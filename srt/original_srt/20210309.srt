1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,548
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:09,749
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,079
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,626
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,520
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about Moon Hunters.

6
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:20,158
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:30,680
Speaker 0: So if you're watching the livestream, you might notice that my background is a lot different, because I actually got, finally, a proper professional backdrop.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Speaker 0: And the difference between the cheap ones that I've used before and then bailed on versus the expensive ones is that the expensive ones are way smaller and are really easy to deploy and undeploy and take up only a tiny amount of space, so I'm very happy with this purchase.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 1: Are you saying the more expensive one is superior?

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,350
Speaker 0: The more expensive one is superior to a degree.

11
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,740
Speaker 0: that is shocking in this case.

12
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:56,700
Speaker 1: As with many things in capitalist society, you get what you pay for.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:04,940
Speaker 0: The only difference, though, is that for anyone who doesn't live in, like, a New York apartment, the expensive one is really not better because you got space to just have, like, a backdrop.

14
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:08,199
Speaker 0: But in New York, like, I don't have room for that shit.

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have room, you can just take, like, a sheet and spray paint it with green paint or some shit.

16
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,700
Speaker 0: If you got a room, just have an actual background.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,199
Speaker 1: Or, like, paint your wall green.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:19,981
Speaker 0: Exactly.

19
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:21,960
Speaker 0: But I didn't go with green.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,960
Speaker 0: I decided, because chroma-keying, like, I don't really do that much.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,199
Speaker 1: You got magenta, gray.

22
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:27,139
Speaker 0: I went black.

23
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:28,407
Speaker 1: Black?

24
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:29,160
Speaker 1: Okay, black works.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,439
Speaker 1: Black actually works really well.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,438
Speaker 1: As long as you don't wear black.

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,779
Speaker 1: As long as you don't wear black.

28
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:38,120
Speaker 0: But even then, like, the blacks in the foreground stand out really nicely because it's the super matte black.

29
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:40,294
Speaker 0: It actually works pretty well.

30
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,140
Speaker 0: I'm excited about this.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:54,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can, like, if you, even if the background is black, if you light yourself heavily, anything you're wearing, unless you're wearing, like, a Vantablack shirt or something, you know, you'll be, I guess, you could make it work.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also means I can get away with having way less light in my face, so I turn my spotlight way the fuck down, and it's real nice.

33
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:02,491
Speaker 1: Anyway.

34
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:10,000
Speaker 1: All right, so there's, uh, we got a lot of materials going on, because it's been a while since we did a show at all, right?

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,720
Speaker 1: And some big happenings in the gaming world.

36
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:22,620
Speaker 1: And for once, I guess it's not good, but there was a drama that was closer to us than most dramas in the past.

37
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:36,819
Speaker 1: And in addition to it being closer to us, I feel like I know everything there is that we need to say about it and can actually comment on it, unlike, say, the MAGFest drama where we were like, "We don't know what to make of this," right?

38
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,936
Speaker 1: "We know exactly what to make of this

39
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,319
Speaker 1: drama.".

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:53,340
Speaker 1: So, we've already broken it down, I think, on our forum and our Discord and everywhere else, so if you weren't in those places, you might not have heard, but we'll just break it down again on our show.

41
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,840
Speaker 1: so there's no, you know, questions roaming around, right?

42
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 1: So, to give you the background, there is a person named Adam Koebel.

43
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:03,807
Speaker 1: Koebel?

44
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,739
Speaker 1: I think it's Koebel.

45
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,050
Speaker 1: Yep.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,860
Speaker 1: Is a well-known tabletop RPG community person, or former community person.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,176
Speaker 0: Former is a good way to put it.

48
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,281
Speaker 1: Sure.

49
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:27,048
Speaker 1: Adam Koebel was one of the people who created the Dungeon World RPG, which is a game that I've played a few times and enjoyed the few times I played it, though it is not without problems.

50
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,939
Speaker 1: I don't think we've done an episode on it, right?

51
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,246
Speaker 0: We played it at PAX.

52
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:34,500
Speaker 0: We're gonna play it, like, one more time and then do a show on it and then COVID.

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,100
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to do a show on it anymore.

54
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,520
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a tabletop RPG that is powered by the apocalypse.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:53,195
Speaker 1: It has the same base system as Apocalypse Worlds, as many games have these days, but the setting is classic, you know, dungeon-y, right?

56
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:54,640
Speaker 1: You know, D&D setting.

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Speaker 1: Adam Koebel was also a GM for one of those... I don't know which one, I could look it up, but it's one of those online, you know, come watch people play RPGs on Twitch things, right?

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,459
Speaker 1: So he was a GM for one of those.

59
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:27,060
Speaker 1: And during one of those sessions for that RPG, where he was the GM, he, without the consent of the players, right, there was a sexual assault scene in the game that was quite harrowing for the players.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 0: When I link to the news, the news itself links to, like, the stream at the point where this happens.

61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,439
Speaker 1: Obviously, content warning for watching that stream.

62
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:40,008
Speaker 0: I'll even quote what the article says, "This clip is not for the faint of heart.

63
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:46,278
Speaker 0: Even if a description of a sexual assault doesn't bother you, the sheer mortifying train wreck in progress likely

64
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:46,459
Speaker 0: will.".

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:57,460
Speaker 0: Because if you weren't familiar with the incident that is sort of why Koebel is not really welcome in these spaces, this incident is probably way worse than you expected.

66
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:58,802
Speaker 1: Right.

67
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:04,100
Speaker 1: So this is the main incident, which is why he was, quote, "cancelled," right?

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,420
Speaker 1: And basically became, you know, he didn't face any actual real, like, consequences legally or anything like that, right?

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,280
Speaker 1: He didn't, like, lose a job or anything, you know, but he was basically shunned, rightly so, by the community.

70
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,560
Speaker 1: He was like a pariah, right?

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,700
Speaker 0: And you can read about all the details, like, he didn't really issue an apology, he stayed silent for a while.

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,279
Speaker 1: His apologies did not seem sufficient, right, et cetera.

73
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,160
Speaker 1: The usual, you've heard stories like this before, right?

74
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,400
Speaker 1: So, that's Adam, right?

75
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:42,239
Speaker 1: I don't know Adam, I don't, if I, it's possible I may have, like, met, like, I, you know, We've met Adam a few times.

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,719
Speaker 1: If it's possible, but, like, before Googling him, I would not have recognized his face, right?

77
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,978
Speaker 1: Or, like, if I've ever, you know, seen him, I didn't know, right?

78
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:57,318
Speaker 1: So, that's the kind of level of relationship we have with that person, is?

79
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:57,840
Speaker 1: I don't know them.

80
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaker 1: So then, right, someone we know quite well, right, is Luke Crane, who has been someone who, I guess, was friend of the show status since the oldest of days.

81
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,820
Speaker 0: Yup, one of our earliest big interviews, like, we got really, Burning Wheel literally got us into indie RPGs.

82
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,919
Speaker 1: Yup, some of, you know, his works, we have lauded his works for over a decade, right?

83
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:29,420
Speaker 1: And, you know, at the time we met Luke, he was just some guy making tabletop RPGs.

84
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:35,340
Speaker 1: And then, over time, you know, we worked together a few times on a few small things here and there.

85
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:43,160
Speaker 1: And then, he became the head of games at Kickstarter and is now, I believe, the VP of community at Kickstarter.

86
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,159
Speaker 1: So, he really leveled up in the world since, you know, we met him.

87
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:58,620
Speaker 1: And our relationship with him, I don't know how it looks to a listener of the show, like, how close it looks like we are to certain people, right?

88
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:06,160
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's, like, someone I'm very close to, like, say, my mother, right, doesn't get a lot of airtime on Geek Nights.

89
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,804
Speaker 0: Maybe she should.

90
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:09,079
Speaker 0: We should bring your mom and my mom on the show.

91
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,665
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

92
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:13,360
Speaker 1: Luke Crane gets way more airtime, right, on Geek Nights.

93
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:20,020
Speaker 1: So, to a listener, I worry, like, does it look like I'm closer to him than I am, right, based on that perception?

94
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:26,780
Speaker 1: But I would characterize our relationship as, like, mostly business acquaintances, right?

95
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 1: I communicate with him, at least in the past, I communicated with him when we were doing something together, right?

96
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,060
Speaker 1: Or I would say hi at a convention.

97
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:42,120
Speaker 1: I think the most recent thing we did together was we played a LARP with him at a PAX a year or two ago, maybe?

98
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,641
Speaker 0: Yup.

99
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:48,710
Speaker 0: I've done a few minor things that you weren't involved in, but they were all... They're really public things.

100
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,900
Speaker 0: They were just, like, consulting things.

101
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:56,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, we play-tested the Mouse Guard RPG and made a little video with, you know, a few years back.

102
00:07:56,621 --> 00:08:00,480
Speaker 1: Yup, back when we still did- Not the Mouse Guard RPG, the Mouse Guard board game.

103
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,307
Speaker 1: Swords and strongholds, right.

104
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:03,597
Speaker 1: You know, but that's it.

105
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,298
Speaker 1: Like, I haven't spoken to Luke probably in well over a year, right?

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,959
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, I don't want people to think we're, like, a close friend, right?

107
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,320
Speaker 1: But it's still a person that I know and know well.

108
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,759
Speaker 1: All right, so what did Luke Crane do?

109
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:33,799
Speaker 1: So, as I mentioned on a previous Geek Nights, Kickstarter, where Luke is a vice president, right, had the zine quest, the third year of zine quest, which is basically a time period where they encourage people to publish and kickstart tabletop RPG zines.

110
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,639
Speaker 1: And there are many tons and tons of wonderful zines to choose from.

111
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,099
Speaker 1: So, of course, as you would expect, Luke Crane put a zine out, right?

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,600
Speaker 1: He put up a Kickstarter, and the Kickstarter was for the perfect RPG, and it was, like, a tongue-in-cheek kind of deal, right?

113
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,820
Speaker 1: Like, hey, hey, hey, we're going to make the perfect RPG zine, right?

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,660
Speaker 1: It'll be sort of a, you know, a joke, right?

115
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,180
Speaker 1: There'll be some sort of message about how, like, the perfect RPG can't exist or something.

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,100
Speaker 1: It was obviously something along those lines.

117
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:12,700
Speaker 1: And there was a long list of, you know, the usual suspects in the community who he got involved, because Luke is a well-connected and prominent figure in the tabletop RPG community.

118
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,459
Speaker 1: He was close to all the other people.

119
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of them are people we are similar relationship with.

120
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,606
Speaker 0: We kind of know them.

121
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,537
Speaker 0: We talk shop semi-regularly.

122
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, a lot of those people are people who have similar, you know, they're the tabletop RPG community.

123
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,660
Speaker 1: peeps, right?

124
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,160
Speaker 1: The same as you have, like, you know, the anti-Twitter peeps, right?

125
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,560
Speaker 1: They're sort of this community of people that we're not close friends with, but we're podcast-y, you know, nerdy friends with at conventions.

126
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:40,828
Speaker 1: We say hi, right?

127
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:42,600
Speaker 1: We tweet at them occasionally, right?

128
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:48,840
Speaker 1: So, all those usual suspects were on the list of people.

129
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,980
Speaker 1: So when the Kickstarter came up, like, and he posted the thing, I just sort of, I didn't even read it, to be honest.

130
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,956
Speaker 0: I was just like, "Oh, those are all people I like,".

131
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:58,620
Speaker 0: and I just hit go.

132
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,747
Speaker 1: I was like, "Oh, Luke put...".

133
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:03,879
Speaker 1: I said, "Oh, Luke put up the zine that I knew was going to be put

134
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,020
Speaker 1: up.".

135
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,680
Speaker 1: And as with many other zines that went up from people I knew or, you know, didn't know, I just looked at it.

136
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,066
Speaker 1: I said, "Oh, Luke's zine is up now.

137
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,511
Speaker 1: Click back," right?

138
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,480
Speaker 1: And then I closed the window and went on with my day.

139
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:21,677
Speaker 1: And then, later in the day, there was a "I smelled through my internet nose".

140
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:22,780
Speaker 1: a drama, right?

141
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:35,019
Speaker 1: And if you hadn't put the pieces together so far, this zine that Luke was putting together, which is an anthology of sorts with all those people involved, Adam Koval was on that list.

142
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:43,000
Speaker 1: And if I had seen that, I mean, this is a drama, the drama with Adam Koval, it's like, I don't know a lot of people or a lot of dramas, right?

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,685
Speaker 1: Like I said, Adam was a person I didn't know.

144
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:46,933
Speaker 1: I knew about that drama, right?

145
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,060
Speaker 1: I knew about that one.

146
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,543
Speaker 1: Like, had the news

147
00:10:50,864 --> 00:11:03,357
Speaker 0: not been what we're talking about and I'd seen that, then what we'd be talking about on Geek Nights right now would be like us looking into Adam being involved in this when we found out and, like, asking Luke about it, asking people about it, like, "What's going on?

148
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:03,838
Speaker 0: Why is he

149
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:04,079
Speaker 0: here?".

150
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:09,619
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if I would have seen that name on there, I would have been like, "Whoa, what is going on

151
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:09,860
Speaker 1: here?".

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,563
Speaker 1: But I didn't see that name on there.

153
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:19,340
Speaker 1: Other people did, and so they reacted as I did, as I would have, and said, "Whoa, what is going on

154
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,520
Speaker 1: here?".

155
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,799
Speaker 0: Now, remember, this isn't necessarily, like, the important reaction is not people like us who would have backed it saying, "Oh, whoa, what's going

156
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:26,999
Speaker 0: on?".

157
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:34,280
Speaker 0: The people who were on the list didn't know he was involved in the project and they all backed out because they did not want to be involved.

158
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:37,280
Speaker 0: In a project that he's involved in for all the reasons you can imagine.

159
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:46,299
Speaker 1: So, now, normally, when you submit something to an anthology, right, poetry, you know, any kind of anthology thing, comic anthology, right, you don't.

160
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:52,200
Speaker 1: it's not really that common practice to know who else the contributors are, right?

161
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,938
Speaker 1: It's just like, you know, it's like, "Hey, I'm publishing an anthology, send in your works and then I'll let you know if I'm going to include them or not and compensate you

162
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:00,420
Speaker 1: accordingly.".

163
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:09,360
Speaker 1: You could ask who else is going to be in there or what else are you putting my artwork next to, but it's not, you typically don't necessarily do that.

164
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,064
Speaker 1: It's not like that standard a thing.

165
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:16,857
Speaker 1: But maybe it has to be now that this is a, you know, maybe we recognize that.

166
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,220
Speaker 1: maybe we should change that, right?

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,880
Speaker 1: So, what happened was, is the other people who had, you know, Luke called a bunch of people, I assume, and was like, "Hey, you want to submit to my ASEAN thing?

168
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,846
Speaker 1: You want to participate in this perfect RPG

169
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:29,107
Speaker 1: thing?".

170
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,979
Speaker 1: People knowing Luke and his reputation and their relationship with him said yes.

171
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,935
Speaker 1: But then once they saw, after the Kickstarter went live, that Adam was on the list, they called Luke and said, "Nope, I'm out.

172
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:43,080
Speaker 1: I'm not, you know, like, what's he doing there?

173
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,104
Speaker 1: I'm not, you know, I'm not doing

174
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:45,324
Speaker 1: this.".

175
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:53,120
Speaker 1: And then, right, there was a notice to everyone who backed the Kickstarter, I don't know, do we want to read it?

176
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,483
Speaker 1: You can read it online yourself.

177
00:12:55,925 --> 00:13:03,320
Speaker 1: It's basically Luke's message to everyone, which is like, people, he said that, I'm going to paraphrase, you can hear the exact words.

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:13,960
Speaker 1: He said people backed out, and he claims that some people were harassed to back out, and therefore- Which has been pretty well refuted by all the people who did back out.

179
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:21,812
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least I haven't seen anyone claim that they were harassed to back out, right?

180
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:27,040
Speaker 1: I've only seen, personally, Luke's claim that other people were harassed to back out.

181
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,620
Speaker 0: I saw people who had, I saw at least two different people who had backed out publicly stating that they backed out because of Adam's involvement.

182
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,486
Speaker 1: I have seen several people say that they backed out on their own volition, right?

183
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:50,620
Speaker 1: Regardless, being, Luke said that being unable to deliver the product as promised, he would just cancel the whole thing, the end, right?

184
00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:02,520
Speaker 0: That's where this gets extra problematic, because that, it's very clear that he could have removed Adam from the project, but the fact that he chose to end the project instead?

185
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,902
Speaker 1: Okay, well, okay, so hold on.

186
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:15,960
Speaker 1: So, some people were, I guess, since so many people focused on this point, even though I think it's not that big a deal, and it's kind of minor and conspiracy theory, I can't not bring it up.

187
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,340
Speaker 0: I know what you're going to bring up, I got a screenshot of it here.

188
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:36,440
Speaker 1: Many people pointed out that in the list of contributors on the Kickstarter happened to be oddly listed in reversed alphabetical order by first name, which puts Adam at the bottom, as if Luke was attempting to hide, or whoever made the Kickstarter, right?

189
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,805
Speaker 1: I don't know if Luke might have worked with someone to do it, right?

190
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:39,527
Speaker 1: If he did it all himself.

191
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 1: Was intentionally trying to hide Adam's name at the bottom somewhere so he wouldn't notice something like that.

192
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:51,896
Speaker 1: That's not possible, but it doesn't really matter if his name was in the fine print or in the big print.

193
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,660
Speaker 1: What if his name was, Adam's name was huge?

194
00:14:54,221 --> 00:15:01,060
Speaker 1: It doesn't change the problem that, you know, Luke, who knows, definitely knows who Adam is way more than we do.

195
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
Speaker 0: But the fact that he decided to include Adam in this project, knowing full well, everyone in this entire tabletop industry knows.

196
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:07,920
Speaker 0: If

197
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:34,560
Speaker 1: I know Luke knows he doesn't have an excuse, right, it means that he was, you know, just regardless of anything that happened after, the fact that Adam was on the project, regardless of how he was listed, means that Luke Crane thinks it was okay for him to be there and was supporting him and, you know, including him, a person who no one else finds it acceptable to include.

198
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:42,600
Speaker 0: It would be very hard to believe that Luke was not aware that many of the other names on this list would not want to be involved in a project with Adam.

199
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,297
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

200
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:45,500
Speaker 0: That is implausible.

201
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:47,735
Speaker 1: It is very implausible.

202
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:49,140
Speaker 1: I cannot believe that, right?

203
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:58,780
Speaker 1: It's basically, you cannot believe that Luke didn't know about the incident or that Adam was persona non grata or that other, right?

204
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,260
Speaker 1: He had to have known when he did this, which is a huge disappointment, right?

205
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,069
Speaker 1: It's like, I'm not disappointed that I'm not going to get this project.

206
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,675
Speaker 1: I'm disappointed in Luke as a person.

207
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,478
Speaker 1: Like, really, dude?

208
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 1: Really?

209
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:14,131
Speaker 0: Like, I actually debated how much investigative journalism to do.

210
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 0: Like, we ended up not reaching out to Luke for comment.

211
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,760
Speaker 0: Like, I'm just not, basically, I'm not going to talk to Luke Crane anymore and I'm waiting to see if he issues any sort of real public statement about this or not.

212
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,285
Speaker 1: So, that's the thing that I want to point out, right?

213
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:33,720
Speaker 1: So, how much do I know Luke Crane as a person having worked with him as, like, you know, a little bit over a large number of years, right?

214
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,629
Speaker 1: Not that much, right?

215
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,840
Speaker 1: You know, I know a lot of his thoughts about games.

216
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:38,382
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:42,180
Speaker 0: I know a lot of us thought we've spent a lot of time talking about games together.

218
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,604
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like, what do I know?

219
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:45,749
Speaker 1: I don't know him, like, as a person.

220
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,720
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know his family or his friends or, you know, you know, or anything.

221
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,683
Speaker 1: I'm not, you know, close to him on, like, a human level.

222
00:16:53,204 --> 00:17:06,220
Speaker 1: But one thing I do know, at least, that I've, about his personality, that I have gathered over the years and I saw, the last time I saw this, really, the last time it really stood out to me was when Kickstarter was unionizing.

223
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:19,940
Speaker 1: And Eli saw other Kickstarter employees and non-Kickstarter employees all saying something, right, positive or negative, about that unionization effort, which I believe proved successful, if I'm not mistaken.

224
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,650
Speaker 1: And he didn't say a damn thing about it.

225
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,493
Speaker 1: Not one thing.

226
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:24,560
Speaker 1: He said nothing.

227
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 0: On one hand, when someone has a job, like, depending on their level, like, they might not be allowed, like, there's a lot of things that could go on there.

228
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,324
Speaker 1: As a vice president, I don't know about the rules.

229
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:36,368
Speaker 1: He might not even be in the union.

230
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:40,876
Speaker 1: He might be on the other side of that negotiating table and therefore not able to say anything.

231
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,519
Speaker 1: He might have been pro or anti-union.

232
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:42,920
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,581
Speaker 1: But that's not the point.

234
00:17:44,641 --> 00:18:00,680
Speaker 1: The point is, is that was the latest example in a pattern of behavior that I have seen from Luke Crane as a whole and noticed, like, the one thing I noticed about him as an acquaintance is that he is silent on many, many things.

235
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:12,475
Speaker 1: You know how bad people will go into, you know, to people and say, you know, stop talking about politics, only talk about games, right?

236
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,000
Speaker 1: You know, and the kind of shitty people will say that, right?

237
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,522
Speaker 1: Luke is not one of those.

238
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,689
Speaker 1: I've never known him to be one of the shitty people who says that.

239
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:24,176
Speaker 1: He doesn't go to other people and say, stop talking about politics, only talk about games.

240
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,740
Speaker 1: At least I've never heard him say that.

241
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,121
Speaker 1: Yep.

242
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:27,506
Speaker 0: I've never encountered that.

243
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:31,200
Speaker 0: And many of the people who are in his orbit will very often talk about politics.

244
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,281
Speaker 1: Indeed.

245
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:39,673
Speaker 1: What he is, is he is a person who shuts up about politics and doesn't talk about anything but games.

246
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:40,976
Speaker 1: He follows those.

247
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,879
Speaker 1: He doesn't give those instructions to anyone else.

248
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:43,460
Speaker 1: that I have seen.

249
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:47,226
Speaker 1: But what I have seen is him following those instructions.

250
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:51,994
Speaker 1: He just doesn't say like he's not the kind of person who will tweet Black Lives Matter.

251
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:55,420
Speaker 1: It's like you don't have to be super active on social media if you don't want to.

252
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,205
Speaker 1: It's not like some requirement of the world.

253
00:18:57,265 --> 00:19:02,980
Speaker 1: or, you know, if you're not that kind of outspoken person, not everyone's an outspoken kind of person.

254
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:03,781
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:21,560
Speaker 1: But Luke Crane specifically is a prominent figure in a community, is a powerful figure at an important organization, Kickstarter, and is basically silent, as far as I can tell, on lots and lots of things.

256
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:35,500
Speaker 1: He only talks about his business and he just shuts up about everything else, which leaves a lot of sort of, you know, if you're not super close to him, I guess you had to be way closer to him than we are to know what he actually thinks about a lot of things.

257
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:36,142
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:40,360
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't know what he thinks about a lot of, you know, most things because he just doesn't say anything.

259
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:46,969
Speaker 0: Like the tabletop RPG community is very liberal, very progressive as a whole.

260
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:54,820
Speaker 0: Obviously not everyone is, but like the community is really focused and a lot of designers are focused on things like consent and games and access and diversity.

261
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,666
Speaker 0: And he existed in that space with all those people.

262
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:03,394
Speaker 0: And I think everyone sort of just assumed that he was like on board with everything.

263
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,676
Speaker 0: And he may be, we don't know.

264
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,399
Speaker 0: He's never really said much about it.

265
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:08,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

266
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:23,379
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, he got the benefit of the doubt of, of me sort of assuming his stances on things because he was an accepted and well-regarded member of a community of people who were outspoken on those things.

267
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,100
Speaker 1: Right.

268
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:32,273
Speaker 1: So it's like, if you see, you know, a whole bunch of, you know, super, you know, a whole bunch of communists, right.

269
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:33,295
Speaker 1: Just straight up commies.

270
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:33,916
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,240
Speaker 1: And they're hanging out and they're hanging out in a bar.

272
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:40,592
Speaker 1: And there's someone else who doesn't look like a communist.

273
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,040
Speaker 1: They're not wearing, they're not handing out newspapers.

274
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,663
Speaker 0: What do you think a communist wears?

275
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,627
Speaker 1: A Che Guevara beret or some shit.

276
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,992
Speaker 1: You know, they, they don't, they're not carrying around a copy of Marx or anything.

277
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:54,212
Speaker 1: Right.

278
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:55,914
Speaker 1: They just look like a normal person.

279
00:20:55,934 --> 00:21:01,700
Speaker 1: There is nothing to indicate to you that they are or are not communist, but they hang out in the communist bar.

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,242
Speaker 1: Their friends are communists.

281
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:04,383
Speaker 1: They're welcome there.

282
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:11,312
Speaker 1: They're high-fiving the communists, but they never are given the communist speech or, you know, doing communist things.

283
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,914
Speaker 1: You don't know how they vote because that's secret.

284
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:13,194
Speaker 1: Right.

285
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,998
Speaker 1: But you got to assume that that person's a communist too.

286
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:16,218
Speaker 1: Right.

287
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,620
Speaker 1: Why are they hanging out in the comedy bar?

288
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,282
Speaker 1: So that is Luke Crane, right?

289
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:23,686
Speaker 1: His, he was in that community, well accepted by these people.

290
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:34,397
Speaker 1: So I had just, even though he was been silent, I had taken that to mostly, you know, understand that he is just not that kind of person who is outspoken on things like that.

291
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,160
Speaker 1: And you don't have to be, there's no requirement they had to be.

292
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:45,906
Speaker 1: But we, this latest, you know, I was a little eh with the, with the union thing, but obviously now extremely eh.

293
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:46,567
Speaker 0: Right.

294
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:51,230
Speaker 0: Well, this is, no one gets the benefit of the doubt if they behave this way.

295
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:58,796
Speaker 0: Like multiple steps along this specific project, they all require giving the benefit of the doubt.

296
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:03,860
Speaker 0: And you don't give the same person the benefit of the doubt a bunch of times in a row if doubts are piling up.

297
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,443
Speaker 1: So, I mean, uh, it doesn't look like Luke Crane's going to say anything else.

299
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,324
Speaker 1: He's going to continue his pattern.

300
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,546
Speaker 1: You know, I'd be surprised if he said anything else.

301
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,249
Speaker 1: He's going to add him in this pattern of silent complicity, right?

302
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:23,333
Speaker 0: Including Adam in the project, uh, appearing to hide this fact from the other people.

303
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:24,554
Speaker 0: Like those are two things.

304
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:33,560
Speaker 0: And then third, not only not really apologizing for it, but basically trying to blame others for the failure of the project instead of Apollo.

305
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:41,909
Speaker 0: Like, even if he had apologized for including Adam and like continued the project without Adam, I'm not saying that would absolve him of any responsibility.

306
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:46,653
Speaker 1: No, that would have still shown a huge misjudgment on his part, even if he corrected it.

307
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:53,080
Speaker 0: It would have, but misjudgment followed by earnest apology and amends is better than fighting back plus silence.

308
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,381
Speaker 1: Right.

309
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,723
Speaker 1: And that's the other thing is if Luke had just come out.

310
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:56,924
Speaker 1: Right.

311
00:22:56,964 --> 00:23:00,828
Speaker 1: So I don't know what he believes again, cause he's silent on everything mostly.

312
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,695
Speaker 1: Um, but he would have come out and like defended his choice to, to include Adam.

313
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:07,335
Speaker 1: Right.

314
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,280
Speaker 1: And said, you know, and it's funny because burning wheel, it's like, he'll sign burning.

315
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:13,721
Speaker 1: Right.

316
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,762
Speaker 1: Fight for what you believe.

317
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,244
Speaker 1: And yet he will not fight for what he believes.

318
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:17,384
Speaker 1: Right.

319
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:18,385
Speaker 1: I don't even know what he believes.

320
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:19,647
Speaker 1: What are Lou Crane's beliefs?

321
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,808
Speaker 1: He's got a blank character sheet.

322
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,390
Speaker 1: Um, at least as far as I can tell.

323
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,831
Speaker 1: All right.

324
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,372
Speaker 1: And I guess the GM knows what it says.

325
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:33,400
Speaker 1: Uh, but if he does believe something that we disagree with, if, you know, if he believes that it would have been okay to include Adam.

326
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:34,085
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,940
Speaker 0: Cause it is not okay to include Adam.

328
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,120
Speaker 1: It's not.

329
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:46,989
Speaker 1: Um, but at least if you had the guts to just come out and present, you know, your argument, at least then I would still be extremely disappointed.

330
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,409
Speaker 1: Right.

331
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,731
Speaker 1: And I still would, it would still be like, eh, right.

332
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:54,835
Speaker 1: Um, but at least then you could have some respect.

333
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:55,836
Speaker 1: that like, oh, okay.

334
00:23:56,256 --> 00:24:00,560
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, I see that you're wrong and you, that's, I can see what you are now.

335
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:00,980
Speaker 1: Right.

336
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:10,667
Speaker 1: Um, but the, to not say anything on top of the same disappointment, uh, provide is an image of cowardice.

337
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,167
Speaker 1: Right.

338
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:16,050
Speaker 1: So you've now not only lost like the approval, you've also lost some respect.

339
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,551
Speaker 1: Right.

340
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:30,080
Speaker 1: Um, whereas at least, you know, uh, if he had defended it, I wouldn't, I guess I still wouldn't respect him, but cause he'd be wrong, but I could respect the, you know, the lack of cowardice.

341
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Speaker 1: Right.

342
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,381
Speaker 1: Not a polly.

343
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:38,605
Speaker 0: Say what, say what you're gonna, you know, a not apology plus silence is like the worst possible option of all the options.

344
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:39,806
Speaker 1: Right.

345
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:49,033
Speaker 1: Um, and it's, you know, and because he, it's mostly because he is in such a position of prominence and power within the community, or at least maybe not anymore.

346
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:49,553
Speaker 1: Yeah.

347
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:51,534
Speaker 1: Um, but I guess he still has his job.

348
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:51,714
Speaker 1: Right.

349
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,015
Speaker 1: We haven't heard any news about that.

350
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,997
Speaker 1: So, um, he's still that position.

351
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:56,478
Speaker 1: Right.

352
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:59,339
Speaker 1: Comes with a great amount of responsibility.

353
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,400
Speaker 1: Uh,

354
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:10,960
Speaker 0: and we're not the only ones who are like taking a guess by this, like go, go look at the list of people who contributed or were going to contribute and go re like, I'm not going to put, I'm not going to read all their comments, but many of them posted about this on Twitter.

355
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,868
Speaker 0: They were mostly as shocked as we were that Adam was involved in this project and shocked at Luke's response.

356
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

357
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,677
Speaker 1: I mean, nobody, this was, you know, I guess cause Luke was silent to all of them as, as well.

358
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:22,898
Speaker 1: Right.

359
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:23,599
Speaker 1: They didn't know.

360
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:24,280
Speaker 1: Right.

361
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:32,668
Speaker 1: But this brought, this actually raised an interesting, if you had asked me, if you had asked me the day before, right, I would have been like, no, there's no way he would ever do something like that.

362
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:32,908
Speaker 1: Right.

363
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,569
Speaker 1: I couldn't have met you.

364
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,551
Speaker 1: It's like, no, there's, there would have been no chance.

365
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:39,094
Speaker 0: I was very surprised to actually read this news and see what happened.

366
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:40,075
Speaker 1: Yeah.

367
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,377
Speaker 1: It was, it was quite shocking.

368
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:42,998
Speaker 1: Like, it's like, Whoa, okay.

369
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,740
Speaker 1: I guess you aren't what I thought you were.

370
00:25:44,980 --> 00:26:03,233
Speaker 0: But I bring up an anecdote because this was published in our forum and a few other places, but this is an incident that I was present for back in like 2010, which at the time didn't think about, but like I remember it clearly, uh, the whale shark, a friend of ours who did a bunch of panels on heavy metal and things.

371
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:11,438
Speaker 0: This was a long time ago, but he gave a panel at a Kineticon where Luke happened to be, cause we'd invited Luke to do some panels on his own and there was a whole thing going on.

372
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,980
Speaker 0: And, uh, Luke attended this.

373
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,861
Speaker 1: Eleven years ago.

374
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, this was a long time ago, but Luke attended this panel about metal.

375
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:30,639
Speaker 0: And the whale shark, when doing this panel, did a section at the end about white supremacists and Nazis in the metal community and how we need to aggressively remove them from our community.

376
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:31,780
Speaker 0: How like that is a problem.

377
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,282
Speaker 1: That is still a problem and it is still a fact.

378
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:36,223
Speaker 1: I'm there.

379
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:41,566
Speaker 1: I'm worried every time I go and listen, like metal on Spotify, like I always Google these bands, like, are they not right?

380
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,228
Speaker 1: It's like in other genres of music, right?

381
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:45,169
Speaker 1: It's like future funk.

382
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:54,515
Speaker 0: I don't usually have to like Google to see if the future funk band, you know, if you didn't be surprised, like I was a big fan of Pogo until I found out what a piece of shit he is.

383
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like, I think Pogo might be like one of the few.

384
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:01,460
Speaker 1: The only thing I have to Google for now at DJs is like, are they coin people?

385
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:10,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but but metal people, it's like, yeah, metal bands have good odds of being white supremacists relative to other genres.

386
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:18,199
Speaker 1: You have to search them out and see if it's, you know, luckily, Spotify does let you block bands or I think you can actually report them and get them removed.

387
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:18,580
Speaker 1: I don't know.

388
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,241
Speaker 1: But here's the thing,

389
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:33,934
Speaker 0: we do know that Luke is into metal and Luke attended this panel and at the end of the panel, Luke approached the whale shark, who is also knows him like we're all in the orbit together, and basically said, and this is nearly verbatim, like I remember this.

390
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:34,574
Speaker 0: I was there.

391
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:37,878
Speaker 0: Don't end on a down note like that.

392
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,580
Speaker 0: Sure, we have our bad boys, but they're not that common.

393
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:46,868
Speaker 0: And that go back to that moment really puts a sour taste in my mouth.

394
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:56,359
Speaker 0: If there is an incident of him telling someone to not aggressively purge Nazis from the metal community and like don't bring up that down note in a panel about it.

395
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,685
Speaker 0: Like the plausible deniability.

396
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:01,847
Speaker 0: I'm not saying Luke's a Nazi.

397
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:08,220
Speaker 0: I'm saying his silence is a pattern that in retrospect is much more recognizable based on this current incident.

398
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,327
Speaker 1: I think he definitely has like a personality of, you know, silent complicity, right?

399
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:17,052
Speaker 1: He would rather he doesn't want to like, you know, have conflict or he just says nothing.

400
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:22,980
Speaker 1: He clearly believes something, but he doesn't want to like get into a flame war about it.

401
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,240
Speaker 1: Right.

402
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:33,819
Speaker 1: Which is somewhat understandable, you know, given the Internet, but like he just avoids saying, you know, any of his beliefs on anything other than, you know, games.

403
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,480
Speaker 1: Right.

404
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:42,015
Speaker 0: Well, the extra weird thing about this is that Luke and Adam before the incident were both pretty well respected for like.

405
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,540
Speaker 0: their games involved a lot of like consent.

406
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,803
Speaker 1: I can't deny.

407
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:49,820
Speaker 1: I enjoy all their you know, the games that they have made right there.

408
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:58,580
Speaker 0: But in terms of like they're not without flaw, but mechanically including consent, mechanically, like enforcing things like allowing people to role play in a safe space.

409
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:05,260
Speaker 0: Like that was something that previous to the incident with Adam, I associated with Adam and previous to this, I associated with Luke.

410
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:13,000
Speaker 0: And it's interesting that even though these ideas are expressed in their works, they did not appear to be expressed in their real lives.

411
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:15,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:20,954
Speaker 1: So even us, even people like us who may, you know, be out here saying all these things.

413
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:21,235
Speaker 1: Right.

414
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:23,540
Speaker 1: You got to keep an eye on us to make sure.

415
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,567
Speaker 1: Of course, we're not.

416
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,980
Speaker 1: we won't have the silent problem.

417
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,426
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:33,500
Speaker 0: Haven't I been on Twitter last week telling people that NFTs are bullshit and Bitcoin is literally evil.

419
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

420
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,989
Speaker 1: You you always know where we stand.

421
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 0: But you know, we might be wrong, but we're not going to.

422
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:38,941
Speaker 0: Right.

423
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:43,509
Speaker 1: It is entirely possible that we will go down a dark, a dark road.

424
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:44,210
Speaker 1: Right.

425
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:49,800
Speaker 1: And surprise, surprise you with hidden in hidden bad takes on things at some point in the future.

426
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,825
Speaker 1: It's not impossible.

427
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:54,060
Speaker 1: You know, I'm working hard to make sure that doesn't happen.

428
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,051
Speaker 0: You also might run into some old bad takes.

429
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,820
Speaker 0: I mean, Geek Nights has been around since 2000.

430
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,279
Speaker 1: If you go to old Geek Nights, I'm sure you can find plenty to ruin us on.

431
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:07,859
Speaker 1: You know, but I would probably agree with you if you odds are twenty twenty one.

432
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:16,160
Speaker 1: Scott, if you pulled up a 2007 Scott podcast, right, found me saying something shitty and say, wow, you said something shitty.

433
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,343
Speaker 1: I'd be like, yeah, I sure did.

434
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:20,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, we remember this one episode in particular.

435
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:25,100
Speaker 0: I was thinking about where we were talking about how unions in our fields of work didn't make sense.

436
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:26,449
Speaker 0: And we don't we don't.

437
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:27,739
Speaker 0: we doubled down on that back then.

438
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:36,294
Speaker 1: I mean, I can see, you know, I'd probably agree with some of the individual points I made, but not the overall.

439
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:39,040
Speaker 1: I'd probably be like, yeah, let's make a union and not have a shitty one.

440
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:40,784
Speaker 1: Yeah.

441
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:41,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

442
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:46,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, you can read like a link to this Reddit post that kind of explains this whole situation in extreme detail.

443
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,729
Speaker 0: And honestly, like I said, we didn't reach out to Luke.

444
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,820
Speaker 0: We're really still say something publicly.

445
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:53,806
Speaker 1: I have not.

446
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:58,680
Speaker 1: I have not gotten involved in any of the, you know, things happening.

447
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,822
Speaker 1: I am just.

448
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:01,927
Speaker 1: I heard what everyone had to say.

449
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:02,568
Speaker 1: I listened.

450
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,359
Speaker 1: And then I said just now what I know and what I think about it.

451
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:09,143
Speaker 1: And that's it.

452
00:31:09,324 --> 00:31:10,328
Speaker 1: That's there's nothing else.

453
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,118
Speaker 1: I think it's I think it's going to be the end right there.

454
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:13,580
Speaker 1: Right.

455
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,447
Speaker 1: I don't I don't think we're going to.

456
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:18,220
Speaker 1: I would be surprised if there was a further development on this front.

457
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:19,823
Speaker 0: I can say that I am.

458
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:28,340
Speaker 0: One thing that I am not going to do is we had been talking until covid kind of messed everything up about trying to do a burning con of some kind.

459
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,323
Speaker 0: Like bring that back.

460
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:29,784
Speaker 1: That's not.

461
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:31,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is not talking about that.

462
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:34,060
Speaker 1: We've been talking about that on and off for quite a long time.

463
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:39,780
Speaker 1: You know, somehow it's like because burning con was a con that died and we are trying to start a small con.

464
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,120
Speaker 1: And it was sort of like we've always been like, hey, let's you know, we can get all these things going together.

465
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:46,846
Speaker 1: It's never good.

466
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:47,308
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,420
Speaker 0: If we do that, it's going to be entirely on our own at this point.

468
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

469
00:31:51,362 --> 00:32:01,480
Speaker 0: So in so to turn this to a positive note, I think what we want to talk about briefly is a bunch of kickstarters, some of which are zines that are super good that you should check out that are not a problem.

470
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:02,581
Speaker 1: Right.

471
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,168
Speaker 1: So you missed out on the perfect RPG or everyone did.

472
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:05,709
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,760
Speaker 1: So I've kickstarted quite a few zine and non-zine RPGs.

474
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,105
Speaker 1: Some of these may have ended.

475
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,799
Speaker 1: But regardless, I'm going to talk about all these really quickly.

476
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:15,000
Speaker 1: Right.

477
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,625
Speaker 1: So the first one is this one over.

478
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,709
Speaker 1: This one's not over yet.

479
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:20,900
Speaker 1: It's called Our Traveling Home by Ash Kreider.

480
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:27,051
Speaker 1: This is basically Howl's Moving Castle, the RPG.

481
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:27,833
Speaker 1: Right.

482
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:30,719
Speaker 1: So this is castle that moves around our traveling home.

483
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:33,584
Speaker 0: I see a bird lady, a red panda.

484
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:35,487
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are.

485
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:39,794
Speaker 1: You definitely have, you know, a non-typical family.

486
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:40,435
Speaker 1: Right.

487
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:42,699
Speaker 1: Living in this home, traveling around.

488
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,220
Speaker 1: Right.

489
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,620
Speaker 0: A game about queer romance, found family and finding healing through belonging inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli.

490
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:50,881
Speaker 1: Yes.

491
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:54,970
Speaker 1: So if that doesn't sell you on the RPG, I don't know what kind of nerd you are.

492
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,215
Speaker 1: OK, the next one.

493
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,720
Speaker 1: Is this still available?

494
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,105
Speaker 1: I don't know.

495
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:06,714
Speaker 1: It will only be funded reaches its goal by twenty three days to go.

496
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:06,954
Speaker 1: OK.

497
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:09,560
Speaker 1: Coyote and Crow, the role playing game.

498
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,760
Speaker 1: Right.

499
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,433
Speaker 1: So we're always talking about, you know, RPGs and how racist and colonial they are.

500
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:16,914
Speaker 1: Right.

501
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:20,060
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, show me the RPG that's not.

502
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,903
Speaker 1: Well, here it is.

503
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:21,988
Speaker 1: It's Coyote and Crow.

504
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,880
Speaker 1: It's a game about Native Americans made by Native Americans.

505
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,088
Speaker 0: An alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred.

506
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:32,419
Speaker 0: Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster, et cetera.

507
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,503
Speaker 0: This looks pretty cool.

508
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:42,860
Speaker 1: The thing that sold me on this game, which sells me on a lot of games and books, by the way, was the map, which is an upside down North America.

509
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,826
Speaker 1: With outlines of different, you know, territories on it.

510
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:48,126
Speaker 1: Right.

511
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:55,600
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, that that alone, like they could just put that picture up and said there is a game associated with this with this JPEG.

512
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,103
Speaker 1: Would you like to pay money for it?

513
00:33:57,143 --> 00:33:58,025
Speaker 1: And I would have said, yes.

514
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:01,793
Speaker 1: So Coyote and Crow.

515
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:02,354
Speaker 1: Excellent.

516
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,236
Speaker 1: We got this one.

517
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:04,699
Speaker 0: I hope you want to say.

518
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,024
Speaker 1: Oh, Wizards grimoire.

519
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:07,345
Speaker 1: Right.

520
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:08,387
Speaker 0: That's the one I was bringing up.

521
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,431
Speaker 0: This is an updated Wizards grimoire.

522
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:11,494
Speaker 1: Yeah.

523
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:14,120
Speaker 1: So we did a show on Wizards grimoire by Vincent Baker.

524
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,786
Speaker 1: I don't think you can kickstart this anymore.

525
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,975
Speaker 1: I think it ended, but you can probably still get it eventually.

526
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:20,255
Speaker 1: Right.

527
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,840
Speaker 1: But yeah, Wizards grimoire is being updated.

528
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's being updated in zine form.

529
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,040
Speaker 1: You can get your hands on it, I guess, when this launches, because the backing period is over.

530
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,904
Speaker 1: Now here's the interesting thing.

531
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:32,545
Speaker 1: There's two of these.

532
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:37,938
Speaker 1: I want to point out after Wizards grimoire, I got really turned on to the solo RPG biz.

533
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,239
Speaker 1: Right.

534
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,431
Speaker 1: Because it's like, hey, you know, you get your solo RPG on.

535
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 1: You don't need to worry about arranging anything with other people so much.

536
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:45,560
Speaker 1: Right.

537
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,886
Speaker 1: So here's two really good looking solo RPGs that I'm going to try.

538
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:59,640
Speaker 1: One of them is the last will and testament of Gideon Blythe, a keepsake game about a family legend, lineage and the burden of destiny for zine quest three.

539
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:01,122
Speaker 1: By G on shim.

540
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:16,260
Speaker 1: It is a solo RPG, but you're like producing this, you know, like you get yourself a blank moleskine and some artifacts, and it's almost like you're scrapbooking and making the story at the same time.

541
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:20,148
Speaker 1: Um, given, you know, the ephemera that come with the game.

542
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:24,900
Speaker 1: Uh, and if you pay enough money, you can, you know, it'll include a lot of ephemera.

543
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,646
Speaker 1: You know, fabrics, scraps, artifacts, right?

544
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:28,786
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,270
Speaker 0: It looks like there's going to be, I guess, an app version two.

546
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,434
Speaker 1: Oh, that'll be really interesting.

547
00:35:33,454 --> 00:35:37,060
Speaker 0: Mobile only zine players follow screen friendly directions to create the family album.

548
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,564
Speaker 0: So there's, there's a bunch of ways to interact with this.

549
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:40,806
Speaker 1: Right.

550
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:47,397
Speaker 1: So it's like you're, you're someone who has found this album, but you're also creating the album as you play.

551
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,440
Speaker 1: Um, and it's a solo RPG.

552
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,902
Speaker 1: You can just do this by yourself.

553
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:55,148
Speaker 1: It's, I guess this looks very experimental and cool.

554
00:35:55,249 --> 00:36:02,860
Speaker 0: Like one of them, like a mechanic is there's an example of play they show in the Kickstarter to just to figure out the terminal fate of a character's beloved.

555
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:08,072
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of descendant cards and you black out all but one word on them.

556
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,457
Speaker 0: And that determines the fate of some characters.

557
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:11,460
Speaker 1: Yep.

558
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:16,949
Speaker 1: So the last one, very similar vein to the previous one is called amending, right?

559
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:21,055
Speaker 1: A space mending, um, by, uh, shinging core.

560
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,458
Speaker 1: I hope I pronounced their name correctly.

561
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:23,820
Speaker 0: Perhaps that is a play on words.

562
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,344
Speaker 1: Uh, that's the person's name.

563
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:28,246
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying I'll bending.

564
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:29,688
Speaker 1: Oh yes.

565
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:36,420
Speaker 1: The title is, is this is also a solo RPG where you get a cloth map.

566
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,143
Speaker 1: Right.

567
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:47,560
Speaker 1: And you literally, so onto the map, the path you are taking with a needle and thread, you travel around the map and when things happen.

568
00:36:48,020 --> 00:37:00,540
Speaker 1: So in the example here, right, there's a spot where, uh, the person, uh, I guess must have uncovered like some gems or something and they sewed a bunch of like little blue sparkly dots into that area of the map.

569
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:01,401
Speaker 1: Right.

570
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:05,928
Speaker 1: Um, so obviously it's not a difficult sewing project, right?

571
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:08,732
Speaker 1: You just sort of, you know, needle in, needle out kind of situation, right?

572
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:13,680
Speaker 1: Um, you know, you can do this whether you are amazing at sewing or have never sewed in your life.

573
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:20,974
Speaker 1: But it's like you're, again, you're creating an artifact and also telling a story and playing a solo RPG at the same time.

574
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:23,880
Speaker 1: Just the idea of that is worth my money.

575
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:35,499
Speaker 1: And then they got a photo, if that doesn't sell you on it, they got a photo of somebody wearing their map as like a scarf and it's like, if that's okay.

576
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,943
Speaker 1: That's like guaranteed RPG sales.

577
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:39,323
Speaker 1: Right.

578
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,827
Speaker 1: Um, and you can play this entirely by yourself, right?

579
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:55,763
Speaker 1: So if you have no friends who want to play RPGs with you or they're not reliable as RPG people are, you can kickstart this and on your own, tell a story and create a beautiful, keepsake, uh, for yourself.

580
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:05,100
Speaker 1: So all these, you know, and more A+ RPGs to kickstart that aren't the perfect RPG, which isn't happening.

581
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:10,269
Speaker 0: And one last little quick news before we get into the main bit and talk about Moon Hunters.

582
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:16,080
Speaker 0: Uh, so Roll20 is a pretty good website that doesn't just support Dungeons and Dragons.

583
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,784
Speaker 0: Like it supports other RPGs too.

584
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,391
Speaker 0: Like Blades in the Dark is directly supported in there.

585
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,178
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm using Roll20 now.

586
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,140
Speaker 0: I never really used it before.

587
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,066
Speaker 0: In fact, right after this Geek Nights recording, I'm gonna go play Blades in the Dark.

588
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:34,320
Speaker 0: Uh, you might be thinking, well, with COVID happening and everyone's stuck at home, are a lot of people playing role playing games online?

589
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,340
Speaker 0: So previous to COVID, oh, I guess, uh, yes, Roll20 had about 5 million accounts on it, on the platform.

590
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,828
Speaker 1: That's all I always question that when people say how many accounts they have, cause how many are bots?

591
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,051
Speaker 1: How many are using their accounts?

592
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:50,233
Speaker 1: I think like I might have an account.

593
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:50,934
Speaker 1: When have I used it?

594
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,456
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

595
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:53,339
Speaker 1: It must've been years ago if I even have one.

596
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:53,560
Speaker 1: Right.

597
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,985
Speaker 1: So I always want to know the active users, like in the past week.

598
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:57,806
Speaker 1: That's what I want to know.

599
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:58,407
Speaker 1: Yeah.

600
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:06,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, but assuming you use that metric during COVID, they have added 3 million new users to Roll20.

601
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:13,740
Speaker 1: Even if those, even if those aren't all active users in the past week, that you cannot deny that a lot more people are using Roll20 than before.

602
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:22,197
Speaker 0: And I can say that during the early days of COVID, like Roll20 would have some performance issues because so many people were using it at the same time.

603
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:23,840
Speaker 1: Or their servers were so weak.

604
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:24,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

605
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:35,436
Speaker 0: But I think there is a, there is enough evidence that there was indeed an explosion of online role-playing because Roll20 is just one way people do this.

606
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,040
Speaker 0: A lot of people just play RPGs by just being in a Discord.

607
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,383
Speaker 0: Just doing a Zoom call.

608
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:46,300
Speaker 0: So, uh, it'll be interesting to see what I really want, what I'm really curious about because I don't know what's going to happen.

609
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:51,727
Speaker 0: What will the role-playing landscape look like in a post-COVID world?

610
00:39:51,747 --> 00:40:00,440
Speaker 0: Because I think a lot of people started role-playing who previously didn't because they were stuck at home, had more free time or were bored and started doing it online.

611
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,024
Speaker 0: Will this translate to more people playing in person?

612
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:13,340
Speaker 0: Will this translate to more online groups existing even post-COVID because it's easier to find people you want to play with instead of whoever happens to be at your local game store?

613
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,898
Speaker 0: Like, this is going to be a very interesting space to watch over the next 18 months.

614
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, you know, we'll see how it goes.

615
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:28,334
Speaker 1: But, you know, even if people aren't playing, you know, the best RPGs, better than no RPGs.

616
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,680
Speaker 1: So, more RPG playing is good.

617
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:36,207
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

618
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,129
Speaker 0: So, check this out.

619
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:40,535
Speaker 0: This is literally the best thing I've seen on the internet today.

620
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:42,138
Speaker 0: It was posted today.

621
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,020
Speaker 0: It's my thing of the day.

622
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:53,060
Speaker 0: It is a minute and thirty second long video that appears to be done in one shot and it is just the camera on a drone flying into a bowling alley.

623
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,907
Speaker 0: And it is beautiful and amazing.

624
00:40:57,448 --> 00:41:01,457
Speaker 0: and you will be surprised at two different points in this video.

625
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:02,660
Speaker 0: Watch it all the way to the end.

626
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, uh, this is quite an excellent, you know, short film here that I hadn't seen.

627
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,514
Speaker 1: Actually, for once, I hadn't seen it until Rims sent it to me.

628
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:13,578
Speaker 1: I had some questions about it.

629
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,740
Speaker 1: Like, how the heck did they do that?

630
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,223
Speaker 1: But that's it.

631
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:20,739
Speaker 0: There are two exact moments in this video where you will think, "Whoa, I didn't expect

632
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:20,980
Speaker 0: that.".

633
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also, you know, the way the people were involved.

634
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:26,115
Speaker 1: Really excellent work.

635
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:27,500
Speaker 1: Big fan.

636
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,533
Speaker 1: Alright, so, I think I saw this from someone in our forum shared this with the class.

637
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,420
Speaker 1: And I believe that's where I found it originally.

638
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:43,380
Speaker 1: So, what this is, is there is a drummer that I had not heard of previously, but is an excellent drummer named Larnell Lewis.

639
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:52,616
Speaker 1: And Larnell is not someone who is a drummer in the metal genre, right?

640
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,260
Speaker 1: Metal has come up again on our podcast.

641
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:06,580
Speaker 1: However, Larnell, here in this video on YouTube, listens to the very famous song "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.

642
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,560
Speaker 0: If you don't know that song, like, you've definitely heard it, even if you don't realize it.

643
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,706
Speaker 1: If you're listening to this podcast, you know that song.

644
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:17,980
Speaker 1: It's like, there's only one listener, and they've definitely heard that song.

645
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,745
Speaker 1: Anyway, but Larnell claims to have never heard that song before.

646
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:34,120
Speaker 1: Larnell listens to the song, and basically in, I think it's two tries, but regardless of how many, one or two tries doesn't matter.

647
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,604
Speaker 1: It's impressive nonetheless, right?

648
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:41,860
Speaker 1: Just heard the song, doesn't have like, you know, music, or sheet music or anything, right?

649
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:52,659
Speaker 1: And then plays the drums as if, you know, he's on stage, and the rest of Metallica except for the drummer is there, and he's got to fill in.

650
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,228
Speaker 0: The YouTube comments on this video are great.

651
00:42:56,549 --> 00:42:58,958
Speaker 0: "Why did it take YouTube six days to recommend this to

652
00:42:58,998 --> 00:42:59,079
Speaker 0: me?".

653
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:00,483
Speaker 0: Up next, Tool.

654
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:01,567
Speaker 0: See what he makes of that.

655
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:05,560
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, Lars has been playing this for 30 years and still can't get it right.

656
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:27,620
Speaker 1: So yeah, this is amazing to see someone who not only has, there's plenty of people in the world who are talented at various musical instruments, but it is an even smaller subset of those people who can just, like, you know, you might find someone who's like amazing at, you know, I don't know, violin.

657
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:45,420
Speaker 1: And then if you were to just play for them once, like a recording of a brand new violin piece, would, you know, to hear it, memorize it, be able to play the whole thing back to you in one or two tries doesn't even matter, right?

658
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,421
Speaker 1: That is incredible.

659
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:48,204
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, like

660
00:43:48,244 --> 00:44:00,020
Speaker 0: in music theory classes, like back when I was serious about music, I got to the point where I could listen to one note being played at a time on a piano for like a minute and transcribe it as I went and then play it back.

661
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:07,220
Speaker 0: One note at a time very slowly over the course of like 30 to 40 seconds was the best I could muster.

662
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:13,380
Speaker 1: This is well worth all nearly 20 minutes of your time to watch this video.

663
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,841
Speaker 0: It's good.

664
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:22,300
Speaker 0: In the better moment, the only thing we can talk about in the better moment is that Scott sent me an image and that image was of the tale of Genji.

665
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,681
Speaker 1: That's right.

666
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:32,180
Speaker 1: Last night, I basically sometime around nine something, I was like, you know, I really don't have anything else to do right now.

667
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:38,980
Speaker 1: And but it's kind of too early to go in bed and I kind of ran out of video games, kind of, you know, what should I do?

668
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:42,539
Speaker 1: And I said, oh, I guess I'm in like a reading mood.

669
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:43,182
Speaker 1: Wow.

670
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:49,300
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, well, if I'm in a reading mood, I guess I had to read that book, don't I?

671
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:49,802
Speaker 1: Yep.

672
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,099
Speaker 1: And so I did.

673
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,480
Speaker 1: I have to read that book.

674
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:00,660
Speaker 1: I did not finish the chapter I was in, but I got a significant portion of the way through it before my eyes would not stay open.

675
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:06,120
Speaker 1: And I will probably do the same thing tonight after I'm done with all my biz here.

676
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,244
Speaker 1: So it'll be a while.

677
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:16,640
Speaker 1: The tale of Genji, the first novel ever written by a human being that we know of is not a short book by any stretch.

678
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,820
Speaker 1: But I will complete reading it within my lifetime sometime in the coming weeks, months, who knows?

679
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,960
Speaker 0: So the Geek Nights Book Club is afoot again.

680
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:35,820
Speaker 0: So if you start reading now, you'll be able to follow along because, you know, we'll do like we normally did during book clubs is we'll chat a little bit during the meta moment about things that have happened in the book.

681
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:43,899
Speaker 1: All I'm going to say is I feel like I could write like a one paragraph summary of each chapter of the Tale of Genji.

682
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,703
Speaker 1: And then that would just.

683
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,432
Speaker 1: you could just replace the whole book with that and it would be fine.

684
00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:51,780
Speaker 1: But anyway, we'll see.

685
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,789
Speaker 1: So, yeah, Tale of Genji is still the book club book.

686
00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:00,460
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to finishing it so we can do a different book club book.

687
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,440
Speaker 1: I don't care what the hell Rin picks it next time.

688
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:07,960
Speaker 0: But again, the problem is not the book because it's not, oh, I don't want to read the Tale of Genji.

689
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,072
Speaker 0: I'm not reading fucking any fiction right now.

690
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:11,320
Speaker 0: I'm reading all nonfiction.

691
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,705
Speaker 1: I'm saying I'm just saying there's nothing.

692
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,311
Speaker 1: the book is not the problem.

693
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:17,539
Speaker 1: It's simply the amount of time we've been on it.

694
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

695
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:18,381
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,732
Speaker 1: It's like to just be on a different book.

697
00:46:21,993 --> 00:46:22,193
Speaker 1: Right.

698
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,119
Speaker 1: The context in which we are reading it.

699
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,320
Speaker 1: Right.

700
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:32,500
Speaker 1: If I had just been reading it on my own and not for this book club and it had been just a selection for a year, you know, two years.

701
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,624
Speaker 1: I don't know when we selected it.

702
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:36,115
Speaker 0: I will say I do know what my book selection will be.

703
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:37,340
Speaker 0: I've already decided.

704
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:38,943
Speaker 1: Good.

705
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:39,727
Speaker 1: All right.

706
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:42,280
Speaker 1: I mean, for future selections, I got so many.

707
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,840
Speaker 1: But I'm probably going to pick ones that are shorter and faster.

708
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,579
Speaker 0: I was about to say, just be careful because if you cross me, the Count of Monte Cristo is coming out of the woodwork.

709
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:53,127
Speaker 0: Count of Monte Cristo.

710
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,438
Speaker 1: I'll take the Count of Monte Cristo.

711
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:54,620
Speaker 1: Right.

712
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:01,479
Speaker 1: As long as we don't see it's regardless of the book, Count of Monte Cristo, as long as we don't take two years to read it.

713
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:01,940
Speaker 1: Right.

714
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,341
Speaker 1: It'll be.

715
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:06,420
Speaker 0: I mean, I powered through the Count of Monte Cristo in like a month and a half.

716
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:07,823
Speaker 0: OK.

717
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:09,050
Speaker 0: I was actually really into it.

718
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,679
Speaker 0: I was reading it at this breakneck pace.

719
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,343
Speaker 1: No, I mean, I was.

720
00:47:12,423 --> 00:47:12,865
Speaker 1: you know, I was.

721
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,355
Speaker 1: I was reading Tale of Genji last night as fast as I read books.

722
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:17,900
Speaker 1: So, you know.

723
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:18,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

724
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:19,345
Speaker 0: All right.

725
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:23,240
Speaker 0: Let's get right into it, because we went on for a while here, but I don't think we have to talk forever about this.

726
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:30,160
Speaker 0: Moon Hunters is a game that we want to talk about, one, because we played it recently, even though it's from 2016.

727
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,595
Speaker 0: But two, it is out on the switch for like 15 bucks.

728
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:34,519
Speaker 0: Like it's out.

729
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:39,298
Speaker 0: But right now, like literally right now and until March 15th.

730
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,207
Speaker 0: So you've got like a week.

731
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,600
Speaker 0: It is on sale on Steam.

732
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:49,300
Speaker 0: So instead of fourteen ninety nine on Steam, this game is two dollars and twenty four cents.

733
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,422
Speaker 0: This game.

734
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:56,620
Speaker 0: just if don't even listen to the review, it's two dollars and twenty four cents.

735
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,344
Speaker 1: Just I found this.

736
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:02,620
Speaker 1: So I found this game, which is developed by Kit Fox Games in my Steam library.

737
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:06,520
Speaker 1: And I didn't know where it came from, but it was a lot lately.

738
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,530
Speaker 1: It was a co-op multiplayer game that I could play with friends.

739
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,580
Speaker 1: And I was with friends online looking for a co-op game to play together.

740
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:29,940
Speaker 1: And, you know, most of the steam, the PC games that are online, real time play together with Steam, play together or with Internet functionality tend to be action RPGs or sort of, you know, Smash TV, twin stick.

741
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:31,204
Speaker 1: Same kind of deal.

742
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:31,646
Speaker 1: Right.

743
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:34,577
Speaker 1: You know, games like Enter the Gungeon.

744
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:35,220
Speaker 1: Right.

745
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:38,509
Speaker 1: Or I've been playing with our friend Scott Johnson.

746
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:39,150
Speaker 1: I've been playing.

747
00:48:39,511 --> 00:48:42,559
Speaker 1: Children of Morta is another one in the same sort of category.

748
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:42,780
Speaker 1: Right.

749
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,912
Speaker 1: So this one, Moon Hunters, I finally figured out where I got it from.

750
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:49,340
Speaker 1: It was from on itch.io.

751
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,820
Speaker 1: There was a Black Lives Matter support bundle and the game was included.

752
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:55,368
Speaker 0: Oh, that explains it.

753
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,860
Speaker 1: And that is why I have a copy of that game.

754
00:48:59,245 --> 00:49:01,455
Speaker 1: So, but yeah, it's on super sale on Steam right now.

755
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:02,380
Speaker 1: It's called Moon Hunters.

756
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,520
Speaker 1: And in this game, you are literal Moon Hunters.

757
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:06,881
Speaker 1: Yeah.

758
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:07,446
Speaker 0: The moon's gone.

759
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,073
Speaker 0: Go find it.

760
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:08,739
Speaker 0: You've got five days.

761
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,619
Speaker 1: The sun goes down and the moon does not come up.

762
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,365
Speaker 1: And it is a clear sky.

763
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:17,858
Speaker 1: And the moon should be there because you are people of the moon religion.

764
00:49:17,878 --> 00:49:18,660
Speaker 1: Right.

765
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:22,233
Speaker 1: And you know where the moon is and it doesn't show up.

766
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,319
Speaker 1: And you're like, oh, shit.

767
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:23,540
Speaker 0: Yep.

768
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,560
Speaker 1: And then your village is like, all right, princess Luna situation going on.

769
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:27,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

770
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:31,400
Speaker 0: And your village is like, go fucking find the moon before we all die.

771
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:32,343
Speaker 1: Yeah.

772
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:34,660
Speaker 1: Like you're the strongest people in our, in our village.

773
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:38,640
Speaker 1: And you can choose from four different or I guess several different like groups.

774
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:40,457
Speaker 1: We're like the wolf clan, different clans.

775
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:40,659
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:43,653
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, where's the moon?

777
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:44,399
Speaker 1: Go and find it.

778
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:44,560
Speaker 1: Right.

779
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,420
Speaker 1: You have this many days to find the moon before like the, you know, the world is ruined.

780
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,244
Speaker 0: It's just five days.

781
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:52,139
Speaker 0: You know what it reminds me of like superficially, like right from the start.

782
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,102
Speaker 0: What was it?

783
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:53,867
Speaker 0: Five second hero.

784
00:49:54,632 --> 00:49:55,196
Speaker 1: Half minute hero.

785
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:55,780
Speaker 1: Half minute hero.

786
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,445
Speaker 0: That's what, yeah.

787
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:57,658
Speaker 0: I haven't played the game in so long.

788
00:49:57,678 --> 00:49:57,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

789
00:49:58,365 --> 00:49:59,738
Speaker 1: Got a little bit of that going on.

790
00:49:59,778 --> 00:49:59,899
Speaker 1: Yeah.

791
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,160
Speaker 0: But in that, this game, there's a lot of interesting, unique stuff this game is doing.

792
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,700
Speaker 0: But the gist of it is you start with these characters, you play through the game.

793
00:50:10,462 --> 00:50:13,340
Speaker 0: You don't find the moon and the world ends probably.

794
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,820
Speaker 1: But then we didn't find the moon, but we probably could have you played it more.

795
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:23,507
Speaker 0: But when you play it again, some of the things that you would learn from the previous time, changed the world a little bit.

796
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,420
Speaker 0: And now you can explore the world a little more.

797
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,310
Speaker 0: There's more options.

798
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:27,100
Speaker 0: There's more history.

799
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:32,020
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like a procedurally generated roguelike in a sense?

800
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:48,860
Speaker 1: It's very much in line with what you have, the trend of the times, where it's a roguelike game, where each game, each time you play, you know, it's a completely different, or not completely, but very different experience where things have been randomized and procedurally shuffled in various ways.

801
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:55,000
Speaker 1: But also, every time you play, you carry a bit of statefulness over to your next play.

802
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:55,604
Speaker 1: Right?

803
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,740
Speaker 1: Rogue Legacy did this, where you'd level up your guy.

804
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,399
Speaker 0: Hades is like the hottest game that does this.

805
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,045
Speaker 1: Hades, exactly.

806
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:05,220
Speaker 1: Every play of Hades, some things are shuffled, right?

807
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,733
Speaker 1: You fight a different boss at the end of level one.

808
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:08,860
Speaker 1: You play with a different weapon.

809
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,580
Speaker 1: But, of course, in your second play of Hades, you've upgraded things, right?

810
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:15,600
Speaker 1: Same pattern here in Moon Hunters.

811
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:23,880
Speaker 1: The thing I think separates Moon Hunters apart is really just the storytelling aspect here in this game.

812
00:51:24,221 --> 00:51:24,845
Speaker 0: Which is interesting.

813
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:30,572
Speaker 0: When you read about this game, it is described on their page as, quote, "Moon Hunters, the personality test

814
00:51:30,733 --> 00:51:31,055
Speaker 0: RPG.".

815
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:35,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's somewhat an apt description, right?

816
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:41,280
Speaker 1: Is that while a lot of the gameplay is that sort of twin-stick action RPG, right?

817
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,180
Speaker 1: Move and then shoot bad guys until their health bar goes down kind of gameplay, you know, that you see so often.

818
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,960
Speaker 0: That's the least interesting part of this game.

819
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:53,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually like that part of the game is just kind of eh, right?

820
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,163
Speaker 1: It's like typical.

821
00:51:54,303 --> 00:51:56,491
Speaker 1: It's not bad, but it's not great.

822
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:58,960
Speaker 1: It's just run of the mill for that genre, right?

823
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:02,840
Speaker 1: The rest of the game is super unique and interesting.

824
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,819
Speaker 1: So, first of all, when you walk around towns and talk to people, right?

825
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,940
Speaker 1: There'll be some dialogue choices of like, you know, what do we tell this person, right?

826
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:18,140
Speaker 1: And every player, because you're playing co-op with up to four people, right?

827
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:20,634
Speaker 1: You will choose one of the choices.

828
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:21,340
Speaker 1: You all choose.

829
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:21,940
Speaker 1: You vote.

830
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,644
Speaker 1: You might choose this.

831
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:23,671
Speaker 1: Yeah, you vote.

832
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:24,939
Speaker 1: You might choose the same thing.

833
00:52:25,624 --> 00:52:26,878
Speaker 1: You might choose different things.

834
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:34,820
Speaker 1: And if there's a tie, whoever in your party has the highest leadership score is the leader and gets the tie-breaking vote.

835
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:37,189
Speaker 0: These are real fun.

836
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,540
Speaker 0: Like, right away, like we started playing this game.

837
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:46,140
Speaker 0: As soon as we realized we were voting on what to say to someone, someone locked in their vote and it got really funny and we were hooked.

838
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,431
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't unlock your vote.

839
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:49,719
Speaker 1: So it's like everyone locks in.

840
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:53,300
Speaker 1: If you lock in first, that was your choice to lock in first or you don't have to.

841
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:55,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was real fun.

842
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,040
Speaker 1: And then there's real consequences.

843
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,438
Speaker 1: And this is where the personality test part comes in.

844
00:53:00,122 --> 00:53:03,180
Speaker 1: For example, we chose, I think, what did we choose when we played most recently?

845
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,096
Speaker 1: Avenge on one of the choices, right?

846
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:11,480
Speaker 1: And then we both got points in vengeful as like our vengeful stat, like, increased.

847
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:15,051
Speaker 1: And you say like, okay, well, that's neat.

848
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:16,960
Speaker 1: What does vengeful stat actually mean?

849
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,451
Speaker 1: Well, for example, another stat was foolish, right?

850
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,658
Speaker 1: So we didn't have any points in foolish.

851
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:24,440
Speaker 1: We were not fools.

852
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:34,300
Speaker 1: We encountered someone along our adventure and the game told us, yeah, this guy would have fought you if he thought you were more foolish.

853
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:41,360
Speaker 1: But since we weren't, he thought that we were, you know, intelligent people and therefore he didn't mess with us.

854
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,760
Speaker 0: In one of the towns, there's these old people just talking to each other.

855
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,600
Speaker 0: And if you go over and try to listen to them, it tells you like, unfortunately, you don't have the patience to listen to this crap.

856
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,963
Speaker 1: And it's like patience is highlighted.

857
00:53:52,044 --> 00:54:00,540
Speaker 1: So it's like if we want to hear what the old people are saying, we have to go somewhere else and do something patient to get patient stat up.

858
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:04,240
Speaker 1: And then we can go to the old people and hear what they're saying.

859
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:12,800
Speaker 0: So all these decisions you make as a group and individually, we'll get to that in a second along the way, define your characters, which define how they interact with the world.

860
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,935
Speaker 0: And then at the very end of the game, regardless of if you find the moon and save the world, I don't actually know if you can find the moon.

861
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:20,560
Speaker 0: We haven't beaten beaten it.

862
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:27,680
Speaker 0: But you almost get this history like it almost, you know, those 80s movies where it's like the credits show, like what happened to everybody.

863
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,315
Speaker 0: Like Joey Jojo blew up in the war and Doc became a lawyer and then got shot, like something like that.

864
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:36,600
Speaker 0: You kind of get that for your character.

865
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:41,599
Speaker 0: Like it tells you the story of your character, like based on the decisions you made, how did you end up?

866
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:55,340
Speaker 1: Now, along your way, where you're doing this sort of, you know, average run of the mill action RPG gameplay where you have different classes and a few different abilities, teleport, range, melee, you know, that sort of stuff.

867
00:54:57,301 --> 00:55:04,175
Speaker 1: You will have to choose where you're going to go next in a very Slay the Spire kind of style.

868
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:06,760
Speaker 1: You start off in your home village and the moon disappears.

869
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,609
Speaker 1: But then it's like, okay, where do you go next?

870
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:12,100
Speaker 1: Do you go to over to there, to that cave?

871
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,560
Speaker 0: You head over to the sun cult, which is probably the culprit.

872
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,068
Speaker 1: You're in the moon group, you're moon people, moon hunters.

873
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,572
Speaker 1: What happened to the moon?

874
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:23,620
Speaker 1: You're pretty sure those evil sun cult guys did something.

875
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:29,400
Speaker 1: So do you go over to the sun cult and like take it to the man and say, hey, what'd you do with the moon, jerks?

876
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:33,699
Speaker 0: We did that the first time, we went over and fucked the sun cult up.

877
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, we sure did.

878
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,719
Speaker 1: I think we unlocked the sun cult guy as like a playable character even.

879
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,779
Speaker 1: Something like that.

880
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,107
Speaker 1: Something like that.

881
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:43,540
Speaker 1: There's stuff that goes on.

882
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,740
Speaker 0: That guy though, he, anyway.

883
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,460
Speaker 1: There's something interesting going on there.

884
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,540
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's all sorts of interesting characters you meet.

885
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Speaker 1: Like none of the, a lot of games will sort of like Slay the Spire for example.

886
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,580
Speaker 1: You have a question mark and then you'll have a fight and they're clearly separate.

887
00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:58,563
Speaker 1: Here it's like.

888
00:55:58,603 --> 00:56:03,700
Speaker 1: every area you go in, even if it's just mostly a town, might have a couple guys to fight, right?

889
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:10,800
Speaker 1: And even an area where you are fighting lots and lots of guys with several bosses, like a big battle area.

890
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:17,079
Speaker 1: There'll be several people to talk to, to have dialogue with, to get quests from, to learn things from.

891
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:18,838
Speaker 1: And you gotta pay attention.

892
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,679
Speaker 1: With a hermit in it, all kinds of stuff.

893
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:29,780
Speaker 0: If you don't pay attention to what people are saying and try to solve the puzzle, you gotta go to the places that make sense for what you're actually trying to accomplish.

894
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:33,520
Speaker 0: And you can just go off on wild goose chases, like go somewhere that doesn't really matter.

895
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:35,920
Speaker 0: Or you can pay attention or go somewhere interesting.

896
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,139
Speaker 0: You can go do something completely different from trying to find the moon and see how that turns out.

897
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,800
Speaker 0: But all those places also let you unlock more of the game.

898
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,160
Speaker 0: Like once you find a type of food, now that type of food is always available.

899
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:57,080
Speaker 0: It's like in the game we just played, we met this bird lady and she seems important, but she doesn't want to talk to us unless we make her a fish sandwich.

900
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:03,379
Speaker 0: So if we ever get fish, we're going to try to go back to that place in a future playthrough and see if we can get this bird lady to talk to us.

901
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,762
Speaker 1: Exactly.

902
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:08,480
Speaker 1: And then of course on the map, it's like, "Oh, well there's a place that has fishing.

903
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,220
Speaker 1: Maybe we should go to that place and try to fish and then get the recipe for the fish sandwich for cooking.

904
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:16,617
Speaker 1: And then the recipe will be available on future playthroughs and so on and so

905
00:57:16,657 --> 00:57:16,858
Speaker 1: forth.".

906
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 1: So I think like I've said a bunch of times, the combat action part of the game is kind of eh.

907
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:35,420
Speaker 1: But what I think the game gives you, that's sort of new and unique, is you get the stat building visual novel action that you would normally see in a Tokimeki memorial almost.

908
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,965
Speaker 1: But better design.

909
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:41,020
Speaker 0: Simply because it tells you what you needed to interact with the thing.

910
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:42,342
Speaker 1: Exactly.

911
00:57:42,924 --> 00:57:47,320
Speaker 1: But also, not only do you get that, you get to play through it quickly.

912
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,960
Speaker 1: Playing Tokimeki memorial takes a long time, right?

913
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:54,300
Speaker 1: Even playing some of the other stat building visual novels takes a while, right?

914
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,184
Speaker 1: They're not quick games.

915
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:58,580
Speaker 1: Here you can play through a playthrough in a sitting with your friends.

916
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:02,180
Speaker 1: I think it would actually be best at a party with four people, right?

917
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,438
Speaker 1: You could play through and it's like, "Okay, we did

918
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:05,599
Speaker 1: that."

919
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,100
Speaker 1: And then you can learn so much and get another playthrough.

920
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:16,480
Speaker 1: And you can really, you know, if one playthrough of a game takes so long, it's like that replay using what you learned from the first time might not ever happen.

921
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:26,659
Speaker 1: Here you can iterate quickly and really explore all the space available in a shorter amount of time, or you're more likely to re-explore.

922
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:38,740
Speaker 1: And then on top of that, right, so you've got the shorter stat building visual novel with greater replay, and then you've got the multiplayer aspect, right, where you're playing it together.

923
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:48,480
Speaker 1: When you play Tokimeki Memorial together or some other stat building visual novel, it's everyone yelling at each other and you're outside the game in the meta picking your choices, right?

924
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:55,720
Speaker 0: But here, if Scott's like, "We should share our water with this guy," and all the rest of us are like, "No, fuck him," and we vote to deny him water, that's what we're doing.

925
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:59,820
Speaker 1: You're literally all together doing it at the same time.

926
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,220
Speaker 1: And then sometimes you're doing that voting, but sometimes you're not.

927
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,460
Speaker 1: You still have the individual play, right?

928
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,960
Speaker 1: So at the end of each day in the game, like I said, the game is five days long, you camp.

929
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:18,840
Speaker 1: And when you camp, each player individually chooses what they're going to do when they camp at night.

930
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,340
Speaker 0: I love that part.

931
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,300
Speaker 1: This is a really fun part of the game, right?

932
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:35,600
Speaker 1: So you're presented with a screen that reminds me a lot of Golden Axe with the campfire, and you pick a spot, and some of the spots tell you straight up, like, "This is going to increase these stats for you," right?

933
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:41,560
Speaker 1: So maybe you want to increase leadership, so you pick a certain thing that increases leadership so you can become the leader.

934
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:46,480
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're a melee character, you pick the thing that will increase your strength.

935
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:51,300
Speaker 1: And then cooking, you can pick a recipe, and then stuff happens and you pick a recipe, right?

936
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:58,100
Speaker 0: And often when you pick something, independent of that stat boost, you'll get your own, like, "I'm keeping watch while Scott's sleeping.

937
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:03,759
Speaker 0: I have to deal with the situation by myself and answer a question that no one else gets to vote, just

938
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:03,920
Speaker 0: me.".

939
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:16,117
Speaker 1: You will get some sort of story encounter, some often, and I guess not always, but very often, while you're doing your camping activity and get to do an individual choice for your character.

940
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:16,980
Speaker 1: that is a lot of fun.

941
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:21,940
Speaker 0: And I will say these choices, like, another game that evokes in my mind is Arabian Nights.

942
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,260
Speaker 0: Or a thousand and one, like, that are the game, because the choices are vague and simple.

943
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:31,393
Speaker 0: Like, do I share or deny the thing?

944
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:32,980
Speaker 0: Do I flirt or distract?

945
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:41,060
Speaker 0: Like, you get very different and vague options, and the story kind of just follows them.

946
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:53,817
Speaker 1: And they are not the sort of blatant black and white sort of mortal choices you get in, like, a Fallout kind of game, where it's like, "Do I kill the guy, steal from the guy, or try to persuade the

947
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:54,219
Speaker 1: guy?".

948
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,159
Speaker 1: Or, you know, just be nice to the guy.

949
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:01,655
Speaker 0: Well, we found the skull, like, the Skull Shrine, and the options it gave us were "Pray" or

950
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:01,996
Speaker 0: "Study.".

951
01:01:03,922 --> 01:01:07,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, I prayed because I want to pray to the awesome skull.

952
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, all hail Zomelguster.

953
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:12,860
Speaker 1: But neither one of those is necessarily good, bad, wrong, right?

954
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:23,660
Speaker 1: They're all interesting choices that, you know, you're going to choose probably according to your personality, in this personality test RPG, right?

955
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:32,200
Speaker 1: What you choose in the choice of, you know, "Pray" or "Study" to the skull says stuff about who you are, the real person, right?

956
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:38,000
Speaker 1: So, I would recommend this game not necessarily for everybody.

957
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:41,600
Speaker 1: I would say if you have, it's okay with just two people.

958
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:47,580
Speaker 1: If you got at least one other person, if you're going to play it alone, I think you're going to lose a lot of the effect of it.

959
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:48,408
Speaker 1: Not all of it.

960
01:01:48,448 --> 01:01:49,419
Speaker 1: You can play it alone if you want.

961
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,839
Speaker 0: But I think three or four, this game shines the most.

962
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,911
Speaker 1: Three or four, it shines a lot.

963
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:55,080
Speaker 1: Two is still good.

964
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:57,720
Speaker 1: I think it's worth playing with two if that's all you can muster.

965
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:07,520
Speaker 1: If you can get people to play this and play repeat plays of it, it is well worth the ridiculously low price it is on Steam right now.

966
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,910
Speaker 0: Two dollars!

967
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,100
Speaker 1: Damn, that is low.

968
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:18,740
Speaker 0: Now, right now we had trouble getting the online play that's built in to work, but the game works 100% fine with Steam Remote Play.

969
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:24,240
Speaker 1: Yes, so technology-wise, yeah, their game does have online play built in.

970
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,240
Speaker 1: I don't know if the online play on the Switch works because I obviously did not buy it on Switch.

971
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:30,620
Speaker 1: It might or might not work.

972
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,880
Speaker 0: It claims to have online support on the Switch.

973
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:42,660
Speaker 1: Yes, on PC, we could not get the online functionality to work, but using Steam Remote Play together, it worked perfectly fine.

974
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:50,220
Speaker 1: On the main menu, you have some trouble because only one person can control the main menu and it might not be the person whose computer is playing the game.

975
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,959
Speaker 0: It ended up being me, but we sorted that out.

976
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:58,020
Speaker 1: But once you're in the game, then it will recognize everyone's controller and you all join and it'll work.

977
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:03,360
Speaker 1: I did have trouble with it one time, but I didn't have trouble with it just recently, so it worked.

978
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:13,040
Speaker 1: But if you're playing locally and you just have four friends in your house at post-covid, and you have four controllers, then you're going to have a real good time.

979
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,834
Speaker 1: You won't have any technological issues with this game whatsoever.

980
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:16,920
Speaker 1: It'll work perfectly.

981
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:24,580
Speaker 1: So yeah, Moon Hunters, terrific use of two dollars for sure.

982
01:03:24,861 --> 01:03:26,044
Speaker 0: It surprised me.

983
01:03:26,104 --> 01:03:30,638
Speaker 0: It was way more than I expected and I want to keep playing it.

984
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:44,600
Speaker 1: Having played a lot, I guess not a lot, but quite a handful of these co-op action RPG things in Covid times, because that's the most common co-op game you're going to see on Steam.

985
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:54,599
Speaker 1: This one is definitely one of the better ones that will get more play, despite the fact that parts of it are meh.

986
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:01,400
Speaker 1: The parts of it that are unique are so unique and interesting that it is worth my time.

987
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:04,019
Speaker 0: You're not going to find another game like this yet.

988
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,500
Speaker 1: Two dollars.

989
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,664
Speaker 0: Two dollars.

990
01:04:06,965 --> 01:04:09,740
Speaker 0: And not two dollars and less than a quarter, to be fair.

991
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,558
Speaker 0: Plus shacks, so another nickel or so.

992
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:22,780
Speaker 1: You can go on itch.io and I don't know what the price is on itch.io, but it's probably, I imagine, pay what you want, because that's what itch.io does for a lot of things.

993
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:25,376
Speaker 1: A plus.

994
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,340
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

995
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,480
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
