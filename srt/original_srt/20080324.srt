Speaker 1: Yeah, you're reclined to an extreme amount.

11
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:57,040
Speaker 0: if you're in a reclining chair, and there's no one behind you and no one in front of you Why ever would you not at least partially recline?

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,857
Speaker 0: I mean you might not want to fully recline because then you sort of had to pick your head up.

13
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,438
Speaker 0: if you want to look at something like a TV, but Always at least partially recline at least do the leg rest thing.

00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,050
Speaker 1: You know hard.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,194
Speaker 1: It was to get it up those stairs.

19
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,440
Speaker 1: the bottom kept falling out.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if we move we're gonna need to get like.

21
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,120

00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, Craigslist, man.

23
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,580
Speaker 0: Yeah that too All right, so remember.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,655
Speaker 0: I don't know when it was but recently We talked about how we went to that haircut place in the train station.

25
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:37,835
Speaker 1: that was really convenient But sort of expensive and you needed that haircut to match your purse right and those shoes.

26
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,293
Speaker 0: people are going like oh $30 for a haircut.

27
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 0: you're crazy.

28
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:45,980
Speaker 1: Meanwhile because I happen to have long hair even though I'm a guy I had to pay 60-something dollars.

29
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:53,999
Speaker 0: All right, so I want a haircut this morning, and so I went in there and the first thing I realized Is that the first time I went there all right?

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,863
Speaker 0: Which is the only.

31
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,771
Speaker 0: I've only been there twice is the second time.

32
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,889
Speaker 0: the first time I went there I had apparently gotten there really early.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,052
Speaker 0: like before most of the people who work there got there So it was like the only I was.

34
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,780
Speaker 0: I must have been the first one there that morning.

35
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:12,419
Speaker 0: So like the only like girl there washed my hair and like the only guy there cut my hair, right?

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:24,000
Speaker 0: But today I got there a little later and like all the working be all the people were there all the barbers and such and The whole other side of that place is like a barbershop, but not just you know.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,680
Speaker 0: It's like a real barbershop, and I was like aha yeah, I gotta go to that side where the men go.

38
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,140
Speaker 1: It depends on what you're getting done.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,980
Speaker 1: I mean I get the nice head massage and that you know the wash.

40
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,500
Speaker 0: They wash your hair, and they cut your hair and whatever.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,665
Speaker 0: Some um you know I like I'm.

42
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:45,429
Speaker 0: it's kind of shabby because I didn't even shower this morning and whatever you know because if someone Else is gonna wash my hair.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,359
Speaker 0: Why should I wash my hair?

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,790
Speaker 0: Right it's like dentist the morning.

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,533
Speaker 0: I go to the dentist.

46
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,317
Speaker 0: You don't brush your teeth.

47
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:51,939
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,333
Speaker 0: You brush your teeth the night before maybe but oh good.

49
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:56,960
Speaker 1: God you brush your teeth in the morning.

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,456
Speaker 1: There's nothing dentists hate more because remember they're not brushing your teeth.

51
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:01,440
Speaker 1: It's not what they do there.

52
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:02,946
Speaker 1: No, they're getting rid of the plaque.

53
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:09,253
Speaker 1: if all it does is make your stay much longer and more uncomfortable I'm told the dentist my uncle.

54
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:12,907
Speaker 1: I'm gonna torture him Brush your teeth before you go to the dentist.

55
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:13,791
Speaker 1: for the love of God.

56
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:14,815
Speaker 0: No don't don't?

57
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:15,860
Speaker 0: what are you paying for?

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,222
Speaker 1: I'm paying to remove plaque and make sure I don't have Gingivitis.

59
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:23,171
Speaker 0: so the plaque should be removed when you brush.

60
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,940
Speaker 0: it would be tartar that you would scrape off.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,592
Speaker 1: I believe no plaque is what you're having a scrape.

62
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,220
Speaker 1: anyway tartar can be removed.

63
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,411
Speaker 1: I believe plaque cannot.

64
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,440
Speaker 1: do we have to look up Wikipedia?

65
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,267
Speaker 0: Why don't we call a dentist?

66
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,854
Speaker 0: because neither of us are dentists.

67
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,220
Speaker 1: we have any dentist listeners.

68
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,527
Speaker 1: I know we have a lot of lawyers.

69
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:39,412
Speaker 0: That would be a very.

70
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,237
Speaker 0: we do have a lot on.

71
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,511
Speaker 0: well We have a. I think it is.

72
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:43,679
Speaker 0: is that the lawyer?

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,528
Speaker 0: Here's my thinking.

74
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,442
Speaker 1: oh because I wonder if you have the same thinking I do.

75
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:53,651
Speaker 0: is that lawyers the kind of people who are lawyers are much more likely to be like Participants because they're you know that they like to talk back.

76
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,760
Speaker 1: Oh wow I was gonna say it much more bluntly.

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,346
Speaker 1: I think lawyers are more argumentative.

78
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:05,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, and because of the somewhat adversarial style of our show It's very easy to decide that maybe an argument should happen.

79
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,391
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I went to that place this morning.

80
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,620
Speaker 0: I went to the barber side some old guy.

81
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,985
Speaker 0: I was like hey come on.

82
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,957
Speaker 0: I'm like all right, and I'm like he's like do you want to shave?

83
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,124
Speaker 0: and I'm like Why not yeah?

84
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:17,646
Speaker 0: I'll get a shave.

85
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,128
Speaker 0: what the hell?

86
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,740
Speaker 1: Did you get one of those nice straight razor shaves?

87
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, except it wasn't so nice really.

88
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,020
Speaker 0: yeah come look at my face.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,325
Speaker 0: It's not too.

90
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:26,586
Speaker 0: Good.

91
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:27,610
Speaker 0: It looks good from far away.

92
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,935
Speaker 0: Ah, but it was.

93
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,160
Speaker 0: I could have shaved myself better.

94
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,324
Speaker 0: It's actually under.

95
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:34,915
Speaker 0: my chin is unshaven spots, and it was all scraping.

96
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,600
Speaker 1: did he actually use a straight razor?

97
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, you probably just sucked.

98
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,128
Speaker 0: I think you just sucked.

99
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,136
Speaker 1: see the thing is it's I mean people like.

100
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:46,333
Speaker 1: a lot of people accused us When we first started using these you know old-time razors.

101
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:47,780
Speaker 1: is that you're just doing it cuz it's cool?

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,579
Speaker 1: Now if we were doing it because it's cool We'd be using straight razors, but let me tell you a straight razor is no better than a safety razor.

103
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:58,203
Speaker 1: in fact He's worse is too less Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:58,925
Speaker 1: It's not gonna.

105
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,289
Speaker 1: Give you a better shave, and you're.

106
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,260
Speaker 1: the chance of dying is increased dramatically every morning.

107
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,488
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't want my chance of dabbing.

108
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,400
Speaker 1: I already have to worry about falling over and dying in the shower.

109
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:15,065
Speaker 0: I don't want to worry about cutting my throat open all right, so I'm like oh well I got at least I'm shaving.

110
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,599
Speaker 0: I mean it wasn't great, but I'm shaving whatever right like I cut my hair.

111
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,139
Speaker 0: He cuts my hair just fine.

112
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:24,340
Speaker 0: You know washes my hair which is nice because that's what I needed cuz they didn't wash it this morning.

113
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:33,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know I leave you know how much that was how much it's $50 $20 for a bad shave.

114
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,856
Speaker 1: I'll shave you for less than what he charged.

115
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:43,039
Speaker 0: yeah for $20 I could have bought in 20 razor blades more than 20 remember I know I could buy like four four packs.

116
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,453
Speaker 1: So and that's the platinum coated nice ones.

117
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,844
Speaker 1: if you're willing to get the cheap ones god They're like five cents each.

118
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:50,515
Speaker 0: I know right, so it's like wow okay.

119
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:51,680
Speaker 0: I'm not getting a shave here again.

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,190
Speaker 0: Maybe oh, maybe I don't even know if it's worth it for the $30 haircut.

121
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,187
Speaker 0: cuz while the $30 haircut You know it was a fine haircut.

122
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,040
Speaker 0: You know and I got my hair washed, which is you know what I wanted.

123
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:11,249
Speaker 0: Still I mean like it wasn't that it wasn't twice as good as a $14 haircut, so yeah Alright, but anyway.

124
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:22,640
Speaker 1: It is tech day It is you know science and technology and all that and a lot of tech news happened in the last week And we're gonna have to skip most of it because we don't want the show to just be one of those tech news round up.

Speaker 1: Yeah, so what should I talk about?

131
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,640

Speaker 1: so here's the deal.

137
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:16,500
Speaker 1: Google unveiled something amazing and awesome, and you they've had this functionality before but they've kind of taken it to the next level.

138
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,379
Speaker 1: It's kind of a search within a search.

139
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,674
Speaker 1: So I search for like Best Buy and I end up on Best Buy.

140
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:29,695
Speaker 1: so now I can search In Best Buy or in the search results that I just had or more stuff.

141
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:31,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but let me explain that.

142
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:33,506
Speaker 0: So you go to Google.

143
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:35,957
Speaker 1: I was about to but you go ahead you go to google.com.

144
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 0: right okay?

145
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,744
Speaker 0: I'm going to google.com.

146
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,716
Speaker 0: I type in Wikipedia right.

147
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,815
Speaker 0: it takes It doesn't take you directly to Wikipedia unless you push the I'm feeling lucky button right.

148
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:51,312
Speaker 0: so if you push the search button Or you press enter it takes you to a list of search results because that's what Google does.

149
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,780
Speaker 0: the top result of course is Wikipedia.

150
00:07:54,402 --> 00:08:06,323
Speaker 0: But under that result before the second result which is the main page of Wikipedia English It's a. there's a little text box that says and then a button and the button says search Wikipedia org.

151
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:16,853
Speaker 0: so I could actually go in that search Wikipedia org and type in farts and click on it and now It'll actually you know search with site colon Wikipedia org.

152
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,160
Speaker 1: so see that this isn't new functionality.

153
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,173
Speaker 1: You could search with site colon a site forever.

154
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's always existed.

155
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,620
Speaker 0: in fact It's very useful because you ever have a site with a really shitty search engine.

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:36,039
Speaker 0: Okay, every website right if it it's much easier to search those websites with Google than it is with their shitty search engine.

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,229
Speaker 0: So you do is you want to search and gadget?

158
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:58,300
Speaker 0: don't go to engage it and use the engagement search box Go to Google and if you want to search and gadget for I don't know phones type phones space site si te colon and gadget comm and press enter and you will get Google search results But you will only get search pages results that are at in gadget comm.

159
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:03,860
Speaker 1: It's super useful pretty much to make this easier like if you search for a retailer or something big like Best Buy or whatever.

160
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:16,435
Speaker 1: it'll do that thing Scott said and it'll make it really easy for people who don't know about all the kind of syntax because you Can put a lot of interesting syntax and arguments into a Google search if you know how to do it Mm-hmm, but they're making it really easy.

161
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:28,720
Speaker 1: now A lot of people are spreading some thought about this and more importantly a lot of people are really Really really angry about this and I I think those people can die in a fire But I also think they can go ahead and fire.

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,499
Speaker 1: I think I need to explain a little bit about exactly why this is a concern and what the deal is.

163
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:41,604
Speaker 1: Alright, so in the old days I'd have to go to Best Buy and use their crappy search and I could find stuff on the Best Buy website Marginally and I was it.

164
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:45,098
Speaker 1: and even if Best Buy had a great search it could only find stuff on Best Buy.

165
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,760
Speaker 1: now Let's say I use the Google thing.

166
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,999
Speaker 1: alright, I'm searching on Best Buy site with Google and it's a much better search already.

167
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,796
Speaker 1: and Because I'm searching on Google technically I just happen to be searching Best Buy's content.

168
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:06,018
Speaker 1: I See all the ads the Google ads like I would if I was searching on Google.

169
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,440
Speaker 1: now Let's say I search for a certain brand of cell phone that I know Best Buy sells.

170
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,500
Speaker 1: Well, I'll see the Best Buy link in the Best Buy price.

171
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:20,014
Speaker 1: I'll also see ads for all the competitors who are also selling that cell phone.

172
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the Google ads basically did.

173
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:34,594
Speaker 0: the difference here the things that the website operators are complaining about is now people who want to search for things on Where they normally would have gone to Best Buy calm and done a search.

174
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:38,020
Speaker 0: that means they would have loaded multiple Best Buy pages.

175
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:46,177
Speaker 0: Now the person is going to be loading a bunch of Google pages and maybe one Best Buy page if they end up going to a Best Buy page at all.

176
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,548
Speaker 1: Now consider the following quote.

177
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,416
Speaker 1: this pretty much sums up the jackasses.

178
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,199
Speaker 1: who are against this?

179
00:10:52,921 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 1: Google is showing a level of aggressiveness with this that's just not needed said one quote internet consultant.

180
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:06,700
Speaker 1: Take for instance a test where users of Google searched the Washington Post and were given a secondary search box.

181
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:20,580
Speaker 1: Those who type two jobs into that second box saw related results from the post employment pages, but the results were bombarded by Advertisements for competing employment sites like Career Builder or Monster.com.

182
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:28,436
Speaker 1: So even though the user began the process by stating their intention to reach the post Google's ad steered them to some of their competitors.

183
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:41,079
Speaker 1: now It seems to me that the only argument anyone has against this functionality is That now it is easier for people to compete with you.

184
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,226
Speaker 1: Capitalism I think this is great.

185
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:56,019
Speaker 1: if I search on Best Buy and I want to buy I don't know some CDRs And I see a Google ad that says hey those exact CDRs that Best Buy is charging 10 bucks for We'll give them to you for five.

186
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:58,166
Speaker 1: Well, what's wrong with that?

187
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:01,180
Speaker 1: That's gonna put a lot of pressure on P. It's gonna make prices come down.

188
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 1: It's good for everyone But people who can't actually compete in a free market and rely on the fact that consumers are generally ignorant or Rely on the fact that while all the information is technically available.

189
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,772
Speaker 1: It's difficult to get all that information together.

190
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,078
Speaker 1: Google more and more.

191
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:25,793
Speaker 1: But the beauty of Google is not so much that they allow you to find information It's that they allow you to find the same like stratum of information across different sources.

192
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:34,160
Speaker 1: and by bringing that information together Consumers can be so much more informed and no one can get away with having high prices ever.

193
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,503
Speaker 0: yeah, Google is uh Pretty good.

194
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:47,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, but and I you know if you read the article You'll see that pretty much everyone complaining against this just either really doesn't understand it or understands it all too.

195
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,791
Speaker 0: Well Yeah, they're crazy SEO bastards.

196
00:12:51,232 --> 00:13:02,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but seriously I I Mean I could see a lawsuit or something coming out of this But I imagine Google would win and I have yet to see any legitimate argument against Google doing well.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,237
Speaker 0: They never complained before.

198
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:10,900
Speaker 0: now They're only complaining because suddenly there's a text box and a button making a feature that's existed for a long time easier to do.

199
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,073
Speaker 0: If it wasn't a problem to do it before why is it suddenly?

200
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,720
Speaker 0: it shouldn't be a problem to make it easier?

201
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,100
Speaker 1: Well, remember these retailers have always had a history of this sort of thing.

202
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:28,150
Speaker 1: I mean if you ever want to see an example of this go to like a Best Buy or Circuit City or whatever with a big old notebook and Walk-around writing down prices of things.

203
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,953
Speaker 1: There's a good chance.

204
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 1: You'll be kicked out within a few minutes.

205
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:36,298
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm because retailers that I don't even get into that suffice to say I said it.

206
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:36,859
Speaker 1: I said it.

207
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:44,474
Speaker 1: You didn't want me to say it, but I said it Google's doing nothing but good here, and I don't think I can beat that horse further.

208
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,020
Speaker 1: No, so what do you got for me?

209
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,460
Speaker 0: So I remember all that satellite radio.

210
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:54,733
Speaker 0: I mean satellite radio feels to me like it was really big Few years ago, and it's sort of gotten a little.

211
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,115
Speaker 0: they like.

212
00:13:55,135 --> 00:14:02,703
Speaker 0: they said they were gonna merge Or maybe there was gonna be a merger and then it was quiet, and it seems like you know satellite radio sort of been Since then.

213
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:07,560
Speaker 1: satellite radio would have been great if I didn't have podcasts iPod and my own music collection.

214
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically they they you know.

215
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,937
Speaker 0: the question was are we gonna let these guys merge?

216
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,900
Speaker 0: and the answer is yes.

217
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:20,600
Speaker 0: And they basically said the obvious Statement of the Department of Justice antitrust division is decision blah blah blah.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,968
Speaker 0: Basically evidence does not establish.

219
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,060
Speaker 0: the combination of radio providers substantially reduce competition.

220
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,527
Speaker 0: Basically the summary it up.

221
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:38,259
Speaker 0: They said there were too many other options, so Combining all the satellite radios isn't a big deal because there's other there's am/fm radios and there's internet radios and whatnot.

222
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,667
Speaker 0: so it's not A big deal huh.

223
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,278
Speaker 1: that's like the opposite of what happened with dr.

224
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,973
Speaker 1: Pepper back in the when coca-cola tried to buy them out.

225
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:54,107
Speaker 0: yeah, but yeah Radio is sort of a weird thing because it's sort of cool in that you can it's you really high-quality radio Right if you can have live stuff on it.

226
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,013
Speaker 0: Just like broadcast radio, but there's.

227
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,000
Speaker 0: no it's a lot easier to get reception.

228
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,930
Speaker 0: You can get a lot more channels you.

229
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,773
Speaker 0: the audio quality.

230
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:03,537
Speaker 0: I think is better.

231
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,300
Speaker 0: It must be right.

232
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,013
Speaker 0: There's a lot less commercials if if there's any commercials at all.

233
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,540
Speaker 0: I don't know that much about it.

234
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,638
Speaker 0: I never actually listen to it.

235
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:16,077
Speaker 0: And there's a lot more selection of stuff And you can actually get some pretty niche weird kind of stuff on there.

236
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:16,238
Speaker 0: like.

237
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:23,067
Speaker 0: I know There's a lot of podcasts that just they play on their podcasts on the internet And then they play on satellite radio also.

238
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,820
Speaker 0: just you know the satellite radio provider takes the podcast and puts it on the satellite radio.

239
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,500
Speaker 0: It's actually looks a jewel time.

240
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,356
Speaker 1: I actually really looked into doing that for geek nights and the only reason we haven't done it is that it's kind of a Gigantic pain in the ass.

241
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:42,654
Speaker 0: yeah Your show has to be like exactly like to the second a certain length And you have to put little noises in your show so they know.

242
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:48,523
Speaker 0: so the automatic Satellite radio system can insert your audio and pretty much I'm nothing.

243
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:53,626
Speaker 1: we're never gonna be syndicated like that unless we get to the point where we have paid staff to deal with all that Crap for me.

244
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,475
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much.

245
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:56,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think this is pretty interesting.

246
00:15:56,887 --> 00:16:02,872
Speaker 0: I mean this is either going to result in You know both the satellite radio going.

247
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 0: uh this is tote the whole.

248
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,359
Speaker 0: I mean you have an entire industry embodied in one company right so it's a lot easier than other industries.

249
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:11,706
Speaker 0: you go How's the industry doing?

250
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:14,480
Speaker 0: is a lot of companies and some are doing good and some are doing bad?

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,720
Speaker 0: You're like the whole industry's in one company.

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,855
Speaker 0: So we know if satellite radio is a good idea or not based on the success of this.

253
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,280
Speaker 0: now one company.

254
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:28,635
Speaker 0: but The question will be is it is it gonna succeed or is it is it blend?

255
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,036
Speaker 0: Yeah?

256
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:29,578
Speaker 0: I don't know.

257
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,187
Speaker 0: I Satellite radio, there's some things.

258
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,135
Speaker 0: I like about it, but really I'm not.

259
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,059
Speaker 0: you don't see me buying it.

260
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:42,826
Speaker 1: I think that the main reason why I would never consider satellite radio is that it's still push rather than pull I mean, it's not like well.

261
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,047
Speaker 1: I mean

262
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:47,044
Speaker 0: you have a lot more choices, so it's a little bit of pull I mean, but

263
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,519
Speaker 1: not really it has the same pull that cable TV

264
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,563
Speaker 0: Exactly got

265
00:16:50,583 --> 00:17:01,676
Speaker 1: a thousand channels, but if I want to listen to like whatever and whatever's on at eight o'clock I'm pretty much screwed unless it's eight o'clock, or I have some sort of TiVo for my radio.

266
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 0: see like cable television.

267
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:08,142
Speaker 0: I think that satellite radio would do well to move to some sort of on-demand type Programming.

268
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:20,300
Speaker 1: yeah, but the infrastructure really isn't fully in place for that especially because every time anyone tries to do something like that Especially with radio it seems like everyone in the industry jumps down their throat and starts screaming about copyright.

269
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,750
Speaker 1: And you see there is.

270
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,339
Speaker 0: there was some sort of on-demand radio.

271
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,842
Speaker 0: That would be.

272
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,715
Speaker 0: that's it for podcast you know because that's really.

273
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:30,830
Speaker 0: that's the one reason I want to have a moat like the iPod.

274
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:37,328
Speaker 0: if you want to get podcasts on the iPod you have to plug it in to a Computer and sync it with iTunes.

275
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:44,640
Speaker 0: if the iPod could just get podcasts on its own Right had iTunes or podcatcher built into it or any other mp3 playing device.

276
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:54,680
Speaker 0: That's the same thing as on-demand radio because you could just browse the web find any podcast Get the episode no matter where you are as long as you have Wi-Fi, and then it's on-demand radio.

277
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,164
Speaker 0: And that is what we really need.

278
00:17:56,425 --> 00:18:01,260
Speaker 0: and satellite radio could beat the podcast mobile device to it if they moved.

279
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,047
Speaker 0: But I don't see them moving well.

280
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,754
Speaker 1: There are a lot of limitations.

281
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:09,220
Speaker 1: I mean remember satellite radio is Not exactly to weigh.

282
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:15,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think another problem with satellite radio is that they all all the devices seem to be like these car devices.

283
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:19,040
Speaker 0: You know where's the carry in my pocket satellite radio.

284
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,885
Speaker 0: Do they make one of those?

285
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:22,580
Speaker 1: see what I would have done if I was setting up satellite radios.

286
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,362
Speaker 1: I would have sold.

287
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:29,744
Speaker 1: you could buy like base stations for anything once for cars once for RVs once for in your house once for Outside.

288
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:32,480
Speaker 0: I think they have house ones that you can hook up to your like receiver.

289
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,365
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah But I would have made like all those things.

290
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:45,002
Speaker 1: and then the simple way is you what you get for your subscription is like a Little key a little dongle little thing and whatever satellite radio thing you plug it into you get your service Regardless.

291
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,151
Speaker 1: so I can bring my service with me go to my friend's house.

292
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,357
Speaker 1: He has satellite radio course.

293
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:57,990
Speaker 1: theoretically He should have a dongle, but if you had some sort of subscription model Or you know semi on demand or maybe you pick likes you know all that There are a lot of better ways.

294
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,359
Speaker 1: It could have been handled than it was handled.

295
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:05,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like they competed in a market that was on the verge of becoming a different mark.

296
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,980
Speaker 1: well They created the market and then no they were competing in the market of listening to audio when I am not home.

297
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the problem is they they jumped in with the right technology.

298
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:24,280
Speaker 1: The problem is they should have jumped in a few years earlier Or they should have jumped in a little bit later, but they would have jumped in like pre iPod.

299
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:32,220
Speaker 0: I think that like a couple years before the iPod came out I seriously believe the satellite radio would be like the default in cars.

300
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:43,740
Speaker 1: Am/fm might have died if they'd been around when I was in high school because remember I didn't even have a CD player For a long time and then in my car I had my CD player, and I would make mix CDs.

301
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:49,218
Speaker 1: I would have paid a lot to have had even an mp3 player, and if there had been satellite radio.

302
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,570
Speaker 0: Oh, man Yep, oh well.

303
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:51,933
Speaker 0: Well.

304
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:53,019
Speaker 0: We'll see what comes to this.

305
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,958
Speaker 0: I I'm gonna give it six months or so before we can make a verdict.

306
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,288
Speaker 0: I think they'll definitely last at least that long.

307
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:08,260
Speaker 1: so I got one more little news partly because a lot of people are probably Somewhat in the dark as to exactly what the deal was with this.

308
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,000
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you've all heard the stories that Pakistan broke YouTube or Pakistan broke the internet something.

309
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:14,965
Speaker 0: Oh, it's an old story.

310
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:28,900
Speaker 1: It's not that old a few weeks old, but anyway The fullness of this was that Pakistan ordered all of its ISPs to block access to YouTube because YouTube contains quote blasphemous web content slash movies.

311
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:44,740
Speaker 1: Now there's some arguments that that might have just been a cover story Because it kind of coincides with a lot of political unrest in Pakistan And there were a lot of videos kind of pointing out certain things about the government in Pakistan at the time.

312
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:50,039
Speaker 1: But nominally this was partly because of the whole Muhammad cartoons OMG thing.

313
00:20:51,233 --> 00:21:17,474
Speaker 1: well Basically what happened here was that Pakistan said all right YouTube is no longer cool in Pakistan, but what they did is Instead of enforcing it legally they enforced it technologically by advertising false routing information To YouTube's websites these false routes because of the way the internet works partly because people trusted Pakistan Which I don't think anyone wouldn't.

314
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:22,370
Speaker 0: they just tell all Pakistani ISPs to block traffic to the YouTube IP addresses.

315
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:27,527
Speaker 1: Well what they did is that's difficult to do yeah, but what they did is they firewall it out.

316
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,229
Speaker 0: I don't know they.

317
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:39,058
Speaker 1: There's arguments that they did this maliciously uh-huh in order to pretty much censor this as far and wide as they could but no one we can't know for sure because we Don't have access to it really feels.

318
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:42,794
Speaker 0: it feels to me like an incompetent IT Situation.

319
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:50,423
Speaker 0: it feels to me like there might have been minor malicious intent But at the same time the people who got poisoned by the bad data.

320
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,630
Speaker 0: it feels like that they that shouldn't happen.

321
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:05,409
Speaker 1: You're supposed to be able to trust the routing information you get and Regardless of whether or not people did trust it the fact remains that Pakistan was advertising false routes Yep, which is bullshit.

322
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:06,375
Speaker 0: It is like.

323
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:06,757
Speaker 1: that is.

324
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:15,050
Speaker 1: one of the fundamental things that makes the internet Go is that people don't lie about the basic low-level stuff of the internet.

325
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:28,695
Speaker 1: That's why every now and then when there's a big internet problem It's because one of the high-level providers has had some sort of peering dispute with another high-level provider And that is one of the biggest reasons why we need some more network network neutrality legislation.

326
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,547
Speaker 1: but I digress.

327
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:45,849
Speaker 1: so Pakistan advertised these false routes and these routes got propagated around the world and that is why There was a period where YouTube was very difficult to access from many parts of the world and a lot of internet traffic was being Routed all over the place in bad ways.

328
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,120
Speaker 0: See the thing is that the thing with that right shouldn't that?

329
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,104
Speaker 0: shouldn't the people?

330
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:51,950
Speaker 0: I mean if you are in?

331
00:22:52,150 --> 00:23:02,278
Speaker 0: Pakistan obviously the false route will screw you right but Someone if you're somewhere else and you know somehow they advertise this false route Shouldn't you like there should be some sort of?

332
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,044
Speaker 0: there's a hierarchy of authority right?

333
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,686
Speaker 0: I mean the Pakistani ISP Don't you know?

334
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,500
Speaker 0: My big router in the sky isn't gonna listen to them.

335
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,448
Speaker 0: when it comes to where the question of where is you?

336
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:11,830
Speaker 1: well when it?

337
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:23,589
Speaker 1: Comes to BGP routes and that I mean routes are summarized in very broad brushes on the internet because broad brush routes take a lot less processing power to deal with and they're less difficult to maintain.

338
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:30,309
Speaker 1: and basically what happened was there's this kind of implicit trust among high-level ISPs worldwide.

339
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:47,375
Speaker 1: and My take on all this is that Pakistan then as a nation at least as far as their technology and government is concerned Has violated that trust and I note how it was rather rapid the response of the world in Containing and removing these routes.

340
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:52,890
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone is ever going to trust routing information that comes out of Pakistan ever again.

341
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,908
Speaker 0: Mmm, and yeah, I there really needs to be like.

342
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,600
Speaker 0: You know some sort of web of trust like.

343
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,110
Speaker 0: I trust these people more than these people more than you know.

344
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,330
Speaker 1: So the problem is something like that requires updates to routing protocols updates to routers.

345
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:07,874
Speaker 1: It's not easy.

346
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,424
Speaker 0: You can't just like type some things in your Cisco and make it happen.

347
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:17,410
Speaker 1: Not really Every road routing protocol has its pros and cons and this is usually BGP type stuff.

348
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,282
Speaker 1: I I'll do a show on routing protocol someday in the future.

349
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:20,864
Speaker 1: I'll warn you.

350
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:27,369
Speaker 0: It's not interesting Because I the way I you know, cuz I don't know much about the routing prop.

351
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:35,030
Speaker 0: You know propagation of routes, but I know about like, you know The propagation of DNS and DNS poisoning and it really DNS poisoning is very hard to do.

352
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:39,530
Speaker 0: But yes, I feel like shouldn't the routing poisoning be?

353
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,980
Speaker 1: Routing is a lot more complicated than DNS.

354
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:55,850
Speaker 0: All right, tell you what and sometime soon I'll do a show on like routing protocols for dummies like how the internet works like how Like if I set up a DNS server and I my DNS server says Google's up your butt it's not gonna work.

355
00:24:56,434 --> 00:25:00,735
Speaker 0: No one's gonna end up up your butt when they were looking for Google Except maybe the people.

356
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:04,310
Speaker 1: that's a very I don't know what but that's a very Dave Riley kind of phrase right there.

357
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,989
Speaker 0: No one's gonna end up at up your butt.

358
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,709
Speaker 1: I can actually answer this very broadly and very succinctly.

359
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:19,576
Speaker 1: The reason DNS is so much more robust against that sort of attack is because DNS is a hierarchy That is a straight-up tree.

360
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,763
Speaker 1: There is a root of DNS a top.

361
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the absolute top That is 100% trusted.

362
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:30,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then like there's this hierarchy going down and it's extremely strict hierarchy Mm-hmm.

363
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:33,482
Speaker 1: The internet is not a hierarchy.

364
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,529
Speaker 1: It's a gigantic messy web.

365
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:39,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean I trust sprint more than I trust Pakistan.

366
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:45,030
Speaker 1: All right, you trust sprint But where do you get your routes from and you have connections all over the world and everyone?

367
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:50,619
Speaker 1: It's so hard to manage all those routes that a lot of I'll talk about on the show.

368
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but suffice to say Number two, you gotta think of a different phrase instead.

369
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:57,679
Speaker 0: Someone think of an alternate phrase.

370
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,230
Speaker 1: be that as it may that doesn't quite fit though.

371
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,117
Speaker 1: I like that though, but it means something different.

372
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,021
Speaker 0: I know whatever.

373
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:05,310
Speaker 1: I could just say something completely random.

374
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:09,607
Speaker 1: So fizzle bottom your mom your mom.

375
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:28,801
Speaker 1: Okay Pakistan's mom apparently, uh I had a bunch of other stories that are all related to this because recently a film that was being made about the Prophet Muhammad that may or may not have been casting him in a bad light was taken down by the ISP hosting it on the grounds that was blasphemous.

376
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:36,908
Speaker 1: and there seems to be more and more a lot of problems in regards to the internet and portrayals of Muhammad.

377
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,110
Speaker 1: and I don't want to get into a religious argument because I don't think this is a religious argument.

378
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,320
Speaker 1: I don't think this has anything to do with religion at all.

379
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:47,515
Speaker 1: freedom of speech wins Regardless.

380
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the same amendment asshole.

381
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:51,227
Speaker 1: Well in the cut in the u.s.

382
00:26:51,510 --> 00:27:12,810
Speaker 1: See the problem is that there are nations like Pakistan who decide to lie on the internet in order to prevent us from seeing pictures of Muhammad or possibly to prevent us from seeing well prevent Pakistanis from seeing what's actually going on in the government, but fizzle bottom I'm very much getting to the point where I'm sick of this and I'm done with it and I don't know.

383
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:23,893
Speaker 1: I feel like the bodies that govern the internet and the United Nations should have some sort of universal code of freedom of speech over communication means Yeah, something like that.

384
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's a show for another time.

385
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:34,939
Speaker 1: All right things of the day.

386
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:42,727
Speaker 1: So you ever get an email from someone where it's from like sprint comm but in the reply to address They don't want you to respond.

387
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:55,960
Speaker 1: They give you some crap like Blah blah blah at do not reply calm or they make up some address so you can't email them back because they don't want to Get deluged with people who can't read who just hit reply and then just you know, shoot their mouth off.

388
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,326
Speaker 1: I guess that was a rhetorical question.

389
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:00,970
Speaker 1: I'll continue.

390
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

391
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,410
Speaker 0: So I was actually reading something.

392
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:14,822
Speaker 1: This is a very very bad idea and it's something that happens a lot if you spoof the reply headers in An email.

393
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:19,803
Speaker 1: that is against pretty much every code of conduct and ethics and even some laws on the internet.

394
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:24,980
Speaker 0: if you do that then pretty much every Email server administrator will be like up blacklist.

395
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,742
Speaker 0: We're done with you.

396
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:26,645
Speaker 0: Go away.

397
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,230
Speaker 0: We don't want any emails coming from you.

398
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,595
Speaker 0: We don't want to send any emails to you.

399
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:32,666
Speaker 1: Fuck you, but even beyond that it's also just.

400
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:33,630
Speaker 1: it's bad practice.

401
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:49,254
Speaker 1: but it happens a lot too just because people When they follow instructions to set things up with technology a lot of people Don't really read the instructions or don't really understand what they're doing and a lot of people configure routers and switches and things Very badly.

402
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:54,490
Speaker 0: Well, I think specifically when it comes to email email servers are very hard to set up.

403
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,277
Speaker 0: It's probably the hardest thing to set up there is.

404
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:57,461
Speaker 1: that's why we use Gmail.

405
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,027
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's like we like Google.

406
00:28:59,047 --> 00:28:59,589
Speaker 0: take care of it.

407
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:01,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, squirrel mail didn't work.

408
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:02,510
Speaker 1: So well, no squirrel.

409
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,508
Speaker 0: Well, that's so good.

410
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:17,249
Speaker 1: but a lot of people will set up even like big companies will set up routers and switches and things to send information or broadcast routes or do things to domains or for domains that they do not actually control.

411
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:29,017
Speaker 1: and What happens if someone owns one of those domains because there is a gentleman someone who gets my thumbs up of the day For owning the domain.

412
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:36,161
Speaker 0: do not reply calm and see I wanted to own them domain test calm But I don't know who had food at bar.

413
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:37,787
Speaker 1: calm would be pretty good to listen to.

414
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,530
Speaker 0: that's a good one.

415
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,437
Speaker 0: There's a lot of.

416
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,676
Speaker 0: there's a whole lot of domains That would be really interesting to get.

417
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:48,689
Speaker 0: just because the a lot of email is sent to those domains You know by people testing shit out.

418
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:52,240
Speaker 1: but the the person who runs do not reply.

419
00:29:52,420 --> 00:30:04,230
Speaker 0: comm is brilliant because instead of using this for blackmail or Nefarious purpose I would use if I had test calm I'll use it for nefarious purposes Logging into all sorts of people's test development servers and stealing all their code.

420
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:05,574
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

421
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:09,125
Speaker 1: but a lot of scary things get sent to do not reply.

422
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:09,546
Speaker 1: comm.

423
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:10,770
Speaker 1: government documents.

424
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,332
Speaker 1: There's.

425
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:15,630
Speaker 1: people are saying that actually some of the WikiLeaks things actually come out from this side.

426
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,200
Speaker 1: No, what this guy is like that?

427
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,614
Speaker 0: if that guy, you know, it seems like he's a smart guy I would not be.

428
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,980
Speaker 0: it would be very likely that if he finds interesting things He would send them to WikiLeaks.

429
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:32,350
Speaker 1: quote from slashdot Apparently everyone from major US banks to the TSA to contractors in Iraq.

430
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:40,692
Speaker 1: Use some variation of this address in there from fields for all the emails sent out and all the bounced emails go to this, dude Mm-hmm.

431
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:47,855
Speaker 1: So he pretty much stopped trying to tell people that happens and now he just posts the interesting ones Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:49,462
Speaker 1: So this is my thing of the day.

433
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:54,783
Speaker 1: My head is off to you, sir And if the government ever shuts you down, it'll be a sad day.

434
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:56,630
Speaker 0: He's not doing anything illegal.

435
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:58,568
Speaker 0: I don't think he's doing anything legal at all.

436
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:04,377
Speaker 0: I don't think someone sent him an email to his domain Even if that was by accident.

437
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:12,010
Speaker 0: if someone sends me something in the mail with my name on it Even if they you know wrote it wrong, you know, maybe they put the wrong thing in the wrong envelope.

438
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,600
Speaker 0: It's mine tough shit.

439
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,190
Speaker 0: That's yeah, that's the way the law is.

440
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:19,746
Speaker 1: That's the law with physical mail and if it isn't it should be that way with email.

441
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:20,590
Speaker 1: I believe it is.

442
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:27,570
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer, you know I know but lawyers are always trying to apply the physical world rules to the to the internet and it usually doesn't work.

443
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,277
Speaker 0: This case it works perfectly.

444
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:35,302
Speaker 1: you ever get an email where at the end someone has this long boilerplate Like if this message was not intended for you, you must delete it.

445
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,330
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to forward this message to anyone.

446
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:37,714
Speaker 1: That's all.

447
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,311
Speaker 0: that's complete bullshit Cuz.

448
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:39,693
Speaker 0: I didn't agree.

449
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:43,430
Speaker 0: I didn't sign anything to agree to that contract and there's no law backing that up

450
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:53,950
Speaker 1: because it's the same thing that happens with cease and desist orders where someone will Send a cease and desist and in the cease and desist They'll didn't say that it's illegal for you to post or in any way show anyone the cease and desist.

451
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like stuff if you get a piece of paper.

452
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,569
Speaker 0: It's like it says top secret eyes only on it.

453
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:02,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, that means it's not illegal for you to look at it.

454
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:05,535
Speaker 0: It's just illegal if you you know, like Complicated.

455
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:06,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not lawyers.

456
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:10,650
Speaker 1: I'll say this if anyone ever threatens you with something like that call a lawyer.

457
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,729
Speaker 1: The lawyer will probably be able to point out that you don't have to do half of what they're.

458
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,290
Speaker 0: well I wouldn't call a lawyer right away cuz that costs money.

459
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,298
Speaker 0: What I would do is I would first call the bluff.

460
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,232
Speaker 0: then if they you know, well first blood, you know You're not bluffing but you know be like All right Make me.

461
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:31,766
Speaker 0: and then if they try to make you then called lawyer because odds are if you just put the slightest bit of resistance They'll just go away and won't come back.

462
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,615
Speaker 1: But uh, yeah.

463
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:34,218
Speaker 0: All right.

464
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,343
Speaker 0: I got a thing of the day here.

465
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,388
Speaker 0: Oh, do you?

466
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:40,930
Speaker 0: yeah Well, you know when you're web browsing, I mean, I know personally at work, right?

467
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:47,136
Speaker 0: Multiple virtual desktops, right and I got a lot of windows open and I basically have a Firefox window But I'm like every window.

468
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,125
Speaker 0: cuz I'm developing web applications.

469
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:56,125
Speaker 0: I'm making websites I'm visiting websites to read things but some websites like good my gmail and stuff.

470
00:32:56,166 --> 00:33:22,310
Speaker 0: I just have open all the time and You know, it's sort of annoying because I sort of use my gmail because I mean it is an application like a web application but since it's also a website I Have it open in Firefox like a website and it sort of doesn't mix in with it's like, you know You have the tabs within Firefox to switch sites But then I also have the virtual desktops and the taskbar in my operating system to switch applications.

471
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:34,890
Speaker 0: So having some of my applications because they happen to be websites in Firefox It's sort of like this dual task switching system that you know, like I'm used to it and it's fine, but it's not.

472
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:42,949
Speaker 0: It's not correct in a Semantic sort of way if I guess that's the best word I have.

473
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:48,025
Speaker 0: So Mozilla if you go to their lab site, they're actually working on this thing.

474
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:54,739
Speaker 0: That looks really cool called Mozilla prism Mozilla prism and Mozilla prism.

475
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:02,270
Speaker 0: basically what it does is you can take any web Site that is an application and turn it into an application.

476
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:10,340
Speaker 0: So for example, I could take mail.google.com, which is Gmail and say hey, yeah Mozilla prism see mail.google.com.

477
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,650
Speaker 0: turn that into an application called Gmail.

478
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:16,466
Speaker 0: It'll make a desktop icon called Gmail with an icon.

479
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,268
Speaker 0: I can click on it.

480
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,150
Speaker 0: It'll open up Gmail in its own window as if it were a standalone application.

481
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:31,409
Speaker 0: I can switch to that application using my standard operating system switching stuff But it doesn't have back or forward or location buttons or anything.

482
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:45,543
Speaker 0: It's just there like, you know an application is and you know, well, I don't think this is like, you know Something you're gonna be replacing your Firefox with because you still need your Firefox for going to the web sites For web applications, especially ones that you keep open a lot.

483
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,090
Speaker 0: I think this is pretty cool.

484
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,356
Speaker 0: I definitely think there's there's something to this here.

485
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:54,370
Speaker 0: I mean because really it's like, you know, Gmail is an email application.

486
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,330
Speaker 0: Why should it be treated in the GUI in the interface any different from you say outlook?

487
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:08,437
Speaker 0: You know just because it happens to be a web application and this sort of breaks that barrier and turns web applications into real Applications in your user interface.

488
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:15,866
Speaker 0: I think that's the way to go and you can actually download this and try this out Which I if you this sounds like something you like go for it.

489
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,790
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

490
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:17,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it.

491
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:28,318
Speaker 1: but anyway to get on to our main bit here as you know Scott and I are kind of Alternating between his field of expertise in my field of expertise, you know IT and CS and it's my turn this week.

492
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,807
Speaker 1: I had a kind of long rambling.

493
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:31,710
Speaker 1: I was tired.

494
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:40,409
Speaker 1: I wanted to eat overview of what IT was and We realized pretty much right away that in order to actually talk about IT I have to break it down into all these tiny little pieces and talk about them.

495
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:40,731
Speaker 1: Yeah,

496
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:57,417
Speaker 0: I sort of realized after last my last week's episode just kind of Blair You know, it's like on the one hand I want to break stuff up in the way that I know it But on the other hand if I break it up that way a lot of the episodes are gonna be uninteresting or Boring or unhelpful.

497
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:12,110
Speaker 0: So as we start out to find a balance between talking about something that people want to know and want to hear and entertaining but also the you know, the Foundation information that sort of we feel needs to be known even if people don't want to know it and it's tough.

498
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:28,948
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna start tonight by talking about one very important piece of IT and luckily It's something that you can probably all relate to because pretty much that the part the IT that the majority of human beings will ever directly interact with is the help desk

499
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,418
Speaker 0: The

500
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,041
Speaker 1: help desk.

501
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:36,650
Speaker 1: now there are a lot of ways to define help desk But I'm gonna use a somewhat broad definition that I think serves my purposes very well.

502
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:44,715
Speaker 1: helpdesk is the interface between IT professionals and IT services and End users.

503
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,550
Speaker 1: now end user does not mean non-technical user.

504
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,315
Speaker 1: I mean Here's two examples of a helpdesk.

505
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:54,994
Speaker 1: one you work at your job and you use the computer and you print to a printer and the Printer stops working.

506
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:59,089
Speaker 1: you call the helpdesk and say hey the printers broken and someone comes and fix it.

507
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:06,489
Speaker 1: so or let's say you work for a major ISP and One of your ds3 circuits goes down.

508
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:15,196
Speaker 1: So you call the helpdesk at Verizon or XO or whoever and say hey My ds3 is down fix it you assholes Mm-hmm.

509
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:16,429
Speaker 0: So, you know, what if?

510
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:17,773
Speaker 0: How about?

511
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:21,610
Speaker 0: the ones were like I buy a Dell and the Dell doesn't work and I got is that a help desk?

512
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,140
Speaker 0: Does that count or is that like the customer service line?

513
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,330
Speaker 0: is that there's a tech support different than out desk?

514
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:34,030
Speaker 1: It's tricky actually that the customer support and help desk are interrelated in a lot of companies But they don't necessarily have to be interrelated.

515
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:46,070
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna take a kind of I'm gonna make up an example company that happens to provide Every possible kind of service in the world and talk about all the different aspects of their help desk and/or customer support.

516
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:48,329
Speaker 1: All right, that's pretty much the easiest way to go about it.

517
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:55,669
Speaker 1: I want to preface this by saying that this does not represent any Particular company that I may or may not have worked at in any way as you see here.

518
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:57,454
Speaker 1: Actually, it really doesn't.

519
00:37:57,534 --> 00:37:59,040
Speaker 0: I'm just I'm saying as you see.

520
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,662
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.

521
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:01,770
Speaker 1: I don't have to say that just because of the.

522
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:05,629
Speaker 1: There's also a bunch of other organizations.

523
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:09,070
Speaker 1: Oh God you know.

524
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,469
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm gonna try to get permission from my company to do a show on how the stupid financial stock markets and everything work.

525
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:20,030
Speaker 1: It's actually really fascinating, but I gotta actually ask permission before I could talk about it in any depth.

526
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,669
Speaker 0: It's a lot like the grocery market only with a lot more money and a lot less food.

527
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:26,830
Speaker 1: But anyway.

528
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,326
Speaker 1: So you got a company and you've got employees who do the business to the core business.

529
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:40,550
Speaker 1: because remember every every company Every profitable company at least I'm not gonna ignore cases like I don't know SEO where there was no core business.

530
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,897
Speaker 1: But in most companies, there's a core business.

531
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,545
Speaker 1: the thing the company does the thing.

532
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,475
Speaker 1: the company makes its money with Selling snake oil.

533
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:57,414
Speaker 1: the reason the company exists like IBM has a lot of them but like Joey Jojo's tomato stand his core business is Tomatoes.

534
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,870
Speaker 1: he makes his money selling tomatoes.

535
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:05,710
Speaker 1: Everything else in his business is nothing more than supporting the business of selling tomatoes.

536
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, he has a cash register, but that's really just there to help him sell tomatoes.

537
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:12,650
Speaker 0: He has a truck but that's really just there to help him move tomatoes.

538
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:19,250
Speaker 1: He has his data center and his Oracle database and his 4ds threes and that's just to help him count how many tomatoes he sold.

539
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:22,786
Speaker 1: You do you or do you not deny that this shit be banging.

540
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:23,510
Speaker 0: this should be banging.

541
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:29,190
Speaker 1: But you really have to understand like in any company, what is the core business?

542
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:36,210
Speaker 1: And this is something that a lot of computer professionals and technology professionals kind of lose sight of especially in smaller companies.

543
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:47,809
Speaker 1: It's very easy when you're the tech guy in a company to feel like you are the company and know in the end The core business is the company and you exist solely to make sure that its core business keeps going.

544
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:53,675
Speaker 1: So different aspects of a helpdesk, let's start on the very broadest level What Scott was talking about.

545
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,910
Speaker 1: there is of course customer support which may or may not be IT and may or may not be help desk.

546
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,010
Speaker 1: Let's call this the tier one of help desk or tier one of support.

547
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:09,925
Speaker 1: These are typically be completely non technical people who deal with core business problems.

548
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,990
Speaker 1: a customer has a problem.

549
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:17,010
Speaker 1: They are calling your core business because they have a problem and you need to resolve it.

550
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,029
Speaker 1: So they will continue to send you money in return for goods and services.

551
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:39,029
Speaker 1: So usually what you have are people who are either Minimum wage grunts or if your company is actually high class or high scale or for whatever reason You might actually have like public relations or consumer relations professionals But regardless there is some sort of interface between the customer and the company.

552
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,936
Speaker 0: So that should be so.

553
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:47,930
Speaker 0: really someone calling Dell with a problem with their computer Isn't really sort of an IT help desk situation?

554
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,950
Speaker 0: It's the same as if they were calling Joe's tomato stand with a problem about tomatoes.

555
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:59,434
Speaker 1: Yes, but it can become an IT or a help desk situation because of something a concept called Escalation.

556
00:40:59,474 --> 00:40:59,776
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

557
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,591
Speaker 1: Now, so let's say we've got this tier one, you know Someone?

558
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:07,610
Speaker 1: I'm Joey Jojo's tomato stand and a customer calls and they've got a problem.

559
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:08,889
Speaker 1: I don't know what their problem is.

560
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,934
Speaker 1: So I have a generic number.

561
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:16,560
Speaker 1: any customer can call and the customer says I tried to buy Tomatoes and I was unable to do so.

562
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:16,640
Speaker 1: Hmm.

563
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,190
Speaker 1: Well, how did you try to buy them?

564
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,067
Speaker 0: They collect information and once they collect I put some money in Joe's pocket, but he didn't give me any tomatoes.

565
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:28,809
Speaker 1: that asshole I screamed at my computer and tomatoes didn't come out.

566
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,205
Speaker 0: You have to wait for them to show up in the mail.

567
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:36,490
Speaker 0: that man You're not responsible for mushiness.

568
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:40,603
Speaker 1: So this customer support person will follow up some rules.

569
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:46,283
Speaker 1: is there some sort of way they have to determine Where the problem is and they may solve the problem on their own.

570
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,070
Speaker 1: They might say oh, well, do you have an account?

571
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:52,150
Speaker 1: Blah blah blah, but the problem might be a technological problem.

572
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:55,589
Speaker 1: And if it is then it gets referred to the help desk.

573
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:59,950
Speaker 1: Now the help desk or IT is still a very multifaceted thing.

574
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:07,721
Speaker 1: But the way most help desks would be set up is that now if it's an IT problem They would escalate it to either IT, but we'll just call it tier two.

575
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,190
Speaker 1: We're gonna ignore everything that isn't an IT problem.

576
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:15,463
Speaker 1: So say the problem was the customer Couldn't make the order because they could like.

577
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,730
Speaker 1: the website wouldn't work for them.

578
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,308
Speaker 1: The customer support person isn't going to know anything about that.

579
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:21,759
Speaker 1: So they escalate it to the tier two.

580
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:24,489
Speaker 1: support the lowest level of IT support.

581
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:28,390
Speaker 1: now If a company has a core business that is technology.

582
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:31,478
Speaker 1: That level is usually the first level you reach.

583
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:36,150
Speaker 1: like if you call Comcast my cables out you pretty much reach this level immediately.

584
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,850
Speaker 0: Well, the the the first level if you call Comcast would usually be there's a problem with your bill.

585
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,990
Speaker 1: There's a problem, you know, usually the first level is press one if you have a billing problem.

586
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,639
Speaker 1: Well, yes to to report a service.

587
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be the tier one support.

588
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:51,838
Speaker 1: You can automate tier one support in most cases.

589
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,844
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but we're gonna skip over that.

590
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:56,161
Speaker 1: I could do a Thursday show on that business Mm-hmm.

591
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:17,400
Speaker 1: so these people are kind of like the lowest level of support for external customers and they will try to get enough information to Determine if one is a problem they can solve or two if they need to escalate it either further up the chain or sideways into different components or aspects of your IT help desk infrastructure or Organization depending on how complex you are.

592
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:19,990
Speaker 1: So say you call and he says can't get to the website.

593
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:26,634
Speaker 1: So they escalate to tier two the IT help desk and they say that you type in the URL and the guy says yeah What'd you type in?

594
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:27,397
Speaker 1: I typed in this.

595
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,663
Speaker 1: All right, looks like it's working.

596
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:33,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get some SSL error SSL error you say and then you're looking.

597
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,782
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

598
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:36,350
Speaker 1: No one's been able to get to our website for a while.

599
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:45,590
Speaker 1: So then you escalate to the tier three or the developers or the support, you know some sort of specialized or higher-level group.

600
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:51,430
Speaker 1: Because like we got a friend who works a help desk and there's different levels and different jobs.

601
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:57,369
Speaker 1: So if I'm a mot like an early entry-level Lowly paid like I just got my foot in the door.

602
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:07,427
Speaker 1: I answer the calls from stupid people and or I answer the calls that are simple and if it's a problem that's complex I forward it up to the higher paid people who are more specialized.

603
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:13,529
Speaker 1: because you if you have someone who is being paid a lot their time is worth X dollars per hour.

604
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:23,610
Speaker 1: if They have to answer every call that gets sent into a help desk no matter how easy It'll probably answer a lot of them really quickly and really easily and really awesomely.

605
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:27,663
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's not worth the money it costs to keep them around.

606
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,750
Speaker 1: They should be doing better things for your business.

607
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean a person with those skills could be doing other things that make mad monies.

608
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:34,693
Speaker 0: They're not.

609
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:39,290
Speaker 0: you know, your business isn't that much better because they answered a bunch of phone calls.

610
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:57,886
Speaker 1: So theoretically you hire people who can do the blood just what is required at the lower levels and pay them less Because someone who's paid $20 an hour spending four hours working on a problem is a lot cheaper than making the person who's paid $120 an hour even read that email.

611
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:08,210
Speaker 1: Yep Now don't read from this that low-level tech people are stupid because actually Most low-level tech people that you call are fully qualified to do a lot more.

612
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:16,627
Speaker 1: They just for various reasons are because of the IT industry are working at that lower level And they just don't have access to the actual decision-making thing.

613
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,230
Speaker 1: That's a whole other.

614
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that said that's a completely separate issue.

615
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,143
Speaker 0: I mean look at all the people with like college degrees working you like Home Depot.

616
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:23,525
Speaker 0: It's like.

617
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:24,770
Speaker 0: that's that issue.

618
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,628
Speaker 1: I think yeah, but theoretically in a nutshell.

619
00:45:27,668 --> 00:45:30,998
Speaker 1: now What you do is an IT helpdesk.

620
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:44,750
Speaker 1: goal is to get a customer who has a problem Figure out at what level that problem needs to be solved Direct it to the level where it can be solved that person solves it and then direct the solution back to the customer.

621
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,481
Speaker 1: Now that's for external customers.

622
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,570
Speaker 1: But why would it be any different for an internal customer?

623
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:59,230
Speaker 1: It's not if I and it isn't if I've got a prod work for Joey Jojo's shack and I Manage the database server that keeps track of all of his multinational tomato orders.

624
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:07,470
Speaker 1: So if I have a problem with my PC, all right, I'm a tech professional I work with the database server, but my job is the database server.

625
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:11,382
Speaker 1: I'm being paid eight thousand dollars a minute to make that database server go.

626
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,968
Speaker 1: if my computer blue screens one day And I can't make it boot?

627
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:22,810
Speaker 1: What's more worthwhile for me to spend my eight thousand dollar a minute time going to Microsoft's website and?

628
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,837
Speaker 0: Reinstalling windows, I mean cuz.

629
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:25,881
Speaker 0: he knows how to do that.

630
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:28,410
Speaker 0: He said, you know, he knows so much about computers.

631
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,695
Speaker 0: He's a database manager.

632
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:33,128
Speaker 0: He could fix his own computer, but that's not his job.

633
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,144
Speaker 1: like Scott Scott could fix his own computer at his company.

634
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:38,859
Speaker 0: Sometimes I do Sometimes I don't.

635
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,852
Speaker 0: sometimes I say you fix it It's your job.

636
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:45,790
Speaker 1: now the scale and scope of these operations really depends on how big your company is.

637
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,604
Speaker 1: If you only have four employees like us now, then people can fix their own stuff.

638
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:52,048
Speaker 1: or maybe you have one IT guy.

639
00:46:52,671 --> 00:47:00,787
Speaker 1: But if you've got a hundred employees It's probably worth your while to have some sort of dedicated help desk staff to deal with all these problems.

640
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:06,490
Speaker 1: now even though Help desk is a cost center in that halt the help desk will never make money.

641
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,524
Speaker 1: In fact help desk can only cost money.

642
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:10,729
Speaker 1: it can never make money.

643
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:28,950
Speaker 1: But what it can do is reduce operating costs and give you a net Like benefit as in it technically cost you twenty thousand dollars a year to maintain this help desk But in the end it saved you $40,000 worth of people who are more important time resolving simple issues.

644
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz think about this fixing up a broken computer a broken Windows computer pretty easy.

645
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,401
Speaker 0: Someone who's not that awesome can probably take care of it.

646
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:39,510
Speaker 0: They can be awesome, but they don't to be that awesome.

647
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:43,272
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's say you have a hundred awesome Programmers.

648
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:45,158
Speaker 0: one of their computers breaks.

649
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,650
Speaker 0: Do you want them to fix the computer or do you want the not?

650
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,630
Speaker 0: Not as awesome guy to fix the computer you just have one spare computer.

651
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:59,130
Speaker 0: They programmers can all be programming all the time and one guy goes around making sure all the computers work all the time.

652
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:00,946
Speaker 0: You get a lot more programming done now.

653
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:02,929
Speaker 1: I've already gone on a little long.

654
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,901
Speaker 1: Yep Cuz I don't want to go into a lot more detail.

655
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:06,410
Speaker 1: cuz I think you've got the gist of it now.

656
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:13,049
Speaker 1: What a help desk is what it should do But I want to give you a little bit of nuts and bolts as to how help desk should be set up.

657
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,553
Speaker 1: now I could.

658
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:20,930
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do whole shows in the future on How to actually set up a help desk and the differences like network operations and production support.

659
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,432
Speaker 0: That's it.

660
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:31,059
Speaker 0: If you ever go and you see like, you know tech people calling up because they have a problem They always say give me the knock Operation Center, that's what they're all grumpy.

661
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:31,742
Speaker 0: Give me the knock.

662
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:33,230
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk to you morons.

663
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:41,202
Speaker 1: Yeah And those are like the places that have the big screen with like the picture of the network and it's all green and red And then alerts are coming in and all the cool stuff.

664
00:48:41,242 --> 00:48:42,589
Speaker 0: They really exist those places.

665
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:43,171
Speaker 1: Yes I have.

666
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:50,098
Speaker 1: actually every company I've worked for has had one and in fact now I kind of sit in one Mmm, and actually IBM's was the coolest.

667
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:56,317
Speaker 1: but it was the coolest because it was so old school Looked like some Apollo action.

668
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:57,724
Speaker 1: No, it looked like I don't know.

669
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:59,070
Speaker 1: It looked like a cold war scene.

670
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:02,522
Speaker 1: It felt like I could launch nuclear missiles from that place.

671
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,185
Speaker 1: war games.

672
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:04,390
Speaker 1: It was also fortified.

673
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,444
Speaker 1: I don't think I could express to you how cool it was to be in the knock at.

674
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:08,630
Speaker 0: IBM should take a picture.

675
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,806
Speaker 1: I got some pictures, but I can't legally show them to anyone.

676
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:12,389
Speaker 0: That's not cool.

677
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:16,625
Speaker 0: If I was IBM, I'd want to show it off like check out our cool cold war.

678
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,635
Speaker 1: not know because you'd all go Wow, that's cool.

679
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,181
Speaker 1: But IT people would go Wow Yeah.

680
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:57,450
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't want to make fun of IBM too much but My advice to anyone who is managing a help desk or is at a company where there is a help desk or anything even a small company pretty much you want to formalize the processes of a help desk as Early as possible and in fact in general you want to err on the side of overkill because the more informal your processes Are the more completely fucked you are if your organization ever gets bigger or if anyone ever gets fired or leaves or retires?

681
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:06,005
Speaker 1: It might seem onerous to have like this formal ticketing system where like say at geek nights Like Scott has a problem with an episode.

682
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:06,729
Speaker 1: that sounds funny.

683
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:16,550
Speaker 1: so he goes to the thing and he makes a ticket with a number and he assigns it to me and I open that ticket and I resolve it and I log my solution and then maybe I can't fix it because it's a Libsyn problem.

684
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:25,890
Speaker 1: So I escalated to Libsyn and I give them a ticket number and they come back to me with that ticket number once they've solved It and then I de-escalate back down to Scott and he approves my solution.

685
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:32,210
Speaker 1: That might seem like a lot of red tape But you know what if you don't set up at least basic structures like that early on?

686
00:50:32,651 --> 00:50:35,018
Speaker 1: You're so screwed if you ever get bigger like.

687
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:46,150
Speaker 1: I can't even express to you how many IT companies that are very large have Inadequate business structures for their help disk and as a result spend so much money trying to rectify that.

688
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,750
Speaker 1: I could do a whole show about it and I probably will.

689
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:56,169
Speaker 0: Yeah It's easy to set up a system when there's only a few people and that's usually why no one sets up a system because you only have a few people.

690
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,114
Speaker 0: what do You need a system for?

691
00:50:57,275 --> 00:51:00,110
Speaker 0: you can just talk and that it works with only a few people.

692
00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:02,970
Speaker 0: But it's easy to set up a system with a few people.

693
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,170
Speaker 0: It's hard to set up a system with a lot of people and if you have a lot of people you need a system.

694
