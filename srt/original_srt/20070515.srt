1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,668
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 15th.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:12,812
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:16,663
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights Tonight.

4
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:21,219
Speaker 1: we share many anecdotes of the old game classic battle tech.

5
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:39,672
Speaker 0: Let's do this Warm today warm yesterday Wilma today, I'm thinking that tonight after the show I'm gonna put my air conditioner in my window just to uh anticipate all the coming thunderstorms and hot weather We're gonna get.

6
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:44,910
Speaker 1: I might put it in the window, but I might not put it in the window see.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:58,350
Speaker 0: I'm also thinking if I put it in the window I can put a bunch of this crap That's in my room in the way because I tore my room apart in Anticipation of building my new computer and my room is now staying torn apart until the RMA'd motherboard comes back.

8
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,983
Speaker 0: Uh-huh luckily Team Fortress 2 hasn't come out yet.

9
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:04,903
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be For a long time.

10
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,477
Speaker 1: I swear to God worry about it.

11
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,354
Speaker 0: if my computer is not built by the time Team Fortress 2 comes out Just kill yourself.

12
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:17,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it seems like there's a possibility that my motherboard was fine.

13
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:21,170
Speaker 0: And yet my power supply was also perfectly fine.

14
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:30,029
Speaker 0: And even though the power supply is perfectly as far as the specs are concerned compatible with my motherboard There's a chance that they're due to a magic thing that I'm not going to talk about tonight.

15
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:38,280
Speaker 1: Incompatible regardless, this is why the current state of motherboard Power supply matching is completely inadequate.

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:46,080
Speaker 1: people need to know when they buy parts for a computer that yes Absolutely yes, this power supply is going to work with that motherboard.

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:56,349
Speaker 1: there needs to be no doubt in the mind of the purchaser whatsoever And the manufacturers and the retailers are not doing enough to make sure that this is the case.

18
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:57,918
Speaker 0: Avid did in a way.

19
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,990
Speaker 0: They did test like nine different power supplies.

20
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, these particular nine will work just fine.

21
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,896
Speaker 0: Yeah actually the problem is that wouldn't?

22
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:12,950
Speaker 0: I mean that wouldn't be a big deal if that were it cuz I could look at that list see the Specs of them and buy a power supply that meets or exceeds all of those specs.

23
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:17,685
Speaker 0: It turns out there are specs that are not documented on any power not to mention the lots of stats.

24
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:18,869
Speaker 1: are you know?

25
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,214
Speaker 1: It's faked?

26
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,669
Speaker 1: well quite what is.

27
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,727
Speaker 0: Wattage is really the only one that's faked and it's like a lot of power supplies like 700 watts.

28
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:40,621
Speaker 1: and that means yes This can put out 700 watts max But really if you make it put out 700 watts all the time it'll explode you know whereas there might be another one that says 500 watts and it can put out a steady 500 watts.

29
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:51,021
Speaker 0: there is an easy way around that and that is to look at the Mean time before failure because it generally is the case that the power supplies that cannot sustain their maximum output have much lower MTBF.

30
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:54,338
Speaker 0: yep Unless they lie about it's still far too difficult.

31
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:58,649
Speaker 1: and actually I would suggest that if you are someone like Newegg what you should do?

32
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:04,350
Speaker 1: Obviously if someone puts in an order for a power supply and a motherboard they're baking a computer.

33
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,133
Speaker 1: It's obvious.

34
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:11,318
Speaker 1: try and see if it works and then on the webs the Newegg website You know they have a bunch of power supplies and motherboards.

35
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,361
Speaker 1: Just try them out.

36
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,270
Speaker 0: You know why don't we try a method?

37
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:30,204
Speaker 0: Whereby you automatically detect if someone is buying multiple components that could be considered to be a computer and then Follow up by some sort of automated email system to find out if said computer actually worked Thereby creating a database of such information to be used for business purposes yeah,

38
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:31,970
Speaker 1: and then also Newegg themselves.

39
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,870
Speaker 1: They have so many power supplies and motherboards they could have one guy just sit there.

40
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,794
Speaker 1: I mean how many.

41
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:45,284
Speaker 1: do you think I could test if I just had a motherboard with a chip in it and A power supply and then I would test the power supply and unplug it.

42
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:47,030
Speaker 1: try another one unplug it try another one.

43
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,460
Speaker 1: How many you think I could test in a day?

44
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:49,346
Speaker 1: all of them?

45
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:49,869
Speaker 1: pretty much?

46
00:03:50,791 --> 00:04:04,184
Speaker 1: So it wouldn't be too hard for them to just have a guy sit there one guy and test a whole bunch of combinations And within a few weeks they'd have a nice little database and when people went to buy motherboards It would be able to recommend power supplies to them.

47
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,009
Speaker 1: that would actually work.

48
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:14,621
Speaker 0: But regardless my brand-new PC gaming machine, which I'm actually really getting kind of excited about playing PC games again is Sitting here open and empty.

49
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:22,710
Speaker 0: I installed every component I could which consisted of the hard drives and the other drives awesome, and now it's sitting there open crying.

50
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:25,327
Speaker 0: I covered it in something, so I won't get dust down it.

51
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,101
Speaker 1: well I've been making a. I got a lot of stuff to do lately you know.

52
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:35,610
Speaker 0: I think with all these three conventions in July God yeah, we'll talk tomorrow about the developments in the convention circuit.

53
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,890
Speaker 1: I'm starting to feel like a professional here, and then we've got new convention in December, and I got a lot of shit going on.

54
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,290
Speaker 1: I'm glad I skipped that door cut and I glad you're skipping that amazement.

55
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,050
Speaker 0: But yeah the thing is I really wanted to go to head amazement.

56
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,733
Speaker 0: I just can't.

57
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,783
Speaker 1: now just can't but regardless.

58
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:51,847
Speaker 1: I got a lot of stuff.

59
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:52,390
Speaker 1: I need to do.

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,796
Speaker 1: I'm trying to fix the forums.

61
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:56,650
Speaker 1: I'm trying to do all this stuff at once and I got no time.

62
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, and meanwhile.

63
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:02,954
Speaker 1: I've got a Pokemon sitting here, and well these Pokemon They need taking care of.

64
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:06,970
Speaker 1: and how can I take care of the Pokemon while also taking care of all this other business that?

65
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,539
Speaker 1: I need to do.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,773
Speaker 1: well It's not easy.

67
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:12,190
Speaker 0: wouldn't your answer be to rush through the game without actually taking care of your pro?

68
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,173
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing.

69
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:17,810
Speaker 1: I've basically been running from gym to gym to gym only fighting the trainers.

70
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:27,930
Speaker 1: I absolutely have to fight running away from all the wild Pokemon unless they're new in which case I just throw a quick ball at him and catch them, and I'm just trying to run to the end of the game.

71
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:41,590
Speaker 1: And as it is I'm about to finally take care of those team galactic fools And then go get the last badge and then beat the elite four and then I'm done with this game Until I'm basically after that I'm gonna get six Pokemon that I want to be my personal Pokemon.

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,450
Speaker 1: I'm gonna train them up to be strong enough for battling with other people and that's gonna be it.

73
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,554
Speaker 1: I'll be done with the Pokemon.

74
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:54,704
Speaker 0: see I've actually been spending a lot of time walking around Planting berries and collecting berries and planting more berries.

75
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,029
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I gave up on that.

76
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,038
Speaker 1: now I just clear cut all the goddamn berries.

77
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:06,030
Speaker 0: well see the thing is I clear cut them all and then I whenever I'm gonna be In an area for a while like if it's an area where I got a breakthrough a bunch of trainers I'm gonna have to keep going back to heal or something.

78
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:13,290
Speaker 0: I'll plant a bunch of berries and tend to those I'll pick him at the end of my business cuz it's trivial effort, and I got three or four berries out of it.

79
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:14,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, see the thing is.

80
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:27,050
Speaker 1: what I've been doing though is I fly to the next area I have to go to and then I just burn through in one go with a whole pile of items So I don't have to go back you know and if sometimes like they'll even be a place to heal along the way.

81
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,890
Speaker 1: You know I feel kind of stupid.

82
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:34,762
Speaker 1: You know sometimes you'll be walking around you see a bed right and you go in the bed And you'll think that this bed can help you heal, but it doesn't.

83
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,430
Speaker 1: you try to push a and it doesn't help you heal.

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found out it does.

85
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,202
Speaker 1: It's just kind of obtuse.

86
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,470
Speaker 1: if you walk into a bed, right?

87
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,059
Speaker 1: It looks like you're laying down on your side because you're facing sideways So you push a and nothing happens.

88
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,869
Speaker 1: if you push down while you're in a bed So that you're laying on your back, and then push a you can heal, huh?

89
00:06:54,311 --> 00:07:01,105
Speaker 0: I never thought of that because I've recently found a house empty Near a mountain, and I thought I can heal here, and then I realized oh, I can't.

90
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:01,988
Speaker 0: oh, I guess I can.

91
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,398
Speaker 1: yep It's kind of.

92
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:04,670
Speaker 1: they should have made that more obvious.

93
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,390
Speaker 1: They should have just said if you're in a bed push a why do I have to push down?

94
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:15,902
Speaker 0: That's so uh press a press a. yeah anyway anyway in the non Pokemon news Pokemon there's too much Pokemon go.

95
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:16,727
Speaker 1: is there such a thing?

96
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:24,210
Speaker 0: well There is a rumor and I like how the article at IGN even says rumor colon Nintendo power shutting down.

97
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:25,836
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not so bad.

98
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,568
Speaker 1: I mean we were just ranted last week about magazines.

99
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:28,870
Speaker 1: suck.

100
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:38,832
Speaker 0: Well the thing is when I was a kid I subscribed to Nintendo power from issue one on and in fact I subscribed until well after issue 200.

101
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:45,090
Speaker 0: And then I kind of stopped caring about console gaming and my brother continued the subscription until relatively recently.

102
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,918
Speaker 0: So my whole life my whole Nintendo life.

103
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:58,408
Speaker 0: I had Nintendo power, and I actually for most of that time Really enjoyed Nintendo power because it offered a lot that really wasn't available anywhere else back then.

104
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:00,850
Speaker 1: yep I mean I didn't get Nintendo power.

105
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:08,882
Speaker 1: I got game pro, and I was like sixth grade, and I kept getting it until like a few years ago Maybe like 2005. ish do that.

106
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:13,596
Speaker 1: Maybe the beginning of 2006 something I don't remember But I just gave them all away.

107
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:18,750
Speaker 0: finally a few months ago to that guy in the back alley behind the post office.

108
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,635
Speaker 1: It's not a back alley.

109
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,305
Speaker 1: It's a parking lot behind the post office.

110
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:25,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, he was some art teacher or whatever and I was some art teacher named at a busy.

111
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,710
Speaker 1: I was just glad to get rid of those things because they were taking up a bunch of space.

112
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,525
Speaker 0: They're useless, but Nintendo power And I realized the comparing it to other gaming magazines even back then.

113
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:39,850
Speaker 0: the strength was that What it provided was partly being able to live vicariously?

114
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,619
Speaker 0: Through games that you did not own and never played.

115
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,304
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, when I was a little kid.

116
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:52,410
Speaker 1: I would get like these Really shitty crappy strategy guide like it would be like multi strategy guides for like a whole bunch.

117
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,080
Speaker 0: You know the red one the yellow one in the blue one those ones.

118
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got them all.

119
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,850
Speaker 0: those are the worst books ever But I read them constant.

120
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 1: They're like kind of big and thin and with lots of color pick.

121
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,988
Speaker 0: they get hints like hit the enemies with the sword.

122
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:13,088
Speaker 1: yep Hey, I got those at the school book fair and Basically, I played double dragon - by reading a little strategy guide about it.

123
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:20,790
Speaker 0: Yeah Well the thing is a lot of times there'd be a Nintendo game that you wanted But your parents wouldn't buy it for you and the local blockbuster didn't have it to rent.

124
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:21,976
Speaker 0: So what did you do?

125
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,490
Speaker 0: you either found a friend who had it and stole it from him?

126
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,534
Speaker 1: Oh, that was a good plan.

127
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:26,439
Speaker 0: It was cuz.

128
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:33,945
Speaker 0: then after a week or two you say oh, yeah Here's that game that you lent me and by then they'd assume that they lent it to you and forgot They wouldn't conceive that you stole it.

129
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,235
Speaker 1: yep But

130
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:56,089
Speaker 0: if you couldn't get a hold of the game in Nintendo power partly because games are 2d back then and fairly straightforward There usually be maps of the entire game and all sorts of trivia and backstory and art and fun stuff And you could basically read through it and get a good 60 to 70 percent of the enjoyment the game would have given you Just by reading the Nintendo power.

131
00:09:56,652 --> 00:10:10,959
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is this became unnecessary over time because well people could get games And there were too many games, and there weren't that many good games You wanted to experience and the games that were so good you wanted to experience them you would play because they were that good And every other game who cared.

132
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:11,543
Speaker 0: also.

133
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:17,045
Speaker 0: Nintendo power Was really good at giving you information about games and actual strategy and tips.

134
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:23,939
Speaker 0: so back before game facts If you got stuck on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles That was really the only way to get your ass out of there.

135
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:34,234
Speaker 0: you can either read Nintendo power or as I did three times Right to Nintendo power and they would answer or try and try and try and try and try and try and try until you succeed Or fail.

136
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:41,688
Speaker 1: ask a friend to add Nintendo power Or I guess you could call the Nintendo hotline where you would have to pay money on the 900 number.

137
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,261
Speaker 1: I wonder if that still exists.

138
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:44,070
Speaker 1: We should try calling it.

139
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:44,752
Speaker 0: I don't know.

140
00:10:45,174 --> 00:11:10,110
Speaker 0: all I know is that his time went on and games especially once the n64 came out It seems like 3d games and also the type and complexity of games that were coming out Really made Nintendo power obsolete almost immediately because now it couldn't provide that vicarious experience because it couldn't just show you all of world 1 or Every item in the game so easily and instead it became just like every other trashy crap gaming magazine.

141
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:19,250
Speaker 0: Yep, also there was the fact that Nintendo power didn't actually review anything because if a game was in Nintendo power It was awesome as far as Nintendo power was concerned.

142
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:29,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing that actually was useful about Nintendo power up until the internet came around was the list in the back of coming Soon games that way because there was no other way to know.

143
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,170
Speaker 1: how else could you know what games are coming?

144
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,290
Speaker 0: Also, there was the great thing.

145
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,770
Speaker 0: It was pretty much and I know a lot of kids when I was growing up really cared about this.

146
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:51,710
Speaker 0: But in every Nintendo power issue There was a car that you could send back and he would say what your top five games were of all time From all the games they had listed or you could write in from all the systems that Nintendo had out And you could win some crazy prize.

147
00:11:52,053 --> 00:12:04,362
Speaker 0: So everyone filled it out and every month Nintendo power had kind of their billboard of the most popular games ever and I remember watching Mario 3 just sit at the top month after month for practically forever.

148
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,606
Speaker 1: What's all the ones all the 64 set up there?

149
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah all those.

150
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:12,510
Speaker 0: but it was always interesting to read that and that was one thing that I mean.

151
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,630
Speaker 0: I guess now I don't see anything like that anymore.

152
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,230
Speaker 0: I assume Nintendo power still does it but considering who would subscribe to Nintendo power nowadays?

153
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,294
Speaker 0: Pokemon Pokemon Pokemon Pokemon I really wouldn't trust that.

154
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:28,284
Speaker 0: cuz I really think back then it was an accurate measure because most people who played Nintendo games Read Nintendo power.

155
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,194
Speaker 1: I didn't Take that.

156
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you also owned the Heathen Sega.

157
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,081
Speaker 1: I was later.

158
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:42,530
Speaker 1: but the point is that Nintendo power at one time was pretty useful and awesome and it's outlived its usefulness.

159
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:53,540
Speaker 0: And if it is not a rumor and it goes away Good riddance, I guess I won't be sad pretty much once the antenna power went from the nice flat binding to the crappy staple binding.

160
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,624
Speaker 0: I was done with that game.

161
00:12:54,644 --> 00:13:00,876
Speaker 1: pro did the opposite went from the crappy staple binding to the flat binding and all the ones that I Had that were staple binding fell apart and they're gone.

162
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:05,372
Speaker 0: Yep I remember when Dragon magazine made the switch and that was pretty much the moment.

163
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:07,438
Speaker 0: I dropped my subscription to Dragon magazine.

164
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:17,059
Speaker 1: Haha Okay, so, you know and you're on Steam you go and you buy a game and then you download it And then anywhere you log in with your steam account You can download the game

165
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:23,964
Speaker 0: Which I didn't really care about when I first got steam and even back then partly because steam was kind of broken when it first Came out.

166
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,940
Speaker 0: I really just didn't care about that at all.

167
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:41,478
Speaker 0: But now that I'm building a new computer and I haven't so much just tried to boot windows in I don't know seven months And I haven't logged into steam in about a year and a half I'm really glad that I can just log into steam on a new computer and redownload all my games.

168
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,533
Speaker 1: Yep I don't have that much hard drive space dedicated to windows on my current computer So I can't even download all the games I own on Steam.

169
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,459
Speaker 1: I own a lot of steam games.

170
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,497
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary and I barely played them.

171
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:57,240
Speaker 1: but Yeah, so the PlayStation 3 online store works in a similar fashion.

172
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:12,763
Speaker 1: you have your credit card information in your account and then you can go on the PlayStation Store with your ps3 and Download games such as the brand new popular game calling all cars Which actually looks kind of fun and the flow game which Sony paid a lot of money to make PS3 game.

173
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:16,480
Speaker 1: Well, I played the flash version a long time ago, and I have no need to pay for it.

174
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:27,631
Speaker 1: But apparently what some kids are doing is they're doing something called quote sharing And see whatever anyone uses the word sharing in the modern era.

175
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,559
Speaker 0: It only means one thing and that is copyright infringement.

176
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,100
Speaker 1: Yes Well, this is actually sort of software license infringement.

177
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:51,234
Speaker 1: What they're doing is alright, I sit at my ps3 I buy a game such as flow I go to your house I sign in with some credit card information to my account or something and then I Download the game of your house, too.

178
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:56,660
Speaker 1: Now you could play but we only paid one time only paid one time.

179
00:14:57,202 --> 00:15:00,214
Speaker 1: Two people have the game three people have the game four people at the game.

180
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 0: I see what you did there.

181
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,924
Speaker 1: We only paid one time.

182
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,430
Speaker 0: how many times does this work?

183
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,758
Speaker 0: I have no idea but I read five.

184
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,180
Speaker 1: There are some drawbacks to this method.

185
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:16,620
Speaker 1: The first drawback is of course that the person that you are sharing the game with has your credit card information.

186
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,780
Speaker 1: They could buy shit with your money, huh?

187
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,132
Speaker 1: So you got to trust them pretty hardcore to share a game with them.

188
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,823
Speaker 0: Honestly, I trust pretty much everyone I know.

189
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:39,080
Speaker 1: and the other problem is that you may Inadvertently share-er the person who originally bought the game on the original ps3 may inadvertently Lose their rights to the game if they need to like erase their ps3 or something like that.

190
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Speaker 0: So now this is where it's interesting because in this case You can't claim any ulterior motive because you were basically putting yourself at the mercy of both fate and your friends.

191
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:55,040
Speaker 0: This is nothing more as far as these punk kids are concerned than being a really good friend.

192
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,759
Speaker 1: Yep, and well some people will get free games.

193
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:07,299
Speaker 1: I can see at least one person buying a bunch of games with someone else's money And I can see some people just getting free games and being trustworthy and having a good time.

194
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:16,639
Speaker 1: But yeah, Sony's a bit pissed and some other people are like, hey, that's not cool, but they're doing it and That's cool.

195
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:28,099
Speaker 0: I think there's more details in the article that I didn't read but I don't think you read it either and I don't think it Matters because I don't think anyone who listens to our show has a PlayStation 3, uh, I think Dave Riley has a ps3.

196
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, he kept saying he was gonna buy one and I haven't listened to any podcast.

197
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:32,979
Speaker 1: He has one.

198
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:38,339
Speaker 0: He calls it the PS triple, you know, I wish him the best with that.

199
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:41,619
Speaker 0: But I can't see it actually being worth the money yet.

200
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:45,839
Speaker 1: I see the thing is I must admit there are some fun things to do with the ps3.

201
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:49,360
Speaker 1: I mean, there are some fun things to do with any gaming console.

202
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,372
Speaker 1: Atari Jaguar is fun.

203
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,420
Speaker 1: A Virtual Boy is fun.

204
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,267
Speaker 0: I think that was just not worth the price.

205
00:16:54,327 --> 00:17:04,990
Speaker 0: with the Xbox 360 the resurgence of PC gaming Pokemon and all the actual Wii games that are coming out because everyone knows the best Wii game out right now is ice hockey for the NES.

206
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:09,030
Speaker 1: But I like how your idea for the best Wii game keeps changing.

207
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,119
Speaker 0: The best Wii game out there is the last Wii game I've played.

208
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:19,140
Speaker 1: But Anyway best Wii game is everyone votes channel.

209
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:30,986
Speaker 0: there's so many games to play right now that the Opportunity cost of buying a ps3 to play games that are still going to exist for the ps3 Next year when the ps3 is cheaper.

210
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,832
Speaker 0: I think the answer is pretty clear.

211
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:40,298
Speaker 0: You have to be really hard up for games or Really really overflowing with free time to want a ps3.

212
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:47,460
Speaker 1: now Imagine if we didn't do with the show we didn't do anime we didn't do board games They didn't do anything except video games, right?

213
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,460
Speaker 0: All right, even if that were the case I still have enough video games to occupy me unless I also didn't have a job.

214
00:17:54,881 --> 00:18:02,933
Speaker 1: Well, what if your job was like, you know, not an awesome job that pays a lot of money But the kind of job that most normal gamer schlub guys have?

215
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:04,800
Speaker 0: the job still takes the same amount of time.

216
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,329
Speaker 1: Oh some what if you lived like right?

217
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,371
Speaker 1: you worked like across the street and you doesn't matter I play my DS in the train.

218
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 1: I guess yeah.

219
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:28,080
Speaker 0: So the thing is I have enough games already not to mention my backlog of games Especially since I never owned a ps2 that I can keep myself content on gaming without buying another console Probably until the next generation of consoles even if I didn't buy any more games.

220
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:32,318
Speaker 0: But then again, I could see a gamer having gone through all those games that I never played.

221
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,646
Speaker 1: Yep Well, it's just yet another thing.

222
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:42,207
Speaker 1: and look there with all the other entertainment where I used to have not enough money To get enough entertainment to occupy my time.

223
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:46,379
Speaker 1: and now too much money not enough and too much entertainment.

224
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,161
Speaker 1: I can't.

225
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:59,887
Speaker 0: possibly I do all of it remember in college when like you'd buy a game for the GameCube and we would play the Everlasting fuck out of that game because we weren't gonna get another game anytime We didn't even buy a crap game.

226
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,437
Speaker 1: when just because there was no game to play and we needed a game.

227
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:06,799
Speaker 0: Yep I'd almost trade all my money for even half of that free time back.

228
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:11,439
Speaker 0: Yep, problem is I only had that free time because like Scott I neglected my studies.

229
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:21,405
Speaker 0: Okay Things of the day.

230
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,536
Speaker 0: I think that my thing of the day needs no explanation.

231
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:29,873
Speaker 0: when you look at it All I can say is that it pretty much sums up the last ten years of my life.

232
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,100
Speaker 1: Ah, I know what you're thinking.

233
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:34,686
Speaker 1: I figured it out already.

234
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:36,132
Speaker 0: I believe you did.

235
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,940
Speaker 0: I think you see what I'm doing here.

236
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:39,406
Speaker 1: I think I see what you did there.

237
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:40,972
Speaker 0: So what do you got for me?

238
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:42,900
Speaker 1: So sometime during the week?

239
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:51,740
Speaker 1: I was sitting at work and I was thinking about You know that crappy old video game game show with the guy who had the earpiece and he got all the trivia, right?

240
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,380
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and then you velcro the games to yourself if you win video power.

241
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:02,900
Speaker 1: I watched it when I was a kid and you know I rediscovered it on the internet a few years ago and then like last week dig rediscovered it.

242
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,308
Speaker 1: So I actually watched the episode.

243
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:09,980
Speaker 0: Well, I like the fact that watching it again I mean as a kid all I could think was wow that guy knows a lot about video games.

244
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:20,260
Speaker 1: All I remember about that show was the velcroing of the video games to the to yourself Which was my ultimate fantasy because I got like three video games a year, maybe four or five at the most.

245
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:28,062
Speaker 0: So getting that many at once was like a little kid orgasm plus every kid on that show was stupid and they'd walk around Like.

246
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:28,687
Speaker 0: I want that game.

247
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,353
Speaker 0: I don't want that game.

248
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:29,958
Speaker 0: I don't want that game.

249
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:33,151
Speaker 0: all that I would have grabbed every single other grabbed every goddamn game.

250
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,892
Speaker 0: a free game is better than no game and I know I would have Made it out with all of them.

251
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,660
Speaker 1: I would have made it out.

252
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,319
Speaker 1: I would just basically gone to the first very first shelf.

253
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:45,900
Speaker 1: You could take in every single game one at a time and I got you know got every goddamn one of them.

254
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,460
Speaker 0: It was like the kids who won that Toys R Us shopping spree Where they give you five minutes in the Toys R Us for everything you can get to the front door.

255
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:56,036
Speaker 0: Yep, my fantasy and I had planned this shit out as a kid.

256
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,000
Speaker 1: I just gone to the video game.

257
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,875
Speaker 1: I'll got paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper because they're all.

258
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:00,800
Speaker 0: I watched the videos.

259
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:04,180
Speaker 0: The kid was always like run around haphazardly like grabbing individual boxes.

260
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,975
Speaker 0: I would have run with multiple shopping carts and my arm just extended into the aisles.

261
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:11,860
Speaker 0: Yeah pulling things in until they were full.

262
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,649
Speaker 1: Oh, I would have probably had one for the Lego aisle and one for the video game I'll and maybe one for the board game.

263
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,031
Speaker 1: I'll.

264
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,438
Speaker 1: I guess I could have done three.

265
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:19,806
Speaker 1: The board game.

266
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,980
Speaker 1: I'll be tough because you don't want to get like five monopolies.

267
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,996
Speaker 1: You got to take one at a time.

268
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,263
Speaker 0: But now is an adult.

269
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:28,577
Speaker 0: I watched that video game palace show and all I could see is video game power.

270
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:29,500
Speaker 1: whatever video power.

271
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy is totally cheating.

272
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,520
Speaker 0: He's got an earpiece or something.

273
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,768
Speaker 1: Yep, the kids basically asked him a trivia question.

274
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,711
Speaker 1: He stalls for time.

275
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:42,480
Speaker 1: Someone tells him the answer in his earpiece and then You know, they eventually they tell him the answer and he acts like he's all smart.

276
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:51,220
Speaker 1: so this got me thinking about some video game trivia randomly when I was daydreaming or whatever and I was trying to think of a Question that he couldn't answer but even with an earpiece

277
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:52,787
Speaker 0: I thought of a few when I was a kid

278
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:57,402
Speaker 1: like how many trees are in the overworld in Zelda 1?

279
00:21:57,402 --> 00:22:01,400
Speaker 1: So that got me thinking I'd go look for a Zelda 1 map and look see all right.

280
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:05,652
Speaker 1: And then I ended up at this website, which is my thing of the day.

281
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:07,999
Speaker 1: This site is VG maps.

282
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,085
Speaker 1: calm Guess what is there?

283
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:10,808
Speaker 1: Can you guess?

284
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,700
Speaker 0: I would wager it's a map of some video games.

285
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:18,459
Speaker 1: No, it's basically maps of every video game.

286
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:35,979
Speaker 1: They've got any s SNES Genesis and 64 GameCube Atari's any game that could possibly have a map be it a you know Metroid game where a map is obvious or a Mario game where a map is semi obvious bionic commando?

287
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, possibly.

288
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,667
Speaker 1: Let me do a little search here.

289
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:38,928
Speaker 1: Yep.

290
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,212
Speaker 1: There's bionic commando.

291
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:43,120
Speaker 0: Wow, because that was my primary use for Nintendo power.

292
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:47,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they got maps of area 1 area 1 B and area 13.

293
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,117
Speaker 0: That's it.

294
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:51,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, look up area 13 is just a UN place.

295
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,360
Speaker 0: Ah Why would someone bother anyway?

296
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:05,360
Speaker 1: the point is they've got a lot of maps of a lot of video game areas that are come better created by Pasting screenshots together and it's pretty useful and pretty cool.

297
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:09,040
Speaker 0: So Scott how many trees are there in the overworld of Zelda 1?

298
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,780
Speaker 1: I have no fucking clue, but I can tell you that there are 12 times 6 tombstones in the graveyard.

299
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:21,448
Speaker 0: So up tonight we're gonna talk about a game probably Primarily through anecdotes of play.

300
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,859
Speaker 0: for you see there was a game that we were all aware of.

301
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:26,480
Speaker 0: Well before we got to college.

302
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:38,172
Speaker 0: however many of us never actually had the opportunity to play said game until college due to the fact that said game is Even among a lot of gamers fairly obscure and obtuse.

303
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,440
Speaker 1: It's generally inaccessible is the problem.

304
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,819
Speaker 1: But so where did you first hear this game?

305
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,689
Speaker 0: Well, I heard about it because it was always.

306
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:56,159
Speaker 0: there were ads for stuff for it in Dragon magazine And there were all these older gamers when I was in middle school at the local gaming shops who talked about it And I'd see things for it.

307
00:23:56,521 --> 00:24:01,120
Speaker 0: But other than that all I knew was it's something I probably wanted to play but had no way to play.

308
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:11,583
Speaker 1: Well when I went to summer camp I went to this nerdy summer camp two times and at the nerdy summer camp D&D was pretty popular So I was playing that and Magic the Gathering is pretty popular So I was playing that.

309
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:15,920
Speaker 1: and there was one other thing that was pretty popular at this camp and that thing was the sodomy.

310
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:24,745
Speaker 1: No the game we're talking about right now which is battle tech and I saw a lot of people play in battle tech at this camp and I kind of understood that it was a game.

311
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:25,427
Speaker 1: we had robots.

312
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:34,960
Speaker 1: you customized and moved them around a grid of hexagons and fired at each other, but I didn't know much more than that and I didn't actually play it until years later.

313
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:43,480
Speaker 1: I bought a copy actually after I left the camp, but I had no one to play it with until RIT Where we learned how to play and played it many times.

314
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:52,853
Speaker 0: Now the system of battle tech is very complex and it involves numerous layers And it's basically a combat system for mechs.

315
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:57,469
Speaker 0: And if you don't know what I mean by mech Really not sure what you're doing listening to geek nights.

316
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:00,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, the word mech basically came from battle tech.

317
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,860
Speaker 1: In fact, I think it's a trademark of the FASTA corporation, which is now Microsoft.

318
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:07,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's give me a little history of this battle tech game, right?

319
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:21,088
Speaker 1: So in 1984 when we were two years old Wow a company called FASTA FASA who you might know from shadow Shadow run and battle tank.

320
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:26,082
Speaker 0: I still have my second edition shadow run handerbug complete with the gigantic Dr.

321
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:28,010
Speaker 0: Pepper staying down the entirety of it.

322
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:28,391
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:39,440
Speaker 1: They came out with a game called battle droids Which is later renamed to battle tank and it was a game Where you had a map of hexagons and you had robots that you would customize with various weapons at various weights.

324
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:55,600
Speaker 1: And there's a whole universe and a big sci-fi story around these robots and the game basically consisted of moving the robot Determining line of sight the range of your weapons what you had to roll in order to hit how much damage you would do How much damage you would do to different parts of the robot?

325
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,320
Speaker 1: Rolling dice to figure out the results if any and taking turns doing this until someone won.

326
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:05,600
Speaker 0: It's a complex and gritty unit based war game at its core.

327
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,980
Speaker 0: However, the system as it is is not really intended to be played just as art.

328
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,120
Speaker 0: You make mechs and I make mechs and we'll fight which is what we mostly did.

329
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:46,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about that But the system was designed primarily to be a system not necessarily role-playing but kind of this Intermediate between role-playing and wargaming where you'd play a campaign let's say where you have a character and there's other characters and you have mechs and you have money and also there's all this plot going on and It was a system where you would play these battles then deal with the consequences of the battles and play other battles usually Scenarios things like that and I have never played a campaign of this game Although I desperately want to.

330
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:47,560
Speaker 1: yeah me also.

331
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:59,440
Speaker 1: But if you ever played mech warrior mech warrior to make or your mercenaries I guess mech assault or whatever equivalent those games basically have all the campaign action of battle tech.

332
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,748
Speaker 1: You know there you do a mission.

333
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:13,456
Speaker 1: if your mech gets destroyed you have to pay money to repair it If you destroy another guy or if another guy on the opposing team or force Ejects from his mech and you win you can salvage it from the battlefield.

334
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:13,898
Speaker 1: Maybe?

335
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:15,947
Speaker 0: yeah There's a lot of fun to be had there.

336
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:21,460
Speaker 0: and all these rules about say you find a busted up mech You can take the gauss cannon out of it and try to monitor your own mech.

337
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're if your auto cannons busted you can try to jury-rig something to make it go.

338
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:37,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, except those games tend to replace the hexa hexagon map turn-based war strategy game with a real-time First-person shooter robot game, which is just fine by me.

339
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:38,340
Speaker 1: Those are mostly good games.

340
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:52,120
Speaker 0: Yeah But it really isn't what I want in this regard because the actual combat system of battle tech is very gritty and very real Feeling and very I don't know rough around the edges in a combat kind of way.

341
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:53,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, it

342
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:53,844
Speaker 0: always I

343
00:27:54,285 --> 00:28:11,980
Speaker 1: guess the thing is the way the technology in the game feels is like everything is a piece of shit and You're basically and it's not like Gundam where everyone has all these ultra fancy robots And who wins is all about who's like the ultra wicked badass pilot with all the bad skills and the flashy moves.

344
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,874
Speaker 1: It's basically I'm a guy and I got this piece of shit robot.

345
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:19,100
Speaker 1: It feels like an old car that doesn't want to go.

346
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:23,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're hard to maneuver and god forbid you try to remit over them quickly.

347
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:34,940
Speaker 1: Yeah and the other guy he's got the same thing and we're lumbering around this battlefield trying to kill the other guy without getting killed and Using some sort of strategy to do this.

348
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:36,006
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a game.

349
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:41,773
Speaker 0: or if you take a corner too sharply because you're in a hurry There's a chance that your mechs just gonna fall over and possibly break.

350
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:45,351
Speaker 0: if you jump up down to a building You gotta hope that building doesn't collapse.

351
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you get shot off of that building You better hope you don't land on your head.

352
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:48,268
Speaker 1: now.

353
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:50,300
Speaker 1: the game does have varying levels of rules.

354
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:58,739
Speaker 1: You can play with these simplest rule set and then you don't to worry about a lot of these things like skidding off the road Or falling over on your ass all the time.

355
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:03,835
Speaker 1: But even with the normal rule set things get pretty hairy and you'll be looking up like up.

356
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,259
Speaker 1: doesn't that trigger some sort of role?

357
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, the triggers this kind of role.

358
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:08,393
Speaker 1: What do I need to roll?

359
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,720
Speaker 1: need to roll an 8 or higher?

360
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,584
Speaker 1: What if I fail?

361
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,476
Speaker 1: you fall on your ass and then what happens?

362
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:13,080
Speaker 1: I fall my ass.

363
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,672
Speaker 1: Well, we figure out which side of your ass you fell on.

364
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:17,460
Speaker 1: let me figure out how hard that hurt you.

365
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:18,931
Speaker 1: Let me figure out if anything breaks.

366
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,387
Speaker 1: if something breaks now We got to figure out if that explodes.

367
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,740
Speaker 1: now if that explodes you got to figure out what that damages.

368
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,170
Speaker 0: That's two hits to your engine.

369
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:26,955
Speaker 0: You're gone.

370
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:27,520
Speaker 1: You're gone.

371
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:45,680
Speaker 1: It's actually one thing that is often the awesomeness about battle tech is That you're driving such a piece of shit that it still manages to go and that during the course of the battle It's sort of like a demolition derby in a way and where you just keep taking more damage all over the place.

372
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:53,499
Speaker 1: But you still might not be dead but you still might be maneuvering or are able to at least stand up and able to fire a weapon.

373
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:02,227
Speaker 0: and I remember once having a mech that was so damaged and both of its legs were busted It could not move or get up.

374
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:10,860
Speaker 0: However, I still had active jump jets on my torso and arms Yep, and I could jump into the air only to fall and take further damage.

375
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:23,409
Speaker 1: And as long as he didn't take so much damage in the wrong way that he that is mech exploded or he died He could fly around shoot and You could actually take people out that way.

376
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:23,991
Speaker 1: It's gone.

377
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:26,138
Speaker 1: That's what makes I think that's the most fun.

378
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:33,539
Speaker 0: remember Yes, the last thing you wanted to hear from someone who had a busted mech who was on a cliff above you was you know What fuck it death from above?

379
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:35,348
Speaker 1: Death row above.

380
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:46,020
Speaker 0: see we could talk in great depth about How the battle tech system works and beyond saying that it is very random in terms of the results of an individual action.

381
00:30:46,521 --> 00:31:03,284
Speaker 0: But it's random in a very realistic way in that like real war if you fire Thousands of small missiles at a robot that is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of feet away The odds of many of them hitting are fairly slim and there's the chance that the one just goes up the tailpipe and blows Up the whole mech.

382
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:07,306
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's very much that sort of Realistic gritty.

383
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:08,931
Speaker 0: you could die at any moment.

384
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,440
Speaker 0: fortune favors the bold kind of combat.

385
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many times have you just walked in with a pristine mech perhaps even one of the clan mechs?

386
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,050
Speaker 1: which is not a piece of shit and You just get shot right in the cockpit and your mech explodes.

387
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:24,273
Speaker 0: That was perhaps.

388
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:24,635
Speaker 0: see.

389
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 0: here's where we're gonna get to about battle.

390
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:34,640
Speaker 0: The game itself is not that great unless you're playing a campaign because the game itself on a raw level without any other factor.

391
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,500
Speaker 0: I Believe tedious would be a good word to describe this system.

392
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:46,480
Speaker 1: I think generally the way game of battle tech goes if it's just a few mechs against a few mechs Is that you everyone maneuvers around the map a lot?

393
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:59,976
Speaker 1: you start really far apart where you can't really hit the other team so well and they get closer and People try to maneuver in such a way into where it is very easy for them to hit the opponent but perhaps impossible for the opponent to hit them.

394
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:11,040
Speaker 1: and So like ten turns which is perhaps an hour is spent just moving guys Until someone gets a shot off and until someone actually does some damage that is significant.

395
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:12,124
Speaker 1: It's nothing.

396
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:12,908
Speaker 1: much goes on.

397
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:29,160
Speaker 0: and even once damage is done aside from the fact that after there's that first blood because everyone wants to be the guy who survives to the end and Especially if you're playing just kind of everyone make mechs are at every man for himself There's not much to gain from rushing in and just killing people because you're gonna take a lot of damage.

398
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:42,880
Speaker 0: So everyone's kind of posturing and threatening and moving around But then eventually someone starts firing and almost all that caution disappears to the wind Immediately because everyone realizes that it's really fun to shoot a whole bunch of missiles at your friend

399
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:50,038
Speaker 1: Yep Even though playing that kind of game if you're playing for survival The best idea is to just hide and let everyone else kill each other.

400
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 0: thus We are not going to talk about the system of battle tech at all.

401
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,488
Speaker 0: We are not going to talk about any more rules.

402
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,420
Speaker 0: What we are going to talk about is why?

403
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,925
Speaker 0: Battle tech is fun.

404
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:07,640
Speaker 0: If you've got a bunch of geeks and a bunch of free time Especially if not everyone understands the rules because that is entirely optional.

405
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:11,189
Speaker 1: Well, the first reason battle tech is fun is because you're.

406
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:20,579
Speaker 1: it's not just like some other strategy game like turn-based or real-time Like say I don't know advanced wars or Starcraft where all the units are predefined.

407
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:26,179
Speaker 1: Battletech allows you to completely and utterly customize all the units and we're not just talking about mechs.

408
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,706
Speaker 1: You can customize infantry.

409
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:36,687
Speaker 1: you can customize boats planes capital ships hovercraft helicopters Fighter jets all sorts of stuff though.

410
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:40,657
Speaker 1: The mech is the primary unit, but you can customize submarines.

411
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:47,254
Speaker 1: you can customize Everything completely and utterly in every way the size of the engine how many weapons?

412
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:53,480
Speaker 1: which part where the weapon goes in The vehicle of whatever sort it is how much ammo for each weapon?

413
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:56,451
Speaker 1: How much heat sinks you're gonna have for the weapon?

414
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:58,900
Speaker 1: Maybe you just want a mech that's gonna overheat and you don't care.

415
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:04,600
Speaker 1: Everything you can customize completely and even without playing the game of battle tech.

416
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,571
Speaker 1: It's really fun to just sit around customizing.

417
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:07,912
Speaker 0: next.

418
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:14,538
Speaker 0: when I was bored in college and no one was home I would sometimes just pull up one of my programs and just make a mech because it was very fun.

419
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:27,920
Speaker 0: now I will point out that this the process is complex enough to where there's a lot of software design to do it for you as in to Figure out all the numbers and make it easy to know if your mech is valid or not and all that sort of thing.

420
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:30,679
Speaker 0: Yep, I don't remember the names of the ones we used offhand.

421
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,931
Speaker 1: We used actually pretty much most of them were crappy and someone should.

422
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:37,686
Speaker 1: if I ever actually started playing battle tech a lot again I would write a better one.

423
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:38,592
Speaker 0: There were two.

424
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,235
Speaker 0: we used that.

425
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,527
Speaker 0: between the two of them We could do just about everything we wanted.

426
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:47,018
Speaker 1: mech works was one of them, but it was a crappy windows program But it managed to work and it printed out really nice mech sheets.

427
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:57,010
Speaker 0: Yep now especially We'd often either play every man for himself or some kind of team thing and usually everyone have one or two or maybe three mechs And we'd agree on tonnages and restrictions and all this business.

428
00:34:57,552 --> 00:35:07,358
Speaker 0: So we now play the first game which is basically Everyone's trying to figure out and play the rock-paper-scissors mech gun marine system of all.

429
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:10,019
Speaker 0: right What kind of mech am I gonna make?

430
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,180
Speaker 0: Scott was highly partial to the mechs that were very fast and very live and not very well armored covered with a million little lasers.

431
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,451
Speaker 1: it's a really good strategy.

432
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:25,511
Speaker 1: if you can get in the right position because Lasers in this game you can fire them without worrying about ammo.

433
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:30,387
Speaker 1: They have decent range decent damage and They make a lot of heat.

434
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:52,660
Speaker 1: but you can take care of that with some heat sinks if you have to if you deal with The numbers correctly and because you have so many lasers You roll the dice so many times that your chances of getting a headshot if you hit increase greatly Because each laser can hit in a different part of the opponent Whereas if you fire missiles your chances of headshots and things are a little bit less because you're rolling far fewer locations

435
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:53,402
Speaker 0: Now.

436
00:35:53,503 --> 00:36:05,724
Speaker 0: by the same token the result of Scott's strategy was usually his mech Running around like an idiot all over the middle of the battlefield and then eventually landing in front of someone like me and being immediately Destroyed.

437
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:09,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is you got to be real careful with this kind of mech.

438
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,810
Speaker 1: You got to manage where it goes very carefully.

439
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:19,197
Speaker 1: You can't leave it in any kind of vulnerable position Because it's not strong enough to withstand a lot of getting hit.

440
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,391
Speaker 0: now I on the opposite token I keep saying token would play.

441
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:32,440
Speaker 0: I tended to play of my rival in Pokemon where I'd make one Kind of mech that was basically nothing more than a my sniper platform.

442
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:41,890
Speaker 0: I'd have like two gauss rifles and a little else and I would position myself on a cliff and just point my mech in the direction of anyone I didn't like and dare them to come near me.

443
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:48,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, which works really well Until someone well basically until more than one person came at me at once.

444
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:51,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, in which case they would immediately surround me and destroy me.

445
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:59,480
Speaker 0: Of course, there was probably my favorite moment in all of met all of battle tech ever where Pete designed.

446
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,280
Speaker 0: What I would have to say is one of the most perfect mechs any of us has ever made at that tonnage.

447
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:11,839
Speaker 0: It was a huge powerful amazing mech and the way you fill out damage in battle tech And this is one of the really fun things about the game.

448
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:21,140
Speaker 0: Yeah Is you'll have a picture of your mech and it shows all the different locations and then there's little bubbles Inside of all of these parts of the mech in the picture.

449
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,060
Speaker 1: So let's say your right arm has 20 points of armor.

450
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:30,320
Speaker 1: There's 20 circles and every time you take a point of damage to the right arm You fill in one of these circles like a scantron sheet.

451
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:43,400
Speaker 0: So when all the circles are filled in your armor is destroyed there and now you start taking damage to the internal structure Where that armor was protecting and you start taking possible damage to things that are in there.

452
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,852
Speaker 1: So let's say there was a laser inside your right arm.

453
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:47,400
Speaker 1: Someone shoots your right arm.

454
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:48,605
Speaker 1: It takes damage.

455
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:52,220
Speaker 1: Okay, but they took off a bunch of armor, but they didn't take off all the armor.

456
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,666
Speaker 1: Your right arm still has armor on it.

457
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,072
Speaker 1: They shoot your right arm again.

458
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:55,253
Speaker 1: Now.

459
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,840
Speaker 1: There's no more armor left on your right arm.

460
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:58,075
Speaker 1: Now they shoot it again.

461
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:01,268
Speaker 1: Okay well There wasn't any armor on your right arm when they shot you.

462
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:06,565
Speaker 1: so that shot they just fired went into your right arm and might Have hit whatever is inside there.

463
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,250
Speaker 1: Well, there's a laser inside there.

464
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:09,434
Speaker 1: Let's roll some dice.

465
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:11,420
Speaker 1: Oh that laser is now destroyed.

466
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,989
Speaker 0: Fantastic now.

467
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:18,060
Speaker 0: it was particularly great If the thing that there was there was I don't know a whole bunch of highly explosive ammunition.

468
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:27,706
Speaker 0: Yep because odds are boom There have been mechs that took a shot to the arm that was already wounded and ended up having a chain Reaction that ended in the pilot's death.

469
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:33,243
Speaker 0: Yeah now Pete's mech was gigantic and Stupidly armored.

470
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:46,980
Speaker 0: However, one of the limitations of mechs unless you put forth all of the extra care to have an expensive Like cockpit that's mounted in your torso which kind of sucks for pretty much everything but this one purpose.

471
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,320
Speaker 0: So, uh this mech Pete, you know dies.

472
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:53,317
Speaker 0: I don't think I was even in this game and I come in and everyone's kind of going.

473
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:55,100
Speaker 0: oh my god You won't believe what happened.

474
00:38:55,321 --> 00:39:09,328
Speaker 0: You won't believe what happened and peach is sitting there looking really sad and I say what and he holds up his sheet and I see That the head is blackened in and the mech had not been so much as touched Anywhere else on its body.

475
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,220
Speaker 0: it had immediately taken one lucky headshot.

476
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:18,380
Speaker 0: That headshot had taken out the armor taken out the internal structure and killed Pete the pilot immediately.

477
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:25,627
Speaker 0: I would have cried we kept that sheet around as some sort of triumphal Artifact for some time.

478
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,777
Speaker 1: This is generally what makes battle tech fun.

479
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:31,991
Speaker 1: for us At least is that because of the way the system works.

480
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:34,980
Speaker 1: it allows for a great many entertaining scenarios.

481
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:36,706
Speaker 1: For example one time.

482
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:37,589
Speaker 1: I don't know who it was.

483
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,974
Speaker 1: Someone made a quad mech.

484
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:39,597
Speaker 1: This is a mech.

485
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:40,520
Speaker 0: It was Alex.

486
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,786
Speaker 0: It was always Alex.

487
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,540
Speaker 0: Okay, Alex always made the clever mech that fucked us all up.

488
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,265
Speaker 1: Yes, the quad mech is a mech.

489
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,492
Speaker 1: that usually a mech stands like a human being.

490
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,140
Speaker 1: it has two arms two legs a torso and a head.

491
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,441
Speaker 1: right.

492
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:59,540
Speaker 1: a quad mech is basically as four legs and That's it as four legs in a body and then the cockpit is kind of on top.

493
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:03,120
Speaker 1: It's like a little frog in a way right where all the four legs are equal.

494
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:19,087
Speaker 1: Well, he made this quad mech and a quad mech is slightly different from a regular mech in that You know normally if you destroy both legs in a regular mech It can't do anything where you can destroy some legs on a quad mech and it can still maneuver But it's not really that much better or different.

495
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, this quad make for some whatever reason just wouldn't die and it was hilarious.

496
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:30,324
Speaker 0: I just kept getting back up and crits would be rolled It would overheat and lay there shut down for a while In fact, I believe.

497
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:33,540
Speaker 0: eventually it got shot and overheated so much that it did shut down.

498
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:40,799
Speaker 0: So the combat continued and several rounds later Alex succeed succeeded in starting the engine back up and coming back in.

499
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, now they really do think about.

500
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:48,240
Speaker 1: it is like a lot like just a demolition derby of giant robots.

501
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:52,200
Speaker 0: The game never came down to one person just clearly dominating everyone else.

502
00:40:52,522 --> 00:41:02,520
Speaker 0: It always came down to like the last two mechs kind of Slugging it out with what little weapons they had left like leaning on each other for support until one of them eventually collapsed.

503
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:12,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the game allows you to do so many cool things that might not actually be useful in terms of rules But are just entertaining like if you could chop off a mech's arm.

504
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:14,939
Speaker 1: You can pick up that arm and club him with it and you can.

505
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:26,460
Speaker 1: You can jump up in the air with your jump rockets and land on someone You know feet first or you can kick another mech right in the in the in the business You can do all sorts of crazy stuff now.

506
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:35,075
Speaker 0: But here's where I think this game really shines for a bunch of geeks hanging around late at night Particularly if you have broken into some sort of conference room somewhere on your campus.

507
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:42,480
Speaker 0: Yep, because One of the things about the game is that not everyone knows how to play because like we said the game is kind of inaccessible.

508
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:55,600
Speaker 0: So it's hard to have multiple copies of the rule book and not many people Even us who have played the game a lot are intimately familiar with the rules Especially with the sheer number of lookup tables and special cases and all this business.

509
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:57,250
Speaker 1: I'm familiar with the basic rules.

510
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,096
Speaker 1: Like how do you move?

511
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:58,760
Speaker 1: How do you shoot?

512
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,686
Speaker 1: But I don't have your out if you hit.

513
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:05,732
Speaker 0: but I don't remember even 11 is a hit to like the right center torso Or the leg.

514
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:06,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used her.

515
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,140
Speaker 1: I remember some of the chart like a 12 I think is a headshot and a 2 is a center torso crit.

516
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,135
Speaker 0: But yeah, I don't remember critter crit chance.

517
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:17,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forget Yeah, but the thing is if you're a bunch of geeks and you're into this sort of thing.

518
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:34,497
Speaker 0: I mean if you already enjoyed making these mechs, it's actually Surprisingly fun to sit there and look up the rules because basically you'll all be running around It'll be full of camaraderie and good spirits and good times and then someone does something weird and then someone will say alright We got to look it up.

519
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:40,843
Speaker 0: So the two people have books start looking through the rule book and everyone's debating like I think we're gonna have to roll a pilot Skill check.

520
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:42,590
Speaker 0: I'll bet there's a penalty to it.

521
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:43,333
Speaker 0: I don't know.

522
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,860
Speaker 0: Are we gonna have to roll an engine crit?

523
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,508
Speaker 0: I hope we roll an engine crit man.

524
00:42:46,589 --> 00:42:48,639
Speaker 1: Is there a chance the engine explodes if this happens?

525
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,362
Speaker 0: I want to see the engine explode and then someone will read the rule and oh and now we got to actually Executed.

526
00:42:54,644 --> 00:43:09,480
Speaker 0: and one of the most fun things in this game is if someone gets hit bad Everyone sits there while the guy who attacked starts rolling all the crit chances or all the hit locations And the person with the book starts reading off where those things actually hit and the person who owns the mech is going

527
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,212
Speaker 1: Oh fuck damn

528
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:11,333
Speaker 0: it.

529
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:25,675
Speaker 0: Ah So it'll be like I'll be rolling and or someone else be rolling and I'll be reading the book and I'll be like All right, Scott, you take four hits to the center torso Four more to the center torso with the crit chain.

530
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:32,274
Speaker 0: Ah, oh Oh Crits roll your crit Scott and then Scott's like what did it?

531
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:33,057
Speaker 0: what it hit Scott?

532
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:33,760
Speaker 0: What's a four hit?

533
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,125
Speaker 1: My gyro is exploding.

534
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:38,652
Speaker 1: Oh, it's nice to make a piloting skill check.

535
00:43:38,893 --> 00:43:39,735
Speaker 1: Oh, I fell over.

536
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:44,070
Speaker 1: Oh, I broke my arm Fell over his ammo in the arm and exploded.

537
00:43:44,432 --> 00:43:46,580
Speaker 0: Ah, oh he fell over pipes in Pete.

538
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:48,568
Speaker 0: Doesn't that mean we have to roll more damage?

539
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:50,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's based on his tonnage.

540
00:43:50,596 --> 00:43:50,977
Speaker 0: Ah shit.

541
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,884
Speaker 0: He has a heavy mech He's probably done for yeah.

542
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:57,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, the rules of battle tech are definitely fun in and of themselves.

543
00:43:57,421 --> 00:43:59,779
Speaker 1: That's why they released so many goddamn rule books.

544
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:12,540
Speaker 1: If you're not satisfied with the simplest rule set or the standard rule set They sell books like maximum tech and like tech manual Number, you know and some fictional year in the battle tech universe.

545
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:14,660
Speaker 1: It's not gonna talk about the battle tech universe at all.

546
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:25,502
Speaker 1: But now and these books just have more weapons more equipment more rules more this more that for you to add into your game to make it more complex and more Hilarious.

547
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:38,120
Speaker 0: so unlike most games where complexity and difficulty and constantly having to look things up is Definitely a detriment with the right group of friends and remember everyone involved in playing has to be equally into it.

548
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,386
Speaker 0: Luckily, that's not difficult to achieve.

549
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:41,168
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

550
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:46,152
Speaker 0: you will have great fun with this game and these difficult rules actually serve to enhance The experience.

551
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:57,771
Speaker 0: Yep I would highly recommend That if you have a bunch of friends Especially if you're in a geeky college or have a setting where there's a bunch of geeks around who are into gaming at all Go buy everything you need to play battle tech.

552
00:44:58,193 --> 00:45:00,100
Speaker 0: learn the rudiments of the rules.

553
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:02,219
Speaker 0: Don't worry that anyone else doesn't know them.

554
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:07,880
Speaker 0: Just force a bunch of people to come over tell them to set aside four hours and try to play this game.

555
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:09,345
Speaker 1: Keep in mind.

556
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:12,478
Speaker 1: There are a lot of battle tech games out there and I don't want you to be confused.

557
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:18,939
Speaker 1: the game We're talking about is classic battle tech, which I believe is currently published by whiz kids.

558
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,911
Speaker 1: now They are fan pro.

559
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:22,320
Speaker 1: I think I'm not quite sure.

560
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:22,943
Speaker 0: I don't know.

561
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:26,398
Speaker 0: you realize that half the books we had were obsolete and out of date when we played.

562
00:45:26,418 --> 00:45:32,945
Speaker 1: yeah I know but regardless there are other battle tech games like this the mech or your mage night game Which don't play.

563
00:45:32,985 --> 00:45:33,994
Speaker 1: that we're not gonna talk about.

564
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:34,620
Speaker 0: we should review it.

565
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:38,215
Speaker 1: Get miniatures that look at mechs with clicks on the bottom.

566
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:39,280
Speaker 1: That's not the right game.

567
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:41,227
Speaker 0: In fact, you know, I'm gonna review that game right now.

568
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,311
Speaker 0: It sucked ass.

569
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:45,504
Speaker 1: Okay, if you get a video game That's not the right game.

570
00:45:45,544 --> 00:45:48,334
Speaker 1: If you get mech warrior the battle tech role-playing game.

571
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:49,740
Speaker 1: That's not the right game.

572
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:52,840
Speaker 0: If you get mech warrior - that's a good game, but it's not the right game.

573
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,422
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

574
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,996
Speaker 1: but the game you're looking for is classic battle tech you will need.

575
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:57,900
Speaker 1: there's a box.

576
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:59,007
Speaker 1: Actually, you can buy.

577
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,719
Speaker 1: that will give you everything you need to play the game.

578
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:03,399
Speaker 1: But if you don't want to buy that box, you can't find it.

579
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,659
Speaker 1: You need what is it called the the master?

580
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,545
Speaker 0: Rule book or whatever.

581
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,308
Speaker 0: I think so.

582
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,020
Speaker 0: We'll probably post in the forums exactly what you need with links.

583
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:19,360
Speaker 1: Yes We will post in the forum links to everything you need to play the game We are describing so that you do not purchase the wrong product if you actually decide to play this.

584
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,960
Speaker 0: I also point out as an incentive.

585
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:25,660
Speaker 0: Generally, whoever owns a given book is the one who gets to read the relevant rule.

586
00:46:26,141 --> 00:46:36,997
Speaker 0: So if I own the max tech book and Scott owns the normal book and we're all playing and someone has a max tech question I get to be the one who says ah, well, it says here that you explode.

587
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:41,956
Speaker 1: Yeah Also, if you're getting into battle tech don't go nuts with the books.

588
00:46:41,976 --> 00:46:44,011
Speaker 1: There's a lot of books There's a lot of map sets.

589
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:44,900
Speaker 1: There's a lot of stuff.

590
00:46:45,342 --> 00:46:57,111
Speaker 1: Don't go nuts buying too much because a lot of it you don't need Unless you start getting into really advanced complicated campaigns and all sorts of other crazy shit and also at first just buy the one rule book

591
00:46:57,452 --> 00:47:06,882
Speaker 0: unless you want to play a campaign or You have a bunch of serious gamers and you're willing to play straight-up scenarios that are difficult put together and take a long time to Play.

592
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:17,740
Speaker 0: don't take this game seriously because Skill matters a lot and tactics matter matter a lot and strategy matters a lot and design and knowledge matter a lot.

593
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:27,919
Speaker 0: but in the end like real war There's a lot of randomness and a lot of capricious ness and a lot of vindictiveness and a lot of revenge killings Yeah, and a lot of just general dickery.

594
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:30,340
Speaker 1: Well, I think the way they usually play this game.

595
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:34,660
Speaker 1: You know when they have serious competitive play is they play with a lot of stuff.

596
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:37,560
Speaker 1: We tend to play with a few mechs because that's hard enough for us to manage.

597
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:38,899
Speaker 1: You know just a few mechs.

598
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:54,159
Speaker 1: but when people tend to play they tend to play with like lots of mechs like like maybe 20 of them and then they play With infantry and elementals and all sorts of stuff all at the same time and like a 1v1 giant battle on a giant map with a crap-ton of units and a lot of complicated terrain.

599
00:47:54,199 --> 00:48:02,457
Speaker 1: and When you have all those things it tends to make a lot of the Bullshit randomness matter less and a lot of the strategy matter a lot more.

600
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:06,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course It also makes the game less fun in my opinion.

601
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:11,138
Speaker 1: It makes it take longer and it I guess that's the way the game was meant to be played.

602
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,360
Speaker 0: to me It's it's equally fun for a different reason and I would love to play that way.

603
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:23,506
Speaker 0: But I do not know anyone who is willing and able to run that game Well enough to where I wouldn't get bored.

604
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, the people who really play hardcore.

605
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:38,130
Speaker 1: They don't even play with hexagon maps They play on just an open terrain Just a piece of girl, you know like the fake grass with the fake hills and everything and they use tape measures and they you know They play with actual miniatures and even

606
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,375
Speaker 0: our craft way of playing with.

607
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,280
Speaker 0: we just equal not crap.

608
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,718
Speaker 0: But we just use the boards and the hex grids and the little mini whatever's.

609
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:48,420
Speaker 0: You still need a tape measure and a laser pen to figure out things like line of sight.

610
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:51,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, line of sight is gonna be one of the biggest things.

611
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,980
Speaker 0: again just use a laser pen don't even try to do anything else.

612
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like hey, can I can this mech see that mech?

613
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:57,190
Speaker 1: Yes.

614
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:00,892
Speaker 1: No, maybe it's not always easy when you're first starting out To answer that question.

615
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:09,760
Speaker 0: Yep But the fun of this game is that I remember one particular game and I was both Infuriated and yet at the same time couldn't help but laugh.

616
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:17,952
Speaker 0: We had huge knockdown dragon mount melee and in the end I killed Almost every single mech that had died on the field.

617
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:20,360
Speaker 0: I did more damage than everyone else combined.

618
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:25,740
Speaker 0: I dominated partly due to luck partly due to my mech design partly due to other people fighting with each other.

619
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:46,062
Speaker 0: I kicked everyone's asses, but Scott with his little run around with the lasers Mac Jumped on me out of the forest after I defeated my last opponent other than him With his pristine Mac that had spent most of the map Running around like an idiot and just lasers me to death while I was kind of hobbling away trying to get some shelter and cool Down in a lake.

620
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,086
Speaker 1: That's the strategy.

621
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:49,935
Speaker 0: and then Scott won because the rules weren't kill the most people.

622
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:51,804
Speaker 0: the rules were last man standing Yep.

623
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,780
Speaker 1: Well, you should have paid attention to those rules.

624
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,426
Speaker 0: The thing is playing the game.

625
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:59,680
Speaker 0: the way we did it was so fun because no one really cared if they won.

626
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,520
Speaker 0: What you cared about was if you did something awesome.

627
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:06,959
Speaker 0: Someone would often charge to their death only because it was an awesome thing to do.

628
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:12,860
Speaker 0: Someone would make a weird Mac that had no chance of winning only because they wanted to see what that Mac would do.

629
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:19,195
Speaker 1: It's sort of a weird experience Actually for the way we played it in that that's sort of like the way you play.

630
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:20,119
Speaker 1: D&D is like D&D.

631
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,920
Speaker 1: you don't play to win, but you're rolling dice and doing stuff in order to See awesome shit happen and make an awesome story.

632
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:47,147
Speaker 1: Well battle tech you're just really restricted and that you're only making an awesome story about one battle between shitty robots But you're trying to win and there's a lot more dice than D&D and it's a lot more rules and it feels like a strategy Game, but really you're getting the same thing out of it that you would get out of D&D Which is an awesome story about an awesome robot battle.

633
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:54,156
Speaker 0: It kind of takes in my opinion the best elements of beer and pretzels D&D and Makes them even more awesome.

634
00:50:54,297 --> 00:51:01,540
Speaker 1: Yep And it also allows for the more serious experience for the people who play battle tech the proper way not the way we play

635
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:16,940
Speaker 0: Yep, and the other piece of advice I want to give for if any of you actually want to get into this is that there Is clan and inner sphere and all I'm going to say is if you're gonna play the way we do where you just kind of all Make mechs of a similar tonnage and then fight don't play with clan because those mechs are too good and it's not as fun.

636
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:18,793
Speaker 1: Yes, the story basically a battle tech.

637
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:19,780
Speaker 1: I didn't want to talk about it.

638
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,000
Speaker 1: Is that there this clans invading this area of space called the inner sphere?

639
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,728
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say anything awesome.

640
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,180
Speaker 0: make it very simple and have awesome technology.

641
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,685
Speaker 1: The inner sphere have shit technology.

642
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:33,818
Speaker 0: the clan people are assholes and the inner sphere are backwards primitives.

643
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:47,380
Speaker 1: Yep, and basically in so in the campaigns or and also mech or your type video games you either you generally are Inner sphere guys trying to fight off the clans or your clans fighting each other or something like that.

644
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:58,200
Speaker 1: You know depending on what part of the story or what year it is in the timeline and the clan people Their mechs are just plain better people clan Just plain better.

645
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:06,512
Speaker 1: So if I was to have say a hundred tons of clan mechs and rim would have a hundred tons of intersphere mechs He can't really win because my mechs are just better.

646
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:07,859
Speaker 1: clan mechs actually work.

647
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,135
Speaker 0: now Here's the difference and in gameplay for us and here's why I recommend playing inner sphere.

648
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:16,160
Speaker 0: if you play clan Especially reading the rules you think wow clan is awesome.

649
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,080
Speaker 0: I want to play clan and then alright.

650
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:21,000
Speaker 0: So say you want to make a Mac an 80-ton Mac and you're using clan.

651
00:52:21,502 --> 00:52:25,540
Speaker 0: Everything you want just fits and you have an awesome Mac and it takes you 20 minutes and it's super badass.

652
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:30,360
Speaker 0: Yep, making a Mac an inner sphere is this exercise in delicious?

653
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:37,819
Speaker 0: Frustration where you have to make decisions like I want that Gauss rifle But the only way to make it fit is to not have any armor on my back.

654
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:43,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile the clan Gauss rifle is much smaller lighter and more efficient.

655
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:44,719
Speaker 1: You can fit like two of them in a Mac.

656
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:57,620
Speaker 0: No Playing with limitations like limiting the tech level or not giving yourself access to clan makes the game Interesting because now everyone's Mac is very different and everyone had to take severe sacrifices to get what they wanted.

657
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,326
Speaker 0: You want to fit more tonnage in.

658
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:03,440
Speaker 0: you got to get that XL engine and that XL engine is not too friendly.

659
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:07,313
Speaker 0: No, all right, or the the fabled XXL engine.

660
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:12,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I made an XXL once Yep, and I took an engine hit almost immediately and then died.

661
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:15,849
Speaker 0: All right I think we're done.

662
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:25,460
Speaker 0: battle tech is awesome And it has provided a great deal of the friendship that the front row crew now shares even though we haven't played it in years And you probably won't play it again for a long time.

663
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,394
Speaker 0: Yeah but it doesn't matter because we played it enough and we got it all.

664
00:53:29,494 --> 00:53:40,495
Speaker 0: it's in our blood forever and I probably have an infinite number of anecdotes because once I told them all I could probably just start making them up and There's a decent chance that they're at least somewhat true.

665
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:50,252
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
