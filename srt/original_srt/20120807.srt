1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,639
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, August 7th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,100
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,983
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,607
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:15,770
Speaker 1: Tonight, tournaments.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,962
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,415
Speaker 1: I am back from Brazil.

8
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:27,136
Speaker 0: Brazil.

9
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,886
Speaker 1: I'll do a show later like on some Thursday about being in Brazil, but it was pretty fun.

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,094
Speaker 1: I would go again.

11
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:39,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, Brazil is a weird place because it has good things and bad things in great combination.

12
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:42,509
Speaker 1: The city, Sao Paulo, super modern, super chill.

13
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:43,372
Speaker 0: Wouldn't it be modern?

14
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:48,070
Speaker 1: We wandered around like the equivalent of Fifth Avenue and had nice dinners and it was crazy.

15
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:56,561
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you notice that half the cars on the street are armored as in an inch of bulletproof glass and bomb proofing.

16
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:01,516
Speaker 1: And yeah, the one thing that I can say is that I did some research.

17
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:07,032
Speaker 1: Brazil recently fell off of the top 10 list of most violent countries.

18
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:08,215
Speaker 1: So they're getting better.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,366
Speaker 1: A lot of violent crime and kidnapping, though.

20
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no, I hope but also lots of good stuff.

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,251
Speaker 1: I get to go back soon.

22
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:22,675
Speaker 0: It's weird that a lot of countries, you know, it's like you look around the world and it's like, ah, you know, you live in the U.S.

23
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,866
Speaker 0: and you look around and you say, look at that country.

24
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:28,502
Speaker 0: They have something awesome that we don't have like Portugal.

25
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,693
Speaker 0: You can just you know, the drug policy there is great.

26
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,561
Speaker 0: What problems do they have?

27
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,167
Speaker 0: The economy not so great.

28
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:37,017
Speaker 1: They speak Portuguese on Brazil.

29
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:37,258
Speaker 0: They do.

30
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:44,440
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, Portuguese, Spanish people who speak Portuguese can understand Spanish just fine.

31
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,836
Speaker 1: But people who speak Spanish can't understand shit of what Portuguese people say.

32
00:01:49,539 --> 00:02:00,063
Speaker 1: And that was and the weirdest part of that is I could read the menus at restaurants better than the Spanish speaking, learning Portuguese guy I was with because a lot of it was in Japanese.

33
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:00,845
Speaker 0: Really?

34
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,110
Speaker 1: A lot of Asians there.

35
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,234
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

36
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:06,004
Speaker 1: So I'd be like, yeah, she made you whatever different names of fish.

37
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:06,667
Speaker 1: I got this.

38
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:08,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,638
Speaker 0: Fish is pretty good down there.

40
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,139
Speaker 0: Yeah.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,084
Speaker 1: Fish was pretty good down there.

42
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:11,627
Speaker 0: Nice.

43
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:12,290
Speaker 0: All right.

44
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:13,335
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'm back.

45
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,766
Speaker 1: Regular schedule until PAX and then fuck.

46
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,329
Speaker 1: There's going to be.

47
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:17,555
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going to happen.

48
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,890
Speaker 1: We're going to be gone collectively for like three weeks.

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,252
Speaker 0: Yeah.

50
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:25,769
Speaker 0: So remember, I talked a whole lot about my new computer and your tiny God.

51
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,432
Speaker 1: Yeah.

52
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:36,340
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, I don't want to go on for a hundred years about it, but I've never bought a computer before in my life that was so powerful relative to what is available on the market.

53
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,631
Speaker 1: Scott, when I bought this computer, it was that.

54
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,100
Speaker 1: So I know exactly how you feel.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,660
Speaker 0: It is like I can do anything and it's like I bought this stupid Adobe Creative Cloud.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,743
Speaker 0: So now I can do.

57
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:50,480
Speaker 0: I feel like I can make any things that I can imagine I can make it.

58
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:57,025
Speaker 1: It is a powerful moment when you drag an hour long, like 1080p 60 video into Premiere and it's like, boop.

59
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:57,570
Speaker 0: Yeah.

60
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,780
Speaker 0: And it's even crazier.

61
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 0: So it's like I'll have everything open that I usually have open and I'll have like Premiere rendering a video and I'll have like Lightroom organizing photo and iTunes importing all these MP3s and full screen 3D game Mac settings.

62
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:16,640
Speaker 0: And there's no slow down.

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,744
Speaker 0: The fans don't even get.

64
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:28,557
Speaker 1: My how times have changed because I remember at RIT, because remember when we first all met, you know, there's the cycle of who has the baddest as computer at any given time among a group of the E.P.

65
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:29,020
Speaker 0: competition.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,877
Speaker 1: When we all got to RIT, that was me because I spent every bond.

67
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:39,000
Speaker 1: my grandparents had bought me for 19 years on a computer right before I went to RIT.

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,300
Speaker 0: Mine was a Pentium 3450.

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,482
Speaker 0: Yeah.

70
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,056
Speaker 1: Mine was an AMD like K7.

71
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,304
Speaker 0: All right.

72
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,880
Speaker 0: We switched to AMD and they kept breaking.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,660
Speaker 0: We kept upgrading and breaking and upgrading.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, because then I upgraded to the Thunderbird gigahertz.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:57,018
Speaker 0: It's another thing I want to say, right, is, you know, there are still people out there I realize that are all AMD ish.

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,630
Speaker 0: And, you know, I looked at AMD and it's like, yeah, you can get like a six core AMD for 100 bucks.

78
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,118
Speaker 0: It's like, whoa.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,799
Speaker 1: At the really low end or not the really low end, but at the at the not like plateau of performance, AMD is still way cheaper.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

81
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,360
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you know, I first had it in Pentium three.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,599
Speaker 0: It was my first computer I built.

83
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,838
Speaker 0: And that computer never had a problem ever.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,043
Speaker 1: Simpler anecdote.

85
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,180
Speaker 1: Every Intel computer I've ever built booted on the first try.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,300
Speaker 1: No AMD computer I've ever built booted on the first try.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:36,619
Speaker 1: We built AMD computers from like all through the Pentium four years up until the core two, which was always like me, Scott and a bunch of the other crew standing around a computer being like, why won't it boot?

88
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,263
Speaker 0: Yeah.

89
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:40,180
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we have many like AMD CPUs.

90
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,020
Speaker 0: Did we have lying around extra motherboards?

91
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,917
Speaker 1: I still have all those AMD CPUs.

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,701
Speaker 0: Right.

93
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,979
Speaker 0: We had all this stuff lying around.

94
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:47,505
Speaker 0: Why?

95
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,040
Speaker 0: Because the shit kept breaking.

96
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,880
Speaker 0: So now I'm sure AMD might be just fine now.

97
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,380
Speaker 1: And Intel, to be fair, the shit that broke wasn't the CPUs.

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,308
Speaker 1: It was always the.

99
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,337
Speaker 0: I had a bad CPU.

100
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,147
Speaker 1: I never, never.

101
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,823
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is that it was always those jank ass a bit motherboards.

102
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:07,101
Speaker 0: Well, the general the first the Pentium motherboard, the first one ahead was a bit.

103
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,663
Speaker 0: It was perfect.

104
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:13,840
Speaker 1: The thing is around that era is when I was getting like, let's overclock it a bit like super mother.

105
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,880
Speaker 0: I didn't even overclock.

106
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,620
Speaker 0: But all those AMD years shit broke.

107
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,819
Speaker 0: The whole AMD ecosystem of hardware was not reliable in those years for us.

108
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:28,780
Speaker 0: And every Intel computer I've had has been 100 percent stable.

109
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
Speaker 0: My first one, Pentium three was stable.

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,580
Speaker 0: The core two duo that I just replaced is still in great condition.

111
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,079
Speaker 0: If you want it, contact me.

112
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,240
Speaker 1: I also have a core two duo that you can have.

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,740
Speaker 0: However, and the new one I just bought booted on the first try.

114
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:40,328
Speaker 0: Perfect.

115
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,120
Speaker 0: Everything amazing.

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,719
Speaker 1: There's something wrong with that motherboard because USB will occasionally cause it to voltage drop and hard crash.

117
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,240
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway.

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,741
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

119
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:58,180
Speaker 0: And having two of the Dell ultra sharp monitors to on arms is pretty sick.

120
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,042
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:06,369
Speaker 1: So if you want my old monitors this past weekend, you may know that we know many people who work at MUSE games.

122
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,460
Speaker 1: like a whole bunch of our friends work there and they're working on a new game is Guns of Icarus online.

123
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:18,780
Speaker 1: There's been a beta for a while and I was in it, but I played it for real over the weekend because it's getting to the point of like being good.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,725
Speaker 1: You can actually play it.

125
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:22,520
Speaker 1: And it was actually really fun.

126
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,260
Speaker 1: Emily was like, come on, play my game, try it out.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,020
Speaker 1: I'm like, OK, I'll stop playing Counter-Strike and play this new game.

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,534
Speaker 1: And it's no slight to Guns of Icarus because it is hard to give it to me to play any game that is in Counter-Strike.

129
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:34,879
Speaker 1: Yeah.

130
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,148
Speaker 1: So I start to play and then I just kind of kept playing for some hours because it was actually really fun.

131
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,179
Speaker 0: There are people playing in.

132
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were.

133
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:48,780
Speaker 0: So we were doing like and the network part worked as the most important thing is that, you know, all these indie games, the network shit doesn't work.

134
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,580
Speaker 1: The network should actually work perfectly.

135
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,260
Speaker 1: There was glitchy stuff in the game, but it was the kind of like game balance, game mechanic glitchiness that you expect from a beta.

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,099
Speaker 0: Not like, oops, I walked through the wall.

137
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,440
Speaker 0: Oops, I fell off the well.

138
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:04,260
Speaker 1: At one point I fell off a ship and instead of dying, I just kept falling forever.

139
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,803
Speaker 0: Nice.

140
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,940
Speaker 1: But mostly it worked.

141
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 1: And the game is actually super fun.

142
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,180
Speaker 1: And me and Adam ended up being on a ship at one point.

143
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:14,639
Speaker 1: And here's why this game is actually fun.

144
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:22,659
Speaker 1: Like the whole gist of it is that you'll have multiple ships, like two ships per team, and each ship has like four or five, a bunch of people on it.

145
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:31,919
Speaker 1: And you run around FPS style on the ship, repairing stuff, Team Fortress 2 style and like manning guns and someone's and someone's the captain and they're steering it.

146
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,239
Speaker 1: And the steering feels like this kind of like steampunk thing.

147
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,941
Speaker 1: The steering and the logistics and the teamwork and all that stuff actually matters a lot.

148
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:46,860
Speaker 1: Like at one point, Adam was the captain on my ship.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,039
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's like when we play Counter-Strike, if two people who know what the fuck they're doing in games are on the same team in a game, shit goes down.

150
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:56,040
Speaker 1: And yeah, shit went down.

151
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,482
Speaker 1: Adam was like, they're coming up on the left and he's pulling maneuvers through the smoke.

152
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:04,004
Speaker 1: We'd like get into the smoke and then reappear behind someone suddenly and just open up a broadside.

153
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,279
Speaker 1: It was the game was surprisingly fun for a still beta game.

154
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:09,184
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

155
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,880
Speaker 1: So that's my initial geek bite.

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,197
Speaker 1: And I'm going to do a more thorough geek bite once I play the game a little more and possibly play it against strangers instead of with someone I know.

157
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:23,320
Speaker 1: Adam, you're a good captain, but don't use that.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:23,982
Speaker 1: There's this thing.

159
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,863
Speaker 1: you can use that like speeds up your ship, but it also ruins your engines.

160
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,819
Speaker 1: And I think he turned it on and forgot to turn it off.

161
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,208
Speaker 0: So it's not like.

162
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,580
Speaker 0: it's not like a one time burst.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,359
Speaker 0: It's like a lever that you put in one of two.

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 1: It's basically like poor moonshine into the engine and you get like 300 percent speed, but then the engine takes damage.

165
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:40,921
Speaker 0: All right.

166
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,635
Speaker 0: But you just kept the moonshine was just flowing like water.

167
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,619
Speaker 1: OK, I guess like you didn't run out of it.

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,658
Speaker 0: I mean, it takes a while.

169
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,080
Speaker 1: Well, the engines all exploded.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,195
Speaker 0: How many X was it?

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Speaker 1: Three X's on the bottle.

172
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:53,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

173
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:56,180
Speaker 0: You know, we learned the X is on the moonshine bottle.

174
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,939
Speaker 0: That's how many times it's been through the still.

175
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,965
Speaker 0: Every time you put it through the still, you put another X. That's when.

176
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:01,207
Speaker 0: Yeah.

177
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:01,975
Speaker 0: Anyway, there you go.

178
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:03,624
Speaker 1: All right.

179
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,660
Speaker 0: Or, you know, so let's just do some news here.

180
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,200
Speaker 0: Let's not blow our whole load that we have plenty to talk about in future episodes.

181
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,079
Speaker 1: So I'm always conflicted when a company I hate sues another company I hate.

182
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:27,520
Speaker 0: And well, the thing is, usually when that happens and this hasn't been happening lately, but whenever anyone sues anyone, I mostly just want the court to set the precedent the way that I want, because I want what I want.

183
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 1: Well, well, there's two things or I or if it's people I hate, I want them to do as much damage to each other as possible.

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,284
Speaker 0: That's also true.

185
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,679
Speaker 0: But so when it's two people, you hate you anyway.

186
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,959
Speaker 0: So what's what's going on?

187
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,979
Speaker 1: EA has sued Zynga.

188
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,923
Speaker 0: Well, Zynga.

189
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,520
Speaker 0: I mean, I hate EA, but Zynga is worse.

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Speaker 1: Well, EA is just kind of, you know, exploiting their workers, making generic.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,042
Speaker 0: Well, they already got sued for exploiting their workers and they supposedly fix that, I guess.

192
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,820
Speaker 1: The video game industry is fucked when it comes to worker treatment.

193
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,895
Speaker 1: That's a separate union.

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Speaker 1: But EA, you know, they're like the Microsoft of the gaming world.

195
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:05,801
Speaker 0: Yeah.

196
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,700
Speaker 1: Microsoft in the 90s to nerds.

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,239
Speaker 1: Anyway, Zynga.

198
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:11,940
Speaker 1: Well, no, they're not a game company.

199
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,018
Speaker 1: Zynga doesn't make games.

200
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:14,959
Speaker 1: I've said that on lectures.

201
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,050
Speaker 1: I've said that at PAX.

202
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:16,980
Speaker 1: I've said it on the shelves later.

203
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,520
Speaker 1: Zynga does not make anything that competes with what I would call a game.

204
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:27,646
Speaker 1: They make games in the same way that patty cake is a game, but in replace patty cake with patty.

205
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,479
Speaker 1: And then you got to put a quarter in to get the cakes.

206
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:35,840
Speaker 1: So EA is suing Zynga over copyright infringement.

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:47,360
Speaker 1: And this is where things get weird, because if you don't know game mechanics, game rules, things like that, not copyrightable at all.

208
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,761
Speaker 1: You can.

209
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:52,401
Speaker 1: There is so much precedent for you not being able to copyright the rules of a game.

210
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:52,603
Speaker 0: Right.

211
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,360
Speaker 0: You don't copyright rules of a game.

212
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,810
Speaker 0: You copyright, you know, art work or music.

213
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:03,500
Speaker 1: A specific, like, for example, a drawing, a music, a background.

214
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's artworks are copyrighted.

215
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,160
Speaker 0: You know, something like game mechanics would be an invention.

216
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,063
Speaker 0: They'd be patented.

217
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,880
Speaker 0: And even then it's very your logo of your company or the logo and name of your game trademark.

218
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,443
Speaker 1: So you can't sue someone and win by all the legal precedent we who are not lawyers know of.

219
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 1: And I read like 10 articles.

220
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,942
Speaker 1: Well, you could.

221
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:33,980
Speaker 0: What if I made an FPS that used like all the sprites from Doom, but you didn't let me finish based on game mechanics.

222
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:34,743
Speaker 0: Of course not.

223
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:44,222
Speaker 1: And every time there's been a lawsuit that worked about someone stealing a game, it's always been like, yeah, they stole all the backgrounds from Morrowind or something like that.

224
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:54,419
Speaker 1: But in this case, no, EA is suing over a game because it's mechanically and stylistically similar to their game.

225
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,200
Speaker 0: Well, did their lawyers be smart?

226
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,500
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on because I mean, like, how could we know more than people who are lawyers 24/7?

227
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,217
Speaker 1: So what's interesting is that the mainstream media, like Wall Street Journal type news organizations are saying the same thing.

228
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:09,660
Speaker 1: we're saying.

229
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,740
Speaker 1: They're like, what the fuck is EA doing?

230
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:12,919
Speaker 1: You can't sue for that.

231
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:14,780
Speaker 1: That's not even covered by the law.

232
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:15,774
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

233
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:16,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

234
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,479
Speaker 0: I mean, look at around the world.

235
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:26,160
Speaker 0: This is why you can see a lot of like Monopoly clones out there, but you just can't call it something like Opoly because you'll get trademark sued.

236
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:32,067
Speaker 0: But if you just call it like the Scott game, but it looks just like Monopoly and it plays like Monopoly, how many people.

237
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:37,880
Speaker 0: it doesn't have Monopoly man on it and doesn't use like Baltic, you know, those names as different names and different colors.

238
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,660
Speaker 1: How many people have taken that old mafia slash werewolf game and remade it?

239
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:43,699
Speaker 1: I'm doing it even.

240
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not you can't copyright that.

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:55,460
Speaker 1: But so every article I've read has had a quote from a lawyer or an analyst or someone who basically said, what the fuck is EA doing?

242
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,899
Speaker 1: This is a ludicrous lawsuit.

243
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:02,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they've always qualified it by saying not that Zynga is a good company.

244
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,560
Speaker 0: Well, because I mean, you got to think Zynga basically does just clone all the games.

245
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,179
Speaker 0: They see someone else, a successful game.

246
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,120
Speaker 0: They make the same exact game thing as a team in the mighty.

247
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,918
Speaker 1: Then they're not breaking the rules, but they're still.

248
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:16,420
Speaker 0: they take.

249
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,739
Speaker 0: They see a game that's successful.

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,460
Speaker 0: They directly copy it and Zynga if I and tweak it slightly.

251
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,751
Speaker 0: So they make it time to make it to make do.

252
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,861
Speaker 1: every time I click, it's nine ninety five to you.

253
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:28,344
Speaker 0: That's right.

254
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:31,220
Speaker 0: And then they stick it on Facebook and iPhone and whatnot.

255
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,083
Speaker 0: And that's that.

256
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,040
Speaker 0: So, yeah, they're not exactly, you know, the bestest.

257
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,799
Speaker 0: I mean, imagine if we just made a game that was the same game as Puerto Rico, but we called it Geek Nights, Rico, and we changed all the artworks and all the things legally.

258
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:44,486
Speaker 1: That's fine.

259
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:45,920
Speaker 1: Morally gray area.

260
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:57,439
Speaker 0: But if we put that out, you know, we would be punished in the marketplace because anyone in that marketplace would know, hey, this is a Puerto Rico clone and no one would buy it up unless we made it online and easy to play.

261
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,820
Speaker 0: Well, actually, I was thinking, right, what if we did that evilly?

262
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:02,482
Speaker 0: Right.

263
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:10,500
Speaker 0: And what we did is we basically just made the board game versions, the physical versions with very low production values, but still playable.

264
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:11,807
Speaker 0: And we made them way cheaper.

265
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,826
Speaker 0: So it's like Puerto Rico, 10 bucks because it's a cheap ass version.

266
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,179
Speaker 0: But it's not called Puerto Rico.

267
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,598
Speaker 0: It's Geek Nights, whatnot.

268
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:24,380
Speaker 1: That'd be on the morally gray, shitty business practice level of the stuff Zinga does.

269
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:25,108
Speaker 0: But legal.

270
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:25,595
Speaker 0: Yeah.

271
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:26,666
Speaker 1: And you know what?

272
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,580
Speaker 1: In my opinion, not a lawyer.

273
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,100
Speaker 1: Everything Zinga is doing here is pretty legal.

274
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,627
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

275
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,700
Speaker 0: The thing is, right, is lawsuit is groundless.

276
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,140
Speaker 0: They is currently legal.

277
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,040
Speaker 0: But I'm actually I'm not sure my opinion.

278
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:52,040
Speaker 1: Scott, if you're OK with copywriting game mechanics and you're OK with a much deeper copyright ability of things like I am considering making my opinion.

279
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,460
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this is my current.

280
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,487
Speaker 1: All right.

281
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,920
Speaker 1: You realize my hackles are up.

282
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:05,929
Speaker 0: I'm ready to argue here that Zinga like games are so basically they're gambling and should be regulated as such, even though.

283
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,060
Speaker 0: because imagine if I made a slot machine, but the slot machine had a guaranteed payout of zero, but you had to pay a quarter.

284
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,186
Speaker 0: You pulled the lever.

285
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:14,151
Speaker 1: I'm just going to.

286
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:16,619
Speaker 1: I'll play the devil's advocate because we should do a separate show on this.

287
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:17,783
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

288
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:22,021
Speaker 1: We're going to be talking about this at both Pax Prime and Pax Dev on two different.

289
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:32,540
Speaker 0: I'm feeling like, you know, that's like even, you know, solitaire blitz is kind of fun from PopCap, but I'm feeling like it's just an evil slot machine and sort of shouldn't maybe shouldn't be.

290
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,005
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

291
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:39,880
Speaker 0: I'm considering changing my opinion that it shouldn't be an argument to be considered or at least should be regulated.

292
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,167
Speaker 1: That's we.

293
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,840
Speaker 1: free speech is number one.

294
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:44,135
Speaker 0: I agree.

295
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:44,420
Speaker 0: I know.

296
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,844
Speaker 0: That's why I'm only considering.

297
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:50,820
Speaker 1: because are we going to say that a game is no longer free?

298
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:58,841
Speaker 1: speech is speech when movies, books, pictographs, drawings, music, everything else is free speech.

299
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:08,840
Speaker 0: But a game is can also because of what it is, right, because it is a thing that you do and not just the thing you experience gambling be regulated.

300
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,319
Speaker 0: That is a good question.

301
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,268
Speaker 0: And also sort of why does it?

302
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,540
Speaker 1: why does gambling matter if there's no payout?

303
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:29,960
Speaker 1: The only reason you regulate gambling is to make sure that at least the people who do gamble don't get fucked by an unregulated, but it's also to make sure, but it's also to make sure that the casino doesn't cheat the people.

304
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,939
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, to make sure that that there's not some unregulated market where the consumers don't know what they're buying.

305
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:42,840
Speaker 1: But games like this, like these crappy social league games, I feel like social game is code for a shit game at this point.

306
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:52,143
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I do those games not tell you exactly what they're doing, not 100 percent of the time.

307
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:59,820
Speaker 0: They don't necessarily tell you, like all the mechanics of the game, like, yeah, this thing gives you 100 percent chance of this happening within five hours.

308
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Speaker 1: So, Scott, if we regulate those games, what's the line?

309
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,079
Speaker 1: Does Half-Life have to tell you how many points of damage the new gun does?

310
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,224
Speaker 0: I don't know.

311
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,339
Speaker 0: That's why I'm only considering.

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's still some.

313
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:14,720
Speaker 0: I mean, it is sort of a man trap, right?

314
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,460
Speaker 0: It's like certain kinds of advertising are illegal.

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:26,433
Speaker 1: Only only advertising that is actually directly false or because of weird regulations, cigarette ads.

316
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I mean, like, you know, subliminal advertising, even though it doesn't work, is illegal.

317
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:41,060
Speaker 1: But that was made illegal under a very shady, it was and would probably not stand up in court if it was challenged.

318
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,884
Speaker 0: But it doesn't work.

319
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:46,800
Speaker 1: But imagine that because it now I'm saying one, because it doesn't work, it wouldn't stand up in court.

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,582
Speaker 1: I don't believe.

321
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:51,913
Speaker 1: And two, OK, even if it did work, would it be?

322
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:55,283
Speaker 1: would it really be fair to regulate it?

323
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,860
Speaker 1: Because what if I wrote a novel that's subliminal?

324
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,240
Speaker 0: Let's not waste the whole episode on this, but I'm going to ask one question and then we will not answer it and then we'll move on.

325
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:06,680
Speaker 1: OK, and then I'll ask another question.

326
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,520
Speaker 0: No, no, no question is like my question.

327
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:15,340
Speaker 0: If I invented a mind control device, would should it be legal?

328
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:17,192
Speaker 0: That's the question.

329
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:17,719
Speaker 0: Don't answer it.

330
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,382
Speaker 0: Let's just move on.

331
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:22,880
Speaker 1: So my question is, do we care if Zynga gets fucked or not?

332
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,581
Speaker 0: No.

333
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,259
Speaker 1: So here's here's my personal read on this.

334
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:38,119
Speaker 1: I think what EA is trying to do here is get a precedent set to change the way these things work in the courts.

335
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:46,500
Speaker 1: I think EA is going to try to use its muscle to get the court to argue or to agree that certain aspects of game mechanics are copyrightable.

336
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,900
Speaker 1: And regardless of whether or not you think this lawsuit has merit, because again, Zynga basically steals stuff for all intents and purposes.

337
00:18:54,561 --> 00:19:03,400
Speaker 1: If EA wins this lawsuit, the the ramifications for game design and gameplay are staggering and almost universally bad.

338
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 1: Well, the thing that we're not want to win this this is like someone sues Hitler.

339
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,699
Speaker 1: We don't want Hitler to win.

340
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:14,740
Speaker 1: But if the lawsuit passes, then video games get banned.

341
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,060
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing, right, is that a lot of these cases lately, the people have been pushing jury trials, you know, juries to decide.

342
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,439
Speaker 1: That's bad news.

343
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:36,236
Speaker 0: And if a jury looks at pictures of EA's games, sees evidence that those games were released on the market first and then sees pictures of Zynga's games, which look basically identical, 99 percent identical, it's not going to.

344
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:40,299
Speaker 0: it's going to be hard to convince the jury that Zynga wasn't just ripping them off.

345
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,560
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the jury is not going to want to decide in Zynga's favor.

346
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,120
Speaker 1: But at the same time, then the appeals would look more.

347
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,300
Speaker 0: It's up to the judge to give the jury the correct instructions.

348
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,980
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying even if a jury trial happened on appeal, it would probably end up getting into a precedent's argument and that sort of stuff.

349
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,146
Speaker 0: That'd be good because.

350
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the news there.

351
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 1: I don't want to get a win, but I don't want to win either.

352
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:09,361
Speaker 1: So I'm hoping that Zynga exhausts money defending against this wins, but then goes out of business.

353
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:25,144
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day, there's been a sort of hobby on the Internet for a while now, and it's kind of gained some steam recently because more people were doing it.

354
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:32,378
Speaker 1: We linked to things about this a while ago, but trying to play modern games with really low settings just to see what they look like and do this.

355
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:33,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did.

356
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,940
Speaker 1: So this one goes a step further.

357
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,024
Speaker 1: This is a dude who didn't just set the kind of like in the menu settings down on Half-Life 2.

358
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:48,980
Speaker 1: He went and changed all the variables to make Half-Life 2 be as minimal as goddamn possible.

359
00:20:49,981 --> 00:21:01,380
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, this looks a lot like Quake one, and it's actually kind of amazing to see how the game is still pretty playable and things are still pretty recognizable.

360
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,860
Speaker 0: Only because you played it before.

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,140
Speaker 1: Even then, I could play this because it's yeah.

362
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,540
Speaker 0: No, you forget on paper is playing Scott.

363
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,247
Speaker 1: When was the last time you played Doom?

364
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:15,164
Speaker 1: and it was not one of these Doom remakes with a higher resolution?

365
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:19,304
Speaker 0: I played the Doom remake with a higher resolution, but I didn't enable the higher resolution.

366
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,434
Speaker 0: So it still looked like Doomdoom looked like.

367
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,160
Speaker 1: I can't even comprehend Doomdoom anymore.

368
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:24,684
Speaker 0: I can.

369
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,360
Speaker 1: My brain is like, what the fuck is that?

370
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,456
Speaker 1: And I turn the resolution up.

371
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,799
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is actually pretty entertaining to watch.

372
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:37,939
Speaker 1: Also, you should totally comment on the guy's video and tell him how amazing it is that it looks just like Minecraft, just like everyone does.

373
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, he has an annotation.

374
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,160
Speaker 1: He's like, guys, stop telling me it looks like Minecraft.

375
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:42,699
Speaker 1: I get an email for every comment.

376
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,443
Speaker 1: I don't care.

377
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,840
Speaker 0: So you could turn that off if you wanted to.

378
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,125
Speaker 0: Yeah.

379
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:54,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so, you know, I just bought a new computer and it has a sound card in it, but the sound card is part of the motherboard.

380
00:21:54,361 --> 00:22:04,167
Speaker 0: And pretty much every sound card these days pretty much just plays digital audio perfectly, as many digital audios as you want just to speakers, just like your iPhone or whatever, like a stereo.

381
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:05,660
Speaker 0: It's they're pretty much perfect.

382
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,750
Speaker 0: They're all the same.

383
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,780
Speaker 0: They don't really matter.

384
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,540
Speaker 0: They all follow the same Intel AC 97 standard thing.

385
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,460
Speaker 0: They all you know, there's no friggin difference.

386
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,526
Speaker 0: You don't even think about it.

387
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 0: You just your computer can play any sound.

388
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,082
Speaker 0: There is.

389
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:17,142
Speaker 0: no.

390
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:19,008
Speaker 1: I remember a day.

391
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,983
Speaker 0: I remember a day back in the day, computers couldn't play any sound.

392
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,208
Speaker 0: There was they didn't.

393
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,959
Speaker 0: you didn't have enough memory and processing power to actually play digital audio.

394
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,600
Speaker 1: Most games had MIDI soundtracks or some equivalent.

395
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:33,540
Speaker 1: And even then, it sounded way different.

396
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,742
Speaker 1: If you had an all 32, it sounded way different than if you had like a regular sound blaster.

397
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:41,840
Speaker 0: or basically, you know, computers today have digital audio.

398
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,794
Speaker 0: You have the audio in a file like an MP3 or an AUG.

399
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:46,120
Speaker 0: that is just the waveform.

400
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Speaker 0: And then the computer plays it back by converting that digital data into an analog audio signal and sending it to a speaker.

401
00:22:54,622 --> 00:23:02,200
Speaker 0: In the olden days, you couldn't store that or process that digital thing and convert it to analog quickly enough or have enough memory to hold on to it.

402
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,339
Speaker 0: So you couldn't do it that way.

403
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:11,285
Speaker 0: You could have analog audio like a vinyl record or cassette tape and just play it back with a player.

404
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:18,420
Speaker 0: But you would have to somehow control the cassette player, have the computer control the play and pause buttons, the cassette player and rewind.

405
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,239
Speaker 0: And I don't think anyone ever even did that.

406
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Speaker 1: Remember, even like not that long ago, PlayStation one games, Redbook audio.

407
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:25,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

408
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:31,789
Speaker 0: So the very first computers for audio, all they had was a PC speaker that basically went beep boop and it had.

409
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,359
Speaker 0: basically it was like a buzzer and you like a doorbell and you could friggin ring it.

410
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,459
Speaker 0: And that was pretty much it.

411
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,320
Speaker 1: I remember installing old games.

412
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:47,660
Speaker 1: One of the things you had to do is set the IRQ and DMA stuff for your sound card and you had to pick like, do you have an ad lib or the Roland, whatever.

413
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:52,399
Speaker 0: So over the years, what you know, they had sound cards and what sound cards were.

414
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,640
Speaker 0: And your computer still has one of these in it somewhere, even though it's not used.

415
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,560
Speaker 1: It's just on the motherboard.

416
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,163
Speaker 1: Right.

417
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,420
Speaker 0: It's basically a synthesizer.

418
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:05,920
Speaker 0: So it was like you have an instrument, a keyboard, like a Casio keyboard synthesizer built into the computer.

419
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:13,720
Speaker 0: And the computer, the game basically has, you know, a musical track and then plays the sound card like it's a keyboard.

420
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:16,620
Speaker 0: And that's how your computer would make music with a sound card.

421
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,760
Speaker 0: And because of that, you know, different synthesizers sound different.

422
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,479
Speaker 0: So different computers sounded different and had different capabilities and could play more noises at once.

423
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:28,440
Speaker 0: And this is how the NES made music and how the SNES made music even.

424
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,741
Speaker 0: Right.

425
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:34,360
Speaker 0: It was all these old computers had synthesizers in them that the games, the software played.

426
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 0: So the software is playing a digital instrument.

427
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:48,782
Speaker 0: So this guy wrote this amazing article here that is called The History of Sound Cards in Computer Game Music, and he covers the PC speaker, the IBM PC, Jr.

428
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:55,524
Speaker 0: and Tandy, the Adlib, the Roland, the Creative Game Blaster, the Sound Blaster, the I had.

429
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,520
Speaker 1: my first sound card was this like integrated way.

430
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,841
Speaker 0: Hold on.

431
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:06,480
Speaker 0: Roland sound canvas, Gravis ultrasound, Creative Lab, Sound Blaster 16, R32 and then modern sound cards.

432
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,279
Speaker 0: And he has audio samples from all of these.

433
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:16,120
Speaker 0: And the best part was that he got audio samples from this game, Silpheed, which is really old shooter, but he has like Silpheed.

434
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,653
Speaker 0: He has samples from it, from PC speaker, PC, Jr.

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,682
Speaker 0: Adlib.

436
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:26,780
Speaker 0: He's got Silpheed running on like six or seven different cards here, or maybe five or six with the same exact music.

437
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,939
Speaker 0: And it's like, whoa, you can totally hear, you know, what's going on.

438
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:35,063
Speaker 0: The other thing is he kind of left out like he has the music from Descent and Descent 2.

439
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:40,239
Speaker 0: But what he left out was the fact that the Descent and Descent 2 were on CD-ROMs and had Redbook audio.

440
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:45,241
Speaker 0: So what those would do is even that was you would put Descent in and you start playing it.

441
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:57,043
Speaker 0: And if you had a modern sound card with the CD-ROM had a little cable that ran from the CD-ROM to the sound card and basically play the music straight off the CD like a CD player.

442
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,820
Speaker 0: So you had a real music with those games.

443
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,160
Speaker 0: But he's not giving you that music.

444
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 0: He's giving you the synthesized music from Descent and Descent 2 for people who didn't have CD-ROMs or CD-ROMs hooked up properly.

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,140
Speaker 1: I remember the one when I finally give us my dad to buy me a Sound Blaster AWE 32, the AWE 32.

446
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,180
Speaker 0: He's also got a lot of Quest for Glory clips here for RIM.

447
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,120
Speaker 1: Quest for Glory had some great sound.

448
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,240
Speaker 0: Also, let me tell you, the Roland sound canvas friggin sounds like amazing.

449
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,120
Speaker 0: It's like this unbelievable synthesizer.

450
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,398
Speaker 0: It's pretty sweet.

451
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,000
Speaker 1: So when I installed it, suddenly I heard the Star Wars theme in TIE Fighter.

452
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,180
Speaker 1: In AWE 32.

453
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,439
Speaker 0: Oh, and you had never heard sound before.

454
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,920
Speaker 1: I'd heard it before, but it was on this shit MIDI card.

455
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,118
Speaker 1: So the samples were ass.

456
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:48,300
Speaker 1: The AWE 32 had really good samples built into it, and it sounded to my young ear like the best music I'd ever heard come out of a computer.

457
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that was before MP3s.

458
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,525
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, you realize, guys, that we're going to be at PAX Prime and PAX Dev.

459
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,060
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

460
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,174
Speaker 1: Yeah, PAX Prime, Friday, 3.30 p.m.

461
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,880
Speaker 1: in the Wolfman Theater, short subjects in gaming.

462
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:10,646
Speaker 1: One of the panel, one of the many panels within that that we're doing is called On the Ethics of Mind Control.

463
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:13,762
Speaker 1: And we're basically going to have the discussion that Scott and I almost had just now.

464
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:32,099
Speaker 1: And at PAX Dev, if any of you were going, Scott, myself, Luke Crane, Jared Sorenson, Avery Alex and Conrad Kraling will be doing Academia versus Reality, Psychology Game Theory in Games in the Grand 2 Ballroom, Wednesday, 2.30 p.m All right.

465
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:34,760
Speaker 1: Asha, son, it's on big time.

466
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,717
Speaker 1: Magfest is a ways out, but we'll be there.

467
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,883
Speaker 1: I'll be there.

468
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:44,880
Speaker 0: Other meta, I just want to say, you know, we I started this geek nights newsletter and I've actually been mailing it about once every two weeks.

469
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,404
Speaker 0: So and in that newsletter, I actually put some moderate amount of work into rewriting it every time.

470
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:56,340
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone's actually reading it, but I can sort of see numbers.

471
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,659
Speaker 0: So subscriptions that people keep subscribing to it.

472
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,400
Speaker 0: And there are people who are reading it and people who are clicking on the links in it.

473
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,620
Speaker 1: Remember, there is a unique content exclusive.

474
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,720
Speaker 0: There is a small amount of exclusive content in this newsletter.

475
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Speaker 1: There's a newsletter thing of the day that you'll never get on the regular website.

476
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:14,902
Speaker 1: Yeah.

477
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:17,500
Speaker 0: And there is also a newsletter fan art.

478
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:23,360
Speaker 0: So if you want to submit fan art, you want to submit questions for us to answer in the newsletter, you know, stuff like that.

479
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,940
Speaker 0: We're just trying to increase our listener engagement.

480
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:28,679
Speaker 0: So newsletter is not a bad place to do that.

481
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,140
Speaker 0: Why not subscribe or whatever?

482
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,900
Speaker 0: And then if it sucks, unsubscribe, but at least tell us so that we know how to make it better or whatever.

483
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,976
Speaker 1: OK, so tournaments, obviously the real.

484
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:41,940
Speaker 0: what is a tournament?

485
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,100
Speaker 1: You want to look up the dictionary definition?

486
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,800
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, a tournament is a thing at a convention that takes way too much time.

487
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,140
Speaker 1: I never do it, even though I know I could win some of these things.

488
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,233
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, to me, what a tournament is, is you want to?

489
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:58,660
Speaker 0: you want to determine somehow who is the best at a at a particular thing.

490
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,900
Speaker 1: From a limited field of contenders.

491
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,361
Speaker 1: Right.

492
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:10,460
Speaker 1: And simultaneously, I think, equally important to most tournaments is to provide an entertaining spectacle for the people who are sometimes.

493
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,519
Speaker 0: Yes, that's what I'm saying for me.

494
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:14,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is an equally important thing.

495
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,100
Speaker 0: I think the purpose of a tournament is that you have some sort of competition and you want to determine who's the best.

496
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:22,860
Speaker 0: So let's say you wanted to have, you know, a race, you know.

497
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:27,300
Speaker 0: So, for example, you know, you could say, OK, everyone ready, set, go.

498
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,839
Speaker 0: And then you have one race and whoever gets to the end wins.

499
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
Speaker 0: Now, for just a race, that probably is the best way to do it.

500
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,142
Speaker 0: That might work.

501
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:45,299
Speaker 0: But the problem is, is what if the competition is such that only a small number of people can participate or you can't really figure out who's the best in the world with only one iteration of the contest.

502
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,839
Speaker 0: So who's the best at Puerto Rico?

503
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,140
Speaker 0: Well, we got five guys playing.

504
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,146
Speaker 0: A guy wins.

505
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,800
Speaker 0: Is he the best in the world?

506
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,620
Speaker 0: No, only five people played.

507
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Speaker 0: Well, 100 people can't play one game of Puerto Rico.

508
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,208
Speaker 0: Of course not.

509
00:29:56,491 --> 00:29:57,320
Speaker 0: That's why you need.

510
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:02,617
Speaker 0: A tournament, you play multiple iterations of the thing in some structure.

511
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,300
Speaker 0: that will determine a grand champion of the thing.

512
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,778
Speaker 0: And that is what a tournament is for.

513
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:08,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

514
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:14,200
Speaker 1: According to Wikipedia, a tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors all participating in a sport or game.

515
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,759
Speaker 1: More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping anyway.

516
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:18,522
Speaker 0: Yeah.

517
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:29,060
Speaker 1: So the reason we're talking about this, which you should know unless you live under a rock, is that teams in the Olympics were disqualified for trying to win the medal.

518
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:29,881
Speaker 1: Yep.

519
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,900
Speaker 1: That is pretty much the most succinct way I can put it.

520
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,686
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

521
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,160
Speaker 0: So they're playing badminton, right?

522
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,220
Speaker 0: Which is actually like bad.

523
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,280
Speaker 1: It's a super fun sport.

524
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,044
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan.

525
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:48,901
Speaker 0: So the way the tournament was structured was it was a round robin tournament, which means you actually was more like the World Cup where you play in a group.

526
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:53,681
Speaker 0: So the group like four teams together and those four teams will each play each other.

527
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:58,062
Speaker 0: And the two, you know, you win or lose against the other three teams in your group.

528
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,040
Speaker 0: So you play three matches, basically.

529
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:08,720
Speaker 0: And if you win more than the other teams in the group, the top two teams in each group move on and the bottom two teams in each group don't move on.

530
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,160
Speaker 0: So basically you cut the field in half.

531
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,939
Speaker 0: Everyone plays three games.

532
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:18,199
Speaker 0: Now, this is sort of a good format because, you know, it's like your first game is flukey.

533
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:22,319
Speaker 0: It gives you some chances to win, even though you lost a game or two.

534
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,495
Speaker 0: If you are actually better, it can also depending on.

535
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:29,819
Speaker 1: I mean, there's different algorithms for sorting around robin tournaments or deciding who plays who and when.

536
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,260
Speaker 1: You can have round robins where you play multiple games against people.

537
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:38,222
Speaker 1: You can have round robins where you don't actually play against every person if they're very large.

538
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:51,640
Speaker 0: So it allows you to have a very large field of competitors without having to, you know, really and filter them down quickly down to, you know, so you can get a single elimination tournament afterwards.

539
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:52,526
Speaker 0: So it's not.

540
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:54,439
Speaker 0: it's not really bad structure at all.

541
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:07,380
Speaker 1: Now, the problem lied in that the round robin format format for the Olympics for Bedman was basically to to decide who qualifies for the single elimination real tournament.

542
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:17,680
Speaker 1: And as a result, because of the way it shook down, as you know, in a single elimination tournament, having a higher or lower seed determines who you play.

543
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:17,962
Speaker 1: Right.

544
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:20,840
Speaker 1: And in single elimination, that means, you know, round one.

545
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:21,866
Speaker 1: Me and Scott play.

546
00:32:22,188 --> 00:32:24,040
Speaker 1: whoever loses is out of the tournament.

547
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:32,880
Speaker 1: So we Scott and I way back, you know, we ran an outlaw tournament like Atari twenty six hundred in our apartment and we did a single elimination tournament.

548
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:42,520
Speaker 1: Now, had Scott and I played against each other in the first round, that would have been BS because we're we were basically the two best players.

549
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:43,024
Speaker 1: Right.

550
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,200
Speaker 1: But one of the best players would have been eliminated immediately.

551
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,020
Speaker 0: So it would have looked as if I sucked because I lost in the first round.

552
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,100
Speaker 0: But in reality, I was the second or first best player.

553
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:57,099
Speaker 0: You just don't realize that because I played against the other best player in round one.

554
00:32:57,883 --> 00:32:59,660
Speaker 0: So the tournament results.

555
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:00,203
Speaker 0: Right.

556
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 0: I would have won the silver medal if the seating would have been different.

557
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:10,820
Speaker 0: But instead I win dick and bupkis because I played against the gold medal guy in the first match instead of in the finals.

558
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:16,580
Speaker 0: And that's why you have seating in a in a single elimination tournament so that the final rankings are accurate.

559
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:21,164
Speaker 0: So, you know, imagine if you played a single elimination tournament, you lost in the first round.

560
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:25,580
Speaker 0: But you could, you know, if you played against the silver medal guy, you would have destroyed him because you're way better than him.

561
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,544
Speaker 0: Well, that's just wrong.

562
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:30,742
Speaker 0: So there's seating going on after you play in these group matches.

563
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:34,862
Speaker 0: They arrange everyone in the single elimination tournament, according to seeds.

564
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:38,720
Speaker 0: Now they're the best guy plays the worst guy and so forth.

565
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,123
Speaker 0: Right.

566
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,040
Speaker 0: Same way the NCAA basketball.

567
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,262
Speaker 1: Part of the reason you might do this, forget the math of it or like, you know, tournament theory.

568
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:49,301
Speaker 1: You guys realize tournament theory is a for real, like serious field of stuff.

569
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:49,582
Speaker 0: Of course.

570
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:49,763
Speaker 1: Yeah.

571
00:33:49,884 --> 00:34:00,540
Speaker 1: But one reason you would do this is basically to reward people who in the qualifications of a tournament, for example, did exceptionally well by giving them easier matches or even buys.

572
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:05,856
Speaker 0: So if you don't have to play in the first year, you did really well during the regular season of football.

573
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:12,545
Speaker 0: So now in the playoffs, which are a tournament, you get to skip the first round and you get home field advantage.

574
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,440
Speaker 0: And, you know, this means that you're more likely to go.

575
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:19,764
Speaker 0: It's going to be easier for you to go farther in the tournament, but the best team is still going to win.

576
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,760
Speaker 0: And if you look at, you know, the playoffs, it's still it's analogous to like in Formula One.

577
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,420
Speaker 1: You have the qualifying lab and then, you know, pole position.

578
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,625
Speaker 1: Everything is determined by that.

579
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:35,159
Speaker 1: If you spend more effort in that, you've kind of spent resources of your car to get ahead.

580
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,184
Speaker 1: So you're rewarded for that.

581
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:56,438
Speaker 1: It makes sure that players, even in, you know, pre tournament play or pre like final round play, have an incentive to try really hard to make the game entertaining and to do well, where if there wasn't a reward for doing better in the regular season, once you're qualified, there's literally no reason to even show up.

582
00:34:56,621 --> 00:35:01,848
Speaker 0: What it is, is you want to have a single elimination style of tournament because it's pretty much like everyone.

583
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:03,260
Speaker 0: you play, you beat someone.

584
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,519
Speaker 0: That means you're better than them.

585
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,700
Speaker 0: You play against someone else who beat someone.

586
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:11,020
Speaker 0: And in the end, the winner is the best in a single elimination tournament, right?

587
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,602
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

588
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:17,340
Speaker 0: But the single elimination tournament has a flaw in that there is a lot of room for flukeiness.

589
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,424
Speaker 0: What if I'm the best, but in one fluke match, there was wind because it was golf or something.

590
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,179
Speaker 0: And I lost because of that.

591
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,420
Speaker 1: There's a reason the Stanley Cup is seven games.

592
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,062
Speaker 0: That's right.

593
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:31,923
Speaker 0: You want to remove flukeiness so you can determine more accurately the true champion.

594
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:44,800
Speaker 0: And that's why prior to the single elimination tournament, you have this multi round thing to remove elements of luck and chance and, you know, to to really know rigorously that a gold medal winner is the winner.

595
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:52,200
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, that's why you combine things like, you know, you have a qualifying to test rigorously who is the best.

596
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:58,120
Speaker 1: Now, again, we're still assuming that the primary goal of a tournament is to figure out who is, in fact, the best right now.

597
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,664
Speaker 1: Obviously, you can try to game the structure of a tournament, much like if you look at voting.

598
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, the tournament is a game.

599
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,160
Speaker 0: The games themselves are a game within the larger game.

600
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,240
Speaker 0: The tournament is the game you want to win.

601
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,062
Speaker 1: I'm saying look at like first pass the post versus run off all these different ways of voting.

602
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:19,180
Speaker 1: You have the situation where you might want to act in a way that is conducive to winning this particular tournament.

603
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,640
Speaker 1: I did this myself in high school.

604
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,567
Speaker 1: I was in Quizball.

605
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,280
Speaker 1: Our school was pretty renowned.

606
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,724
Speaker 1: We had good people and we would often lose a match on purpose to get our own utility, which might be.

607
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:40,700
Speaker 1: we know who we'd be up against if we were seeded at X. So maybe we would lose the game to make sure our seed was different to play someone else in the first round of the next tournament.

608
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,515
Speaker 0: There are also other situations like, you know, who's the best?

609
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:44,460
Speaker 0: rock, paper, scissors?

610
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:46,303
Speaker 0: Right.

611
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:52,578
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if you're rock, you're going to want to play scissors in round one so you can make it to round two.

612
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:59,000
Speaker 0: Now I'm playing against, you know, I don't know, would I just make it up other guys?

613
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:00,230
Speaker 0: It's rock.

614
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,319
Speaker 0: I'm playing against peace.

615
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,297
Speaker 0: So rocks plant rocks playing against wood.

616
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,900
Speaker 0: Rock is already won enough matches because he's fucking rock, right?

617
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,620
Speaker 0: He's already going to be in the tournament.

618
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:12,360
Speaker 0: If he loses to wood, he gets to play scissors in round one.

619
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:17,444
Speaker 0: If he beats wood, which he might be able to do, he's going to play against paper in round one.

620
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:17,929
Speaker 1: Forget that.

621
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:18,980
Speaker 1: Look at personal stuff.

622
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,420
Speaker 1: You know, in board games, we talk about how one of the worst things that can happen is when someone who cannot win the game has the power to determine the winner of the game.

623
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,640
Speaker 1: It's generally a sign of poor game design.

624
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,606
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

625
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,240
Speaker 1: And in tournaments, it's the same way.

626
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,240
Speaker 1: If you have a you could have a situation where I'm still playing around, I'm not eliminated from the tournament.

627
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:45,680
Speaker 1: I still have to play around, but I cannot qualify for the next round.

628
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:46,144
Speaker 0: Right.

629
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,720
Speaker 0: So like we're doing the round robin thing.

630
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,940
Speaker 0: I've lost two matches, but I have to play a third match in my group.

631
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,666
Speaker 1: But now I'm playing against.

632
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,000
Speaker 0: it's impossible for me to move on to the real tournament.

633
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:08,066
Speaker 0: But I'm playing against this guy, you know, it's like, well, I can do some dick things to really screw this guy over or I could lose on purpose to him to make sure he gets into the qualifier instead of.

634
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:11,841
Speaker 0: maybe the other guy is a neighboring country that I'm friendly with.

635
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:22,043
Speaker 0: And if he wins, my rival is now not going to be in the tournament, you know, where as if I had played to win, maybe I could have beaten this guy because he's the scissors to my rock.

636
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,683
Speaker 0: And then my rival would have also entered the tournament, though I would not have.

637
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,980
Speaker 1: So what happened in the Olympics?

638
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,000
Speaker 1: Basically, there were teams where in the round robin, very, very good teams.

639
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:40,360
Speaker 1: They were in a situation where both teams had no more reason to play and actually, in fact, had a vested interest in losing.

640
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:46,338
Speaker 1: Yes, even though you've seen three stooges is where two people are trying to throw a boxing match at the same time.

641
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,860
Speaker 1: Not fun to watch.

642
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:52,200
Speaker 0: Oh, so this caused big problems.

643
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,700
Speaker 0: Number one, there is a rule in the books that they have, which is sort of a B.S.

644
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,778
Speaker 0: rule, but it is a rule.

645
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,540
Speaker 1: It's the shadows over Camelot rule.

646
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,083
Speaker 0: Exactly.

647
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:01,620
Speaker 0: That says you have to try to win every match.

648
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,860
Speaker 0: So they broke that rule and were disqualified.

649
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,320
Speaker 0: So I would argue that's all there is to it.

650
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:13,885
Speaker 0: I would argue that that rule, because it very heavily rule says you had to try to win the match.

651
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,280
Speaker 0: It did not say you had to win the tournament.

652
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,940
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that that rule is broken in the sense that it relies upon intense.

653
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:21,482
Speaker 0: Yep.

654
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:27,483
Speaker 1: So then the skill becomes, can I throw the match without it appearing that I'm doing so?

655
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:31,500
Speaker 1: What right does the referee have to say you are trying to throw the match?

656
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,589
Speaker 0: But in this case, just sucking.

657
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:36,302
Speaker 0: in this case, it is two people trying to throw the boxing match.

658
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,939
Speaker 0: There was no question that they were trying to throw the match at all.

659
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,602
Speaker 0: No, no.

660
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:41,370
Speaker 0: You know, now this situation is.

661
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,639
Speaker 1: there have been soccer games that came down to two teams trying to score into their own nets.

662
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:47,346
Speaker 0: There have.

663
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:47,893
Speaker 0: I've seen them.

664
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:48,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

665
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:57,048
Speaker 1: So this happens in a lot of sports, and every time it is because of poor game design, if there is ever a situation where a player

666
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,291
Speaker 0: who cannot

667
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:02,142
Speaker 1: win the game can decide who does win the game

668
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:08,600
Speaker 0: or somebody who could win is trying to lose a part of a tournament on purpose to gain an advantage.

669
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,501
Speaker 0: Right.

670
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,920
Speaker 0: They are not putting forth the full effort, as you know, you would intend.

671
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,480
Speaker 0: That is because the game is broken.

672
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Speaker 0: The blame lies with the game.

673
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,004
Speaker 0: Not the player.

674
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:22,024
Speaker 1: The people who wrote the rules for this tournament in the Olympics are fucked up.

675
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:24,460
Speaker 1: They would they they Hunger Games did.

676
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:24,681
Speaker 0: Right.

677
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:32,002
Speaker 0: But it caused them a lot of problems because now you have people who bought tickets to watch this and now they're watching two teams trying to lose the second part.

678
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:39,759
Speaker 1: We care in the Olympics nominally about who is the best at something in the world, but we also care about whether or not it is entertaining to watch.

679
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:51,131
Speaker 1: And if we just care about who is best, the rules of this game basically said that one of the skills of being best is being able to lose on purpose while appearing that you're not doing so.

680
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:51,740
Speaker 0: Exactly.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,720
Speaker 1: So thus, it's not fun to watch those matches.

682
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,020
Speaker 1: I think the punishment against these players is ridiculous.

683
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,923
Speaker 1: I think whoever.

684
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,331
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I think it's it's.

685
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:07,979
Speaker 0: you can't really argue with it too much because they did have the bullshit rule of you must try to win the match, but they didn't even try to look like they were trying to win the match.

686
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,240
Speaker 1: True.

687
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:17,601
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I feel like that rule is that's like if we play a game in Puerto Rico and I'm going to win and you can't win, but there's a way for you to guarantee that.

688
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:23,573
Speaker 0: But there's no rule in Puerto Rico that says you must at all times attempt to get as many victory points as you can.

689
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,857
Speaker 0: And I choose like craftsmen, even though I've got a better example.

690
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,242
Speaker 1: Look at power grid.

691
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:35,482
Speaker 1: Very often players will fuck up or pull back on purpose, use the rubber band.

692
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:35,743
Speaker 0: Yes.

693
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:39,660
Speaker 1: Or look at look at the stadium bicycle racing.

694
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:40,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

695
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:41,124
Speaker 0: Well, they were all.

696
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:41,647
Speaker 0: they were.

697
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,662
Speaker 1: people stop or go slow on purpose to start from behind.

698
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

699
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:50,420
Speaker 1: The fact is, anytime suddenly that something like that happens, it means that whoever designed the game made a mistake.

700
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:51,780
Speaker 1: The game is poorly designed.

701
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,004
Speaker 1: Don't patch it.

702
00:41:53,225 --> 00:42:00,440
Speaker 1: Any time you have a soft rule, like you can kind of say what kind of cards you got in your hand or the player has to try their best.

703
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,803
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

704
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:09,862
Speaker 0: So so, yeah, the tournament was broken, even though there's nothing fucked up.

705
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:13,462
Speaker 0: So let's talk about, you know, different kinds of tournaments and their pros and cons.

706
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,780
Speaker 1: I am a big fan when I am in tournaments of double elimination.

707
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:17,283
Speaker 1: Yes.

708
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,280
Speaker 1: Even though it's a giant pain in the ass to organize.

709
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,965
Speaker 1: Yeah.

710
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:20,999
Speaker 1: It's the most fun.

711
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,500
Speaker 1: It reduces flukeiness to a good degree.

712
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:25,300
Speaker 1: And I just really like brackets.

713
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:25,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:33,360
Speaker 0: The more you try to reduce flukeiness, you're going to run into, you know, problems of people trying to lose on purpose, you know, to get seating.

715
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:37,860
Speaker 0: So, you know, the double elimination allows you to screw up one time.

716
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:50,023
Speaker 1: You can eliminate the problem of people trying to lose on purpose by one, making sure that it is pretty much always to the player's advantage to have a better seed and two, by setting up to where.

717
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:59,019
Speaker 1: if there could be a situation where a player would be playing against someone who wanted to lose, that that match does not happen and there's a buy in the problem with advantage of better seed.

718
00:42:59,341 --> 00:42:59,622
Speaker 0: Right.

719
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:03,860
Speaker 0: Is that the the rock, paper, scissors problem, right?

720
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,620
Speaker 0: It's like, well, theoretically, any tournament have that problem.

721
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:10,400
Speaker 0: Well, for example, Street Fighter might have that problem, right?

722
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,902
Speaker 0: Where, OK, if I try hard to get the highest seed possible, they're going to put me against a guy who's worse.

723
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:22,339
Speaker 0: Oh, but that guy plays this character in this style, which is really bad for me, even though everyone else is pretty good at beating it.

724
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:27,220
Speaker 0: But I'm way better than that guy at the same time when I'm going to get seated against him.

725
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:33,619
Speaker 0: If I lose, I'll get seated against a guy who's a little better than him, but plays with a style and a character that I'm really good against.

726
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:45,119
Speaker 1: So I don't know two ways around that, because even while people try to use logic like that, one, a lot of times the skills aren't nearly I guess they're more fungible than you'd expect.

727
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,780
Speaker 1: Players can play different characters.

728
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,500
Speaker 1: It's like the sideboard and magic tournaments.

729
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,820
Speaker 1: Magic tournaments, by the way, have a fucked up magic.

730
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,440
Speaker 0: Tournaments are really fucked up there and they don't even care.

731
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,503
Speaker 1: They're just like whatever the incentivization of magic, of like sanctioned magic tournaments.

732
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,960
Speaker 1: A game theorist would shoot himself if he read.

733
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,685
Speaker 0: Let's talk about this.

734
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:05,800
Speaker 0: The reason magic tournaments are designed the way they are.

735
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,221
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:10,204
Speaker 0: I don't know too many details, but basically what they read, like four articles on this reason.

737
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:19,592
Speaker 0: OK, one of the things that they optimize for, which is pretty interesting, is, you know, you got a poker tournaments have sort of a similar thing, kind of which is the player.

738
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:19,734
Speaker 0: Right.

739
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,469
Speaker 0: A single elimination tournament.

740
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:22,980
Speaker 0: You enter, you lose immediately.

741
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:23,685
Speaker 0: You're out.

742
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,660
Speaker 0: It's like, well, that sucks.

743
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,485
Speaker 0: They're trying to give the player more enjoyment, even if they lose, so that you can play more games.

744
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:37,639
Speaker 1: You can have more fun as the people who play magic tend to go to a magic event and only play magic the whole time.

745
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,520
Speaker 0: So like I went to a magic tournament once and I did single elimination.

746
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:40,982
Speaker 0: I entered.

747
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:47,379
Speaker 0: I got my ass kicked and then I sat around and did nothing till another tournament started that I could actually cry in a magic tournament once.

748
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:48,062
Speaker 0: Right.

749
00:44:48,123 --> 00:44:51,720
Speaker 1: Because I played with a 400 card deck and I beat him anyway.

750
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:52,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

751
00:44:52,502 --> 00:45:00,180
Speaker 0: So but it's like if you were to so they make a magic tournament to where you play a bunch of games no matter what.

752
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:00,802
Speaker 0: So you're not.

753
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:05,640
Speaker 0: you enter and you have a lot of fun playing a lot of magic, even if you keep getting your ass kicked.

754
00:45:05,962 --> 00:45:12,180
Speaker 0: And so they want to optimize for that to make more people have fun at the tournaments, keep coming, keep paying to play.

755
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,226
Speaker 0: It's a pay to entry.

756
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,760
Speaker 0: You want to get your money's worth, play a lot of games.

757
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:20,280
Speaker 0: But the result is the badminton problem times a million.

758
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:25,823
Speaker 1: Now, most people are familiar with single elimination because any convention, any nerdy thing you go to.

759
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:31,600
Speaker 1: Speaking of someone who helps run big conventions, it's a pain in the ass to run a tournament and they take forever.

760
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,740
Speaker 1: Single elimination is really the only format that is even reasonably feasible to run unlimited resources.

761
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:47,799
Speaker 0: You know what my favorite kind of tournament is the everyone come up right and gets X number of tries at a thing and then you get something with a score.

762
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:52,262
Speaker 1: Those are boring because the kinds of tournaments I like are direct competition tournaments.

763
00:45:52,282 --> 00:46:01,499
Speaker 0: I do like direct competition, but, you know, it's like that tournament, though, works the best mechanically, even though it's not entertaining, you know, to really watch or be in it.

764
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:01,840
Speaker 0: Right.

765
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:06,625
Speaker 0: But like imagine if everyone played Dig Dug, you get three games, three game overs.

766
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,060
Speaker 0: Your highest score counts.

767
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,125
Speaker 0: That removes flukiness.

768
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:12,522
Speaker 0: And we just post the scores highest score at the end of the day as the winner.

769
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:17,600
Speaker 1: But much more everyone can, you know, it's much more fun is two player Dig Dug players eliminated.

770
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:20,700
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's much more entertaining to everyone involved, of course.

771
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,660
Speaker 0: But if you want to determine who's the best Dig Dug, that's a great format.

772
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:24,939
Speaker 0: It doesn't take a lot of time.

773
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,660
Speaker 0: It doesn't have any, you know, bullshit trying to lose.

774
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,920
Speaker 0: You just try to get the fucking highest score you can each time.

775
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:38,080
Speaker 1: The thing is, in well-designed tournaments, very rarely is there actually a real incentive to lose it only when they are poorly designed as this come into play.

776
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,437
Speaker 1: This badminton tournament could have been fairly easily reworked to where no one would ever have actually wanted to lose a round match.

777
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,880
Speaker 0: But I mean, there's all these factors, right?

778
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:53,480
Speaker 0: Entertainment for spectator, entertainment for player, you know, does it actually determine the true winner?

779
00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:01,982
Speaker 0: There are tournaments you could set up where they're so flawed that you might win the tournament, but might not actually be the best player there because the tournament was broken.

780
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:05,520
Speaker 0: Making sure no one tries to lose all these different things.

781
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:07,180
Speaker 0: You can't have all of them.

782
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,000
Speaker 0: You need to choose some of them above others, right?

783
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,760
Speaker 0: There is no tournament structure I've ever seen that allows for all of those things to be maximized to perfection.

784
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:16,946
Speaker 0: It does not exist.

785
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:19,940
Speaker 0: There's probably some mathematical law that it can't exist.

786
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,802
Speaker 1: I don't know.

787
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,560
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was this year or not, but apparently it won Olympics.

788
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:33,800
Speaker 1: The Japanese women's soccer team played a game to a draw on purpose because it meant that in the tournament season, they wouldn't have to travel far to the next round.

789
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,080
Speaker 0: Oh, see, more factors coming into play.

790
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:36,864
Speaker 1: Exactly.

791
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:38,420
Speaker 0: Anyway.

792
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:44,347
Speaker 1: Oh, I found a whole list of Olympic things that are almost identical to what the badminton players did.

793
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:44,997
Speaker 1: that was totally OK.

794
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:52,799
Speaker 1: Like in cycling with like getting into a peloton and slowing it down on purpose to let your teammate get ahead, stuff like that.

795
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:05,160
Speaker 1: So really what it comes down to is if you are making a tournament from a game theorist's perspective to determine the best player, there's math.

796
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:07,160
Speaker 1: Use the math and come up with the best tournament.

797
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:16,080
Speaker 1: If you're making a tournament in the real world, use the tournament that causes the most entertainment to happen for all involved.

798
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,039
Speaker 0: I thought of another example, right?

799
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:22,763
Speaker 0: Let's say it's a. you're having a tournament of a sport where you could actually become exhausted.

800
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:31,078
Speaker 0: You might want to get a seed to where you're going to play your next game later in the day to have more resting time, whereas you might see it against something you might if you win.

801
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,520
Speaker 1: You know how Quiz Bowl got around?

802
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:39,879
Speaker 0: If you win, you might see it against someone who's really bad and you're guaranteed to beat them, maybe, but you're going to have to play them pretty much right now.

803
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,441
Speaker 1: Quiz Bowl got around that by not telling you when the matches would be or where they would be.

804
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:53,039
Speaker 0: concealing, concealing information from the players is very good, because as soon as it's uncertain, your decision is arbitrary.

805
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,784
Speaker 1: But I don't feel we could do a whole separate show, I think, on specifically tournaments and conventions.

806
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,816
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, as I realize we can do tournaments and conventions.

807
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:05,580
Speaker 1: So I played in my entire life.

808
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:06,780
Speaker 1: I played in a magic tournament.

809
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:09,080
Speaker 1: I played in a Dungeons and Dragons tournament.

810
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:14,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, Michicon, like one of those hardcore like points from a settlement tournament.

811
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,220
Speaker 1: I played in the in a like sanctioned Settlers tournament.

812
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,033
Speaker 1: And until recently, I hadn't really played in any other tournaments.

813
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:29,019
Speaker 1: because when I go to a con, a tournament like I'll look at a tournament like Puerto Rico tournament, I'll be like, I guarantee I could win that show.

814
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,070
Speaker 0: I could come close.

815
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:30,699
Speaker 0: Guaranteed.

816
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,184
Speaker 0: I don't know.

817
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,159
Speaker 0: You know, defense is playing.

818
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember there's the guy's got Carcassonne tournament.

819
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can win that.

820
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:42,565
Speaker 0: But I mean, remember, there's that guy at the PAX tournaments who has like the frickin armor of medals because he just frickin plays all of them and wins everything to me.

821
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:44,500
Speaker 1: But then I look and I'm like, all right.

822
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,899
Speaker 1: Dominion Tournament, four and a half hours.

823
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:48,820
Speaker 1: And then I look in that four and a half hours.

824
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:00,240
Speaker 1: I can go get a beer and a steak, see a panel, play like two board games or different board games, not the same one times and be in a tournament that takes forever.

825
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:10,542
Speaker 0: And the thing is, you're not going to necessarily when you join a tournament, you're not necessarily going to be playing at the entire time, but you sort of have to hang around for when your next matches or maybe they'll tell you the time and you to come back.

826
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:19,503
Speaker 0: And basically you always fall behind that you're leaving and coming back constantly to play a game, play a game, leave, you know, you're playing the same game over and over.

827
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:29,542
Speaker 0: And it's kind of cool to try to win the tournament, especially if there's good prizes for the variety of the experience, not for the one tournament that takes half my day.

828
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:33,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's much better for these sorts of tournaments, you know, to be standalone.

829
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:37,622
Speaker 0: If there's a tournament in packs, it's like, well, I'm not going to do that when I get packs.

830
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:42,023
Speaker 0: But if there's just a Dominion tournament in New York City, oh, my God, that's all it is.

831
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:44,680
Speaker 0: It's like, of course, I'm going to show up.

832
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,800
Speaker 0: It's not like it's competing with anything, especially if it's in the winter or something.

833
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:58,160
Speaker 1: So crewmate row let us in on the secret, because, you know, packs one of the things they do, if you win a tournament, you get a medal, you get this huge, solid medal.

834
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want it.

835
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:01,560
Speaker 0: It's not actually that huge, but I have ones and you don't.

836
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,860
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's fucking gigantic.

837
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:11,083
Speaker 1: So what she told us was to play pick a tournament that won't take long on like Sunday morning.

838
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:11,345
Speaker 0: Yeah.

839
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:16,619
Speaker 0: When no one will show up, especially, you know, one of those tournaments for a less popular game where not too many people are going to enter.

840
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,119
Speaker 0: So they'll only be like maybe one or two rounds.

841
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:20,920
Speaker 1: So Scott and I show up for this zero tournament.

842
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:22,859
Speaker 1: We're like, all right, that's a short game, too.

843
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,220
Speaker 0: It's not a game that takes a long time.

844
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,439
Speaker 1: We're like, look, no one will show up.

845
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,868
Speaker 1: It's going to be a 50/50 chance.

846
00:51:26,888 --> 00:51:29,583
Speaker 1: one of us is getting that medal and then we can say we want a medal.

847
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:35,500
Speaker 1: Then we show up and there were a bunch of people that were actually seven people total, which is the maximum for one game of zero.

848
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,762
Speaker 0: So it actually we only had to play in the one zero and the company that publishes it was there.

849
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:44,547
Speaker 1: And they were like, look, we're using some rules that make the game not 100 percent random.

850
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,519
Speaker 1: They were really good rules.

851
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:45,881
Speaker 0: Yeah.

852
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:47,931
Speaker 0: And we played a few games and it's like you got.

853
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:56,940
Speaker 0: it was sort of like an F1 ish system where, you know, the way F1 works is you have a grand prix and you win the grand prix, which you always want to do, because why wouldn't you want to win the grand prix?

854
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:57,866
Speaker 0: No one tries to lose.

855
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:00,120
Speaker 0: If you come in first place, you get 10 points.

856
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,600
Speaker 0: If you come in second place, you get seven points.

857
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,440
Speaker 0: Whatever the points are going down to like eventually, I think, like eighth place gets one point and less than eighth place is zero points.

858
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:13,060
Speaker 0: And then you add up the points you get from all the different races.

859
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,880
Speaker 0: Never has the most points at the end of all the races wins.

860
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,395
Speaker 0: So it was a similar system like that.

861
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,960
Speaker 0: You know, a first place gets you this many points.

862
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,620
Speaker 0: So and that makes you always want to win everything.

863
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:22,863
Speaker 1: Yep.

864
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:23,980
Speaker 1: So it went really well.

865
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:32,998
Speaker 1: Now, Scott and I, you know, often talk about how bad ass we are at board games and we're very kind of full of ourselves and people who go to Nerd NYC often look at us like, uh, but then we win.

866
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:33,484
Speaker 1: Yeah.

867
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:34,518
Speaker 1: So they can't really say much.

868
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,939
Speaker 1: So we show up to this thing.

869
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,160
Speaker 1: Scott wins the first round, like ridiculously.

870
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,720
Speaker 1: I win the next round ridiculously.

871
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:45,080
Speaker 1: We pretty much tie in the third round and it was a perfect draw between me and Scott.

872
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,482
Speaker 0: Yep.

873
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:48,399
Speaker 0: So in sudden death, Me and rim had a tiebreaker and I won.

874
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,934
Speaker 1: The tiebreaker came down to one card.

875
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,364
Speaker 0: Yep.

876
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:53,159
Speaker 0: I won.

877
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:53,744
Speaker 1: Yep.

878
00:52:53,764 --> 00:52:55,980
Speaker 1: Scott won one by the flaw.

879
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:02,260
Speaker 0: And this this see this kind of tournament, the F1 style is great because number one, great entertainment for the participant.

880
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,800
Speaker 0: You get to play a lot because you can just keep playing to add up more points.

881
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:12,159
Speaker 0: You know, suddenly halfway through the the games, the other the guy in first could start losing and you could start winning and you can come back.

882
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:18,502
Speaker 0: It's also great for the spectator because every match is most of them are really interesting.

883
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:25,680
Speaker 0: The problem it has is that problem of losing guy can screw things up for winning guy.

884
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:34,543
Speaker 0: You could be like, you know, for example, maybe the last ground free of the season doesn't matter because the guy already has so many points, even if he disqualifies himself.

885
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:36,055
Speaker 0: And there's a great place.

886
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:36,760
Speaker 0: guy wins.

887
00:53:37,022 --> 00:53:38,059
Speaker 0: He still wins the holes.

888
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,160
Speaker 1: There is a great video from some race.

889
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,490
Speaker 1: It was on College Humor a while ago.

890
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,660
Speaker 1: It was something like it wasn't ground free.

891
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,259
Speaker 1: It was like some minor circuit racing.

892
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,399
Speaker 1: Like and basically a guy got passed and he wasn't going to win.

893
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,540
Speaker 1: So he cut across the grass and rammed his rival.

894
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:53,222
Speaker 0: Yup.

895
00:53:53,964 --> 00:54:00,700
Speaker 0: You know, let's say rim is in first place and he's going to win the championship as well as the Grand Prix.

896
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,320
Speaker 0: But if he comes in second place or less, he will not win the championship.

897
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:09,579
Speaker 0: So, you know, he's coming up to to pass me.

898
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:10,205
Speaker 0: Right.

899
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:11,660
Speaker 0: So I'm lapped.

900
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,347
Speaker 0: I'm losing.

901
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:13,580
Speaker 0: I'm so many points away.

902
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:18,704
Speaker 0: Even if I won the race and everyone else crashed, I would not win the championship going backwards.

903
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:27,644
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I'll just freaking get in front of rim and not let him pass me until the second place guy can catch up to him or crash into rim or do whatever I can to make rim not first place.

904
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:41,268
Speaker 0: And then I someone who is lost can have an influence, has no chance of winning, can have a huge influence on who wins the championship, you know, because I can throw a monkey wrench in there because I'm still participating, even though my chances of winning the whole thing, well-designed

905
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:44,167
Speaker 1: games and well-designed tournaments minimize the possibility.

906
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:44,976
Speaker 0: You know what they do in F1.

907
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,360
Speaker 0: Actually, F1 has a very clever in-game solution, the blue flag, which is you're getting lapped like the first place guy comes around you.

908
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,527
Speaker 0: They wave the blue flag at you.

909
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,280
Speaker 0: You have to let him go or else you're fucked.

910
00:54:56,103 --> 00:54:57,959
Speaker 0: So that's not the worst solution in the world.

911
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

912
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:05,100
Speaker 1: Like in Suro, it could have been a problem because people who aren't winning around could trivially just attack and kill someone who's doing well.

913
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,582
Speaker 0: That's true.

914
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:16,377
Speaker 1: And I think the only reason that didn't happen was that basically Scott and I were trash talking each other the entire time to such an epic degree that everyone else was kind of just sitting back watching us.

915
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:16,821
Speaker 1: Yeah.

916
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:18,007
Speaker 0: You know, that's another thing.

917
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:26,447
Speaker 0: is you have to consider the game itself, right, is not, you know, is for different, even though you have the same exact tournament structure, which will have the same flaws.

918
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:31,640
Speaker 0: no matter what the game is, certain games like it might be impossible to try to lose on purpose.

919
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:39,400
Speaker 0: You know, it's like there's no way in this game for me to lose on purpose or there is no way in this game for me to attack another player.

920
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:40,699
Speaker 0: I can't bring anyone down.

921
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:44,040
Speaker 0: So even though if I could do that, it would mess the tournament up.

922
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:45,719
Speaker 0: There's no way in game to do it.

923
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,663
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter.

924
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:57,439
Speaker 0: And you want to match up the tournament to the kind of game it is to take advantages of those characteristics, you know, to match them up with the flaws of the tournament so you can get a better result.

925
00:55:59,041 --> 00:55:59,243
Speaker 0: All right.

926
00:55:59,304 --> 00:56:00,780
Speaker 0: Anything else to say about the tournament?

927
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,262
Speaker 1: Not really.

928
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should get the video.

929
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,499
Speaker 1: I have all the video from that outlaw tournament, which, as I recall, I won.

930
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:12,160
Speaker 0: OK, but yeah, tournaments are awesome.

931
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,080
Speaker 0: They're a game in and of themselves.

932
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,182
Speaker 1: Sheriff in town.

933
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:22,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I suggest you, you know, try to experiment with different kinds of tournaments, you know, or just study tournament theory and read a book.

934
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,466
Speaker 0: And yeah, there are.

935
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:25,739
Speaker 0: But I mean, there are lots of weird ones out there.

936
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:39,880
Speaker 0: It's like find a short game to play with your friends, like spot it or even rock, paper, scissors or tic tac toe or something that tic tac toe and, you know, play a tournament with your friends and, you know, make the game the tournament and not the game itself.

937
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:42,139
Speaker 0: And you could actually have quite a bit of fun.

938
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:48,320
Speaker 0: And when you win the whole thing, you feel way more like a champion than if you just win one game or like, for example, but you know what?

939
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,843
Speaker 1: My favorite actual form of tournament is, even though we don't really do anything with it, challenges.

940
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:55,940
Speaker 1: I challenge you for the title.

941
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,320
Speaker 1: I challenge you for the rank per wrestling time.

942
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should do that with board games.

943
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,540
Speaker 0: Someone holds on to the championship.

944
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,584
Speaker 0: They're the champion.

945
00:57:03,725 --> 00:57:09,880
Speaker 0: Why don't we determine some by the first game and then you have to beat the champion to take the belt away from the champion.

946
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,240
Speaker 1: I feel like we should do that in our own group just for like Tigger's and Euphrates.

947
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,450
Speaker 0: The best thing about that method is that you don't need any seating because the basically just have two people playing.

948
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,460
Speaker 0: whoever wins is the champion.

949
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,840
Speaker 0: And then if you could beat the champion, now you're the new champion.

950
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:32,880
Speaker 1: The problem is, is that the person in the order of multiple challenges or that too often do I just challenge Scott every day until he gets pissed off and rises just like that.

951
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:39,880
Speaker 0: The chair, whoever is the current champion, ends up getting worn out and might lose to someone who challenges later.

952
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:41,200
Speaker 0: Like I just got the championship.

953
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,842
Speaker 0: You challenge.

954
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 1: That's why you make a laddered structure of challenges where you can't challenge Mike Tyson in round one of punch out.

955
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,900
Speaker 1: You get to beat all these other MOOCs first.

956
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,322
Speaker 0: That's right.

957
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,440
Speaker 0: Like in boxing, it'll be like, OK, you want to challenge the champ, right?

958
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,980
Speaker 0: Well, you actually have to win this other tournament.

959
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,420
Speaker 0: And by winning that other tournament against a bunch of MOOCs, you earn the prize in that tournament is the right to challenge the champ.

960
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:12,540
Speaker 0: So it's like whoever wins this whole thing, the best of these guys with a regular single elimination tournament, then gets to play the champ to be the champ.

961
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,480
Speaker 0: That is good to be the champ because the champ doesn't have to play in the tournament.

962
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:16,920
Speaker 0: So he's super not tired.

963
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:20,800
Speaker 0: And now the reverse problem of dude just fought like six fights in a tournament.

964
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:22,440
Speaker 0: Now he's going to fight the champ.

965
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,839
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, champs got a big advantage.

966
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:26,660
Speaker 1: It's a nice that I'm in the sheriff.

967
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:29,388
Speaker 0: Sheriff of what?

968
00:58:29,428 --> 00:58:30,455
Speaker 0: Sheriff of Foxton?

969
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:34,909
Speaker 1: A sheriff.

970
00:58:35,574 --> 00:58:36,420
Speaker 1: Sheriff of nothing.

971
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:44,300
