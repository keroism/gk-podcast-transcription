Speaker 1: that's the kind of topic we did them back in like 2006 2007. we used to host a lot of parties and stuff back then like actually kind of way more than we do now Mmm, but also it's interesting that we we were trying to think I would do the show today And we have forgot that we had that ongoing series how to not suck at something that

8
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:44,477
Speaker 0: seemed

9
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:47,448
Speaker 1: pretty popular back Then like and we just kind of stopped doing it.

10
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,071
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

11
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,384
Speaker 1: I don't think we ran out of ideas I don't know why we stopped.

12
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,849
Speaker 1: so I think we're gonna start.

13
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,220
Speaker 1: how to not suck at doing episodes on how to not suck at things.

14

00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:08,519
Speaker 0: Now that you're done talking about nothing I got some somethings.

17
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,025
Speaker 1: You want a thing.

18
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,780
Speaker 1: so my pebble broke and I'm getting a replacement.

19
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,285
Speaker 0: You have had that happen.

20
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,047
Speaker 1: so the pebble.

21
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:20,549
Speaker 0: I had the very first pebble ever and the screen just like flip the fuck out and Then they sent me a new one eventually.

22
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,516
Speaker 1: so the pebble.

23
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,100
Speaker 1: I have the pebbles.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,350
Speaker 0: They didn't want the old one back.

25
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,640
Speaker 1: I have the pebble time steal series.

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,280
Speaker 1: they're making me send it back, but I Have had it for a long time, and it's waterproof, and they make a big deal on the website.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,183
Speaker 1: They're like wear it at the beach wear it in the pool Wear it.

28
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:36,951
Speaker 1: it is a hundred percent waterproof.

29
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:38,720
Speaker 1: thirty meters down go nuts.

30
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:45,620
Speaker 1: So we're at the beach And I had it on and I jump into the water and the screen immediately goes apeshit and it dies.

31
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,562
Speaker 1: So like Literally like.

32
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:54,379
Speaker 1: it starts buzzing constantly, and I look and the buzzer is like squirting water out the top of it.

33
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,460
Speaker 1: I'm just like really like didn't even pretend to be waterproof.

34
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:12,055
Speaker 1: So I do the warranty thing and they respond back and they're like so before we're gonna accept the warranty you need to take a video of you attempting to charge it and Trying to turn it on and proving that it won't turn on.

35
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:20,085
Speaker 1: and I was like Okay, I made this video of like it not turning on and I sent it to them, and then they're like okay I'll give you a new one

36
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,233
Speaker 0: okay, but then

37
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:32,740
Speaker 1: they asked me something interesting Mmm, and this is actually I don't know if you're aware of this Extreme design flaw of the pebble which is not relevant to what happened to me because I can see the top seal here.

38
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,169
Speaker 1: I'm just not sealed.

39
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,639
Speaker 1: like you can see it's not sealed.

40
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:41,519
Speaker 1: But if the pebbles in water and you push any of the buttons immediate ruin.

41
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,733
Speaker 1: The buttons are not waterproof.

42
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,159
Speaker 1: if you press them That's something that they bury and hide.

43
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:50,254
Speaker 1: But that is a an explicit little design flaw of all the pebble.

44
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:54,636
Speaker 0: so if you push the button in the water Fucked just ruins it and they won't give you.

45
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:59,740
Speaker 1: if you do I don't know if they will or not but in my case I can clearly see that that is not what happened.

46
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:05,888
Speaker 1: So I don't have to worry about that like if I push on it Yeah, I'm not planning to go swimming anyway.

47
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was an interesting thing that happened to me at the beach.

48
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:11,504
Speaker 1: Cuz it starts buzzing.

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,430
Speaker 1: I'm like who's calling me while I'm in the water.

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,038
Speaker 1: I'm like oh pebble warranty is calling me.

51
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,563
Speaker 0: I guess Okay News time.

52
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,871
Speaker 0: I guess a big news happened.

53
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:22,293
Speaker 1: Well.

54
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,393
Speaker 1: You were the one who was bitching for like ten minutes, Bob There's no news at all in the world right now.

55
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,224
Speaker 0: I found a news Super important news.

56
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:30,327
Speaker 1: how important could this be?

57
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:42,195
Speaker 0: the National Hockey League is going to officially and definitely create Yet another hockey team in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada.

58
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,580
Speaker 0: This is a done deal.

59
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:49,380
Speaker 1: Now what sucks is that this team should be called the Stars, but that name is already taken.

60
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,389
Speaker 0: Okay, so first of all right issue.

61
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker 0: the first we need less hockey teams not more hockey team.

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,036
Speaker 0: Yes issue the second they could have just moved the Arizona team to Las Vegas.

63
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:02,054
Speaker 0: Yep Number three we just need less hockey teams.

64
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:02,295
Speaker 0: They should.

65
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,858
Speaker 0: what they really should do is get rid of Arizona team and probably a few others.

66
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,753
Speaker 1: now I'm actually like I. while I kind of want to do less hockey teams I feel like we're at a pretty good level like if we didn't expand.

67
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:13,520
Speaker 1: I feel like this is sustained anyway.

68
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,591
Speaker 0: Another issue that requires the some amount of discussion.

69
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:19,360
Speaker 1: right no one lives in Vegas who cares about hockey.

70
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:24,880
Speaker 0: No, there is going to be an expansion draft which basically means each team.

71
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,675
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go over the specific rules.

72
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,925
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I've never I've never paid.

73
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,751
Speaker 1: it's like expansion drafts are not common.

74
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,413
Speaker 0: you can it.

75
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:39,540
Speaker 0: you can read these specific rules for the expansion draft Online, but basically the deal is each team can protect a certain number of players from its team.

76
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,817
Speaker 0: So basically you're like if you're you know the Rangers you saying you can't have our loan quest.

77
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:45,540
Speaker 0: he's ours.

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,924
Speaker 0: Don't touch this right.

79
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:55,130
Speaker 0: and then there are certain players that have like no move clauses or no trade clauses in their contracts And those players you have to protect like you can't decide.

80
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,246
Speaker 0: you have to spend one of your protections on them because you're forced to Because you made that contract.

81
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:00,111
Speaker 0: so what if?

82
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,560
Speaker 0: and then what if you had?

83
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:06,140
Speaker 1: All your contracts had no move somehow, and you've only got in protection.

84
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,640
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of rules.

85
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:14,680
Speaker 0: The expansion team can go around and they just take players for everyone to make their own team.

86
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:18,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's how that works, and then you have to fill in your slots with a shell people.

87
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,497
Speaker 1: so imagine this You're gonna have a team now.

88
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,253
Speaker 1: That is a whole bunch of people who have fought with each other in the past.

89
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:25,980
Speaker 1: some of them probably hate each other.

90
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,299
Speaker 0: I mean that's no different than any other trade deal.

91
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:33,460
Speaker 1: Uh the difference is in a trade you get like one player in exchange for a player.

92
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:42,012
Speaker 0: This is a team composed of nothing, but those people anyway, so then All these people have to go to Las Vegas to play hockey right.

93
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:45,946
Speaker 0: so the deal that the big deal is The gambling situation right.

94
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:49,355
Speaker 0: so that's the whole reason you choose Vegas because Vegas is actually.

95
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,160
Speaker 1: I don't think that's the reason you choose Vegas.

96
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,591
Speaker 1: I've learned a lot about this.

97
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:56,120
Speaker 0: so Vegas It's a big city with no sports teams.

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,638
Speaker 1: No, professional sports team gambling in Vegas has been on a steep decline for a decade.

99
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:07,776
Speaker 0: that is true but Sports gambling in general is on the rise.

100
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:08,700
Speaker 0: that is also true.

101
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,500
Speaker 0: It is the only kind of gambling that freakin matters anymore than anyone cares about now.

102
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,169
Speaker 1: There is a side angle here Vegas.

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:22,960
Speaker 1: the way they make money now is hospitality and spectacles and Hockey in Vegas is actually perfect for a spectacle.

104
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,078
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of games there.

105
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:29,558
Speaker 0: So if you're suddenly all these real hockey teams have to go there yep like they're gonna have away games and fucking.

106
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:30,080
Speaker 0: so think it is.

107
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:36,484
Speaker 0: If the Rangers are in Vegas for a game I guarantee there's once a year at most because this is the West vs The East.

108
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,050
Speaker 1: is it once or twice it might be?

109
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,235
Speaker 1: I mean, I think twice.

110
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,380
Speaker 0: yeah Vegas will come to the garden.

111
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,575
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, no one will go to see you get cheap tickets.

112
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,744
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You can't get cheap.

113
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,166
Speaker 1: It doesn't be.

114
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:46,252
Speaker 1: I don't care if it's the Sabres.

115
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,680
Speaker 1: you still can't get a cheap Rangers ticket.

116
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:59,272
Speaker 1: The Sabres are better than Vegas but so if the Rangers are in Vegas for their game there I Guarantee there's at least a couple thousand Rangers fans.

117
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,280
Speaker 1: I happen to be in Vegas at the time.

118
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:08,604
Speaker 0: It's a. Vegas will be way cheap Yeah, but they'll be like, oh you can go to Vegas in the winter Which is a place you want to go in the winter and see cheap hockey I also think.

119
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:14,571
Speaker 0: and then you can sell the high kids to have gambling machines at the hockey arena Just like they did in Australia at the footy field.

120
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anytime there's a game in Vegas They're just gonna be gonna score a goal first.

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,305
Speaker 0: Who's gonna score the most goals?

122
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:23,220
Speaker 1: which players gonna score first, but hey tourists you want to see Penn and Teller?

123
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,339
Speaker 0: You want to see who's gonna serve the most penalty minutes?

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Speaker 1: I think that the audience of the Vegas stars is gonna be like any given game is gonna be Vegas not stars.

125
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:33,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just calling the Vegas stars for now.

126
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,380
Speaker 1: Emily thinks they should be called the aces.

127
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:38,328
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

128
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 1: I want to call them the Mavericks.

129
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,631
Speaker 0: There's already a Dallas man basketball.

130
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,138
Speaker 1: Well basketball not the same.

131
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:45,449
Speaker 0: What?

132
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:45,716
Speaker 0: what?

133
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:52,987
Speaker 0: The only team that there I know of that I can think of right now where the same name is in two different leagues Not counting minor league the Cardinals.

134
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:53,530
Speaker 0: They're the st.

135
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,443
Speaker 0: Louis Cardinals of the house ball in the Arizona Cardinals of Football.

136
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,027
Speaker 1: that is true.

137
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,079
Speaker 1: I can't think of any more unless you count minor leagues.

138
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:06,040
Speaker 0: And that doesn't count because there's a million stupid giants the San Francisco Giants and the New York football giant.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:15,396
Speaker 0: I did not know there was a San Francisco Giants the baseball team and then they used the World Series recently I guess I guess I pay attention to baseball is also used to be the New York Giants of baseball.

140
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:16,500
Speaker 0: that no longer exists.

141
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:23,984
Speaker 0: Let's bring them back Mm-hmm, I think instead of expanding in Vegas someone's gonna tell me that there's another one that I forgot There should be.

142
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,139
Speaker 1: we should just expand into Bronx or Queens.

143
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,326
Speaker 1: Have a third hockey team here.

144
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,475
Speaker 0: No, the Islanders are already garbage.

145
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,724
Speaker 1: You don't need yeah But at least there's more.

146
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:40,280
Speaker 1: it spreads a little bit of hockey out because the Rangers you just can't see unless you got an inside Line, but there's rain the Texas Rangers and the New York Rangers.

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,502
Speaker 1: But this audience is gonna be like a third the people in Vegas who decide they like they care about hockey and that's gonna be Their team.

148
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:51,480
Speaker 1: it's gonna be a third tourist who've never seen ice hockey before who are like, yeah, I'll see an ice hockey game.

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,548
Speaker 1: It's part of my Vegas thing.

150
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:53,173
Speaker 1: Whatever cool.

151
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:54,000
Speaker 1: It's a spectacle.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,923
Speaker 1: I'll go watch this thing.

153
00:08:55,264 --> 00:09:02,827
Speaker 1: and the last third will be fans of whatever the other team is who happen to be in Vegas And we'll see how this all goes.

154
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,560
Speaker 1: I don't predict they'll win a Stanley Cup in my lifetime.

155
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,768
Speaker 0: You know, that's the main.

156
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,794
Speaker 0: that's the last point.

157
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:09,739
Speaker 0: right is like there.

158
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,095
Speaker 0: now We really can't have Vegas with the name on the Stanley Cup.

159
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,823
Speaker 0: that can't happen Like.

160
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:16,972
Speaker 0: it cannot be allowed but it's possible.

161
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,720
Speaker 0: and what are you gonna do if it happens?

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,380
Speaker 1: No, like I feel like old enemies like the Rangers and Islanders will somehow collaborate to prevent Vegas from getting right.

163
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:31,368
Speaker 0: And but you know, hey if I go to Vegas in the winter, which is a most likely to go in the winter I'll go see a hockey game for cheap.

164
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would see it's readily available.

165
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:35,344
Speaker 1: You know what?

166
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:41,632
Speaker 1: Even if it was like Sabres and the Vegas Mavericks I would probably go see it cuz it's Vegas.

167
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,315
Speaker 1: What else are gonna do?

168
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:45,509
Speaker 1: gonna see Ben and Teller You're gonna eat a bunch of fancy food.

169
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,277
Speaker 1: You're gonna wander around watch a fountain.

170
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:47,678
Speaker 1: do a thing.

171
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,308
Speaker 1: Have you been to Vegas in your adult life?

172
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:50,769
Speaker 0: Nope.

173
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,234
Speaker 1: Have you been to Vegas ever?

174
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:52,596
Speaker 0: Nope.

175
00:09:52,937 --> 00:10:02,372
Speaker 1: Oh it Talked to us a long time ago, but the way it's way more fun and nicer than I expected But also like 80% exactly what I expected.

176
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:08,177
Speaker 0: Like there's the Florida Panthers of hockey and the Carolina Panthers of the NFL.

177
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,837
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I didn't even think of them.

178
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:26,253
Speaker 1: So other minor news is This is more video game news but it's kind of relevant to Real life because if even if you're not like someone who would self-describe as a video gamer And I'm not I don't even know if this game is good because I haven't actually played it except a demo.

179
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:40,891
Speaker 1: but this game the NFL New York Jets and the Winnipeg Jets Playing the Harford Whalers down in hell.

180
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:48,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, so VA - one one HALL - a. it's this video game that

181
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,900
Speaker 0: we've been waiting for for years

182
00:10:50,461 --> 00:11:07,115
Speaker 1: based solely on having played a like two-minute demo of it and being told what it is and it's basically a Papers-pleased style game coupled with a visual novel set in a cyber dystopia That is so close to the Idoro world that I'm kind of like a shot.

183
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:20,335
Speaker 0: It's pixel anime style But as far as I can tell from the you know information I have gathered these part where you make the drinks Papers-pleased acts as like a skill like clicking fast almost right?

184
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, this doesn't have that.

185
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,886
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's basically.

186
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,192
Speaker 0: it's more like Phoenix, right?

187
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:24,373
Speaker 0: Like.

188
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:34,006
Speaker 1: it's just a visual novel mostly Yeah but based on the drinks you make for people and how you interact with them like stuff will go differently and I can't say the game's good.

189
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:43,240
Speaker 0: We haven't played it, but I've been waiting for this game for a long time Installed it the day it came out because I pre-ordered it But I just haven't had time to play it because it's summer and I'm outside all the time.

190
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:47,640
Speaker 1: It looks like the kind of game that I'm gonna really really really really like.

191
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,483
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to.

192
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:52,257
Speaker 0: I'm gonna stream it with my new equips and it's weird and different enough to where.

193
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:56,127
Speaker 1: even if you don't think You like video games This is the kind of thing that you should try.

194
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,730
Speaker 1: it might broaden your horizons on what it means to say This is a video game.

195
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,038
Speaker 1: Hmm Even if the game is bad at least be interesting and I suspect it's not gonna be bad.

196
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,767
Speaker 1: No Other interesting stuff that's been going on.

197
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:16,217
Speaker 1: So Scott said there's no news, but literally right now Britain is having a referendum on whether or not they're going to leave the European Union.

198
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,865
Speaker 0: don't care You don't care at all.

199
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:18,588
Speaker 0: next next news.

200
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:21,120
Speaker 1: You need you even know like what that entails or what that means.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,206
Speaker 1: What is the European Union?

202
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:23,855
Speaker 0: Scott don't care next?

203
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:24,600
Speaker 1: Okay, really?

204
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,946
Speaker 1: So you have no this.

205
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:27,910
Speaker 1: Okay.

206
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,299
Speaker 1: This is why Scott doesn't ever think there's any news.

207
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,785
Speaker 0: There's nothing to say about this.

208
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,411
Speaker 1: There's a lot to say about that.

209
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,739
Speaker 0: Nothing to need to say that hasn't already been said.

210
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,067
Speaker 1: Continue by that logic.

211
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,712
Speaker 1: No one should ever make any more media cuz.

212
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,497
Speaker 1: every concept has ever ever been expressed.

213
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:42,863
Speaker 1: at some point in some Form.

214
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:43,931
Speaker 1: you're just rewriting.

215
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,279
Speaker 0: I don't watch a lot of our media old man Scott.

216
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:55,499
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

217
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,190
Speaker 1: I stumbled onto these videos and they're actually pretty pleasant.

218
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,270
Speaker 1: They're called like oddly satisfying and it's just a serious kind of like gifts with sound but longer form.

219
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:19,070
Speaker 1: But it'll show like just a machine making cakes in close-up detail or like this one right here a guy has set up like 40 balls all over snow pool table and then he throws one ball with his hand and it bounces around like crazy.

220
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,338
Speaker 1: It doesn't hit any of them.

221
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:26,025
Speaker 1: and all these just like really Satisfying videos to watch like a master chef has been around for a while.

222
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:26,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a thing.

223
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:28,302
Speaker 1: It's one of those YouTube ghettos.

224
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,130
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

225
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,926
Speaker 0: I mean this has been a thing like this is even older than YouTube right?

226
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:38,825
Speaker 0: this kind of stuff like I remember like even in high school seeing like JPEGs or like animated gifs of like stuff that was like, whoa.

227
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was animated gifs I think we call.

228
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:43,810
Speaker 1: I used to see it was gear porn cuz it was just complex gear.

229
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, awesome thing.

230
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,361
Speaker 0: Okay, and it was all it was called.

231
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:49,878
Speaker 0: even back then it was called oddly satisfied But that's not my thing of the day.

232
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,810
Speaker 1: This is oh my thing of the day.

233
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,390
Speaker 1: Is that someone did something brilliant and this is the cut?

234
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:55,871
Speaker 1: This is like.

235
00:13:56,152 --> 00:14:00,830
Speaker 1: this is the most beautiful troll in the world because it's creative and interesting.

236
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:05,574
Speaker 1: They call it the most Unsatisfying.

237
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,870
Speaker 0: those things like an OCD person goes it's things that just don't work out.

238
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen these two.

239
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:12,048
Speaker 1: like he starts to go and then it just falls.

240
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:13,470
Speaker 0: I've seen this exact one.

241
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,509
Speaker 1: I think I guys about to catch his finger in a mousetrap in slow motion and just before it snaps the gif ends.

242
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,787
Speaker 1: Someone slowly failing at Tetris to tourists throwing a frisbee the wrong way over and over and over again.

243
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:28,315
Speaker 0: clearly not Understand the museum exhibit.

244
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,844
Speaker 0: I wanted to make the guy place sitting there playing Mario badly.

245
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:33,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can't stop him He's just doing it.

246
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, just keeps touching that first Goomba or whatever.

247
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:36,710
Speaker 0: over and over it's falling a hole.

248
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,246
Speaker 0: You know, I guess he can get to the first hole and fall in.

249
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:42,370
Speaker 1: occasionally He has to get to the first hole and then fall in like he gets a little bit further.

250
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,514
Speaker 1: You're like maybe he's got it.

251
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he's not improving right?

252
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,730
Speaker 0: It's some some performer some performance art, right?

253
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,390
Speaker 0: They're not improving.

254
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,679
Speaker 0: They just keep sucking and not getting anywhere significant.

255
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,729
Speaker 1: one of these is just Mario like trying to jump up onto a thing You're just failing forever.

256
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,657
Speaker 1: It's it's beautiful.

257
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,005
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:07,050
Speaker 0: So yeah so I Felt like I used this thing of the day, but I guess I didn't so I couldn't find it in a search.

259
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,095
Speaker 1: So this is a duplicate.

260
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,005
Speaker 0: is here's a bunch of old awesome.

261
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:10,870
Speaker 0: Yes rooms fault.

262
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:17,444
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of awesome old woodblock prints, which are my favorite You know old Japanese artworks and all these artworks of something in common.

263
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:22,259
Speaker 0: They depict people Flipping over go boards as in like.

264
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,250
Speaker 0: when you flip the table because you're pissed you lost risk and shit.

265
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,162
Speaker 0: Let's go with the game they played.

266
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:27,987
Speaker 0: So that's the thing.

267
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:28,450
Speaker 0: They're flipping.

268
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,570
Speaker 0: I'm sure they would be flipping other might be a shogi board in here somewhere.

269
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:37,281
Speaker 0: No, it looks like I'll go boards, but it tells you Flipping the table is not something new.

270
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:41,790
Speaker 0: It is a century-old multi-century old behavior.

271
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:49,750
Speaker 0: right and It's kind of cool to see you know, someone in ancient times exhibiting a behavior of the modern times.

272
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,847
Speaker 1: Yep, because humans have not changed substantially in terms of our brains for like 40,000 years.

273
00:15:55,691 --> 00:16:01,338
Speaker 1: So even though society is advancing all that time We haven't so much physically.

274
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:04,710
Speaker 1: so the same but I virtually bullshit that we do now.

275
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,845
Speaker 1: You know some go master would do and troll the other guy.

276
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,073
Speaker 1: a hundred or a thousand You might not a thousand.

277
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:20,330
Speaker 0: what I wonder though is like how come there aren't like depictions of like, you know Dudes flipping over chess tables of like, you know, some like European arts.

278
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,175
Speaker 0: I've never seen that.

279
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:27,086
Speaker 1: maybe they less really less angry one Maybe there are but to wood blocks were kind of a pop art thing.

280
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:27,770
Speaker 0: That's true.

281
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:33,890
Speaker 0: That's not the kind of thing you would paint you would you know, if you're someone's paid, you know patron by somebody.

282
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you saw that thing.

283
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,410
Speaker 1: I was gonna use the thing today later.

284
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,330
Speaker 1: It's an explanation of why in medieval art babies look like frumpy old men and then suddenly in the Renaissance babies look good.

285
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,618
Speaker 1: It's not because people couldn't draw babies.

286
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,143
Speaker 1: They drew them ugly on purpose.

287
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,070
Speaker 1: because of all these stupid societal reasons.

288
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,636
Speaker 1: I'll use that as my thing of the night.

289
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,384
Speaker 0: I'm curious of those societal reasons.

290
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:54,710
Speaker 1: It's a real good video.

291
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,185
Speaker 0: I can just go to the museum and find out.

292
00:16:56,205 --> 00:17:00,279
Speaker 1: yeah In the meta moment Connecticut is July 7th 8th.

293
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,603
Speaker 1: Well, it's 8th 9th and 10th.

294
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,348
Speaker 1: You can pick up your badge on the 7th.

295
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,326
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's anything on the 7th.

296
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,845
Speaker 0: We're not responsible like to advertise that it's on the 7th and they'll put like.

297
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:15,230
Speaker 0: I mean last year They had like the meager amount of late Programming or something on the so just able to say that it was for day.

298
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,515
Speaker 1: What was interesting?

299
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:17,519
Speaker 1: like we were shocked.

300
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,569
Speaker 1: we scheduled like four panels like Thursday afternoon and evening.

301
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:24,465
Speaker 1: There was a surprising number of people who showed up by surprising.

302
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,237
Speaker 1: We mean five Like 40 or 50.

303
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:27,980

Speaker 1: we counted them together.

307
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:34,010
Speaker 1: We remarked on how crazy it was that there were so many people.

308
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,810
Speaker 1: I even have the spreadsheet with the numbers and our notes.

309
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,496
Speaker 0: some sad people.

310
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:41,779
Speaker 1: You were off by a full order of magnitude.

311
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,607
Speaker 0: Also a lot of those people weren't people.

312
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,452
Speaker 0: they're so sad Alright.

Speaker 1: We did one of those panels.

315
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,795
Speaker 0: I Thought we bailed on it.

316
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,560
Speaker 0: No, we did it.

317
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:53,290
Speaker 0: I don't remember this weed now.

318
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:56,346
Speaker 0: I remember being in this room and there are a few people and I was like, holy fuck.

319
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:57,110
Speaker 0: Why is anyone here?

320
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,739
Speaker 0: Did everyone leave Jesus people?

321
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,370
Speaker 1: there were like 40 people whatever.

322
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:05,160
Speaker 0: anyway Don't go to convention on Thursday.

323
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,105
Speaker 0: It's not like it's pegs.

324
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,090
Speaker 1: Can I count is pretty fun.

325
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,059
Speaker 1: The schedules must be up mostly up online.

326
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,556
Speaker 1: the font for the schedule I got nothing to do with.

327
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,547
Speaker 1: do not come to me with that.

328
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,538
Speaker 1: that is Outside of my control on this convention.

329
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:19,445
Speaker 1: All I do is schedule all the panels.

330
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:20,930
Speaker 1: I do not do anything else.

331
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,479
Speaker 1: So if you have any complaint about anything you can add account.

332
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:24,101
Speaker 1: that is not.

333
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,389
Speaker 1: why didn't you schedule a panel on X?

334
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:28,518
Speaker 0: Go to someone.

335
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,830
Speaker 0: answer to that is cuz it sucked.

336
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:32,500
Speaker 1: No, the answer to that is because no one submitted anything.

337
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,290
Speaker 1: also like kind of interesting.

338
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:37,907
Speaker 1: No one submitted anything related to ponies like at all.

339
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,659
Speaker 0: like that's gone I think I haven't even watched the news season to ponies at all.

340
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,723
Speaker 1: I watched a couple episodes.

341
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:42,205
Speaker 1: It's going.

342
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:48,100
Speaker 1: it's steady-state entertaining but Not as good as continuing adventure time.

343
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,510
Speaker 0: I also got when what's the newest adventure time?

344
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,016
Speaker 1: There's been a bunch shits gonna.

345
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,764
Speaker 1: do you know what happened to Finn sword?

346
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:54,708
Speaker 1: the Finn sword?

347
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,407
Speaker 1: Maybe the one that is Finn?

348
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:03,156
Speaker 0: I Remember seeing something happened to it.

349
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,862
Speaker 1: something happened to it.

350
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,347
Speaker 0: I don't know how new that is though.

351
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,310
Speaker 0: Did something else happen?

352
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,242
Speaker 1: Alright, uh, did anything happen with the crown?

353
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,010
Speaker 1: Did anyone go inside the crown?

354
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,574
Speaker 0: Inside of it.

355
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, your name stole it.

356
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're way behind on adventure time.

357
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:30,006
Speaker 1: Adventure time, you know I like Steven Universe but adventure time has gone on so much longer and is still like the freshest show Like it just never gets stale and I'm curious if they're gonna keep that up.

358
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:33,479
Speaker 1: Hmm But yeah pony stuff not represented.

359
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,169
Speaker 1: old people only submitted undertale because I asked him to.

360
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,964
Speaker 1: There was like two people submitted.

361
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:39,286
Speaker 1: Dr.

362
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:42,816
Speaker 1: Who things There was still a Hetalia.

363
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:44,220
Speaker 1: ask a nation, but only one.

364
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,287
Speaker 1: Like the Hetalia stuff mostly disappeared.

365
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,740
Speaker 1: there was a ton of homestuck submission still but they were all ask a homestuck.

366
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,732
Speaker 1: Literally not one of them looked like it was actually a panel.

367
00:19:54,752 --> 00:20:02,989
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and otherwise Most of the submissions that I got cuz remember while it's a pretty big con It's a generic con like it's one of the few cons.

368
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,720
Speaker 1: That is all the stuff and is pretty big.

369
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:11,676
Speaker 1: I'd say it was about a third anime submissions and Almost everything else was gaming related.

370
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:14,047
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm like gaming is the primary thing.

371
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:25,929
Speaker 1: anyone submits panels for now other than cosplay and I suspect that's because gaming cons traditionally didn't have a lot of panels and Pack sort of changed that and now there's a lot of gaming panels.

372
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:27,875
Speaker 0: I mean people also.

373
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:29,399
Speaker 0: everyone plays games, right?

374
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:36,520
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like the universal nerdery But like for whatever reason gaming culture has a big panel making component.

375
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:38,920
Speaker 1: That is second only to the anime culture.

376
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,066
Speaker 1: But the anime fans.

377
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:46,412
Speaker 1: I have a lot more anime cons that are Less professional or lower level enough to accept their like.

378
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,500
Speaker 1: I I'm a punk kid wanting to a panel.

379
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:52,720
Speaker 1: There aren't as many gaming cons that will accept the punk kid who wants to do a panel.

380
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:59,240
Speaker 1: So as a result all those gaming panels that are like mid-tier are ending up at conventions like kinetic on which is interesting.

381
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,860
Speaker 1: A lot of them look pretty good actually.

382
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:09,379
Speaker 1: But I think more panels were submitted about gaming than any other topic and of those I think it was a 50/50 split between tabletop and video.

383
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:14,880
Speaker 1: Otherwise, the book load book will be Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake gonna read it soon.

384
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,479
Speaker 1: I am in the last hundred pages of the Wheel of Time.

385
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,830
Speaker 1: Andral busted out.

386
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,240
Speaker 1: He did the thing and it was pretty good.

387
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,969
Speaker 1: I know you don't know who that is.

388
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,300
Speaker 1: Do you remember anyone from the Wheel of Time?

389
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:27,740
Speaker 0: Ran.

390
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:28,764
Speaker 1: Rand Altor.

391
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:29,366

Speaker 1: All right.

00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,098
Speaker 1: All right, that's still only one person.

Speaker 0: Dark one.

00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,109

408
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,129
Speaker 0: Well, I'm just talking about the cool characters.

409
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:00,992
Speaker 1: Tom's not cool.

410
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,037
Speaker 0: He's alright.

411
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:02,740
Speaker 0: He's like the best.

412
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,831
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you love the spoony bard.

414
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:09,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not.

415
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,440
Speaker 0: I'm more into the you know, the Luz Theron types.

416
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:15,579
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the Luz Theron stuff's pretty good later on.

417
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,151
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'm done with that crap real soon.

418
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,019
Speaker 1: and then we're gonna read Oryx and Crake.

419
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:24,138
Speaker 0: Oh, actually, my favorite my favorite dude was the the ancient king of Man of Theron.

420
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:24,559
Speaker 0: That's my guy.

421
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:27,519
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think part of his brain is inside of Matt.

422
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah shit went down.

423
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:34,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, um, otherwise the patreon is going strong.

424
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:38,280
Speaker 1: people are like people seem to really dig it and put stuff in there.

425
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,584
Speaker 0: Make it weaker we can.

426
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:44,058
Speaker 1: uh, I'm working on the chicken surprise shirts sometime this by the end of the summer.

427
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:44,720
Speaker 1: That's gonna happen.

428
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:45,610
Speaker 1: It's looking pretty good.

429
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:54,538
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Well, I'm gonna get him for the people who want them first And then I'm gonna try to get a license a legit licensing agreement with the game designer.

430
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:56,507
Speaker 1: be like look Do you remember this game you made?

431
00:22:56,527 --> 00:23:05,560
Speaker 1: I sell chicken surprise shirts officially Because I think I think I could sell dozens of them maybe total.

432
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:08,620
Speaker 1: So yeah bringing it back how to not suck.

433
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,075
Speaker 1: We used to give a lot more advice on geek nights and we kind of stopped over the years.

434
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:17,300
Speaker 0: and you know what our advice Then is probably bad advice compared to now because we're older and smarter now.

435
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,480
Speaker 0: So what I would actually get smarter when you're older, right?

436
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:20,006
Speaker 0: That's not.

437
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:20,189
Speaker 0: I mean.

438
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,608
Speaker 0: when I was younger I said old people were dumb and I still say that.

439
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,460
Speaker 0: but whatever age I am is the age when people are the smartest.

440
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:26,585
Speaker 1: You know what is.

441
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,509
Speaker 1: you don't get smarter.

442
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:33,180
Speaker 1: In fact, you kind of objectively get dumber But you get a wiser or at least you should get wiser.

443
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,345
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't get wiser.

444
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:43,061
Speaker 1: you can tell those people when once they hit their 30s Suddenly they stop upgrading all their shit like whatever phone they used when they hit 30.

445
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,629
Speaker 1: They just use that kind of phone forever.

446
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,815
Speaker 1: Like they're why should I upgrade?

447
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:46,660
Speaker 1: Why would I care?

448
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,217
Speaker 1: Like if a new website comes out like a new social media thing after they turn 30, they will never use it.

449
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,169
Speaker 0: No I'm not using the snapchats.

450
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:56,959
Speaker 1: I'm not using the snapchats either.

451
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:04,199
Speaker 1: The I've already used the snapchat some dumbass kid who doesn't know better.

452
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:21,259
Speaker 1: But what I'd kind of like to do is we should take one of those old how to not suck episodes do that topic again now and then just post both episodes side by side and there will be objective evidence of Whether or not we were dumber back then or dumb now.

453
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,939
Speaker 0: I mean, we're gonna agree more with whatever we say now no matter what.

454
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, but other people will see the two.

455
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:33,187
Speaker 1: like if we give completely different advice on like how to get a job ten years ago Versus now that would be very interesting.

456
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,520
Speaker 1: Mmm, but we have to make sure we don't ever go back and listen to those episodes.

457
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:37,147
Speaker 1: Are we tainting?

458
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,339
Speaker 0: That's definitely not a concern.

459
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,206
Speaker 1: Hey, I gotta listen to those beta episodes.

460
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,772
Speaker 1: I'm remastering the third one right now.

461
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,116
Speaker 0: Holy my concern.

462
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:49,425
Speaker 1: Holy hell Guys, at least we're gonna get the radio Shaq microphone soon.

463
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,188
Speaker 1: It'll get a little easier.

464
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:53,080
Speaker 0: So how to not suck at what?

465
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:59,544
Speaker 1: Throw in a party hosting guests all that nonsense we See like.

466
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:04,080
Speaker 1: I don't go to as many parties or gatherings as I used to because college like very different situation.

467
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Speaker 1: But I see time and time again the same mistakes the same problems.

468
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,273
Speaker 1: A lot of people really suck at inviting groups of people into their house To have a party let alone suck at like.

469
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:21,480
Speaker 1: hey, let's have a holiday party Let's have like a holiday a party around a specific event.

470
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:22,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, so many.

471
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:26,599
Speaker 0: I mean there's so much differences that go on based on the level of party and what kind of party.

472
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,970
Speaker 0: but I Guess started the beginning with that invite part, right?

473
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:29,372
Speaker 0: Yeah.

474
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:30,960
Speaker 0: So how do you invite people, right?

475
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:38,240
Speaker 0: So obviously if it's a fancier party you got to mail the invitations And if it's less than that, you can just email people or whatever or call them individually or something.

476
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,104
Speaker 1: So something interesting.

477
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:47,315
Speaker 1: ask them individually in person for an invite party like a wedding in particular Culture says you have to send like I'll save the date and then you have to like mail people.

478
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:48,400
Speaker 1: these RSVP things.

479
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:56,032
Speaker 1: Practice shows that nobody under the age of like 35 will ever Send that envelope back and you just call them all.

480
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:58,220
Speaker 1: anyway be like you're coming to my wedding right in the envelope bag.

481
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,654
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever sent one of those envelopes back.

482
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:01,600
Speaker 0: You're the bad person then.

483
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am.

484
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,747
Speaker 0: I always said in the envelope back.

485
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:04,691
Speaker 0: Here's your asshole.

486
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:07,360
Speaker 0: if you don't I think most everyone sends it back except you.

487
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:11,154
Speaker 0: You're not You're the one you you think I got.

488
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,120
Speaker 0: no one sends these back.

489
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,405
Speaker 0: No, you're the fucking hassle.

490
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:13,747
Speaker 0: who doesn't?

491
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:23,420
Speaker 1: certain unnamed people who had weddings in the last ten years Confided in me that something like a third or more of people did not send the envelope back.

492
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,060
Speaker 1: Like it's not just me who doesn't send the envelope back still send the fucking envelope back.

493
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,831
Speaker 0: But also the main thing with the invitation right is you?

494
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,461
Speaker 0: there's two concerns no matter what party it is Right.

495
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:40,200
Speaker 0: concern number one who to invite you need to prioritize the people not you know, don't invite people who don't mix.

496
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,071
Speaker 0: Well, yeah all that kind of stuff right?

497
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:43,559
Speaker 0: don't invite the people you don't like.

498
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:45,860
Speaker 0: Make sure they don't find out the party's happening.

499
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,522
Speaker 0: Wait, wait hot.

500
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:55,339
Speaker 1: take any any party any gathering that has any invitation process more formal than hey You want to come to my place on this date?

501
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,434
Speaker 1: You're almost definitely doing it that way because you are inviting people.

502
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:00,820
Speaker 1: You don't actually want to be there.

503
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:03,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's always a wedding right funeral.

504
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:07,308
Speaker 0: Don't send out invitations for a funeral.

505
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:11,300
Speaker 1: You tell people when the funeral is the day after they die.

506
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,705
Speaker 1: Uh, you're Jewish.

507
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:14,831
Speaker 1: most people don't do it that way.

508
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,137
Speaker 0: All right, right, right.

509
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:28,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Right, so the other concern with the invitations is the main purpose of the invitation is not what you think it is.

510
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,626
Speaker 0: It just let the person know you want them to come.

511
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:34,180
Speaker 0: it's to remind them of when it fucking is because they're gonna be like.

512
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,243
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

513
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:38,632
Speaker 0: There was that party today and everyone's partying and the person's not there.

514
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:39,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need to.

515
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,400
Speaker 1: somehow you're getting married today.

516
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:55,603
Speaker 0: Right, you need to get if you you want this person to come they want to come but they will fail to come even if they're usually have their shit together unless you make sure that the thing is on their calendar and on their schedule and they Remember to come.

517
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:59,760
Speaker 0: like I'm like I have like my whole calendar and all shit in order all the time.

518
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:00,998
Speaker 0: Like I'm super good about that.

519
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:10,413
Speaker 0: But if you don't if you invite me to a thing and like I don't remember if it's not on my calendar Like there have been times where it's like oh shit that's this weekend.

520
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:11,757
Speaker 1: Oh snap now, this is more of.

521
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:12,660
Speaker 1: this is separate advice.

522
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:14,477
Speaker 1: This is more advice of how to live your life.

523
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,830
Speaker 1: You probably have a gmail account.

524
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:18,620
Speaker 1: use the fucking calendar.

525
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:26,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, like know when stuff is but if you're hosting a party like this might sound dumb You might feel like isn't that like a?

526
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:30,500
Speaker 1: no if you are going to do something literally send your friends a calendar invite.

527
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:31,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, do something.

528
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:32,799
Speaker 0: make sure you know.

529
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:37,840
Speaker 0: Basically your goal is to make sure that the people mark it off on their schedule and remember to come.

530
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:42,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to give them the date the location the time all that stuff now.

531
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:43,780
Speaker 1: Actually, I think the other.

532
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:54,075
Speaker 1: Well, there's another one more thing Which the other is if you're sent if you're formally inviting people to a thing Then it's sort of like saying this is my thing.

533
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:55,400
Speaker 1: I am responsible.

534
00:28:55,621 --> 00:29:00,200
Speaker 1: It is a party as opposed to people are coming over which means you've got to feed them.

535
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,200
Speaker 0: Well, no, I mean one other aspect of the invitation Which is sort of like the addendum to the invitation is you have to let people know what to expect, right?

536
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:16,785
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you are going to have to get a hotel, you know You are going to have to wear black tie Bring food.

537
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:17,931
Speaker 0: You will not have to bring food.

538
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:19,319
Speaker 0: You'll have to bring fucking money.

539
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:26,728
Speaker 0: Bring a gun You know, whatever you need.

540
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,080
Speaker 0: let the people know what they're gonna need.

541
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,132
Speaker 0: Otherwise people show up and like I didn't bring any board games.

542
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:33,357
Speaker 0: No one has a spot it here.

543
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,200
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

544
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,013
Speaker 1: Yep, it implies that there is structure to your event.

545
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,726
Speaker 1: now unstructured events are possible But that's a whole separate kind of party.

546
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:40,530
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that later.

547
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,419
Speaker 1: I'm about structured parties here.

548
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:44,830
Speaker 0: So please moderate amount of structure.

549
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you if you send someone an invitation That's probably a party where they expect.

550
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:54,639
Speaker 1: when they show up There's gonna be like snacks and drinks and stuff and at some point dinner will appear.

551
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:05,027
Speaker 1: if you invite people semi-formally to a thing like you're the kind of person who doesn't normally do big social things and You don't even make it very clear.

552
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:09,300
Speaker 1: Like I'm not feeding you I guarantee your friends might not complain to your face.

553
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:10,804
Speaker 1: Why didn't you feed me?

554
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:11,908
Speaker 1: but they're pissed.

555
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:14,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're mad that you didn't feed him.

556
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:16,040
Speaker 1: They expected you to feed them.

557
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:23,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they traveled right there in your house or whatever or at your venue and they're there during dinnertime and they're partying.

558
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,095
Speaker 0: They're not expecting to leave the party and get food or call for their own delivery.

559
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:30,387
Speaker 0: And then so if there's no dinner It's how we're all hungry.

560
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,492
Speaker 0: and now because we're hungry.

561
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:32,095
Speaker 0: We're hangry.

562
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:41,160
Speaker 1: Yep, and Even worse if you like if you're a hose like you're hosting the party You're gonna have less fun than everyone else because you got to do all that sort of host stuff.

563
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:49,165
Speaker 1: So like it sounds like kind of minor advice But for real when people come over in this sort of thing after they've been in your house for a couple minutes You should ask them.

564
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:50,812
Speaker 1: Would you like anything to drink?

565
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:51,756
Speaker 1: Would you?

566
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:52,720
Speaker 1: would you like a snack?

567
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:59,575
Speaker 1: Would you like some food or have it all out somewhere where it's very obvious that hey take one of these things if you're hungry You're thirsty.

568
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:05,216
Speaker 1: Well, otherwise your friends are sitting around in your house thinking to themselves man.

569
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,280
Speaker 1: I'm really thirsty.

570
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:08,820
Speaker 1: Should I ask him for a drink?

571
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:10,619
Speaker 1: Can I just open his fridge?

572
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,102
Speaker 0: I don't know.

573
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,611
Speaker 0: I just open people's fridges.

574
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:17,637
Speaker 0: I don't have that feeling like I see other people do have that.

575
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,386
Speaker 0: and But like I'll.

576
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,842
Speaker 0: you know, sometimes I remember to ask them but you about half the time I don't.

577
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:29,363
Speaker 0: because if I'm in someone's house, I'll just go and I'll just if I need water I just go and start looking for cups and getting water, you know It's like I don't.

578
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:42,839
Speaker 1: well that brings up a very important point because there's there are two very very different kinds of parties because what we've been talking about to this point is how a typical person throws a party who doesn't Run a regular basis have their friends staying at their house.

579
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:50,609
Speaker 1: the kinds of parties we throw almost exclusively are Hey all our friends come to our house this weekend.

580
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 1: Everyone's gonna sleep on the floor in like sleeping bags and pajamas.

581
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,799
Speaker 1: and Just you're just in my house.

582
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:57,706
Speaker 1: Like take every tip.

583
00:31:57,827 --> 00:32:03,095
Speaker 1: everyone assume take whatever you want for the fridge Like we're all real close friends and family like.

584
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,591
Speaker 1: no there is no Formality to it in that degree.

585
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:16,179
Speaker 1: like if I show up at one of our friends houses I probably just go straight into their kitchen and take something out of their fridge And I think someone goes in my fridge is I don't care as long as they don't mess it up.

586
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:38,515
Speaker 1: And if you don't throw parties like that at a regular basis or at least a semi regular basis or at least go to parties Like that I think you need to make closer friends before you hit your 30s or you're gonna be in for a Rude awakening of not having a lot to do and going to very boring Stilted parties among a bunch of adults who aren't really close friends anymore Sitting around a table that has a bunch of like bags of chips open the picking at

587
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:41,655
Speaker 0: and then everyone has to go home late Because you know and sleeping there.

588
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:45,103
Speaker 1: Yeah Uh, so yeah Really just.

589
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:46,389
Speaker 1: I guess this all comes down to.

590
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,740
Speaker 1: you have to set the expectations for what the party is.

591
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:51,520
Speaker 1: If you have a close friend group, that's probably implicit.

592
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:57,034
Speaker 1: If you don't have a close friend group You've got to give a fucking timeline of like at four o'clock.

593
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,520
Speaker 1: The catering is going to arrive.

594
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:03,272
Speaker 1: Bring like you bring beer you bring snacks.

595
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:04,657
Speaker 1: You don't bring anything.

596
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:11,443
Speaker 1: You always bring garbage And very specifically tell your friends unless you told them to bring something Do not bring anything.

597
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:18,944
Speaker 1: your friends are gonna bring the worst snacks the cheapest crappiest bags of chips that they literally bought at a bodega On their way to your house.

598
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:24,690
Speaker 1: They're gonna bring a six-pack of beer that you will never drink Mm-hmm that you do not want.

599
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:33,233
Speaker 1: the only bottles of awful liquor I have that I either threw away or gave away to someone because Someone unnamed literally just brought it to our house and put it on the table.

600
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:35,000
Speaker 0: people always bring some nasty chip.

601
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,205
Speaker 0: That's the kind that I don't eat.

602
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:37,008
Speaker 1: Yep.

603
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:41,848
Speaker 1: It's like Tostitos covered in schmutz Some kind like nope.

604
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:44,199
Speaker 0: I don't eat that and then no one eats it and then it's there.

605
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,208
Speaker 0: Yeah and then everyone leaves and it's still there.

606
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:47,434
Speaker 0: cuz they don't want to take that shit home.

607
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:56,432
Speaker 1: like we had a big party at that Waterfall house upstate and even though our friends were very organized like we had a spreadsheet and again guys That's I mean, there's a such thing as going too far.

608
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:56,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

609
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:05,600
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna get to that If you have a gathering that's more than a few days or is more than like ten people.

610
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:17,360
Speaker 1: You actually should plan it like literally I'm not joking make a spreadsheet and Organize shit like who's responsible for bringing stuff if anyone is or pay money and just make all that go away?

611
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm usually a fan of the paying money just sort of spontaneous.

612
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:21,580
Speaker 0: Like what are we gonna do for dinner tonight?

613
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,331
Speaker 0: All right money.

614
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:24,244
Speaker 1: it happens Yeah you see you are a fan of that.

615
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:29,947
Speaker 1: but at the same time the only reason most of our big gatherings have gone smoothly is because Someone else actually did plan all that.

616
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:45,360
Speaker 1: because if you have 20 people and someone says hey, let's order food You know your friends especially if this is a party where people who aren't close friends are you know like that guy you kind of know from work is gonna be like I don't want any pepperoni and someone else is gonna be like I only eat pepperoni, right?

617
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,083
Speaker 0: So, you know what I say?

618
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:47,913
Speaker 0: All right us for getting pizza.

619
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,059
Speaker 0: the rest of you just do whatever you do.

620
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:50,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's party goer.

621
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:54,620
Speaker 1: advice of bail on whatever the party is doing and fend for yourself.

622
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:58,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I show up to a stranger party, I have a plan.

623
00:34:58,416 --> 00:34:59,380
Speaker 1: This is the Scott party.

624
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,863
Speaker 0: It's everyone.

625
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:05,047
Speaker 0: fend for yourself the party and you know that in advance I got.

626
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,191
Speaker 1: I got bailout plans.

627
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,120
Speaker 1: Like if the party sucks, how do I make an excuse to get the fuck out of here?

628
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,653
Speaker 1: If the party is boring do I have a plan to make it not boring?

629
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:14,683
Speaker 1: if I don't I have a plan to get the Fuck out of there.

630
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:17,700
Speaker 1: I have a plan to get food in case food is not at the party.

631
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:20,939
Speaker 1: I have a plan to call the police in case it's that kind of party.

632
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:23,327
Speaker 0: Don't need a plan to call the police just do it.

633
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,054
Speaker 1: Like if you show up and Oh party.

634
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:31,336
Speaker 0: No, I meant posse Rims driving up to your house and he's like, okay Let me make a list of things that I'll do and I'll call the cops.

635
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:39,040
Speaker 0: for if I see There's not much on that list, but there are things on that list The same things that are on the list all the time.

636
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:47,840
Speaker 1: but this was a big party that involved like multiple friend groups mashing together and Because we were staying in a remote place ordering food was not an option.

637
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:55,500
Speaker 1: So we had to plan who was gonna cook in what we planned it real well The problem is your friends are all morons.

638
00:35:55,861 --> 00:36:00,014
Speaker 1: So even though there is a spreadsheet that was shared with everyone and everyone has Google.

639
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:00,917
Speaker 1: you can log in.

640
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,202
Speaker 1: you can look at the Spreadsheet.

641
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,875
Speaker 1: it says you bring this thing and that is what you were supposed to bring.

642
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:07,080
Speaker 1: do not bring more.

643
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:19,280
Speaker 1: You need to remind your stupid friends who are coming to your party on a daily basis not to bring shit or they're gonna bring Shit, I think we had you already talked about brings four times the amount of food we needed despite having the spreadsheet.

644
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,763
Speaker 0: Hmm All right.

645
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:22,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:22,727
Speaker 0: Hmm.

647
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:28,251
Speaker 0: So now once you're at the party and everyone's brought their shit You got to do stuff at the party up.

648
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:32,408
Speaker 1: if you run a party you are Responsible for everyone's fun.

649
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:36,484
Speaker 1: Like if you don't want to be responsible for that You should not host a party.

650
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:50,846
Speaker 0: people will just default to sit around play video game watch YouTube play board game Poke their phone do their own thing unless somebody you know organizes and says, all right We are doing this thing it is happening.

651
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:56,930
Speaker 0: So, you know based on the scenario, you know, that might be someone else But usually it's your party.

652
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,257
Speaker 0: You're running it it.

653
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:02,068
Speaker 0: that's your Responsibility for at least the major thing to be.

654
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:04,474
Speaker 0: you know, like maybe you're all gonna go to a nearby.

655
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:08,527
Speaker 0: fair, you know It's like okay, we're gonna go at this time.

656
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:09,652
Speaker 0: Here's how to get there.

657
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,776
Speaker 0: This is when we're going.

658
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:13,171
Speaker 0: we're gonna be you know Yep, and it's if you're gonna.

659
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:18,465
Speaker 0: if you have any you got to be like, okay You have to actually get up and be like, okay people let's go Get out.

660
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:29,540
Speaker 1: if you're gonna have a party that involves events or like significant activities You can have one of those per day and one optional less complicated thing.

661
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:32,040
Speaker 1: That is the absolute maximum.

662
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:39,085
Speaker 1: Yep If you try to do more than that in a given day on a party or a weekend or anything It is going to be disaster.

663
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:42,937
Speaker 1: unless your job is literally make all this happen and you yourself have no fun.

664
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,567
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I cannot stress that enough.

665
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:47,977
Speaker 1: That is like the mistake everyone makes up.

666
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:54,050
Speaker 1: Yeah in the morning Let's all go get brunch together, which already nope You can't get a restaurant for 20 people and now it's one o'clock.

667
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:57,502
Speaker 1: then we're all gonna go to the haunted house at 7.

668
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:01,175
Speaker 1: So before we do that, let's go downtown and like wander around through all the shops.

669
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,660
Speaker 0: you get out of town.

670
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,380
Speaker 0: You're not gonna make it to the haunted house by 7.

671
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,772
Speaker 1: Yep, half your party's gonna say fuck it on the shops go straight to the haunted house The other half your party's gonna get lost downtown.

672
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,100
Speaker 1: You won't see him again until that night.

673
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,700
Speaker 1: Some people are gonna say wow, this is too complicated bail on everything.

674
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:21,080
Speaker 0: It would be theoretically possible for one person to go to the shops get in their car go to the haunted house.

675
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:27,526
Speaker 0: All right, you know, but when you're with these basically when you're with more people Everything slows down and takes longer.

676
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:33,280
Speaker 1: for every four people you have in addition to yourself and your close fast walking fast friends.

677
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:39,685
Speaker 1: Assume that it'll take like 20% more time to do Literally Anything right like even it.

678
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:42,680
Speaker 0: let's say it's me and rim right and we're gonna go see a movie.

679
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:43,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

680
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:47,720
Speaker 0: So we separately take the subway arrive at the movie on time watch the movie and then separately leave.

681
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,137
Speaker 0: That's basically instant speed.

682
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,183
Speaker 1: Yep So now we're now.

683
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:55,764
Speaker 0: but now we got a different situation me and Rimmer at a party and me and rim together with no one Else are gonna go to the movie.

684
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:56,406
Speaker 0: right.

685
00:38:56,788 --> 00:39:00,700
Speaker 0: both of us together is slower than both of us separate.

686
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:01,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's just how it is.

687
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:06,280
Speaker 0: It won't be that much slower to be so really fast because we're both really high speeds.

688
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,260
Speaker 0: But it'll still be slower.

689
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:12,900
Speaker 1: But like alright now we've got 12 people and we're gonna go to the shops before go to the haunted house.

690
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:16,175
Speaker 1: Well one half the people don't actually want to go to the shops.

691
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,160
Speaker 0: That's also true.

692
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,899
Speaker 1: They're only going along to socialize and that's all they want.

693
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:28,632
Speaker 1: Yeah of the half who want to be at the shops a few of them are gonna spend way too much time in the shops and A few of them are gonna want to go to different shops and split off.

694
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:35,492
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm getting the party back together Will take like a half hour And also it does.

695
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:37,222
Speaker 1: it's not even just in the city It's anywhere.

696
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:45,160
Speaker 1: the the every two or three or four people you add means another car in the suburbs Which means now there's six cars all driving to the place.

697
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,344
Speaker 0: But now you had to spend.

698
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:50,400
Speaker 0: even if you're gonna go somewhere you lose ten minutes just discussing who's going in what car and which?

699
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,739
Speaker 0: Car is going where and then oh this these people need to go to the ATM.

700
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:56,431
Speaker 0: So that car is making a little you know detour.

701
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,460
Speaker 1: Oh car four is not a gas that sucks.

702
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:05,523
Speaker 0: This car needs to go to a walla to get some snacks and this car needs to do this and you know who's going in That one.

703
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, you keep you're not you're losing time constantly with every.

704
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:09,568
Speaker 1: I mean hell.

705
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:14,380
Speaker 1: remember way back We all a bunch of us all plan to go to an Otacon and we had like four cars.

706
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:17,193
Speaker 1: One of the cars refused to speed on the freeway.

707
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:18,760
Speaker 1: So they we lost them forever.

708
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,327
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, cuz they would only go 55 never else.

709
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:22,872
Speaker 0: They got their hours after us.

710
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:24,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, like three hours later.

711
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:29,526
Speaker 1: Yep so I This is you might think.

712
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:30,148
Speaker 1: Oh, don't worry.

713
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,071
Speaker 1: I made some buffer time.

714
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:32,758
Speaker 1: No, you didn't know you didn't.

715
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,160
Speaker 1: almost everyone I know is terrible at this.

716
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,719
Speaker 1: It's just a human nature is to underestimate the pain in the ass of dealing with a few more people in your group.

717
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:52,238
Speaker 1: So like for every four people assume an extra half-hour buffer time maybe for everything Which means if you have any number of people you cannot do more than one thing in a day.

718
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:52,981
Speaker 1: and that's it Like.

719
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:53,726
Speaker 1: that's the golden rule.

720
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:59,169
Speaker 0: never deviate from that unless you are a professional All right, so now you know your party's winding down.

721
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got to get people to go home.

722
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:02,840
Speaker 0: you should offer them tea.

723
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,986
Speaker 1: Would you like me to roll out the beds?

724
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:07,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, should I?

725
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:10,320
Speaker 1: shall I arrange a hotel room for the night?

726
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,236
Speaker 1: Shall I call into work for you.

727
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:18,117
Speaker 1: Would you like to hand them a lease?

728
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:20,697
Speaker 0: But little Airbnb.

729
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:31,305
Speaker 1: It's real easy If this is a formal party where there's people there who aren't close friends well in advance say this is when the party ends and Wrap it up.

730
00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:33,438
Speaker 1: Like don't try to be passive-aggressive about it.

731
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:37,698
Speaker 1: No one's smart enough to pick up on the social cues and more importantly the people are overstaying.

732
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:39,568
Speaker 1: They're welcome They see the cues.

733
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,840
Speaker 1: They're actively resisting because they're lonely.

734
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:44,810
Speaker 1: Like not even joking that guy.

735
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,507
Speaker 1: you kind of know at work who's at your house and it's 11 And you really want the party to end.

736
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:50,719
Speaker 1: he's hanging out because they got nothing to do back home.

737
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:56,681
Speaker 0: There needs to be some sort of clear ending time, even if it's like a big fancy party with like a band and shit Right.

738
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:57,785
Speaker 0: It's like they have like.

Speaker 0: Yeah last dance That's actually the last dance.

741
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:05,591
Speaker 0: That's why they have that song.

742
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:07,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why it exists.

743
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:12,180
Speaker 1: Like you might think you can be clever and sort of socially finagulate.

744
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,799
Speaker 1: You're probably not clever enough to do that.

745
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:17,880
Speaker 1: So make sure there's a defined end and if it's your actual friends just be blunt.

746
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:18,485
Speaker 1: Just be like guys.

747
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:19,091
Speaker 1: I gotta go to bed.

748
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:20,119
Speaker 1: get the fuck out of my house.

749
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you're the real if they're real friends, they're totally okay with that.

750
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,486
Speaker 1: That is how I end almost every party guys.

751
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,691
Speaker 1: I'm going to fucking bed.

752
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:27,915
Speaker 1: It's like 4 a.m.

753
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:28,296
Speaker 1: Jesus.

754
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:29,360
Speaker 1: Fuck go away.

755
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,704
Speaker 0: You guys do whatever.

756
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:32,447
Speaker 0: I'm going to bed.

757
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:37,509
Speaker 1: Yep, either get out of my house or if they're actually close friends I'm going to bed.

758
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,924
Speaker 1: Just don't leave the door unlocked If you're.

759
00:42:40,944 --> 00:42:47,199
Speaker 1: if your close friends are not that close you need closer friends In terms of food and catering and all that.

760
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:52,524
Speaker 1: If you're going to pay for catering I Kind of recommend you pay for catering.

761
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,531
Speaker 1: don't think you can cook food for everybody.

762
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:55,795
Speaker 1: you probably can.

763
00:42:56,015 --> 00:43:08,240
Speaker 1: there's a big difference between cooking a Dinner for four or five people cooking a dinner for your family where dinners an hour late And that's just what happens and cooking dinner for a bunch of people or someone's been cooking at dinner all day for your family and Thanksgiving.

764
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:13,219
Speaker 1: Yep, you might have some friends who are like we'll take care of dinner which in our group is often the case.

765
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,110
Speaker 0: like there are Certain of our don't expect to play a board game with any of those people on that whole day Yep, but they'll have fun.

766
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,498
Speaker 1: Like they'll be in the kitchen like doing.

767
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:20,860
Speaker 1: they're like.

768
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,697
Speaker 0: I hope if someone offers to cook that they like doing it.

769
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:30,450
Speaker 0: That would be weird If you said I'll cook dinner, I hate fucking cooking These assholes, they're all having fun and I'm cooking.

770
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,535
Speaker 0: it's like I offered to cook.

771
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:32,560
Speaker 0: Why did I do that?

772
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,512
Speaker 1: Yep, like so pro tip I'm complaining.

773
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,079
Speaker 0: I'm doing a thing that I volunteered to do.

774
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,286
Speaker 1: Here's the pro tip.

775
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:44,584
Speaker 1: if you're having a party where there's a grill and someone's gonna be cooking meat That's actually gonna be a job all night Usually be constantly cooking meat

776
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:50,802
Speaker 0: because the meat you basically can't if you have any significant number of people unless you have a monstrous grill Or

777
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,246
Speaker 1: you can lower safety.

778
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:56,119
Speaker 0: You cannot grill faster than people can eat what you were grilling.

779
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:56,943
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

780
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:58,093
Speaker 1: So this is where you cheat.

781
00:43:58,113 --> 00:43:58,899
Speaker 1: This is like pro tip.

782
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:04,859
Speaker 0: You need to get like you ever go to like one of those public barbecues and they have like tons of grills lined up and then You're still waiting for food.

783
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:12,722
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like people can eat a burger way way faster than it takes to cook one and they want a second like in a Lauren Scojo party.

784
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:21,810
Speaker 1: like someone right now someone will come out and be like, hey the burgers are done and by the burgers They mean literally as many burgers as could fit on that grill.

785
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:24,620
Speaker 1: They're gone before you can get upstairs to the grill.

786
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:29,845
Speaker 0: It's actually what I suggest doing and Some people might not like this is you know You let you have your grill.

787
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:30,709
Speaker 0: you grill some meats.

788
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:31,351
Speaker 0: people eat them.

789
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:32,516
Speaker 0: you girls some meats people eat them.

790
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:40,580
Speaker 0: if you're eating like these Waves and actually takes long to eat Grill and even though your grill is small just put those meats to the side and don't let anyone fucking eat them.

791
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:46,200
Speaker 0: Right and then wait until you've grilled everything and then let people eat and you say won't those first burgers be cold?

792
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:51,440
Speaker 0: Maybe but maybe you can heat them up to keep them in a warm place like near the grill or in a warm oven.

793
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,644
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, right.

794
00:44:53,226 --> 00:45:05,200
Speaker 0: I think there's strategies you can use to serve everyone at once and then Because once you start serving food everyone enters food mode, right and there's their hangry because you didn't give enough snack, right?

795
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:13,800
Speaker 0: So they can't really be enjoying themselves like playing a board game once food mode is activated But only some of the people are eating and now food mode is on for hours until the grill is finally empty.

796
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:19,917
Speaker 0: what you can do is You can let people keep enjoying themselves playing games and whatnot because they're not in food mode yet.

797
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:23,291
Speaker 0: and then you activate food But everyone eats simultaneously and finished eating something.

798
00:45:23,312 --> 00:45:25,100
Speaker 1: you ring a bell soups on every pony.

799
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,842
Speaker 1: Let's go.

800
00:45:25,862 --> 00:45:28,852
Speaker 0: they finish eating and then they go cleaning and then back to enjoying.

801
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:35,980
Speaker 1: and if you provide enough snacks People won't be so hangry that they start freaking out about when's the burger gonna be ready?

802
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,760
Speaker 1: They'll be like, oh cool food and they won't rush it, right?

803
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,285
Speaker 0: So the final thing I just mentioned.

804
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,714
Speaker 1: so I got the cleaning everything you said there.

805
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:44,340
Speaker 1: There's a more pro move.

806
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:50,320
Speaker 1: I've seen Laura and scojo like at their parties do this to a tee and some of you go to those parties and listen.

807
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:52,240
Speaker 1: You're gonna see what's happening.

808
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,285
Speaker 1: And if one of you was fooled by this now You'll see through the gnosis.

809
00:45:55,305 --> 00:46:02,120
Speaker 1: a lot of people who don't go to a lot of parties or who just you know For various reasons they kind of want to like have something to do with the party.

810
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:06,121
Speaker 1: They want to be like the grill master because that feels like when you were a kid Like.

811
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:09,139
Speaker 1: you see the dad cooking the grill and you're like, man, I want to be that someday.

812
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,348
Speaker 0: No, you don't get to have any fun doing that.

813
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:16,080
Speaker 1: you want to go do something else so you provide snacks and all that.

814
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:20,153
Speaker 1: But then you'd be like, hey who wants to man the grill?

815
00:46:20,173 --> 00:46:22,240
Speaker 1: who wants to run the grill?

816
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:33,460
Speaker 1: not some other schmuck to run the grill and do the waves and leave them there for the rest of the night and there'll Rotation of schmucks who will be making all the food at the grill and you can just leave the grill alone.

817
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,127
Speaker 1: It'll take care of it.

818
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,380
Speaker 0: if you invited schmucks sure?

819
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he's cleaning is?

820
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:38,512
Speaker 1: it is there.

821
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:40,080
Speaker 1: they're they're they're they're marks.

822
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:40,925
Speaker 1: That's what they are.

823
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:46,171
Speaker 0: No matter how close the first person is a friend to you No matter how neat and tidy like their houses, right?

824
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:48,320
Speaker 0: They're gonna goth the fuck up out of your house.

825
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,549
Speaker 1: They're gonna break at least two glasses.

826
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,176
Speaker 1: No matter they're gonna break your shit.

827
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:53,120
Speaker 0: They're gonna mess your shit up.

828
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,819
Speaker 0: So here's how to prevent them from messing up your shit.

829
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:59,030
Speaker 0: You know maximally you can actually get things a little bit cleaner, right?

830
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,080
Speaker 1: So as an aside make sure you cannot resent them.

831
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:03,466
Speaker 1: That's how parties go right.

832
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:04,591
Speaker 0: rule number one.

833
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,515
Speaker 0: Fuck the environment.

834
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:10,332
Speaker 0: disposable everything Yeah, but you just don't want to fuck the environment completely.

835
00:47:10,352 --> 00:47:13,242
Speaker 0: what we do and it seems to work pretty well Is you?

836
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:14,165
Speaker 0: it works at packs.

837
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:18,100
Speaker 0: also you have a plastic cup and you write your name on it with a sharpie.

838
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,520
Speaker 0: You put the sharpies near the cups more than one of them and everyone writes their name on a cup with a sharpie.

839
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:27,620
Speaker 0: And now sure someone might go for a second cup if they change beverages or something.

840
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,859
Speaker 0: But they're gonna write their name on that too.

841
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:40,236
Speaker 0: And if you see cups around the house with names on them that haven't been reused or clean or disposed of properly You know, you can call that fucking person out like, you know rim you got this half-drunken.

842
00:47:40,397 --> 00:47:40,698
Speaker 0: Dr.

843
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:41,380
Speaker 0: Pepper over here.

844
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,003
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

845
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:43,249
Speaker 0: how long has this been here?

846
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,660
Speaker 0: an hour and you actually get you know.

847
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,199
Speaker 0: And as you call one person out and everyone else will get their shit in line.

848
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:53,565
Speaker 1: Except I don't think they will because I Take inventory.

849
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:57,286
Speaker 1: because we because one thing if you have a dishwasher That helps enormously.

850
00:47:57,326 --> 00:48:00,879
Speaker 1: if you have a dishwasher use real stuff for glasses and drinking.

851
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:09,452
Speaker 1: maybe use plastic disposable for plates and things because you can wash a lot of Glasses in a hurry in a dishwasher.

852
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:13,531
Speaker 1: as long as you turn on that mode You never turn on depends on the number of people you got.

853
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:14,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, the heated dry.

854
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:15,480
Speaker 1: You got to turn that on.

855
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,800
Speaker 0: That's I don't like the heated room was worried about like my plastic.

856
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,580
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you only use the heated dry if you're doing a party situation and you're just filling with glassware constantly.

857
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:25,260
Speaker 1: Maybe that's like the number one use case for heated dry.

858
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:31,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, but your friends are going to leave so many half-drunk beverages around your apartment.

859
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:34,387
Speaker 1: like you I don't know why this happens.

860
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:37,197
Speaker 1: I don't know how but forever.

861
00:48:37,217 --> 00:48:41,415
Speaker 0: I mean if I pour beverage I usually drink the whole thing immediately and then it's an empty cup.

862
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:42,620
Speaker 0: I have to carry around and like fuck.

863
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,859
Speaker 1: I don't know why you even use cups.

864
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:44,703
Speaker 0: Cuz.

865
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,570
Speaker 0: I was like you drink right ahead of the pitcher.

866
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:48,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, just drain it you're done.

867
00:48:49,943 --> 00:49:03,311
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna serve alcohol my advice to you is very specific either have bottles of beer and just leave it at that or if there's gonna be cocktails do Not let people make their own cocktails from your liquor cabinet.

868
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:04,935
Speaker 1: They're going to one.

869
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:08,966
Speaker 1: They're gonna ruin all your expensive liquor Waste it and not drink it.

870
00:49:09,087 --> 00:49:09,408
Speaker 0: Yep.

871
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:12,920
Speaker 1: They're gonna make cocktails, but most people suck at making cocktails.

872
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:17,880
Speaker 1: They're gonna make cocktails that aren't that good and then they're gonna leave them out and not drink them and then they make another cocktail.

873
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,461
Speaker 1: That sucks.

874
00:49:19,484 --> 00:49:38,800
Speaker 1: if you're going to have booze at your party either pick a few trusted friends or yourself and they make everyone's drinks or Leave out the things to make a few drinks like a very limited set like a limited set of tools and put a piece of Paper that's laminated next to it that says here are the exact recipes to make these two cocktails.

875
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:44,260
Speaker 0: Another thing you can do is in you know, you can basically lock or hide the cabinet of you know equipment.

876
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:45,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you make.

877
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:48,898
Speaker 0: you know get like your 10 martini glasses and make 10 whatevers.

878
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:52,180
Speaker 0: Yep Right and then it's like or like you do a champagne, right?

879
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,632
Speaker 0: You don't give someone the champagne valve that go nuts, right?

880
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:56,040
Speaker 0: You pour a bunch of champagnes.

881
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, you give everyone a glass.

882
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:08,971
Speaker 1: now those same rules can apply to regular non-alcoholic beverages Like if you've got fancy juices, you're gonna make stuff be like, alright Who wants a glass of like ice cranberry something?

883
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:12,041
Speaker 1: and then everyone who says that you just make like 10 of them all in a Row.

884
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:14,432
Speaker 1: don't let people make their own stuff.

885
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:22,400
Speaker 1: It's okay if it's in cans or bottles But as soon as they're pouring They're gonna leave half-drunk garbage all over the place and they're gonna mix monstrosities that they themselves won't drink.

886
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:28,138
Speaker 0: I think this is at least part of the reason why like, you know Japanese people they always pour the sake for the other person can't pour your own.

887
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:31,899
Speaker 1: Yep Well, that also means that if you're getting drunk, it's harder to pour your own.

888
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:36,500
Speaker 0: At least that's the number one reason I'm saying this is a one of the reasons.

889
00:50:36,522 --> 00:50:45,039
Speaker 1: Yeah you if you if you want to get drunk in that situation like if you're that kind of person you at least need to find Someone else who themselves wants to get drunk and is willing to enable you.

890
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, it raises the bar of getting drunk in terms of drinking and drunk people.

891
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:51,480
Speaker 1: There's gonna be some of your friends.

892
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,213
Speaker 1: They're gonna drink too much alcohol and be dumb.

893
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:55,037
Speaker 0: Don't be friends with them.

894
00:50:55,057 --> 00:50:58,616
Speaker 0: Yep Pretty much like they have a problem.

895
00:50:58,636 --> 00:50:59,079
Speaker 0: Let them know.

896
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:04,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, like don't let your friends get stupid drunk at parties reliable and definitely don't let them drive you.

897
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:12,145
Speaker 1: No But like if there's a friend of yours who gets way too drunk at parties on a regular basis They're gonna bargo like.

898
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:16,380
Speaker 1: they obviously get too drunk to where they can't really interact like every party.

899
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:18,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah talk to them like.

900
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:18,273
Speaker 1: that's.

901
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:19,340
Speaker 1: that's intervention time.

902
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:28,470
Speaker 1: It's one thing if someone gets too drunk at one party but if they're too drunk at three parties in a row, like I'm not even joking like Figure out a way to deal with that's just.

903
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,100
Speaker 0: that's life problems not party problems.

904
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:39,619
Speaker 1: Yeah But parties are the best way for you to see that happening because if you are hosting a party You cannot get that drunk because you're responsible for the party.

905
00:51:40,122 --> 00:51:43,780
Speaker 1: So you will have that like even if like in our group luckily a lot of people don't drink.

906
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:45,314
Speaker 1: So we have a good mix of.

907
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:50,960
Speaker 1: you know Scott who has no alcohol in him you as a little all the way out to certain unnamed people who have a lot of alcohol.

908
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,438
Speaker 1: But at typical parties everyone's pretty drunk which kind of sucks.

909
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:56,740
Speaker 1: that's bad.

910
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,565
Speaker 0: Does they know?

911
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,640
Speaker 0: if there's trouble no one can do anything about it.

912
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,460
Speaker 1: But if you're hosting a party you need to be not drunk so that one you can you know.

913
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:05,585
Speaker 1: Make the party happen.

914
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:10,629
Speaker 0: man if the cops show up and every single person is drunk Who's gonna be the reasonable person to talk to them?

915
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:11,331
Speaker 0: Nobody?

916
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:13,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're all just gonna go to the slammer.

917
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,884
Speaker 1: You can't arrest us all.

918
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:16,309
Speaker 1: you can't arrest us all

919
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,240
Speaker 0: and you're not gonna remember you're gonna wake up in the slammer like fuck

920
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:34,200
Speaker 1: Yep, but even if you're like our group if you're hosting the party you're responsible for everyone's happiness And you're sort of like going around like donating it like making sure things go like you you go over to like the group Of people who are just poking at their phones and like hey, what are you guys up to?

921
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,350
Speaker 1: Why don't you go play a board game with Scott over there?

922
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:53,892
Speaker 1: He's setting up a seven wonders right now Like facilitate all that but as a result you're very well placed to spot People who might be having problems like someone who's got some anxiety Someone who is obviously like not having a good time Obviously because of other issues going on in their life,

923
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:55,558
Speaker 0: and you know why did they come to this party?

924
00:52:55,819 --> 00:53:01,920
Speaker 1: well It's probably good that they at least came to the party But maybe depending the host is in a unique situation to see that shit.

925
00:53:02,502 --> 00:53:04,768
Speaker 1: The problem is I could give way better advice about that.

926
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:09,140
Speaker 0: host also is the only person who hopefully knows everyone at the party.

927
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,026
Speaker 0: Yeah someone who's a guest might not know.

928
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:18,280
Speaker 0: all the other guests would not be looking at those guests that they don't know like they're only Hanging with the people that are in their crew and open invite friends of friends parties.

929
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,931
Speaker 1: That's a whole different ballgame that we're not talking about tonight.

930
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a whole nother world Mmm.

931
00:53:24,626 --> 00:53:25,272
Speaker 0: What else you guys say?

932
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:25,555
Speaker 0: nothing.

933
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:26,526
Speaker 0: I want to go eat pretty much.

934
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:34,285
Speaker 1: One of the most important things other than everything we talked about is just that just make sure that everyone's having a good time Or at least had the opportunity.

935
00:53:34,305 --> 00:53:36,354
Speaker 0: why even having a party if people aren't having a good time?

936
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:37,740
Speaker 1: yep except most parties.

937
