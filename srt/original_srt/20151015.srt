1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,538
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, October 15th, 2015, Spooky.

2
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:16,007
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:16,583
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,409
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,210
Speaker 1: Tonight, spookily, we talk about Halloween.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:23,361
Speaker 1: Holy.

7
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,208
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,009
Speaker 1: Fun fact, Halloween is actually the official anniversary day of Geek Nights.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,230
Speaker 1: That's when we published our first episode, legit.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,549
Speaker 0: That wasn't a beta episode.

11
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:36,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, though, fun.

12
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:55,779
Speaker 1: other fact, we started putting episodes up, starting with the episode like a week after Halloween, but then I finally edited, I was basically going back through the beta episodes, and I decided that October 31st, that we happened to do an episode that day, was the furthest back.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,329
Speaker 1: I could go where episodes were still listenable, so I retconned and put them in the feed.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:11,810
Speaker 1: So we'd recorded that one originally as a beta, sort of, and like I said, but I'll talk about it in a moment, I might make it more accessible for you guys to get the old, old, old beta episodes.

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,470
Speaker 0: That's so boring.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,630
Speaker 0: That's like just telling everyone the terrible secret of space.

17
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,249
Speaker 1: Well, they'll have to pay.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,609
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to make people pay?

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,370
Speaker 1: Oh, it's going to be Patreon.

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,788
Speaker 1: I'm not just going to give it to you fuckers.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,130
Speaker 1: You're going to subscribe to our Patreon and give us money if you want that business.

22
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,229
Speaker 1: I'm going to trickle them out.

23
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,369
Speaker 0: So I got some opening bits.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,189
Speaker 0: Oh, you got some opening bits?

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,050
Speaker 1: In fact, those have never been published, so we could license those, not Creative Commons.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,810
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,750
Speaker 0: I think they say Creative Commons at the end of them in the audio.

28
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,709
Speaker 1: There's no way those do.

29
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,610
Speaker 1: Our intro, as you recall, was the song that we sang.

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,648
Speaker 0: Have you listened to these?

31
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,510
Speaker 1: Yeah.

32
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:45,108
Speaker 0: I haven't.

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,430
Speaker 1: We sang a... Here's a fun fact.

34
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,190
Speaker 1: This isn't meta.

35
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:50,430
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything.

36
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:51,002
Speaker 1: We?

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,750
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,909
Speaker 1: What's the name of the ark that the bad people took down into the Prince of Nothing world and fucked it up?

39
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,464
Speaker 0: The ark?

40
00:01:58,832 --> 00:01:58,921
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:01:59,232 --> 00:01:59,950
Speaker 0: It's called the ark.

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,830
Speaker 0: Inku Halanes?

43
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:02,590
Speaker 1: No.

44
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:04,367
Speaker 0: What's the name?

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,610
Speaker 0: Isn't that where it landed?

46
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,329
Speaker 1: That's also the name of the ark.

47
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,508
Speaker 0: And the people that were on it were the Inku Aroi.

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,190
Speaker 1: Name any character who is a female in those books.

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,618
Speaker 0: Esminet?

50
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,490
Speaker 1: All right, all right.

51
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:18,489
Speaker 1: We remember some things.

52
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,470
Speaker 0: I forget the other girl, though.

53
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,470
Speaker 0: The one who was a serving girl.

54
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:24,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew her name.

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,350
Speaker 1: You don't remember that shit either.

56
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,730
Speaker 1: So I did, but then my brain said Egwene.

57
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:29,829
Speaker 0: Wrong book.

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,570
Speaker 0: Wrong book.

59
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, my brain fucked it up.

60
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:40,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, so- Oh, so Scott and I, in the beta episodes in the early days of Geek Nights, we sang an opening song together for every episode.

61
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:41,550
Speaker 0: I don't remember this.

62
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,169
Speaker 0: You don't remember that?

63
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:42,969
Speaker 1: You don't remember the song?

64
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:43,260
Speaker 1: No.

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,788
Speaker 1: I could sing it right now, but I almost want to save it for the-.

66
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,390
Speaker 0: I can go listen whenever I want.

67
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,990
Speaker 1: You guys are really fucking lucky.

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,490
Speaker 1: We did not decide to keep singing that song as our opening.

69
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,209
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,210
Speaker 0: All right, anyway.

71
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,181
Speaker 0: Oh, is it this one?

72
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:57,870
Speaker 1: Yes, it's that one.

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,510
Speaker 1: Scott remembers.

74
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,408
Speaker 0: You remember things.

75
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,370
Speaker 0: All right, opening bit.

76
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,689
Speaker 0: So I ordered some stuff on Amazon, like you do.

77
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,990
Speaker 1: Oh, I did too recently.

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,889
Speaker 0: And I divided it into two deliveries, like you do.

79
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,283
Speaker 0: No.

80
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,190
Speaker 0: And they were supposed to arrive like yesterday.

81
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,449
Speaker 0: So yesterday I get home and there's nothing there.

82
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:22,690
Speaker 0: And then I check the tracking a little bit later after I eat a salad and watch some TVs or whatever, play some Rocket League.

83
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,130
Speaker 0: And it says delivered.

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,349
Speaker 0: So I go to the door and there it is.

85
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,289
Speaker 0: But there's only one box there.

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,767
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Oh, where's box number

87
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:28,929
Speaker 0: two?".

88
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,687
Speaker 0: So I go back and I check the tracking and it's like, "Box number two delivered

89
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:33,290
Speaker 0: yesterday.".

90
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,577
Speaker 0: I'm like,

91
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:33,884
Speaker 0: "What?"

92
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,225
Speaker 0: And it says, "Signed for by

93
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:37,950
Speaker 0: Gabriella."

94
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,114
Speaker 0: And I'm like,

95
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,284
Speaker 0: "Whoa.".

96
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,129
Speaker 0: I don't know who Gabriella is and Gabriella is not me.

97
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,430
Speaker 1: I know a Gabby and I don't know any other Gab star people.

98
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,310
Speaker 0: So I go to the Amazon chat and I'm like, I mean, there's nothing really in there.

99
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,630
Speaker 0: It was like shampoo and a towel and a washcloth.

100
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,950
Speaker 1: It's not like when I ordered like the Marantz or the Countryman or any of that business.

101
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I decided to stop because I used to just use my old regular towels for the floor towel.

102
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,290
Speaker 0: I actually bought a floor towel that's meant to be a floor towel.

103
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:08,713
Speaker 0: Ooh.

104
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:09,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

105
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:10,989
Speaker 0: Anyway, for the bathroom.

106
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:12,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, that matches.

107
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm like, "Congratulations, thief.

108
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,156
Speaker 0: You got a

109
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:16,500
Speaker 0: towel.".

110
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,529
Speaker 1: But you signed your name for it.

111
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,231
Speaker 0: Yeah.

112
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:23,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I go to the chat on Amazon and I'm like, "Yeah, I didn't get this.

113
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,060
Speaker 0: I don't know who this

114
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:24,304
Speaker 0: is.".

115
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,706
Speaker 0: They're like, "Okay, well, you want us to send you another one or a

116
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,090
Speaker 0: refund?".

117
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,848
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Send me another one, but don't you care who this

118
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:30,029
Speaker 0: is?".

119
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,420
Speaker 0: They're like, "Yeah, we'll

120
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,247
Speaker 0: investigate.".

121
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,108
Speaker 0: "All right, are you all

122
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,290
Speaker 0: set?".

123
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:35,164
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Yeah, I'm all

124
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:35,449
Speaker 0: set.".

125
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,690
Speaker 0: And it's like, they don't even give a shit.

126
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,289
Speaker 0: It's like, dude.

127
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:44,330
Speaker 0: Well, you know, there's this interesting problem where like if the other package had something expensive in it, what if it was that one that they had signed for?

128
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,389
Speaker 1: Maybe then they'd care.

129
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,350
Speaker 1: What it comes down to is that's like step back.

130
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,695
Speaker 1: You know, we've had things stolen.

131
00:04:50,157 --> 00:05:02,270
Speaker 1: and like when your Xbox and all that was stolen, like the dude fucking logged in with your account, like we had an IP address, it kept logging in, and the detectives gave zero fucks.

132
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:09,070
Speaker 0: Well, he sort of like, he put in like the token effort, like he knew he could do it, but it doesn't seem like he went through with it.

133
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:17,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like imagine what our society could be like if there was a way for actual criminal investigation to occur.

134
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,390
Speaker 0: You mean if all the detectives were like Batman?

135
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:19,830
Speaker 1: Not Batman.

136
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,570
Speaker 1: I don't even like break into bars and like break people's fingers.

137
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,929
Speaker 0: But I mean, just, you know, this is smart enough to just figure it out and actually do the job.

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,149
Speaker 1: You don't need Batman for that.

139
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,810
Speaker 1: You just need pretty much ADIQ and up.

140
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,989
Speaker 1: Like it's not rocket science.

141
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,050
Speaker 0: Anyway.

142
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:39,830
Speaker 1: ADIQ and the most minimal of motivation.

143
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:44,050
Speaker 1: So in the news, something interesting happened.

144
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,249
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of stuff you're going to see Thursday episodes, especially a lot of things that are a little bit older coming up.

145
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,410
Speaker 1: One, because geek nights, we've never claimed to be timely.

146
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,929
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be getting your news for us.

147
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,229
Speaker 1: You're getting commentary from us.

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,310
Speaker 1: And two, I was in Australia and Singapore and Hong Kong for like three and a half weeks.

149
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:05,250
Speaker 1: So a lot of stuff happened that I didn't get to talk about publicly with all you people.

150
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,650
Speaker 1: And one of those things that a lot of you might not have noticed, Kickstarter is now a benefit corporation.

151
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,669
Speaker 0: I didn't know that this was a thing.

152
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,926
Speaker 0: Nor did I. But now I know.

153
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:22,489
Speaker 1: So apparently the gist of this is right now there are, if you think of corporations, you usually think of two kinds.

154
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,547
Speaker 0: There's either the S Corp, C Corp, LLC.

155
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,570
Speaker 1: If you're sole proprietorship, you might know more than the average bear.

156
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:32,650
Speaker 1: If you're not Yogi, you're just an average bear.

157
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,929
Speaker 1: There's for profit companies.

158
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:37,229
Speaker 1: There's nonprofit companies.

159
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:45,310
Speaker 1: A lot of you, especially geek nights listeners might know this because your anime convention is probably a nonprofit and they probably have a badly written charter.

160
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:50,801
Speaker 1: And that's why when you want to do something cool, some lawyer says, "Oh, we can't do that or we'll lose our nonprofit

161
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:51,205
Speaker 1: status.".

162
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:55,390
Speaker 1: And that's why a lot of other conventions are for profits.

163
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,508
Speaker 1: They don't have to worry about that.

164
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:09,990
Speaker 1: But a PBC is interesting because the problem with corporations, especially for profit corporations, is that legally their duty is to the shareholders to maximize their value.

165
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:28,050
Speaker 1: So if Scott and I ran Rim and Scott Corp and we had stock or we had investors and we decided to raise salaries for our employees because we're good people and we want them to have living wages, the shareholders could sue us for not executing our fiduciary duty and maximizing their value.

166
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,570
Speaker 0: We work for the company that they invested.

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,490
Speaker 0: We run the shit and they're suing us because we're not making that.

168
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,970
Speaker 0: We could be giving them more money instead of our employees.

169
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:46,210
Speaker 0: We'd have to prove to them that actually giving our employees more money is resulting in them getting more money because it means we can hire better employees which results in more profits.

170
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,269
Speaker 0: And if we can't prove that, then they'll sue us.

171
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,150
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that corporations count as people.

172
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:01,230
Speaker 1: So corporations are basically immortal psychotic sociopaths that live forever siphoning money.

173
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,442
Speaker 0: The thing I don't understand is, if you look at the history of corporations in America, there used to be very few of them.

174
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,510
Speaker 0: They used to be very limited.

175
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,930
Speaker 0: They used to only exist for a short period of time.

176
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,930
Speaker 0: Like the "build this railroad from here to here" corporation.

177
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,950
Speaker 0: It exists to build this railroad from here to here and then it's gone.

178
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,370
Speaker 0: It was a very limited thing that had a purpose and then it sort of blew out of proportion.

179
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,770
Speaker 0: But why is there any other kind of corporation besides public benefit corporation?

180
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,290
Speaker 0: Why should the for-profit corporation even exist?

181
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,190
Speaker 1: "Be suffered to exist" is what I would say.

182
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,669
Speaker 1: And you know what?

183
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,770
Speaker 1: Turns out Scott and I are actually pretty left on the scale of politics.

184
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:50,230
Speaker 1: And I'm very much... I mean, I've said a tweet about this, but basically it's okay to me if two different video game companies are trying to compete with each other for profits.

185
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:51,509
Speaker 1: I don't really care that much.

186
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:57,850
Speaker 1: But two health insurance companies, profit should not be motivator number one.

187
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:02,929
Speaker 1: Motivator number one should be providing that service and paying all your employees a reasonable wage.

188
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:11,610
Speaker 1: So the fact that Kickstarter did this... And it's cool because basically they had to go to all their investors and shareholders and everyone.

189
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,909
Speaker 0: It's easy enough to start as one of these from the get-go.

190
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,970
Speaker 0: But to switch to being one of these, if you have some jerk-ass shareholder, they'll sue you if you try.

191
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but apparently the vote was unanimous.

192
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,190
Speaker 0: Because it's not like it was traded on Nike, right?

193
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,470
Speaker 0: It's like the only people who had shares of Kickstarter were probably cool people.

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,990
Speaker 0: They probably weren't selling them to anybody.

195
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,450
Speaker 1: But there's a lot more going on here.

196
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,390
Speaker 1: But one, read this because this is really cool.

197
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,962
Speaker 1: And I think more people need to realize that.

198
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:40,950
Speaker 1: one, this is an option.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,850
Speaker 1: Two, this happened.

200
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:48,770
Speaker 1: And also, I have a lot of respect for Kickstarter now because this is basically my dream.

201
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:55,250
Speaker 1: If I owned 100% a big game company, I always wanted it to be a straight up non-profit if I had to.

202
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,850
Speaker 0: I would want a company where all employees are equal at the company.

203
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,330
Speaker 0: Everyone owns an equal share and everything, right?

204
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,270
Speaker 1: Well, it depends because you might hire someone who's good at doing the company stuff.

205
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:10,130
Speaker 1: But you wouldn't want them to have, say, other levels of control.

206
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,390
Speaker 1: They might be bad and other things.

207
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,850
Speaker 0: I'll let the janitor have, you know, I'm good.

208
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, he can have a share.

209
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,270
Speaker 0: So you want to hear a related interesting news?

210
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,459
Speaker 0: Who?

211
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,730
Speaker 0: So Square, the swipey payment company.

212
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:20,308
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.

213
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,050
Speaker 0: So they're going public or they're trying to-ish, right?

214
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,630
Speaker 0: And that's, I don't know, I can't give investment advice.

215
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,630
Speaker 0: It's not the worst investment.

216
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:27,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:28,730
Speaker 0: They're a successful business.

218
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,710
Speaker 1: I actually learned a lot about them recently because I didn't know how they were handling the chip stuff and like the new terminals.

219
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,490
Speaker 1: And actually the way they're handling it is way better than I thought.

220
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Speaker 0: But anyway, so they're going public.

221
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,570
Speaker 0: And in the document of like, you know, because you make all these documents and you go public and it's like risks, right?

222
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,389
Speaker 0: And one of the risks on their going public sheet, you know what it says?

223
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:49,988
Speaker 1: What does it say?

224
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,710
Speaker 0: Well, the risk, I don't know the exact words they used, but it's basically like, look, we have a risk of going public.

225
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,730
Speaker 0: Some of our employees have a lot of shares.

226
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:05,250
Speaker 0: And if we go public at our current valuation, they will become so mega rich, they'll probably just fucking leave.

227
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,210
Speaker 0: And that would just tank the company without those employees.

228
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:14,207
Speaker 0: And that makes me like Square if it has the kind of people who will just leave like I would.

229
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:16,889
Speaker 0: And now it's like Square.

230
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,490
Speaker 0: If you call me up, maybe I'll actually talk to you on the phone.

231
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,569
Speaker 0: I'm like every other company.

232
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:21,992
Speaker 0: Yeah.

233
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:22,769
Speaker 1: See, also Kickstarter.

234
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,210
Speaker 0: I'm actually like, but I got to get in on some of those shares.

235
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,908
Speaker 0: I don't need too many.

236
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,490
Speaker 0: I'll take a lot less than everyone else's got.

237
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:28,945
Speaker 0: Just a few.

238
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:29,998
Speaker 0: Like

239
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:30,719
Speaker 0: 10. 10

240
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:30,929
Speaker 0: is good.

241
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,489
Speaker 0: You know, just enough that I don't have to work.

242
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:33,570
Speaker 0: Like all I want.

243
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
Speaker 0: I don't need the yacht out of a game company.

244
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,890
Speaker 1: Like I would if I if I had that cash out, I wouldn't go 100 percent to the beach.

245
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,350
Speaker 1: But what I would do is basically form a company to make cool things.

246
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:51,590
Speaker 1: And as long as it just paid everyone enough money who worked at it to live in New York, about at the level that we live in New York right now, like I'd run that forever.

247
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,529
Speaker 1: I've made extra profits.

248
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:58,270
Speaker 1: I'd use that money either to charity or to make games that won't be popular that I want.

249
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,290
Speaker 1: Like that.

250
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:00,949
Speaker 1: Like imagine if we had money like that.

251
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,930
Speaker 1: Like, let's just make, you know, buy the license and make advance wars.

252
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:04,885
Speaker 1: Go for it.

253
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:05,947
Speaker 1: Hire all those people.

254
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,830
Speaker 0: But I mean, the thing is, you look at people who own a company of that scale.

255
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:09,470
Speaker 0: Right.

256
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,349
Speaker 0: Like Penny Arcade.

257
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,970
Speaker 0: They're still drawing comics.

258
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,868
Speaker 0: Why don't they just go to the beach and be like, fuck you.

259
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,429
Speaker 1: I think I'll go to PAX.

260
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,710
Speaker 1: And I think I think they enjoy doing those things for now.

261
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,829
Speaker 0: Still, I mean, honestly, like every like three days, a fucking week, it's like, yeah, I'd make a gig nights when I felt like it.

262
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,730
Speaker 0: If I was on the beach, not to twice a week, every week.

263
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:38,509
Speaker 1: But if I wasn't doing all this other nine to five bullshit work, I'd probably feel like making actually more gig nights because it's really fun to make gig nights if it isn't the only thing that makes it not fun.

264
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,450
Speaker 0: It's not be my first choice of thing to make if I had plenty of time.

265
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,149
Speaker 0: But perhaps bread and cookies would go up.

266
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,349
Speaker 1: But right now it competes for time with other things.

267
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,669
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

268
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,350
Speaker 0: Playing King Arthur Pendragon while on a boat would go way off the list.

269
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:51,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

270
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,850
Speaker 1: If we were playing King Arthur Pendragon on a boat, we'd be live streaming that shit.

271
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,730
Speaker 0: We could do one Tuesday episode about it when we're all done 10 years later.

272
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you'd also get 10 years of live streams.

273
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,710
Speaker 1: I would I just I would live stream.

274
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,089
Speaker 1: I would do so much video.

275
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,829
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't is because I don't have time.

276
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:08,224
Speaker 1: Anyway.

277
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,450
Speaker 1: So that's my news.

278
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,610
Speaker 1: You got any news on Gig Nights Thursday?

279
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,889
Speaker 0: Other than the lounge?

280
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,730
Speaker 0: You probably this game is going to be over by the time you hear this.

281
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,550
Speaker 0: Most people I know there are some crazy people who listen to the episode as soon as we upload it, which case the game is probably happening.

282
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,110
Speaker 1: Once I finish, I'm doing some renovations in the studio.

283
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,449
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about live streaming all our all our gig nights on YouTube again now that I can do that.

284
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:42,730
Speaker 0: Tonight, October 15th, 2015, there is an important baseball game in Los Angeles between the Mets and the not anymore Brooklyn Dodgers, not Brooklyn anymore Dodgers.

285
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:50,169
Speaker 0: And the winner of that game will go to play in more baseball games this year.

286
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,490
Speaker 0: The loser of that game will go home and take a nap and play baseball again next year.

287
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,550
Speaker 1: So aren't the Cubs going to win the World Series or something?

288
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,310
Speaker 0: If that happens, it'll be the craziest of crazies.

289
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,610
Speaker 1: Is it going to be Mets Cubs?

290
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,447
Speaker 1: Like, what's going on?

291
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,810
Speaker 0: So, yeah, whoever whoever wins is going to go play the Cubs in a best of seven.

292
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:11,010
Speaker 0: And whoever wins four of those seven games will go to the World Series against her.

293
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:12,644
Speaker 1: So there's one funny.

294
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,090
Speaker 1: there's a college.

295
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,255
Speaker 1: It's not my thing of the day, but there's a college humor video recently that was like if Back to the Future happened and they went to 2015.

296
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:20,070
Speaker 1: It's just like today.

297
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,639
Speaker 1: And it's just one of those.

298
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,070
Speaker 1: like no flying cars.

299
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:24,150
Speaker 1: Everything sucks.

300
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,106
Speaker 1: There's still racism.

301
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,189
Speaker 1: There are hoverboards.

302
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,570
Speaker 1: But at one point, there's this long monologue that happens because he sees like Cubs.

303
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,770
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, the Cubs won the World Series.

304
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:40,910
Speaker 1: And then there's this long thing about actually baseball is in a steep decline and interest in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and steroid and blah, blah, blah.

305
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,029
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

306
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,970
Speaker 1: I got a huge backlog of cool things I've seen.

307
00:14:52,230 --> 00:15:01,089
Speaker 1: But these are interesting enough that I'm going to go by the rule of, you know, the thing of the day, like the best thing I saw today or, you know, something like that.

308
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,707
Speaker 1: So I got two tweets here because these tweets are extraordinary and they're tips of icebergs.

309
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,790
Speaker 1: Tweet number one is the wizard of the Democratic debate.

310
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:11,888
Speaker 1: The wizard.

311
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,590
Speaker 1: Very few people watch the United States Democratic primary debate because it's either going to be Hillary or Bernie.

312
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,170
Speaker 1: And those debates aren't.

313
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,009
Speaker 1: Why not both?

314
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:29,770
Speaker 1: Because Hillary would probably not pick Bernie because as a VP, he doesn't bring a state to the table that would otherwise be in contention.

315
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,890
Speaker 1: That's how VP picks work for the Democrats.

316
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,570
Speaker 1: They'd only bring Bernie if Bernie had some.

317
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,970
Speaker 0: And Vermont was swinging to the right?

318
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

319
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,290
Speaker 1: Vermont is going to be blue.

320
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,810
Speaker 0: You don't even need to visit Vermont.

321
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:45,548
Speaker 0: They need someone from Florida, Ohio.

322
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,265
Speaker 0: Vermont is so far left, they voted for Bernie to be this.

323
00:15:50,791 --> 00:16:01,649
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, on the other side, so the Republican debate is like, it's like America took everything that's fucked up about itself, put it all on one stage and let it all happen.

324
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,210
Speaker 1: So for people like me who are cynically and deeply disavowed of real politics, I treat it like football.

325
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,830
Speaker 1: And watching the Democratic debate is like watching...

326
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,589
Speaker 0: It's a waste of time?

327
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,610
Speaker 1: It's like watching that football game we saw in Buffalo that one time that we left at halftime.

328
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,170
Speaker 1: Like, it's just not fun to watch.

329
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,110
Speaker 0: Right, and you would have been better off not watching in the first place, which is why I didn't watch in the first place.

330
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,829
Speaker 1: The Republican debate is like watching...

331
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,930
Speaker 0: You're better off staying at home where it's warm.

332
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,270
Speaker 1: It's like watching that crazy Italian fuck everything, no rules football.

333
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:31,408
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

334
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

335
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,829
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

336
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, like right now, so Ben Carson, Donald Trump, just some politics news that Scott doesn't care about.

337
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,810
Speaker 1: The two of them combined have like 40 or 50 percent of the polling.

338
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:45,250
Speaker 1: They're actually pretty much both far and away beyond everyone else in the pack.

339
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,408
Speaker 1: The two of them just said apparently that they might boycott the rest of the debates because fuck you, we're going to win without them.

340
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:54,570
Speaker 1: Interesting things are happening in US politics.

341
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,570
Speaker 0: I like that, actually.

342
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:55,897
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

344
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,049
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for the two of them to be like, you know what?

345
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:00,729
Speaker 1: Like, here's what I would do if I were them.

346
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,281
Speaker 0: I watch a debate when someone makes it a real debate where the person asking the questions is like, "You didn't answer the question.

347
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,310
Speaker 0: You must answer the question.

348
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,348
Speaker 0: We're all going to sit here until you answer

349
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:09,449
Speaker 0: it.".

350
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:09,806
Speaker 0: Yup.

351
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,290
Speaker 0: That did not answer the question.

352
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,069
Speaker 0: We're going to sit here again until you answer it.

353
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:13,847
Speaker 1: I would have a buzzer.

354
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,410
Speaker 0: If you tell me the debate is doing it like that, then I will watch every single second with full, wrapped attention.

355
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,407
Speaker 1: I want a buzzer and I want a shocker on each of them.

356
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,444
Speaker 0: If you don't answer the question, if you make a tangent, if you do anything that's unrelated to the question, right?

357
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:31,290
Speaker 1: But many other interesting things are happening in the debate.

358
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,589
Speaker 0: If you don't answer fast enough, if you make a factual error, you make a grammatical error.

359
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,950
Speaker 1: In the Democratic debate, there was a crowd, like people in the audience.

360
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wouldn't be much of a debate if no one was watching.

361
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,410
Speaker 1: In the audience, there is a wizard.

362
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,610
Speaker 1: They had this weird, bright blue rim light coming in from multiple angles on the audience to make it look really cool, I guess.

363
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,750
Speaker 1: Everyone just looks kind of bluish, except for this wizard dude.

364
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,709
Speaker 0: He's wearing a blue shirt.

365
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:09,490
Speaker 1: His hair, he is a majestic wizard, and his hair is highlighted so deeply blue, it almost looks like he's photoshopped in.

366
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:16,890
Speaker 1: He is watching through the telepresence of his wizardry, and he shows up in the audience a lot.

367
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,547
Speaker 0: Maybe it was.

368
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,410
Speaker 1: You cannot help but see this dude.

369
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:25,050
Speaker 0: I'm sure this dude is going to be on some talk show soon.

370
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,836
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely.

371
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,050
Speaker 1: This guy, I want him to run for president.

372
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,170
Speaker 0: They're going to find this dude and talk to him, and maybe he's already an important dude to begin with.

373
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,369
Speaker 0: Where was the debate held?

374
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,009
Speaker 0: College, usually?

375
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:34,548
Speaker 0: You know what?

376
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:35,530
Speaker 0: It's usually at a college.

377
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,769
Speaker 0: You're probably a professor there.

378
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:41,310
Speaker 1: If no one's done it yet, I'm going to see if I can track him down and get him on Geek Nights before he shows up on real media.

379
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:42,330
Speaker 0: All right, go for it.

380
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,390
Speaker 1: If I can get this guy on Geek Nights, I'm going to get him on Geek Nights.

381
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,109
Speaker 0: He's probably just a professor at the college, because usually the debates are at colleges.

382
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,750
Speaker 1: I am confident that whatever this guy is ...

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,089
Speaker 0: Or he could just be local old guy.

384
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,790
Speaker 1: I am confident we could have a fascinating 50-minute conversation with this dude.

385
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:06,170
Speaker 0: Anyone who's that old who grows that kind of beard, at the very least, either has war stories, grognard stories ...

386
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,950
Speaker 1: No, but he has the long hair, too, and it's long, straight ...

387
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,170
Speaker 0: Or believes crazy nut conspiracy things.

388
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,010
Speaker 1: It's stark white, long, straight, well-groomed hair.

389
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,969
Speaker 1: This is not eunuch Santa hair.

390
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,670
Speaker 0: He could just be a well-groomed eunuch Santa.

391
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,430
Speaker 1: But that is a contradiction.

392
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:24,390
Speaker 0: Anyway ...

393
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,108
Speaker 1: And the other tweet that I got here that is equally beautiful is Danky Kang.

394
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,180
Speaker 1: There was an answer on Jeopardy.

395
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:40,047
Speaker 1: Yes, there was an answer on Jeopardy, and the answer was basically, "This video game character who is blue is known for collecting rings and going

396
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:40,508
Speaker 1: fast.".

397
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,389
Speaker 0: Could that be Knuckles the Echidna?

398
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,290
Speaker 0: He collects rings, and I'm colorblind.

399
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,023
Speaker 0: Red, blue, colorblind.

400
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:48,669
Speaker 0: It's a thing now.

401
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:53,850
Speaker 1: But apparently, the answer to this is Danky Kang.

402
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,770
Speaker 1: It's a delightful tweet.

403
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,323
Speaker 0: Sure.

404
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,749
Speaker 0: All right, so I think I might have done a video from this guy's YouTube account as a thing of the day before.

405
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,306
Speaker 0: A bit guy?

406
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:05,669
Speaker 0: No, not that guy.

407
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,010
Speaker 0: So there's a YouTube account called S-W-U-N-Y-O-O-N.

408
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,430
Speaker 0: It's this Korean dude, but he's fluent in English, fluent enough to correctly subtitle his own videos in English.

409
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,297
Speaker 0: And you know, there's those reaction videos like, "Kids react.

410
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:20,348
Speaker 0: Old people

411
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:20,530
Speaker 0: react."

412
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,430
Speaker 0: And that's usually highlighting age differences in culture.

413
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,582
Speaker 0: He does videos highlighting culture shock of Korea versus rest of world, usually America, right?

414
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:42,689
Speaker 0: So his first video ever was, "Korean girls are introduced to Nicki Minaj Anaconda," which is like, you know, it's a music video that's so inappropriate, it would not be allowed on Korean television, right?

415
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:51,509
Speaker 0: And he went on to make other videos like, "Korean guys are introduced to The Interview," which is that movie where, you know, Kim Jong-un gets blown up by a train or whatever, right?

416
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:51,902
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

417
00:20:52,511 --> 00:21:05,690
Speaker 0: And then he goes to Japan and he asked all the-- He goes to Japan, he gets to go to school, and he made a couple videos that were like-- He went asking all the people of all the different nationalities who were at the school in Japan, and he's like, "How do you tell when someone's an American?

418
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,866
Speaker 0: How do you tell when someone's a

419
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:07,130
Speaker 0: Korean?".

420
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,150
Speaker 1: Oh, that sounds delicious, the American one.

421
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:16,827
Speaker 0: Right, but his latest video is the most choice, which is, "Korean girls watch South

422
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,089
Speaker 0: Park.".

423
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,790
Speaker 0: He makes them watch South Park.

424
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:20,528
Speaker 1: What season?

425
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,630
Speaker 0: He makes them watch two episodes.

426
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:31,610
Speaker 0: I forget what the first-- Oh, the first episode was-- Oh, the one where Butter's dad goes to the gay brothel.

427
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:37,070
Speaker 0: And the second one he makes them watch is the Steve Jobs centipod one.

428
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:40,450
Speaker 1: Oh, that one might be the grossest one.

429
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:49,470
Speaker 0: And the thing is, though, is I realized-- I mean, you can watch this video for yourself if you're going to, but the thing is South Park is so American.

430
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:54,407
Speaker 0: If you're not American, it's really, really, really hard to understand what the hell's going on.

431
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,530
Speaker 1: Huh, that's interesting.

432
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,370
Speaker 1: I never really thought about it that way.

433
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,409
Speaker 0: Right, and even the newer episodes are so timely, too.

434
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,190
Speaker 0: They're either-- Oh, yeah, so think about it.

435
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:06,850
Speaker 1: Go fuck yourselves, Redskins.

436
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,544
Speaker 1: How would anyone outside of the U.S.

437
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:12,029
Speaker 1: and maybe Canada even know what the fuck that's about?

438
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,450
Speaker 0: They don't know shit, right?

439
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,649
Speaker 0: And it's like, even if you understand the jokes, you're not going to laugh.

440
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:24,249
Speaker 1: You know, it's like us watching really deep in Japanese shows where it's like, "I get that a pun happened

441
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:24,390
Speaker 1: there.".

442
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,149
Speaker 0: But you don't laugh at it.

443
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get it, and then I see the subtitles.

444
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,090
Speaker 0: I understand that that was-- Yes, okay, you've explained it to me, but I don't laugh.

445
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:36,210
Speaker 1: Oh, it sounded like she said caterpillar, bushy eyebrows, something?

446
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,850
Speaker 1: All right, and the guy has really bushy eyebrows because he's old.

447
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,629
Speaker 1: Okay, something happened there.

448
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,969
Speaker 0: But yeah, this guy's YouTube channel is the best.

449
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:53,810
Speaker 0: He doesn't upload too many videos, and the thing is his video production is very good and nice and his subtitles are good, and it's not produced the same way those other React videos are produced.

450
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:57,850
Speaker 0: It's produced in a way that is pleasant to watch and short.

451
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,730
Speaker 0: The video's only five and a half minutes long.

452
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:08,909
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Book Club book was the Wheel of Time book one, and until further notice, the new Book Club book is the rest of the fucking Wheel of Time because we just keep reading them.

453
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,829
Speaker 0: The square of space?

454
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--.

455
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,389
Speaker 1: Matt needs to shut up.

456
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,189
Speaker 0: He hasn't really said anything lately.

457
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,070
Speaker 0: He's just sort of hanging there with his magic spear that he got of evil.

458
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:29,909
Speaker 1: But up until that point, if he had just been quiet at any point for the three previous books, a lot of things would have turned out a lot better for him.

459
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,137
Speaker 1: Just listen.

460
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,330
Speaker 1: Someone's telling you something.

461
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,290
Speaker 1: Just listen to them.

462
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,742
Speaker 1: Stop saying, "Burn me!

463
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:35,126
Speaker 1: Fuck

464
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:35,307
Speaker 1: you!".

465
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:36,868
Speaker 1: Just shut up.

466
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,949
Speaker 1: And also, Perrin, work your shit out.

467
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,495
Speaker 0: Oh, so Rand.

468
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,508
Speaker 0: You seem like a man with a plan now.

469
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:42,890
Speaker 0: Good job.

470
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rand's doing okay.

471
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,790
Speaker 0: Good job using your magical powers there.

472
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,068
Speaker 1: Nyeh-neh-neh-neh-neh-neh still needs to calm down.

473
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,848
Speaker 1: Uh... Rand's getting a little uppity.

474
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,910
Speaker 0: He hasn't really done anything recently.

475
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,470
Speaker 0: He's just killing.

476
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,990
Speaker 1: He's being a little adversarial.

477
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,228
Speaker 1: Well, I guess.

478
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,737
Speaker 1: I like the proactive go-getters.

479
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,190
Speaker 0: I don't like the troublemakers.

480
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:07,690
Speaker 0: Also, evil guys.

481
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:08,889
Speaker 0: Some of them are good.

482
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,490
Speaker 1: I like the evil guys a lot, actually.

483
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, evil guys are getting the job done.

484
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,710
Speaker 1: What did Luke always say?

485
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,590
Speaker 1: Evil does its job.

486
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:17,076
Speaker 0: You know what?

487
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:17,790
Speaker 0: Low gain, also.

488
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:20,449
Speaker 1: We knew way back.

489
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:21,961
Speaker 1: They fired him.

490
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:22,870
Speaker 0: He's a Chekhov's gun.

491
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:23,497
Speaker 0: And you know what?

492
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:24,670
Speaker 0: That trigger's getting pulled.

493
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:26,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, these books are nothing but.

494
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,190
Speaker 1: Anything appears.

495
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,479
Speaker 0: It's not Chekhov's gun.

496
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,370
Speaker 0: It's like Chekhov's armory.

497
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:36,730
Speaker 1: This book is just... Everything that ever comes up comes up again later, and it's a big deal.

498
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,108
Speaker 1: That's the way they go.

499
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,507
Speaker 1: Which I'm okay with.

500
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,090
Speaker 1: People said book six is when we'll get tired and stop reading, so I'm curious.

501
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:46,730
Speaker 1: Other metamoment?

502
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,870
Speaker 1: Probably starting up some Patreon biz, and I'll be talking about that more.

503
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,390
Speaker 1: That'll get you some things.

504
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,170
Speaker 1: I'm also re-spinning up if you want Geeknight's t-shirts.

505
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,969
Speaker 1: I'm going to re-release the old t-shirt.

506
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,847
Speaker 0: Amazon has a thing now that's sort of like Cafe Press only less garbage-y.

507
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,889
Speaker 1: The main reason we stopped doing t-shirts is one, having a New York tax ID was a pain in the ass.

508
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:10,290
Speaker 1: Two, manually shipping those shirts.

509
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,269
Speaker 1: Actually, a lot of you ordered shirts.

510
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:20,689
Speaker 1: I had to carry a fucking bin of shirts to the post office every few days on my way to work and dump them all in the bin one by one with my stuff.

511
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,587
Speaker 1: That's kind of why I stopped offering them.

512
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,888
Speaker 0: We're not trying to make money on them.

513
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,005
Speaker 1: No, we'll make a little money, but mostly people kept asking for swag and we're lazy.

514
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:36,049
Speaker 1: If you donate enough on the Patreon, we can quit our jobs and make all the swag you want.

515
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,089
Speaker 0: You have to donate a lot on the Patreon.

516
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,510
Speaker 1: We'll make the Geeknight's Loot Crate.

517
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,050
Speaker 1: It'll be just like Loot Crate, but we'll send you stuff if you sign up for it every month, guaranteed.

518
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:44,841
Speaker 0: Sure.

519
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,070
Speaker 1: You'll get something in the mail.

520
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,670
Speaker 0: I'll send you all the stuff in my apartment.

521
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,370
Speaker 0: I want to get rid of plenty of nerdy stuff.

522
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,529
Speaker 1: Oh, it's RIM's last three cell phones and a broken RAM stick.

523
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:55,448
Speaker 0: What's this?

524
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:58,950
Speaker 0: A super old sound card that may or may not work.

525
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,649
Speaker 0: Oh, and what's this?

526
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,609
Speaker 0: Comics that Scott bought in a discount bin at a convention like seven years ago that he's never going to read again.

527
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,589
Speaker 1: Oh, a laser printer with a full cartridge.

528
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,010
Speaker 0: Ooh, an empty inkjet cartridge.

529
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,090
Speaker 1: Like $40 in Singaporean money.

530
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:20,230
Speaker 0: Maybe that could be a business, the completely random bullshit Loot Crate.

531
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,690
Speaker 0: You have no guarantees about what will be in there.

532
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,530
Speaker 0: It will be something of value to somebody.

533
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:35,590
Speaker 1: The first person, Scott, for real, the first person to do that and make a big social media splash about it will make money and get a lot of press and attention, and no one else will.

534
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:36,829
Speaker 0: Here's how it'll work.

535
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:38,949
Speaker 0: Send us shit you want to get rid of.

536
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,790
Speaker 0: We will randomly send it to fucking someone else that also signed up, right?

537
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:45,530
Speaker 0: It's like super secret Santa.

538
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,990
Speaker 0: Everyone just send us all the stuff.

539
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,010
Speaker 0: We'll put it in a warehouse, shuffle it up, and send it out every month.

540
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:56,010
Speaker 1: Yes, my name is Jim, and I'm sending you 40 barrels of toxic waste from my factory.

541
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,027
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

542
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,829
Speaker 0: Well, someone else is going to deal with it now.

543
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:01,010
Speaker 1: Oh.

544
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,750
Speaker 1: Dropshipping.

545
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,364
Speaker 1: That serves to be nothing but industrial waste and drugs.

546
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,709
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, look, if you just want to give away your fucking drugs, and we're going to send them to someone else, we're not going to do them.

547
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:20,946
Speaker 1: That is a nice segue, because one of the things that parents are always afraid of on Halloween even when I was a kid was, "Oh, my God, people are going to put drugs in the

548
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:21,170
Speaker 1: candy.".

549
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,788
Speaker 1: Like, no, they're not.

550
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,649
Speaker 0: That has never happened.

551
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:27,149
Speaker 1: Kids, if they found marijuana in their candy...

552
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,483
Speaker 0: We'd be like, "Ew, this isn't candy.

553
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:28,807
Speaker 0: Fuck.".

554
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:32,307
Speaker 1: Or at worst, they would say, "Wow, free

555
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:32,870
Speaker 1: marijuana.".

556
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:39,970
Speaker 0: No one who has marijuana is giving it away for free to kids on Halloween.

557
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless they do it by accident because they put the wrong bowl out, I guess.

558
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,150
Speaker 0: I guess if they were doing it on Halloween and some trick-or-treaters came.

559
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is, it doesn't make you stupid like that.

560
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,230
Speaker 0: Hey, kids, want to get high?

561
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,410
Speaker 1: Someone made a great tweet.

562
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,479
Speaker 1: It showed a tiny Twix bar broken open and just a handgun sitting in between.

563
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,689
Speaker 1: It's like, "Watch out!

564
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,840
Speaker 1: I found this in my kid's

565
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,244
Speaker 1: candy!".

566
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:03,870
Speaker 0: No one has ever put razor blades in the candy.

567
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it has happened once in some crazy, but no, that's not a thing.

568
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:17,510
Speaker 1: Though, when I was a kid in high school, a messed up kid in my class actually did open a box of candy and put needles in it and gave it to the teacher.

569
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,530
Speaker 0: But that was a messed up kid, not an evil adult.

570
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,230
Speaker 0: Even the craziest of adults didn't do that.

571
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, craziest adults gonna stab a bunch of people on an Amtrak or something instead.

572
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,326
Speaker 0: That's right, that's right.

573
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:26,510
Speaker 0: Anyway.

574
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,450
Speaker 0: I can't believe we never did an episode on this.

575
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:38,456
Speaker 0: I was looking through some photos and I was in Connecticut last, and no one really took a lot of photos, relatively speaking, unless we went to Disney World or some shit.

576
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,950
Speaker 0: But there were Halloween photos.

577
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:43,127
Speaker 0: so I saw some Halloween costumes that had been erased from my mind.

578
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:50,981
Speaker 0: Like, dog, My ones like that were Gennaro's scary mask.

579
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,349
Speaker 0: that made everyone my sister really upset.

580
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,002
Speaker 1: My parents dressed us up.

581
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,929
Speaker 1: The earliest costume I can remember was Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.

582
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,289
Speaker 1: Me and my little brother dressed up as them.

583
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,190
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's pictures of that I could find somewhere.

584
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:12,980
Speaker 1: The first costume that any input win is I wanted to be army guy and carry a gun and that was like second or third grade.

585
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:21,289
Speaker 1: Pretty sure like 80% of the boys in my school were dressed up as army guy with gun that one year for some reason.

586
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,657
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

587
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,149
Speaker 1: We were all into army man with gun.

588
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,315
Speaker 1: We all had the same like fake Colt .45 gun.

589
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:35,910
Speaker 0: In first grade the most popular thing everyone at Ghostbuster was the top.

590
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:42,050
Speaker 1: Everyone bought that plastic Ghostbusters like the one like the toy and used that as their costume.

591
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:48,859
Speaker 1: I had that toy but instead my mom made both of us legit fucking Ghostbusters costumes like made them.

592
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:51,448
Speaker 0: Yeah there were some people who made them, some people who didn't.

593
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:55,362
Speaker 0: The first costume, I didn't do that because everyone else was doing it.

594
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:59,610
Speaker 1: The costume that really tells you the path I was on is fourth grade.

595
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:08,978
Speaker 1: I dressed up as vampire 100D because that was like once I knew that you actually look like vampire 100D.

596
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,756
Speaker 1: In my mind I know that I looked exactly like vampire 100D.

597
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:15,770
Speaker 1: I know I looked exactly like that Amano drawing.

598
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,201
Speaker 1: I'm sure that is how it was and I don't have a picture handy.

599
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:28,010
Speaker 1: I feel like if I never looked then as far as I'm concerned I looked exactly like D and no one knew what the hell that was because no one watched anime.

600
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,547
Speaker 1: Anime didn't exist for those people.

601
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:37,410
Speaker 0: I had some of those costumes where you bought them at Toys R Us and it came with like a plastic mask or the rubber band.

602
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,438
Speaker 1: I never had one of those.

603
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,002
Speaker 1: I knew they were cheap shit even when I was a little kid.

604
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:49,590
Speaker 0: Well one of them that I had was Voltron which is awesome and the other one I had is something that I'm trying to look up because I always forget the goddamn name but it's still in the basement.

605
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,670
Speaker 1: The one where there's the three guys with the three different power suits.

606
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,698
Speaker 0: Yes and they snap things onto their body.

607
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:57,970
Speaker 0: I think it's a Hannah Rivera thing.

608
00:30:58,596 --> 00:30:59,909
Speaker 1: I was a big fan of that show.

609
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,096
Speaker 1: Oh fuck.

610
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,495
Speaker 0: It's a garbage show by the way.

611
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:06,376
Speaker 1: Yeah three guys power suits kid show.

612
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,316
Speaker 0: The way the action figures worked is the dude.

613
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:08,850
Speaker 0: Centurions!

614
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:10,396
Speaker 0: Is it Centurions?

615
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:10,577
Speaker 0: Yes.

616
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:11,365
Speaker 0: Let me look at the picture.

617
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:11,890
Speaker 0: It's Centurions.

618
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,103
Speaker 1: Here let me get some images.

619
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,659
Speaker 1: So fun fact.

620
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,546
Speaker 1: Let me look at it.

621
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,747
Speaker 1: I typed into Google three guys power suits kids show and Centurions was literally.

622
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:20,476
Speaker 0: Let me look at the image.

623
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:21,429
Speaker 0: I'll tell you if you're correct.

624
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,324
Speaker 1: I'm confident with Centurions.

625
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:23,930
Speaker 0: It sounds right.

626
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:26,982
Speaker 1: Come on.

627
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:27,590
Speaker 0: Click on images.

628
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,248
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

629
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,253
Speaker 0: Yes.

630
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:30,602
Speaker 0: These guys.

631
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:30,828
Speaker 1: Yep.

632
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,144
Speaker 0: The green guy with the yellow armor.

633
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,650
Speaker 1: I was the blue guy because the green guy was sold out.

634
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,929
Speaker 1: He had the rocket on his arm.

635
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:45,267
Speaker 0: Those are good toys because the action figures basically had these little holes on them sort of like Lego reverse and then you could attach things to their armor.

636
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:47,270
Speaker 1: And the costume had the same gimmick.

637
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

638
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:50,014
Speaker 1: The costumes weren't just costumes.

639
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,790
Speaker 1: The costumes were toys.

640
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:59,430
Speaker 0: No the costume I had was basically a plastic onesie that you tied in the back and then a plastic mask of the rubber band.

641
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,499
Speaker 1: Mine had a legit hard plastic mask in two pieces.

642
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:09,570
Speaker 1: It also had a plastic thing to wear on my arm that had a detachable missile and a bunch of other components.

643
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,690
Speaker 0: I didn't have any components.

644
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:12,942
Speaker 0: Voltron one was the same way.

645
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:18,314
Speaker 0: It was a plastic thing but you tied it in the back and then your feet stick out the bottom.

646
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,134
Speaker 1: I just can't believe typing three guys.

647
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:22,539
Speaker 1: power armor kids show totally worked.

648
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:24,275
Speaker 0: I think it was the only one that had three guys.

649
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,750
Speaker 1: Yeah the three guys is definitely.

650
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,530
Speaker 0: you never did a mask costume?

651
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:31,994
Speaker 1: I couldn't find mask costumes and they were really hard to make.

652
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:36,013
Speaker 1: In fact mask toys were actually pretty hard to get because.

653
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:36,639
Speaker 0: Go on eBay.

654
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,538
Speaker 0: See what you find if you go to eBay.

655
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:46,960
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm saying when I was a kid because when I was a kid one I got into masks like basically day one like early days there were.

656
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,084
Speaker 1: like you couldn't get those that even most toys are us.

657
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:52,215
Speaker 1: The first time I ever saw a mask toy was at Children's Palace.

658
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:55,347
Speaker 0: I think how the thing about Halloween in general is.

659
00:32:55,387 --> 00:33:05,307
Speaker 0: you could tell the cool families like you can tell how good your childhood was and how nerdy it was based on your family's appreciation of Halloween.

660
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,912
Speaker 0: Yeah we still you're mad like Jesus here or whatever.

661
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:11,310
Speaker 0: it's like they weren't even letting you go out on Halloween and they weren't even acknowledging its existence.

662
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:12,479
Speaker 1: Yeah right.

663
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,469
Speaker 1: We get excited about it.

664
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:21,528
Speaker 0: Like first we want to go get the pumpkins and the apple cider and then we put on the cut and then we got the candy and then we ate the candy.

665
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:29,002
Speaker 1: We would reliably dress up the house in like the most horrific violent like horror scenes we could imagine.

666
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,477
Speaker 0: We had all kinds of.

667
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:33,225
Speaker 0: we just had normal decorations but we kept getting more all the time.

668
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,276
Speaker 0: We never threw any away.

669
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,923
Speaker 0: so it's just gonna be just be like first.

670
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:46,744
Speaker 0: we just had like these cardboard things to stick up and then we had like these vinyl bits like and it was so fun because you put like the vinyl bat in the window and it was and then you put little eyeballs on it and then

671
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:51,856
Speaker 1: we I had this hanging skeleton that scared the shit out of me and my brother and we were really young.

672
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,189
Speaker 1: so we'd always like get it out every year and like it's time for the skeleton.

673
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,826
Speaker 0: And then you'd make a ghost with like a foam ball and a little piece of cloth and tie it on a string on the tree.

674
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,837
Speaker 1: We made those in school but we never used them at home because they weren't scary enough.

675
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:06,240
Speaker 1: At home I always wanted like corpses coming out of the ground.

676
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:16,846
Speaker 1: Toward high school like we still did it but we'd do things like make a noose and a gallows and hang somebody from it like a dummy and then scare people when they're coming to the house.

677
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,683
Speaker 0: My mom still has every freaking.

678
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:21,489
Speaker 0: I don't know how long she's had this thing but at least since I was in elementary school.

679
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,398
Speaker 0: she has this sweatshirt.

680
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,956
Speaker 0: It's an orange sweatshirt and on it is like Peanuts Halloween.

681
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:27,975
Speaker 0: Break it out every year.

682
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:31,670
Speaker 0: But yeah it's like you know and she literally wears it every single year.

683
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,768
Speaker 0: She wears the Peanuts Halloween sweatshirt.

684
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,279
Speaker 1: So I definitely have this perception though that like it's not just us great pumpkin.

685
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,277
Speaker 0: you know Halloween special action.

686
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,742
Speaker 1: The Halloween special I actually like the most.

687
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:47,487
Speaker 0: They're all garbage by the way if you try to watch them now so don't.

688
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,096
Speaker 0: but the ones that were the biggest deal when I was a kid.

689
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:54,523
Speaker 1: The Garfield one because that thing was actually like really legit scary and kind of fucked up.

690
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:55,936
Speaker 0: The Garfield one was the best.

691
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,715
Speaker 1: With those like pirate ghosts and it wasn't like.

692
00:34:57,735 --> 00:34:59,090
Speaker 0: Alright so first of all pirate ghosts.

693
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:05,349
Speaker 0: but really the number one thing from the Garfield Halloween special was he would go to the houses and just be like give me.

694
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:06,096
Speaker 0: Yup.

695
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:08,768
Speaker 0: And we'd just be like we'd go up to houses and be like give me.

696
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,135
Speaker 0: Give me.

697
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:10,990
Speaker 0: Right?

698
00:35:11,414 --> 00:35:12,707
Speaker 0: Like that was the inside joke.

699
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:17,514
Speaker 1: But at the end when those pirate ghosts come it's not like Scooby Doo oh no a pirate ghost.

700
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,414
Speaker 0: It's like no it's going to kill Garfield and Odie.

701
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:22,329
Speaker 1: Yeah it's got a knife it's literally going to kill them.

702
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:32,710
Speaker 1: I read a great deconstructive retro blog that wrote about how if you watch that again in the context of the wider Garfield canon there is a very solid reading.

703
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,050
Speaker 0: And this was before there was a Garfield and Friends cartoon.

704
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:38,045
Speaker 0: this is like the only Garfield animation that existed that I knew of.

705
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:38,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

706
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,580
Speaker 1: And it's not Bill Murray but as a kid I thought it was Bill Murray.

707
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,068
Speaker 0: And I don't even think I don't remember it having any stupid Monday jokes or lasagna jokes in it.

708
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,269
Speaker 0: I think he did kick Odie off the table though.

709
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,278
Speaker 0: Which is the real Garfield joke they don't do anymore.

710
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,924
Speaker 1: Well Garfield and Friends was actually a pretty legit show.

711
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:55,463
Speaker 0: Well the Friends part especially.

712
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:55,646
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:57,175
Speaker 1: Anyway.

714
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:57,599
Speaker 1: Sheldon.

715
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:58,286
Speaker 1: Yeah.

716
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:58,448
Speaker 0: Etc.

717
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,253
Speaker 0: Yes.

718
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:00,510
Speaker 1: Ah yeah.

719
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,410
Speaker 0: I don't remember any other Halloween specials besides Peanuts and Garfield.

720
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,458
Speaker 1: And we were also.

721
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,865
Speaker 1: I think it was partly just because of reading comics like Foxtrot and Calvin and Hobbes but Foxtrot came way later.

722
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:11,966
Speaker 0: Yeah.

723
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,903
Speaker 0: Calvin and Hobbes was around.

724
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:25,401
Speaker 1: But even like when Foxtrot was around and I read as a kid there was that mythos of kids maximizing their candy haul from all the newspaper comics cause those were a thing back then too.

725
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:30,064
Speaker 0: We didn't really super maximize but it's like we got so much candy it wasn't necessary to maximize.

726
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,570
Speaker 1: We maximized when we lived in the suburbs outside of Detroit.

727
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,893
Speaker 1: When we were young actually cause we lived in Detroit.

728
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:36,167
Speaker 1: We didn't go trick or treating.

729
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:36,895
Speaker 1: It was too dangerous.

730
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:40,346
Speaker 1: We actually would go to the mall in the rich suburbs and the mall.

731
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:47,098
Speaker 0: There was a mall next to us and people did go to it but we just went to all the houses on the block and we also went to the houses on the next block and the next block.

732
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,530
Speaker 1: We would go to the rich neighborhood.

733
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:55,095
Speaker 1: we'd go to Lakeside Mall like out in the suburbs and do trick or treating in the mall cause it was actually legit too dangerous to go around the neighborhood.

734
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,479
Speaker 0: When we were in Beacon I think no one ever came maybe once.

735
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,903
Speaker 1: That's cause our house is in the fucking edge of town.

736
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:02,390
Speaker 0: And in New York City no one has ever even attempted to come.

737
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,319
Speaker 0: but you know what I figured out.

738
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,954
Speaker 0: what they do in New York City at least in my neighborhood is they go to the stores.

739
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,065
Speaker 0: There's no mall.

740
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:13,641
Speaker 0: They go to the stores cause I remember it was Halloween one year and Halloween was on a Sunday.

741
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:27,360
Speaker 0: and I remember this because I was getting food at that lunchbox place that's closed now and the guy in there was a Jets fan and I know it was Sunday because I was watching the Giants game on Sunday night football and it was on in there and he had-.

742
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,269
Speaker 0: How do you remember this?

743
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,130
Speaker 1: cause you don't remember fucking anything else.

744
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,228
Speaker 0: cause if you watch sports you don't forget them.

745
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:39,549
Speaker 0: and he had you know he had these little Jets pictures hanging on the wall on the thing and a kid comes in to get some food.

746
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:41,321
Speaker 0: well not some food.

747
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:51,381
Speaker 0: a kid comes in to get some trick or treats right and he gives him apples and I'm like oh man if I got apples I would have like let some you know poop in a bag on your porch right on fire.

748
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:58,635
Speaker 0: but the kids were genuinely happy to get the apples and they were eating the apples before they even left the store.

749
00:37:58,695 --> 00:37:59,563
Speaker 1: Well what happened?

750
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:00,835
Speaker 1: What happened to kids?

751
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:03,300
Speaker 0: Well I mean it is apple season.

752
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,401
Speaker 1: Yeah but like when I was a kid there was some fucking delicious apples.

753
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,614
Speaker 0: he probably got them from the apple house.

754
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,170
Speaker 1: When I was a kid like we had apples in the house.

755
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,404
Speaker 0: my goal was full size Snickers bars and it's like we went apple picking.

756
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:13,670
Speaker 0: when we went to get the pumpkins we had apples.

757
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,470
Speaker 1: we didn't need you to give us any.

758
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:21,503
Speaker 0: yeah but it's like when I was a kid no one ever tried to give you an apple but people did give you the old lady candy.

759
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:22,493
Speaker 0: it's like you don't want that shit.

760
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:23,850
Speaker 0: it's like take it back grandma.

761
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,159
Speaker 1: yup what do you want?

762
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,102
Speaker 1: you want a popcorn ball so dense that it literally requires a chisel to eat?

763
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,697
Speaker 0: If it's not name brand go fuck yourself.

764
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,878
Speaker 0: take this neck away from you and shove it up your ass.

765
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:40,654
Speaker 1: I remember sadly there was a really nice old lady at least give me a smarty and she would make like handmade candy apples and she was super nice.

766
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,790
Speaker 1: but my parents wouldn't let us eat them one because as a kid I thought candy apples were nasty so I didn't want to eat them anyway.

767
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,839
Speaker 0: Candy apples are not.

768
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,856
Speaker 0: I mean they're really sweet but they're not a good time to eat and you can't finish them anyway.

769
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:52,776
Speaker 0: yeah and they're just a pain in the ass.

770
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,061
Speaker 0: but if you want to have a candy apple here's what you do.

771
00:38:55,203 --> 00:39:03,670
Speaker 0: take an apple cut it up with one of the little apple slicey things that you push down and then just drizzle some butterscotch on it instead of caramel because butterscotch is way better.

772
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:06,129
Speaker 1: it's a saw of cat hair.

773
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:08,010
Speaker 0: so that's a problem.

774
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:15,685
Speaker 0: yeah but just drizzle some fucking butterscotch on the apples and then eat them or make a baked apple ready for a baked apple recipe.

775
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:16,838
Speaker 0: it's the easiest thing in the world.

776
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,938
Speaker 0: take apple core the apple.

777
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,755
Speaker 1: do not forget to core the apple.

778
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,610
Speaker 1: I learned that lesson.

779
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:26,589
Speaker 0: take the core out of the apple without removing the bottom of the apple.

780
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:28,406
Speaker 0: put it in some tinfoil.

781
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:35,598
Speaker 0: then in the middle of that apple shove in deliciousness like sugar cinnamon sugar butter cinnamon all kinds.

782
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:35,881
Speaker 0: right.

783
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:37,923
Speaker 0: close the tinfoil over the top.

784
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:41,720
Speaker 0: put it in a tray so you don't get apple juice all over your oven.

785
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,298
Speaker 0: put it in the oven.

786
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:48,529
Speaker 0: wait take it out of the oven and now it is like apple pie without pie.

787
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:50,930
Speaker 1: also don't use some mealy nasty apple.

788
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:54,849
Speaker 0: no you gotta use the most quality apple that you can get.

789
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:56,050
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into apples.

790
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,001
Speaker 0: go to the apple house and get like a jonah gold or something pretty sure.

791
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,534
Speaker 1: we did an episode on apples recently where we talked about different cultivars.

792
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:11,130
Speaker 0: I was gonna do tonight's episode on apples and save the halloween idea for halloween times but we already did an episode on apples relatively recently.

793
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:14,629
Speaker 0: no it was a long time ago but we haven't done an episode on halloween.

794
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,324
Speaker 1: I remember looking at the list of apple cultivars recently on a geek knives episode.

795
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,000
Speaker 1: maybe we were talking about something else I don't know.

796
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:24,222
Speaker 0: I'll go find out what that episode seems like an old episode but we have done apples.

797
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,990
Speaker 0: if you want to hear the apple episode go to frontrecruit.com and search for apple.

798
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:31,558
Speaker 1: so I do feel like as time went on like halloween really changed as a holiday cause.

799
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,679
Speaker 1: as a kid like I lived in Detroit.

800
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,839
Speaker 0: so halloween change or did we change?

801
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,173
Speaker 1: I think halloween change?

802
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:37,859
Speaker 0: I think both.

803
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,070
Speaker 1: yeah we changed.

804
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,818
Speaker 1: halloween change cause.

805
00:40:39,839 --> 00:41:00,769
Speaker 1: I've noticed that when I was a kid like I didn't interact with that many adults who were younger than my parents but it seemed like a lot of them stayed home or didn't do a lot like we'd go visit like friends of the family or whatever like doing trick or treating and the people who were our age who were like their older kids or whatever were just hanging around the house or not doing a lot.

806
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:09,330
Speaker 1: well I feel like now the halloween party has become a big like halloween is a twenty to thirty something year old like big party holiday.

807
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:11,473
Speaker 0: now you realize that when right.

808
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:15,836
Speaker 1: so maybe those guys those kids of my parents the old friends were all just losers like?

809
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:16,464
Speaker 1: I don't know.

810
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:19,169
Speaker 0: no here's the problem where your memory is fucked up.

811
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,492
Speaker 0: right.

812
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:22,340
Speaker 0: so at that time you were like elementary school right.

813
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:25,551
Speaker 0: yup right okay those kids you remember like who were older than you.

814
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,935
Speaker 1: they were like college kids home from college.

815
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,744
Speaker 0: right they were college kids or teenagers.

816
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:36,490
Speaker 0: right anyone older than college kids in like the eighties was your parents.

817
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,363
Speaker 0: they were already parents.

818
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:41,674
Speaker 0: people had kids and got married younger just a few decades ago.

819
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:46,321
Speaker 0: now you have people like us who were you know early thirties not married.

820
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:46,887
Speaker 0: no kids.

821
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:50,844
Speaker 0: so we're halloweening it up and we're also in a city so we're doubling it up.

822
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:53,754
Speaker 1: the city is a big thing because in new york like go to St.

823
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:56,946
Speaker 1: Marks like go to any hip neighborhood on halloween it is party central.

824
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:01,735
Speaker 0: also the college kids that were still at college and not home were partying it up also in halloween.

825
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:02,039
Speaker 1: of course.

826
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,590
Speaker 1: I remember at RIT there were not many halloween parties and there was plenty of halloween action.

827
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,029
Speaker 1: not that many it wasn't that big.

828
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:09,755
Speaker 0: there was a lot.

829
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:12,560
Speaker 1: the frats threw their like giant like fucking parties.

830
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,286
Speaker 0: it was big time.

831
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,397
Speaker 0: halloween action RIT.

832
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,277
Speaker 0: it was like the last chance to have a blast before it fucking iced over everything.

833
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:26,378
Speaker 1: yeah but I feel I remember like a lot of the parties were actually the weekend before thanksgiving because people well that's you know if it stayed warm and you got lucky go again.

834
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,662
Speaker 0: you know keep going till you can't go no more.

835
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:32,540
Speaker 1: or random parties out of nowhere like that one that had the riot.

836
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:34,640
Speaker 0: that wasn't random out of nowhere yeah it was.

837
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,362
Speaker 1: they scheduled in advance like hey guys this day party racket fest whatever.

838
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:40,362
Speaker 1: yeah yeah it was.

839
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:41,801
Speaker 1: they picked that date randomly.

840
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:42,290
Speaker 0: anyway.

841
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,110
Speaker 0: what else is there to say about halloween?

842
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,837
Speaker 0: you got the candy.

843
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:51,069
Speaker 0: you got the halloween entertainment media like the specials and even the internets.

844
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:54,966
Speaker 1: we had this cassette tape that every year and I was a big fan of it.

845
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:56,561
Speaker 1: it was a horror sound thing.

846
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,588
Speaker 0: oh we had one of those and it was just like.

847
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,910
Speaker 1: no it was like dozens of people screaming violently.

848
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:05,510
Speaker 0: ours was like it had witches cackling.

849
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,310
Speaker 1: it had that but there was this undercurrent of humans screaming violently.

850
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,287
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can just get an mp3 now.

851
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:11,873
Speaker 0: you don't need the.

852
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:13,289
Speaker 0: yeah you don't need the cassette tape.

853
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:21,026
Speaker 1: we'd always watch the horror movie around halloween like the days before halloween like we'd sit down and watch like some slasher film like as a family.

854
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:21,836
Speaker 1: that was always a thing we'd do.

855
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:25,370
Speaker 1: a little alien action yeah more like jason kind of movies.

856
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:26,319
Speaker 0: jason kind of action.

857
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,118
Speaker 1: yeah jason freddy like that kind of stuff.

858
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,209
Speaker 1: that was our halloween jam.

859
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:31,450
Speaker 1: I was a big fan.

860
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:31,612
Speaker 1: like.

861
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:36,648
Speaker 1: what I like to do with my little friends is your little friends yeah when I was little where are your little friends?

862
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:40,295
Speaker 1: they're chasing the moon in 1q84 little people.

863
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:53,932
Speaker 1: okay I like to tell ghost stories like not believing in ghosts just telling ghost stories to where I've never had someone tell a ghost story and have it actually be scary in any way?

864
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:57,470
Speaker 1: yeah well I'd sometimes would do a jump scare as part of my ghost story.

865
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,397
Speaker 0: I also jump scare because you can't get a real scare because you suck.

866
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:01,226
Speaker 1: I can get real scares.

867
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:12,133
Speaker 1: but the way I got real scare scares was telling ghost stories like they were true to gullible friends that got the scare especially when I tell ghost stories about my own house.

868
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:13,889
Speaker 1: that was a kid when I was younger.

869
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:19,389
Speaker 0: I remember you telling me these stories at RIT and you absolutely believed them at that time.

870
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:21,470
Speaker 1: that is how you tell a good ghost story.

871
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,310
Speaker 0: you were trying to convince us so desperately that your house you grew up in was actually haunted.

872
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:27,229
Speaker 1: we have some friends.

873
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:29,466
Speaker 0: I was basically like that's bullshit.

874
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:29,990
Speaker 0: you're crazy.

875
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:33,326
Speaker 1: I remember that specific time because we went on this long walk like I remember.

876
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:36,739
Speaker 1: we walked through Rochester and we ended up like in that big cemetery.

877
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:42,237
Speaker 1: and I was telling those stories because some of our friends who will not be named were getting legit nervous.

878
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:43,229
Speaker 0: but you believed them.

879
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,073
Speaker 1: I believed them when I was a little kid not just a ghost story.

880
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:46,962
Speaker 0: you believed them at RIT.

881
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:48,094
Speaker 1: I did not believe.

882
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:50,072
Speaker 0: you believed other nonsense at RIT too.

883
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:54,962
Speaker 1: I did but I did not believe at RIT that my house was actually haunted.

884
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,840
Speaker 0: you seemed as if you were convinced.

885
00:44:57,183 --> 00:45:06,850
Speaker 1: I was trying to legit scare people in fact I tell those stories every year on Fark in the halloween thread and you were trying to convince me that fairies were real.

886
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:15,130
Speaker 0: that was the exact same walk and I was upsetting them and you legit believed in fairies and I was the only one who was like.

887
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,837
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

888
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:16,545
Speaker 0: what's wrong with you?

889
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:17,899
Speaker 1: I remember just trees.

890
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:21,010
Speaker 1: dammit duane was a druid I guess.

891
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,150
Speaker 0: well dammit duane definitely believed even more than you.

892
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,209
Speaker 1: dammit duane was real easy to convince about stuff but that's a separate story.

893
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:28,807
Speaker 0: he believed it on his own.

894
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:31,029
Speaker 1: I think he had some chemical help.

895
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:38,789
Speaker 1: the best way to tell a ghost story is to act like it's true and tell people this legit fucking thing happened to me.

896
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:40,328
Speaker 0: act like you believed it too.

897
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:49,824
Speaker 1: if you want to scare people and you want legit ghost stories go find the Fark halloween thread and every year the tradition is people just tell stories like that.

898
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,770
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can find old Fark halloween threads.

899
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,689
Speaker 1: every Fark halloween thread is up there.

900
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,530
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's an archive of it somewhere.

901
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,788
Speaker 1: they are actually my current favorite halloween pastime.

902
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:08,389
Speaker 1: I love ghost stories except you know my grandma has ghost stories because she had alzheimers and thought she saw ghosts partly because of that.

903
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:12,546
