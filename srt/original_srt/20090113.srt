1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,726
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 13th.

2
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:12,388
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:15,035
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:25,901
Speaker 0: We talk a bit about fallout 3.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:39,917
Speaker 0: So uh over the xmas holiday one of the things I did is I bought gifts for some people and I got Emily a copy of chrono trigger on the DS.

7
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:44,331
Speaker 0: It's weird how I didn't really have any desire to play that game again.

8
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,419
Speaker 0: I mean I played that game like 40 times.

9
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:52,757
Speaker 1: I didn't play it 40 times more like four times and mostly the only.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,792
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way I play even though I knew there were zillion endings.

11
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:59,872
Speaker 1: the only one of the only reasons I was actually able to play it again was because of plus mode.

12
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:00,495
Speaker 1: yeah plus.

13
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:01,520
Speaker 0: well what I was about to say?

14
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:12,430
Speaker 0: I played through the whole game Maybe three or four times in my life one time when I was living alone and I had nothing to do and I had an emulator, but I Played plus mode 36 times.

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,006
Speaker 0: yeah plus mode because I would just go around like hey I'll go beat that boss.

16
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,379
Speaker 0: Just because it'll take me like five minutes to get there.

17
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:19,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know.

18
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,400
Speaker 1: I think that they should just have the option of just starting the game plus mode.

19
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:28,500
Speaker 1: That way you know you can get all the goodness without having you know the bet cuz chrono trigger.

20
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:35,540
Speaker 1: While it's probably what the best Japanese RPG game you have to beat the game as JRPG BS.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,680
Speaker 0: You have to beat the game at least once the real way or else plus mode is just stupid.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz then you just go into the bucket right away and win a game over in plus mode like WTF mate.

23
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you play in real mode then you just.

24
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:52,593
Speaker 0: one thing I can say that I didn't expect was Watching because we have another friend Jess who hadn't really played this game before.

25
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:59,600
Speaker 0: so I'm watching the two of them Play this game, and I'm seeing it again from those kind of virgin eyes.

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:20,944
Speaker 0: I mean I think back to the game, and I remember being good and awesome and enjoying it but Seeing someone else play it and starting to remember the sort of all the first like the first time I encountered certain things like I Think the iconic moment for me was when I got back from saving the girl in the past and I go to the courtroom thing and That guy walks out.

27
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:21,646
Speaker 0: that guy what?

28
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:25,356
Speaker 0: whose lunch I ate, and I remember thinking what the fuck.

29
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:26,640
Speaker 0: What's he doing here?

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,202
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

31
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,025
Speaker 0: I can't believe it.

32
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,472
Speaker 1: damn it damn it damn it damn it.

33
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:30,356
Speaker 1: I can't believe eating.

34
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:31,200
Speaker 1: the lunch mattered.

35
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,640
Speaker 0: Ah, I can't believe it or uh, but you're still hungry.

36
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,164
Speaker 1: You're still hungry.

37
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,509
Speaker 1: How about that guy who raises you?

38
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,597
Speaker 0: Oh my god with the mode seven.

39
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,403
Speaker 1: yep I love that.

40
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,827
Speaker 1: also gato.

41
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,712
Speaker 0: He has metal joints.

42
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,036
Speaker 1: You put the gato song in.

43
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:47,838
Speaker 0: oh my god.

44
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:48,440
Speaker 0: I'll find it.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,609
Speaker 0: I got it even though apparently I was.

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,027
Speaker 0: I was catching up on old fast karate and Apparently Dave downloaded the entire.

47
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:58,699
Speaker 0: I mean I downloaded the entire OC remix collection in like.

48
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:04,071
Speaker 0: So I haven't updated my OC remix collection since then.

49
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:10,379
Speaker 0: apparently he downloaded the current collection And he's going through every song trying to find the good ones.

50
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:15,298
Speaker 0: Apparently the ratio of good to bad has only decreased over time, huh?

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,202
Speaker 0: Duly noted.

52
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,968
Speaker 0: I'm giving up any plan.

53
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:19,951
Speaker 0: I'm open when he finishes.

54
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,780
Speaker 0: I can ask him for his complete perfect collection.

55
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,687
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not a bad idea.

56
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,570
Speaker 0: That's what I got to do.

57
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,637
Speaker 0: so godspeed David Riley.

58
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,658
Speaker 0: Godspeed alrighty.

59
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:31,786
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

60
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,540
Speaker 0: you can play any games other than I've been playing NS.

61
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,176
Speaker 1: I finished playing Fallout 3. no desire to play it anymore.

62
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:42,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm playing that alchemy flash game.

63
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,580
Speaker 0: Oh my god that alchemy flash game was like a breath of fresh air.

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,505
Speaker 1: It's a good game.

65
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:54,134
Speaker 0: It is even though it builds upon trends We've been seeing in gaming anyway, but it executes it better than many of those games have.

66
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,280
Speaker 1: it's a good game for learning the programming.

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,736
Speaker 0: Let me tell you yeah god if I was teaching like elementary or middle school kids about computers I would totally make them play this game in class.

68
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:04,299
Speaker 1: mm-hmm.

69
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:13,528
Speaker 1: Well really it's not gonna teach you a lot about some aspects of computing, but it will help you with things like You know Pipelining and stuff like that.

70
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,514
Speaker 0: It'll teach you about the logics.

71
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it.

72
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,545
Speaker 1: I mean It's hard to think about it sort of as functions even though they're there, but yeah It doesn't.

73
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:23,826
Speaker 1: you know.

74
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,440
Speaker 1: it's like there are functions here, but it's hard to see them unless you know.

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,178
Speaker 0: But ideas like race conditions are very apparent to even someone who's never heard of a race condition before.

76
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,322
Speaker 1: oh indeed They won't.

77
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,594
Speaker 1: they won't know to call it a race condition, but they will know.

78
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 0: but they'll know what that thing is.

79
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:44,148
Speaker 1: I know throw in some weights Actually would probably help you with some quake scripting to play this game.

80
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:45,573
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

81
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:47,760
Speaker 0: I'm done with quake scripting.

82
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,893
Speaker 0: I remember I wrote a function.

83
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,140
Speaker 1: wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

84
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,897
Speaker 0: I wrote a function in quake that was just a loop of 20 weights.

85
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:05,540
Speaker 1: Well a lot of people do right is the fastest way to do it is you do You just type five weights real quick like we're right and then you call that weight five.

86
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,456
Speaker 1: And then you do like five weight fives and now you have 25 weight.

87
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,620
Speaker 0: yep I had all different.

88
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,952
Speaker 1: And then you could do 425 weights to get a hundred weight.

89
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,000
Speaker 0: you realize I had two different keys.

90
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:29,400
Speaker 0: One was bound to my low ping bastard offhand grenade script because it gave you offhand grenades and quick to a game Which famously did not have offhand grenades, but what game nowadays has offhand grenades?

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,634
Speaker 0: Nothing that's right, but back then it was famous.

92
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:34,558
Speaker 0: It was a big deal.

93
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 1: I remember I think actually halo has offhand grenades.

94
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:49,397
Speaker 0: I remember like the first thing I heard about quake - like when my friends were all buzzing about it because we were all in the Clan communities back then and it was like oh my god quake - has a date and oh my god.

95
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:50,460
Speaker 0: No offhand grenades.

96
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:57,908
Speaker 0: But so I had the script that would give you offhand grenades And I had the low ping version.

97
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:01,200
Speaker 1: and the high ping version is basically switch weapon throw grenade switch weapon.

98
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:08,020
Speaker 0: Yes, because I there was a previous weapon Command and so I would use that to get back to whatever weapon I was using before.

99
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:12,900
Speaker 0: It was pretty elegant for someone in high school who had never really written anything other than Q basic.

100
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,426
Speaker 1: Yeah And you know that's a huge advantage.

101
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:25,399
Speaker 0: being able to push a button to throw a grenade while still using your other weapon Bonus points for giving it to an entire clan does making them dominate for a short while before other people also get it.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,927
Speaker 0: But anyway, you got any.

103
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:27,409
Speaker 0: I don't know.

104
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,434
Speaker 0: video game news.

105
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,946
Speaker 1: Oh Video game news.

106
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:31,730
Speaker 1: what's going on?

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,855
Speaker 1: Apparently, I don't know.

108
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:33,919
Speaker 1: Sony's losing money.

109
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,479
Speaker 1: Nintendo's making money even though I don't know what games that are coming out with.

110
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,583
Speaker 0: well You know what?

111
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:42,575
Speaker 0: They're making money off of Wii Sports sold more than Mario Brothers.

112
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:45,304
Speaker 0: Well Super Mario Brothers Actually, there's a.

113
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:50,140
Speaker 1: there's an EA game coming out for the DS called like Henry has worth or something like that.

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,706
Speaker 1: It's a little puzzle II platform run gonna.

115
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,373
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take a look at that when it comes out.

116
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:59,860
Speaker 1: in the meantime This is a clothing store on the corner from my work the Uniqlo or whatever.

117
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:07,180
Speaker 1: It's basically Japanese Old Navy, but you know it in you know, it's like there's probably like one Old Navy in Japan.

118
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:11,075
Speaker 1: So there's one Uniqlo and I don't know there might be more than one Uniqlo in the u.s.

119
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,220
Speaker 1: But there's one in New York City.

120
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:20,360
Speaker 1: It's probably not one near your house And they tend to have you know nerdy clothes because even though it's Japanese Old Navy, right?

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,237
Speaker 1: I mean if you walk into Old Navy or I guess like Kohl's or whatever in the u.s You'll see clothes that have like u.s.

122
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:33,079
Speaker 1: You know properties licensed properties on them like you can go get like Superman underwear for your kid or whatever, right?

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,860
Speaker 1: So of course and yes for your kid in quotes, right?

124
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:47,133
Speaker 1: so and you know a Japanese Old Navy you're gonna see like they had all sorts of like Tezuka style and shirts and Gogo 13 shirts, you know, and this is sort of for us.

125
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:53,133
Speaker 1: It's like all man's hot merchandise Japanese licensed properties on them, but for them is class for them.

126
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:59,199
Speaker 1: It's like oh, there's some licensed property shirts Just like the way you would look at like like a spongebob shirt at Kohl's.

127
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaker 0: But nothing's classier than wearing some good jeans a nice gray blazer and a Duke Togo face right underneath that business.

128
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:10,143
Speaker 1: So, you know, they did all the manga style in a while back, you know which I guess they do.

129
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,791
Speaker 1: I always see people have the.

130
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 1: the bags from the store always have like Going to guy characters on them, but now apparently in the spring It's gonna be all video game actions gonna be Sega Capcom Taito Sony Bandai Hudson.

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,767
Speaker 0: We've got to get in on this.

132
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,453
Speaker 1: We're looking at some Sonic the Hedgehog.

133
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:34,863
Speaker 1: We're looking at some Megaman looking some breakout Prap of the rapper.

134
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:43,505
Speaker 0: I'm glad we're seeing like the biggest increase in my wardrobe the biggest purging and then rebuilding that I've had Since I got to RIT.

135
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:50,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're gonna have to go, you know, we'll head over there and like March or whatever Shopping.

136
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:51,630
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh shoes.

137
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,920
Speaker 1: Yeah a little little Megaman shirt going on But a high-class Megaman shirt not some crap ass Megaman.

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:08,720
Speaker 0: it's always like with anime stuff and even a lot of video game stuff the difference between the Big square print of the red dragon versus the classy stylized red dragon or the big square print of all.

139
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:14,980
Speaker 1: Strange how you can have like, you know, you can have like a like a shirt has Megaman on it But then you have a shirt with Megaman on it.

140
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,200
Speaker 1: That is like actually not lame and it's hard to tell with the differences.

141
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:28,622
Speaker 0: But the extra part is if you go too far into the lame spectrum It gets into that kind of hipster retro or ironic territory and suddenly it's cool again Like if it's.

142
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:33,442
Speaker 0: if it's a really really lame shirt, it's totally awesome Uh-huh.

143
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:37,180
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure where the line is because you know, there's a bottom of that trend.

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,460
Speaker 0: There's a point at which it's the worst possible shirt and then and then it becomes iconic like that red dragon shirt.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,977
Speaker 0: You all know which one I'm talking about.

146
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,392
Speaker 1: We should find a picture of that red dragon shirt.

147
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,973
Speaker 1: be like if you are wearing this shirt You are that guy.

148
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,266
Speaker 1: if You own this shirt.

149
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,189
Speaker 1: You are that guy.

150
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,020
Speaker 0: do not wear this shirt, but a lot of us owned that shirt.

151
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,704
Speaker 1: I oh I never owned that shirt Although I did see it.

152
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,339
Speaker 0: I did in fact own that shirt in middle school, but I did not wear it that often.

153
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:06,765
Speaker 0: That often.

154
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:19,408
Speaker 0: well the thing is when I was in middle school in the Midwest The fashion was the thing that guys were allowed to wear was somewhat raggedy jeans Or corduroys again with cords

155
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,855
Speaker 1: and red dragon shirts some

156
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:30,433
Speaker 0: sort of dumb t-shirt Like a lot of people would wear like their dare t-shirt But totally ironically and then a flannel shirt over that unbuttoned.

157
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,740
Speaker 0: That was like the prescribed style.

158
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,467
Speaker 0: No one was allowed to deviate from what.

159
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,113
Speaker 0: if you did I don't know but ever.

160
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,037
Speaker 0: that's what everyone dressed like.

161
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:37,640
Speaker 0: it was middle school.

162
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, I dressed like that.

163
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:44,279
Speaker 0: I'd alternate between the red dragon and the dare and the nondescript black.

164
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,146
Speaker 1: Anyway Yeah, this is pretty.

165
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,494
Speaker 1: this is pretty good news right here.

166
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,540
Speaker 1: I got a. I don't know.

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,730
Speaker 1: I got a lot of t-shirts and it's like the oldest ones.

168
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,806
Speaker 1: I can't get rid of for whatever reason some of the you know and it's like Now.

169
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:06,819
Speaker 1: it's like I've got like three tiers of t-shirt And it's like I keep adding a newer better tier and then somehow the slightly the what used to be the top tier moves down.

170
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,179
Speaker 1: But I can't get rid of any of them.

171
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:11,490
Speaker 0: The worst thing is I have the product.

172
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,016
Speaker 0: I gotta buy new socks like every sock I own has a hole in it.

173
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:24,512
Speaker 0: But I feel like if I buy new socks without destroying the old socks And I put these new socks in my drawer with the old socks the next time I open it It'll still all be old socks.

174
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,160
Speaker 0: It seems to happen to me.

175
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:26,722
Speaker 0: I don't know.

176
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:27,164
Speaker 0: I don't know.

177
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,593
Speaker 0: if they convert maybe the old socks eat him.

178
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:30,136
Speaker 0: I don't know.

179
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:30,778
Speaker 1: no it's.

180
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,240
Speaker 1: it's true.

181
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,280
Speaker 1: I got rid of all my old socks and bought all new ones a couple years ago.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,686
Speaker 1: I'll probably do it in another year, too.

183
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:36,610
Speaker 1: It's.

184
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,614
Speaker 1: it's a very good idea.

185
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:47,580
Speaker 0: doesn't help that to this day I can't figure out which Visigoth it is but one of our friends Invariably will leave like the worst most stretched out crew socks ever.

186
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,250
Speaker 1: I don't know how people wear such thin useless socks.

187
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,920
Speaker 1: It's like you're better off wearing no socks, but they're so stretched out.

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,026
Speaker 0: They've got to be either.

189
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,479
Speaker 0: They must either have club feet, and we don't know about.

190
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,326
Speaker 0: yeah That's another thing.

191
00:11:57,346 --> 00:12:01,674
Speaker 1: like such stretched out socks It's like a sock needs to be like you know.

192
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:02,800
Speaker 0: you could buy it one size.

193
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if the sock is stretched out, then it must be like falling down around the ankle.

194
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:11,860
Speaker 1: It's like first of all I get socks that don't go very high up except in the winter, right?

195
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,851
Speaker 0: Oh come on you gotta rock the knee socks, and if they do go up.

196
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,538
Speaker 1: They got to stay up.

197
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,809
Speaker 1: They can't be flopping down.

198
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,338
Speaker 0: Do you remember the the Seinfeld about?

199
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:20,479
Speaker 0: yes?

200
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,919
Speaker 1: I was referring to the Seinfeld about that.

201
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:29,596
Speaker 0: Well, then but but moving on back to video games a bit it finally happened.

202
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,120
Speaker 0: No one didn't see this coming.

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,499
Speaker 0: There were rumblings about this in like July of last year that this would happen mm-hmm.

204
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,024
Speaker 0: But uh wrath of the Lich King is coming to fallout 3.

205
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,592
Speaker 0: There's doubt there is an expansion.

206
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:48,054
Speaker 0: well actually multiple expansions Pay downloadable content for the single-player game.

207
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,559
Speaker 0: fallout 3. it is here.

208
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,911
Speaker 0: You're going to have it well depending on the price.

209
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,198
Speaker 1: I mean is that really any different from an expansion pack?

210
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,563
Speaker 0: well It's tricky.

211
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,053
Speaker 1: It seems like it's an ok DLC right.

212
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,880
Speaker 1: I mean it's like 10 bucks or something like that.

213
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:08,409
Speaker 0: The interesting part is that there's a lot of strong feelings on both sides of the issue And I think on the negative side the biggest fears.

214
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,214
Speaker 0: I always see people bringing up or that one.

215
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:21,258
Speaker 0: what if developers start Making games, but then purposefully Removing things that they would have just put in the game Knowing that the game will sell anyway, and then they can sell it as DLC for five more bucks later?

216
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,790
Speaker 1: see that's the thing is like a get a video game right.

217
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:32,140
Speaker 1: you pay 50 bucks for it and some you know and Usually pay 50 bucks for like a retail console or PC game.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,460
Speaker 1: Maybe 60 bucks right and there is no sort of accepted standard for like how much content that should be.

219
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,950
Speaker 1: So it's like you go to see the movies.

220
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:48,818
Speaker 1: you expect at least a 90 minute movie Right and if a movie was like a half hour people wouldn't be paying full price to see it.

221
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:49,240
Speaker 1: right?

222
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,092
Speaker 1: It's sort of like there's an accepted length for these things right?

223
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,080
Speaker 1: so you go to the bookstore right?

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,267
Speaker 1: Smaller books are cheaper than the bigger books.

225
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,734
Speaker 1: hardcover is more expensive than softcover.

226
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:08,992
Speaker 1: You know there's sort of this accepted pricing scale in relation to what you're getting and You know up until you know a while back.

227
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,980
Speaker 1: You know even in the NES days, right?

228
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,069
Speaker 1: You sort of paid the same price for any video game.

229
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,157
Speaker 1: yet some video games gave you more and some gave you less.

230
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:28,744
Speaker 1: so Now basically the companies are taking advantage of this lack of a standard accepted game content size To make lots of money.

231
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:35,106
Speaker 1: right they're making like portable games for the cell phone charge in 10 bucks for which probably should be $1.

232
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:38,848
Speaker 1: Right they're taking Really big games and selling them.

233
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:43,803
Speaker 1: you know cuz you can't charge a lot more than 50 bucks for any game No matter how big.

234
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:53,860
Speaker 0: I think back in the day Zelda to Mario 3 and worst were 70 bucks And that was like a crazy outline like you would go to the store the Toys R Us or the Children's Palace.

235
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,190
Speaker 0: I just stand there staring at it.

236
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,038
Speaker 0: That was more money than you could imagine.

237
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:07,030
Speaker 1: yep So it's like you can't sell any game any game no matter how big or how crazy for more than like 50 60 bucks At least that once.

238
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,840
Speaker 1: right you could do a subscription But you can't charge a one-time fee if it's one of those boutique games.

239
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:21,042
Speaker 0: I mean I remember back in the day when I was playing like the realm and all those old MMOs Someone made a small yeah like fancy flight simulators can be like a hundred bucks You know.

240
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:34,080
Speaker 0: like that there were a few like clothes mugs and clothes like little MMOs Where you paid like what caught a hundred bucks or so and then you still paid a monthly fee, but they were like these Walled garden private like awesome communities.

241
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm talking about it for a normal video game for PC or console.

242
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,937
Speaker 1: You know it's gonna be 50 60 bucks is the most you're gonna get away with.

243
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:49,060
Speaker 1: I definitely When people want to make a game that's bigger than 50 or 60 bucks right because I mean fallout 3 is really big.

244
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:57,096
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of stuff in that game repeats itself You know But it's a really big game, and it's like a long time and a lot of money to make.

245
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,453
Speaker 1: so they want to make more money.

246
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:03,040
Speaker 1: They can't charge more than 50 or 60 bucks at once because no one's gonna pay.

247
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:12,197
Speaker 1: so they've got to sell sort of 50 bucks worth and Then sort of sell you more later in order to get more than the 50 bucks.

248
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,623
Speaker 1: Yep, otherwise They're just.

249
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:14,286
Speaker 1: they're not gonna be.

250
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,614
Speaker 1: they're gonna have to make the game smaller.

251
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:19,652
Speaker 0: of course it also Really depends on what it is that they're selling.

252
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:37,680
Speaker 1: at the same time though some other people Right are gonna make some $20 game and sell it for 50 bucks because 50 bucks is what you can get away with and there's Standard for it, and I really think we sort of need to Have some sort of market pressure that pushes You know the games that you know to lower in price and higher in price based on what you're getting.

253
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,140
Speaker 0: You know it's kind of like the issue they have on the iTunes store where?

254
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:50,048
Speaker 0: Everything is priced at these few like there's few price points and actually this really relates to the stock market Because I just did a whole bunch of training on this.

255
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,435
Speaker 0: we were talking about decimalization.

256
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,460
Speaker 0: now that was when Regulations change and it used to be that you could only trade at certain price points.

257
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:01,345
Speaker 0: So like every say I'm not gonna get to the details But say every eighth of a cent.

258
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,034
Speaker 0: those are like the minimum intervals you could jump.

259
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,880
Speaker 0: a lot of board games have the same thing.

260
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,782
Speaker 0: Like I'm on ray you can bid but the bidding chain like if you want to outbid someone you have to outbid them by a Certain amount.

261
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,232
Speaker 0: you can't say you can't.

262
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,599
Speaker 1: you can't bid like a half dollar.

263
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,569
Speaker 1: It's the one dollar is the least you can bid.

264
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,165
Speaker 0: yes, but when they introduced decimalization They said you could bid down to the penny.

265
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:29,534
Speaker 0: so instead of the price is being forced to fall into these Categories of like for video games the $5 game the $20 game the $50 game the $60 game.

266
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:32,486
Speaker 0: There are $5 games.

267
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,070
Speaker 0: there are $20 games.

268
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,883
Speaker 0: there are $45 games it But it's not like.

269
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,029
Speaker 0: there's regulation forcing video games to be this way.

270
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:52,656
Speaker 0: the market is kind of enforcing it with these semi unrealistic expectations where people expect games to cost $50 and include X or Cost $10 and include why like?

271
00:17:52,817 --> 00:18:09,138
Speaker 0: and that's part I think what's holding back a lot of like Nintendo downloadable content like that or the Xbox Live stuff even is that you could make a really awesome game in there But you can't sell the game for more than a certain amount or people will just not even look at it even though it might Be well worth the money.

272
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:16,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why you see something like Wario shake Which is pretty good, but it came out for 50 bucks on the Wii when it probably could have come out for 30.

273
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,201
Speaker 1: It's like.

274
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:25,536
Speaker 1: you know it didn't cost them 50 bucks because I mean like it cost the same exact price as Twilight Princess Which obviously cost a zillion more dollars to make than Wario shake it.

275
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,028
Speaker 1: yeah, it's the same You know for the same console.

276
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:28,974
Speaker 1: It's like come on.

277
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:29,798
Speaker 1: Give me a break here.

278
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:36,594
Speaker 0: Personally for me when it comes to this sort of thing these expansions It really depends on how much it costs and what it is.

279
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:42,053
Speaker 0: I mean remember wasn't it oblivion That had those the downloadable content that lets you look different.

280
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:42,716
Speaker 1: I don't know.

281
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,880
Speaker 1: I never I don't know anything about it.

282
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,548
Speaker 0: We talked about it.

283
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:58,275
Speaker 0: I think way back They were like yeah for if you pay whatever dollar amount You get these extra set of hats in this single-player game that no one in the world will ever see, but you Great, it's like buying virtual clothes for your virtual doll.

284
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,160
Speaker 0: I Don't think I'm down.

285
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,946
Speaker 1: I mean I can.

286
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:08,539
Speaker 1: actually I can respect a game more if it makes you push like you know grind To get a new hat in a single-player game.

287
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:17,126
Speaker 0: Then if it makes you pay money to get a new hat is I mean at least in a multiplayer game like if I pay five bucks for the Black Baldrick I can show it to other people.

288
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's still sad, but at least it's a little bit better than the single-player game.

289
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,239
Speaker 0: It's less sad.

290
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,633
Speaker 0: There's a long continuum of sadness.

291
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:26,096
Speaker 1: there is.

292
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:29,851
Speaker 1: it's all sad But that's less said but like or say they're like.

293
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:34,974
Speaker 0: one of the things that I don't like is that one of the expansions Gives you it ups the level cap in Fallout.

294
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:35,477
Speaker 0: It's like.

295
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,020
Speaker 0: why?

296
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,140
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it makes the game.

297
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,705
Speaker 1: I mean I I got.

298
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:44,865
Speaker 1: you know I got level 20 shortly before beating the game and stopping playing you know and I didn't try To level up.

299
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,220
Speaker 1: I just sort of got level.

300
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,561
Speaker 0: That was.

301
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,815
Speaker 0: the biggest complain people had about the game was that it was too easy to level up.

302
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,860
Speaker 0: They wanted more grind.

303
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:52,244
Speaker 1: They're stupid.

304
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,374
Speaker 0: seriously that is like the biggest complaint.

305
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:55,720
Speaker 0: I've seen going through forums.

306
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,040
Speaker 1: No, they're stupid, but I mean I didn't have maxed out all the skills.

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,227
Speaker 1: I mean there was still some things that I could Could not do.

308
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,580
Speaker 0: I guess the intent couldn't get any more levels.

309
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:14,130
Speaker 1: So if I decided to you know I could load up my save game from before I actually beat the game and got the ending and I could.

310
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,200
Speaker 1: I got the thing that lets me see every place on the map.

311
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:26,400
Speaker 1: I could go around and go to all the places on the map and do everything if I wanted to and maybe I you know Maybe I would want to do that right, but I could never get more levels.

312
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,879
Speaker 1: So like I've mostly concentrated in guns and such to make you know to make it easier to kill things So I can get through the game without with less stress.

313
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:38,033
Speaker 1: But as a result I was unable to hack like a whole bunch of computers.

314
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:40,380
Speaker 1: like I wasn't able to do anything cool with robots.

315
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:49,559
Speaker 1: They always killed me right, but if I you raise the level cap to 30 Then I would have been able to go back and try to do some of those other things that I couldn't do.

316
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:59,692
Speaker 1: you know I could lock pick some of those 100 lock pick doors and stuff like that and You know the thing is why does that cost money?

317
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:01,759
Speaker 1: all you do is change a number in the game.

318
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,120
Speaker 1: literally I think now I can go to level 30.

319
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:15,410
Speaker 0: I think the original intent of this was that you're supposed to play through the game like an old fallout Multiple times kind of being a different person like I'll be the heckery guy and go through the whole game like a heckery guy Or I'll be the evil badass.

320
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,335
Speaker 0: I'll go through the whole game.

321
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:17,260
Speaker 0: is the evil badass?

322
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,630
Speaker 1: I see the thing is I watched all the game endings.

323
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:25,016
Speaker 1: cuz this you know when you end unlike other fallouts I've heard that you after you beat the game you keep playing and this fallout.

324
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,287
Speaker 1: when you beat the game It's done, and you have to.

325
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:31,630
Speaker 1: if you want to keep playing you have to load a save game from before Depending on what you choose.

326
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:32,436
Speaker 0: that makes sense.

327
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,895
Speaker 1: well Yeah, but so I got.

328
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:36,789
Speaker 1: I beat the game And I got the goody-goody ending.

329
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:43,999
Speaker 1: cuz I was a goody-goody guy, right I was like the best goody-goody you could be and even though I freaking blew everyone's brains out who was bad?

330
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,167
Speaker 0: That makes you good.

331
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,776
Speaker 0: It's pummel empathy exactly?

332
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:54,480
Speaker 1: um well I guess it's bullet empathy, and I went on YouTube to watch the other endings, and they were not significantly different.

333
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,839
Speaker 1: They were definitely not worth playing the entire game again.

334
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,060
Speaker 1: Not we're not even close.

335
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:11,786
Speaker 1: So I would never under any circumstance want to start the game over even though I might You know want to say load up the game before the ending and go Explore some unexplored areas.

336
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:15,718
Speaker 1: cuz really the good part about the game is the exploring and all the other parts of kind of play.

337
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,164
Speaker 0: now the interesting one is Operation anchorage.

338
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,348
Speaker 0: now that did you?

339
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,153
Speaker 0: do you know anything about the Battle of Anchorage?

340
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:22,715
Speaker 1: Yes?

341
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:23,297
Speaker 0: Yeah?

342
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:24,240
Speaker 0: Do you know a lot about it?

343
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,331
Speaker 1: I know what I learned playing the game once.

344
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:32,220
Speaker 0: well what they've added What they're going to add is there's a point where you can go to a VR simulation in the game.

345
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:36,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was actually a part of the game I was impressed with because it was the it sort of felt.

346
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,639
Speaker 1: when I got there I was like wow this is the end of the game.

347
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:42,619
Speaker 1: And it totally wasn't even though in like in other games that would have been the end.

348
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:49,757
Speaker 0: So but what you can do is they want you to be able to play that battle in a tactical like.

349
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:53,500
Speaker 0: it's not because fallout is Not an FPS, and there's very little.

350
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,585
Speaker 1: I sort of wish it was.

351
00:22:55,645 --> 00:23:02,551
Speaker 1: I wish like someone could like hack the game and make it an actual FPS and remove the RPG from the.

352
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,848
Speaker 0: oh my god Don't get me started cuz that would be fucking awesome.

353
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:12,240
Speaker 0: because the thing the problem with the game for me not for everyone I mean everyone has different taste in games, but it's not an FPS.

354
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:16,884
Speaker 0: Fallout 3 requires Zero really skill.

355
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:27,880
Speaker 0: It's just a game of do like you do the right basic options fight things and level up in the right way Manage your ammo right and you won't lose or die unless you do something really stupid.

356
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:36,760
Speaker 1: So yeah unless he goes somewhere where there happens to be extreme danger like a lot of times I'll speed walk somewhere, and they'll be really dangerous guys, and then you can't escape and you die.

357
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,236
Speaker 1: But nothing you could do about that.

358
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:42,060
Speaker 0: yep But as a result the game doesn't require any skill.

359
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,683
Speaker 0: You don't really.

360
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:46,520
Speaker 0: you're not better at the game by the end of it than you were when you started.

361
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:49,752
Speaker 0: But what this is other than having more goodies?

362
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,040
Speaker 0: what this is added is a an actual?

363
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,982
Speaker 0: Tactical game where you make a squad and you pick your team members like snipers heavy weapons guys Whatever.

364
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:05,869
Speaker 0: you give them orders or tactics and you play this kind of strategy tactical Simulate the battle game.

365
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know about strategy or tactile.

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,407
Speaker 1: It's gonna be.

367
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:09,440
Speaker 0: I don't think so either.

368
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,666
Speaker 0: But what's interesting?

369
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:21,127
Speaker 0: that they're basically if this is to be believed fully Adding a real-time first-person strategy fighting game To fallout which is otherwise.

370
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:24,137
Speaker 1: and our thing is it's not yeah, but it's not a strategy.

371
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:27,140
Speaker 0: if it's all RPG Well, I don't think it's all RPG.

372
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,043
Speaker 0: I mean it's kind of.

373
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,150
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna take place in the simulator.

374
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:31,434
Speaker 1: the simulator was.

375
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,701
Speaker 1: it was no different than the outside of The game.

376
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,467
Speaker 0: yes except that it'll.

377
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:39,660
Speaker 0: maybe it'll give you the weapons and things that fit for that fit world.

378
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,366
Speaker 0: So you have the same loadout.

379
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:45,399
Speaker 0: what will make the difference is what points you attack or where you go and teammates you choose?

380
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,819
Speaker 0: Quotes the player will be able to choose from a limited resource pool.

381
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,939
Speaker 0: See that's why types of team members will accompany him on several missions within the simulations.

382
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,100
Speaker 0: Choices include different troop types like snipers every weapons.

383
00:24:56,421 --> 00:25:00,180
Speaker 0: They'll also be able to make tactical decisions on how to deploy these troops in certain situations.

384
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,560
Speaker 1: That sounds to me like a lot of you know games these days.

385
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,226
Speaker 1: They do things that for tip.

386
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:13,549
Speaker 1: for most lay people appear to be strategy and tactics and they'll even you know They'll say oh the game's so strategic.

387
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,073
Speaker 1: normal people will say that but from a Actual game perspective, which few people understand it.

388
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:28,420
Speaker 1: There's actually no strategy Like someone will make a really complex rock-paper-scissors and somebody like all this game so strategic not realizing It's actually just a complex rock-paper-scissors.

389
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:40,220
Speaker 0: well, actually it's funny because about I'm I'm crying about three-quarters of way through an article on Stratego for an upcoming project And which is really just a complex rock-paper-scissors.

390
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:56,024
Speaker 0: No, actually what I'm writing a lot about how when in suboptimal play and this is true across many games in suboptimal play There is emergent behavior and emergent tactical thought and emergent options that don't exist Among skilled players.

391
00:25:56,084 --> 00:26:16,259
Speaker 0: so by playing games that are above your level by playing games where you're a novice or you're not strategically optimal the game is Probably more fun and the end result is that you should play games that are above your mental level Because you'll have more options more tactics more thought and the game will generally be more interesting for you.

392
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:17,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

393
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,077
Speaker 1: If you play a game that you're perfect at there's no thinking about strategies because you already know what there's.

394
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,924
Speaker 0: there's no strategy The other way around.

395
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:29,360
Speaker 0: like Stratego the game is strategic at the high level of play.

396
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,160
Speaker 0: The problem is there's no tactics.

397
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:36,840
Speaker 0: You'd might as well just set up your two boards and then everyone just turn their pieces around and you can figure out who.

398
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,646
Speaker 1: Well playing the game is.

399
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:42,661
Speaker 1: sorry because there's no way to figure out by looking at how you set up the board who was gonna Win.

400
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,394
Speaker 0: you'd have to actually I would argue that mathematically.

401
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,375
Speaker 1: there is mathematically But you don't it's.

402
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:47,781
Speaker 1: you know It's.

403
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,668
Speaker 1: it's not an easy thing to just to do like.

404
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:57,057
Speaker 1: you can't like if I just set up the board and flipped it over Could you just say oh so and so one maybe for some configurations, but not all.

405
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,337
Speaker 1: yes playing It is sort of figuring out who set theirs up better.

406
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:04,708
Speaker 0: Yes, it is But the thing is you're not when you're playing Stratego You're not when you're an optimal player.

407
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,139
Speaker 0: the playing of it is not a game.

408
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:07,420
Speaker 1: now.

409
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,078
Speaker 0: It's not just following the algorithm that will tell you which original starting setup won the game.

410
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:12,660
Speaker 1: That is correct.

411
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:13,583
Speaker 0: That is all it is.

412
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:14,868
Speaker 1: That is correct.

413
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:17,800
Speaker 0: So once I write a program that does that we've solved Stratego.

414
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,668
Speaker 1: Yes, that is also correct.

415
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:27,073
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's a lot sort of like Like NFL football versus college football, you know, it's like in college football.

416
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,060
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of crazy shit going on.

417
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,705
Speaker 1: It's real interesting for spectators.

418
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,009
Speaker 1: It's real interesting for players.

419
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,654
Speaker 1: You have a lot of different options.

420
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,700
Speaker 1: a lot of different plays become feasible.

421
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:50,567
Speaker 1: I actually made the NFL where the players are far superior Right and everyone knows all you can't pull these shenanigans because the other team is too smart Unless they're like, you know the Chiefs or something analogy I make you can't use.

422
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,737
Speaker 1: so your options are far far fewer.

423
00:27:52,898 --> 00:28:00,480
Speaker 0: the analogies I make are one like a child playing chess for you Like you put your queen in a spot that'll get something and you hope the guy doesn't notice.

424
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a strategy that works when two kids are playing chess.

425
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,859
Speaker 0: It doesn't work if you're playing chess against an adult.

426
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,421
Speaker 0: No It's.

427
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:09,049
Speaker 0: or like in Little League the trick plays.

428
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,033
Speaker 1: Yeah in lit, right?

429
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:12,260
Speaker 1: That's a perfect example in Little League baseball, right?

430
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,749
Speaker 1: Well, they're in any baseball right?

431
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,754
Speaker 1: It is perfectly legal.

432
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,100
Speaker 1: Let's say you get a walk, right?

433
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,546
Speaker 1: So someone throws four balls.

434
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:23,169
Speaker 1: you walk to first base and then just start running to second Oh my god, and then just start running to second.

435
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:23,712
Speaker 1: you can do that.

436
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,480
Speaker 1: There's no reason you can't do that, right?

437
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,520
Speaker 1: You just you have a free walk to first base, but you're like you can try to keep going a second.

438
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,987
Speaker 0: They can't balk but at the same time what if you did some sleight of hand and the pitcher's standing there But he don't have the ball?

439
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,879
Speaker 0: the guy at second base has the ball.

440
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

441
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,856
Speaker 1: So that shit doesn't fly in the major leagues notice.

442
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:54,640
Speaker 1: in Major League Baseball Everyone walks to first base slowly and calmly but in Little League baseball They run to first base and a lot of times they'll just keep running a second because the Little League kids it works on them.

443
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:55,883
Speaker 1: so that's it's.

444
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:57,850
Speaker 1: these extra options are available.

445
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:04,993
Speaker 1: when you play an amateur, you know play with amateurs and Professionals are playing and smart people are playing.

446
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,920
Speaker 1: these options are not there.

447
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,810
Speaker 0: However, I feel like wall fallout 3 is not going to do this.

448
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,420
Speaker 0: There is potential for that sort of game.

449
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:21,490
Speaker 0: It's like a meld between the Marines of NS but with a more single-player Commanding from the front lines perspective.

450
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:24,180
Speaker 0: I got a lot of vague ideas about it, but nothing concrete yet.

451
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:29,600
Speaker 1: See, I'm not really interested in like some an expansion pack like that that gives you like this battle to do.

452
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,620
Speaker 0: I would be but I would be more interested in the history of the world.

453
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:52,559
Speaker 1: I would be interested in the other expansion pack maybe that sort of lets you keep playing after the game and adds a whole bunch more quests and hope maybe even adds more land to The map like more just more stuff that that might be worth as long as it's cheap like five ten bucks Depending on how much they give and how much I feel like it.

454
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,366
Speaker 1: You know that and if I can load up my old character and I have to start again stuff like that Maybe I'll be interested.

455
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:05,668
Speaker 0: It looks like it's gonna be 800 Microsoft points or Pounds or nine point six euros.

456
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,635
Speaker 1: It's like 20 bucks.

457
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:09,340
Speaker 1: 18 bucks something like that.

458
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,982
Speaker 0: Well, it depends if that could all change any day.

459
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:12,803
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:13,643
Speaker 1: Yeah what to see.

461
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:22,210
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day.

462
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,105
Speaker 0: This is a machinima.

463
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:34,800
Speaker 0: What I can say about it primarily is that the voice acting is surprisingly good and it beats Expectations by a large margin.

464
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,107
Speaker 0: I mean way back.

465
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:36,710
Speaker 0: we used that old.

466
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,041
Speaker 0: There was that pyro machinima for Team Fortress 2 and it was.

467
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:50,354
Speaker 0: it was really good for the first half but then it really just kind of petered out and I think the the Overwhelming consensus was that that machinima was one of those zero-day businesses And there was.

468
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:51,580
Speaker 0: it was just hey, let's make one.

469
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,565
Speaker 0: Oh my god were the first ones.

470
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,268
Speaker 0: everyone's watching it.

471
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:59,749
Speaker 0: This is pretty funny and every time you think you see where it's going with the jokes it pulls one on you.

472
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:04,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the jokes are obvious, but some of them are pretty clever.

473
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:10,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I really like the the the thing that the blue team has built because they're bored.

474
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is classic and that's what FPS is are all about.

475
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:21,934
Speaker 1: Oh my god That and all the only that's what I'm saying is why they really need to get the the physics the half-life 2 physics stuff going On in the multiplayer.

476
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:22,958
Speaker 1: so shit like that can happen.

477
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:30,256
Speaker 0: as we said if left for dead had half-life 2 physics That might have been a game for all time Maybe as opposed to just a six-month.

478
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:34,170
Speaker 1: mean the only one that really has is the half-life 2 deathmatch for everyone's got gravity guns.

479
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:38,255
Speaker 1: Throwing shit at each other is setting people on fire Exploding barrels, right?

480
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,281
Speaker 1: Why isn't that in left for dead?

481
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,949
Speaker 1: Why isn't that in tf2 or even imagine NS?

482
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, man.

483
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:52,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be okay someday someday Alright, so, you know how people always talk about villains being stupid right?

484
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,706
Speaker 1: Like why doesn't like?

485
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:56,290
Speaker 0: obviously none of them are rezo.

486
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:02,024
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it's true except for rezo Maybe chevron egg dough and maybe no chevron egg though.

487
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:03,510
Speaker 1: Well, I guess yeah, he wasn't stupid.

488
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:05,101
Speaker 0: He was like, well, here it is.

489
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,439
Speaker 0: There's the thing that can be strong Like Koopa, right?

490
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,388
Speaker 1: Why doesn't he just send like all?

491
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,918
Speaker 1: The like spiky beetles all at once.

492
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:15,941
Speaker 1: so why does?

493
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,987
Speaker 1: why does he just make a pit so big?

494
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,030
Speaker 1: Mario can't jump over.

495
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:23,510
Speaker 0: I have the answer to that Because if he made it it's a 2d world, right?

496
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,278
Speaker 1: I just send ten hammer brothers at once.

497
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,845
Speaker 1: Mario can't possibly beat them all.

498
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:27,447
Speaker 0: it's a 2d world.

499
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,650
Speaker 0: If he made a pit bigger than he could anyone could jump across.

500
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,543
Speaker 0: He's basically made a pit in the world that no one can cross.

501
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:38,454
Speaker 0: cutting off that part of the world forever That's fine.

502
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:39,901
Speaker 1: make two big pits.

503
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,610
Speaker 1: no one can cross with Mario in the middle.

504
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,670
Speaker 0: But how does he get food from the 2d farms?

505
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,850
Speaker 0: I mean you got a thing a real world like one thing.

506
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,881
Speaker 1: Mario is on this tiny spit of land.

507
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,830
Speaker 1: on both sides of him are pits.

508
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,034
Speaker 0: He cannot build it.

509
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:55,867
Speaker 1: Mario's there and Luigi's there too if the world even that the world is 2d.

510
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:56,590
Speaker 1: It's still round.

511
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,618
Speaker 0: Did you see the Mario Opera?

512
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:01,630
Speaker 0: Mario and Luigi will fuck you up if you get anywhere near them?

513
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,959
Speaker 1: No, Mario is coming at you, right?

514
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,984
Speaker 1: So you're way ahead of him.

515
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,993
Speaker 1: You build a giant pit He can't cross.

516
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,720
Speaker 1: you run around the world.

517
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,070
Speaker 1: He's still heading towards your giant pit.

518
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,176
Speaker 0: What he sends Luigi in the other direction.

519
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:14,760
Speaker 1: Luigi can't go backwards.

520
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,204
Speaker 1: You can't go backwards.

521
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,908
Speaker 0: Maybe you can no Maybe no.

522
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:23,866
Speaker 0: Anyway, the thing I always hear people say is why don't you just send booze after him?

523
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:27,102
Speaker 0: cuz you can't kill booze Let's get a hammer exactly two booze at once right?

524
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:27,866
Speaker 1: He's trapped in the middle.

525
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:28,530
Speaker 0: the reason for that?

526
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,619
Speaker 0: Bowser can't control booze.

527
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,303
Speaker 0: for crap all that.

528
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,310
Speaker 0: Bowser is afraid of booze.

529
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,746
Speaker 0: That's the reason you only find scary stuff in those mansions.

530
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:35,270
Speaker 1: That's right.

531
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,875
Speaker 0: But anyway, there was that.

532
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:41,250
Speaker 1: remember that flash video that was like all the Koopa underlings were like fuck you Bowser.

533
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,762
Speaker 1: We're doing it our way and they freaking tear Mario a new hole.

534
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,124
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good one.

536
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,776
Speaker 1: So Someone was saying hey, why doesn't dr.

537
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:51,750
Speaker 1: Wily just send all the robot masters at Mega Man all at once, right?

538
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,067
Speaker 0: It makes sense because the doors holding them in can only be opened by jumping into them.

539
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,354
Speaker 1: Well, yes, that's true But you know the.

540
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,643
Speaker 1: why doesn't he send all the robot masters at once?

541
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:03,630
Speaker 1: then how would Mega Man possibly beat them, right?

542
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,172
Speaker 1: It's like sure.

543
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:12,784
Speaker 1: he could try to like shoot the metal blades a whole bunch and bubble man might get axed but It's not gonna do much against you know, some of the other guys.

544
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,210
Speaker 0: Well, apparently we have the answer.

545
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,708
Speaker 1: Well, not only do we have the answer, right?

546
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:26,559
Speaker 1: instead of doing a flash video with some stupid lame joke like that Mario flash video this guy actually Hacked the ROM so that you fight all.

547
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,065
Speaker 1: it's called Megaman - Rockman -.

548
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:39,909
Speaker 1: Netta a Japanese guy did it, of course and It's a ROM hack that lets you as Megaman in Megaman to fight every single robot master for Megaman - all at once.

549
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,337
Speaker 1: They all appear all at once.

550
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:42,442
Speaker 1: you fight them all at once.

551
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:43,949
Speaker 1: you have all the weapons though, right?

552
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,166
Speaker 1: Which is sort of like wrong because they're still alive.

553
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:48,030
Speaker 1: So how do you have their weapons?

554
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,274
Speaker 1: I don't know, but you fight them all at once and The thing about it.

555
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:53,157
Speaker 1: That's pretty funny.

556
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:53,998
Speaker 1: Is that?

557
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,443
Speaker 1: it is actually beatable.

558
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,010
Speaker 1: It's like you think oh you would just die instantly.

559
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,269
Speaker 1: It's like a. you know, fire would come at you quick boomerangs would come at you flash man would jump on you.

560
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,947
Speaker 0: but no what happens is remember it's Megaman.

561
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:13,839
Speaker 0: and Especially if you play the Megaman X games one of the biggest strategies you'll use and a lot of things is you get hit by Something now you're invulnerable for a few seconds.

562
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:17,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you're basically invulnerable for the majority of this fight.

563
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:25,909
Speaker 1: Yeah because it's like you shoot but you like kill bubble man right with your metal blades and then you get hit and Then you're invincible long enough to like dole out a lot of damage.

564
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,761
Speaker 1: They're all in the same spot.

565
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,129
Speaker 1: you can sort of hit them all at once.

566
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:35,071
Speaker 0: so I just have to go through the list of all the different weapons that destroy the people and Spoilers.

567
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,800
Speaker 0: metal man totally gets punked by his own metal blades.

568
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:38,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's true.

569
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,490
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when I figured that out as a kid.

570
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:47,502
Speaker 1: Yeah so in this there's a little video here that shows you someone beating it and Also, you can get the ROM and try it yourself.

571
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:58,269
Speaker 1: Of course, you'll probably just die Pretty quickly if you try but if you're the master and maybe you watch the video closely Maybe you too can beat all the robot masters all at once.

572
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:05,930
Speaker 0: So to continue our discussion of fallout 3 since we both played a quite large bit of it.

573
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,850
Speaker 1: Well, I played the whole fight and played the whole thing, but I beat it.

574
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:11,096
Speaker 1: I got to the ending.

575
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,470
Speaker 1: that did not go everywhere and do everything.

576
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:17,729
Speaker 0: I know the ending but I did not get to it yet because I've been going around doing everything.

577
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:19,228
Speaker 1: Well, what part were you at?

578
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:24,888
Speaker 0: The part I was at at the moment was I had gone and done the whole mr.

579
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:25,490
Speaker 0: Tenpenny thing.

580
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:26,194
Speaker 0: You didn't do that.

581
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:29,190
Speaker 1: Did you but I went up there eventually, but I didn't really do anything up there.

582
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,126
Speaker 1: I just went up and I was like, oh, here's that place for him was talking about.

583
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:32,750
Speaker 1: All right, I'm leaving.

584
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:34,190
Speaker 0: I like that place a lot.

585
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:46,045
Speaker 0: And even though I think I agree with Scott Johnson that these story there is bullshit Even though it teaches you a valuable lesson about not being a nice guy and not being tolerant Let me let me sum up my thoughts in this game, right?

586
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,498
Speaker 1: First of all fallout one and two.

587
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,750
Speaker 1: I've tried to play those and I've never had success.

588
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:59,169
Speaker 1: I tried to play them back in the day and I tried to play them recently and while playing them recently I had a slightly larger measure of success.

589
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:00,837
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

590
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:09,399
Speaker 1: I was just too Frustrated with that crap to deal with it, you know, it's like a lot of people really like those games And they're like, oh, they're classics.

591
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,384
Speaker 1: Oh, they're so great.

592
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:13,056
Speaker 1: They're not you know They don't.

593
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:14,046
Speaker 1: they don't do it for me.

594
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:26,130
Speaker 1: So Fallout 3 the only reason I was sort of giving it a chance was because it was like all FPS in and I sort of felt like actually Exploring the world, you know by walking around.

595
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,190
Speaker 1: That was what was gonna do it for me.

596
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,770
Speaker 0: That was I mean that was the biggest plus for this game.

597
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,270
Speaker 0: That was the reason I thought Scott might enjoy actually was that he played for the original fallout.

598
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,520
Speaker 0: You know, everybody's yelp bugging him.

599
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,968
Speaker 0: So he downloaded it He played it and the first thing I remember him saying was wait, so I can't just walk around the world.

600
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:43,550
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

601
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:47,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I got a click on the town and then you click on another town.

602
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:52,308
Speaker 1: You just sort of quickly teleport from one town to another but sometimes it's random encounters.

603
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:57,710
Speaker 1: in the middle It's like ah, well, I guess it's better, you know, at least in Final Fantasy, right?

604
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:18,930
Speaker 1: There might be random encounters as you walk from here to there but you're having the fun of exploring a map and picking up treasure chests and you sort of seeing things for yourself in this game, it's like But and there's a lot more, you know in the older fallout It was a lot more RPG grinding, you know, cuz he's like click on the rat click on the rat again.

605
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:24,030
Speaker 1: It was like slow Diablo really, you know, and that sort of was annoying.

606
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,401
Speaker 0: Yeah That's one thing that I was a little disappointed.

607
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:33,210
Speaker 0: the FPS thing of this game Mattered a lot less than I mean, I didn't expect it to matter much, but it didn't matter at all.

608
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,910
Speaker 0: It was basically just turn-based combat.

609
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,054
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, that that did annoy me.

610
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:40,903
Speaker 1: cuz like if I'm I felt like I was as FPS.

611
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,210
Speaker 1: he controls like an FPS, right?

612
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:51,310
Speaker 1: But like there's a difference between cone fire and you know, I mean Counter-Strike has cone fire Your bullet is going to be in this area, right?

613
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:57,093
Speaker 1: This game basically aiming at someone's head and clicking on their head It would.

614
00:38:57,213 --> 00:39:02,110
Speaker 1: the game would then do the RPG calculation saying, okay, you're using small arms.

615
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,270
Speaker 1: Your small arm skill is this he's this far away.

616
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:10,310
Speaker 1: So the percent chance of you hitting his head is this let's roll the dice.

617
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:16,030
Speaker 1: You did not hit and then after it did all that the bullet would fly off into the middle of nowhere, right?

618
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:26,590
Speaker 1: There are instances where I was Crouching and aim perfectly at someone's head who wasn't paying attention With a missile and like it would just like fly right past him like way off into the sky.

619
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,019
Speaker 1: He's just like what the fuck.

620
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,610
Speaker 1: my aim doesn't matter for shit.

621
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:31,249
Speaker 0: But I guess I mean for me.

622
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:38,470
Speaker 0: I enjoyed the game a lot because of the exploration at first like when I first walked out of that vault and Start and realize I go in any direction.

623
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,370
Speaker 0: I see that elevated highway going off in the distance and the first thing I thought was hot shit.

624
00:39:43,491 --> 00:39:45,581
Speaker 0: I got to get up there and walk along that thing.

625
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:46,425
Speaker 0: I look to the right.

626
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:47,350
Speaker 0: I see this big tower.

627
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,310
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh man, I'm totally gonna check that out.

628
00:39:50,171 --> 00:40:03,458
Speaker 0: But I guess what disappointed me was it wasn't as bad as games like Oblivion in that there was a lot of stuff to do But the majority the vast majority of anything any feature on the train anywhere out there was 100% non interactive.

629
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,559
Speaker 1: Yeah that you know.

630
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,290
Speaker 0: and I spent an hour exploring.

631
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:18,910
Speaker 0: I didn't explore anything really for the rest of the game except for plot stuff because it was all Like other unless I found a computer that told me something or a person that told me something or an item that did something.

632
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:21,990
Speaker 0: The world itself was just cookie cutter all over the place.

633
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:32,090
Speaker 1: I think that's the one major problem I have with the game other than all the RPG bullshit You know, basically the thing is the game has lots of RPG bullshit, which I hate right?

634
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:39,510
Speaker 1: but the thing is Mostly ignore all that and the explore e part of the game sort of makes up for it.

635
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,089
Speaker 1: Now the thing that bothers me, right?

636
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,050
Speaker 1: I think the one way the game could really improve the most is that you have this big world, right?

637
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,057
Speaker 1: but the world really is Static.

638
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,289
Speaker 1: it doesn't change.

639
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:58,503
Speaker 1: it is as it is and the only way the world can change is if you change it.

640
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:07,445
Speaker 1: and you literally all you do in this game is go to different parts of the world and Decide how and if you are going to change that part of the world.

641
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:14,270
Speaker 1: and sometimes, you know You don't actually know what the result will be of your actions in terms of changing the world.

642
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:18,690
Speaker 1: But you're making a decision, you know change the world for the better or the worse.

643
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,100
Speaker 1: You know, what action are you going to take now?

644
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,376
Speaker 1: and the world is non living.

645
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,534
Speaker 1: it's like Other characters in the world are not making decisions and changing the world in any way Like I can go to.

646
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,970
Speaker 1: it's like a I can go into like a random cave, right?

647
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,610
Speaker 1: It can be full of bad guys, but they're not right in this spot at the moment, right?

648
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:52,943
Speaker 1: I could take all my goodies like a whole pile of bottle caps a thousand bottle caps and put them in an unlocked locker And come back to the game like literally like I can just say wait in game time and like wait weeks and weeks and weeks And travel around the whole game world and come back.

649
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,955
Speaker 1: It'll be in that locker Because there's the game.

650
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,205
Speaker 1: There's no characters exploring things like me.

651
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:59,290
Speaker 1: There's no one doing anything.

652
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:08,750
Speaker 0: well, I have two things to say to that but first I would like to Remind you about a game that came out a long freaking time ago the Blade Runner game for the PC.

653
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,634
Speaker 0: Do you remember that game?

654
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:12,470
Speaker 1: I remember the trailer for it because it's on a CD for another game.

655
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:15,298
Speaker 0: But you don't remember the game because the game schtick.

656
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:20,554
Speaker 0: the big deal about the game was that the plot was Determined.

657
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:24,170
Speaker 0: when you start like the what the truths about the game world?

658
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:29,950
Speaker 0: We're not static and you might or might not be a replicant and other people may or may not be replicants.

659
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:30,552
Speaker 1: I'm in.

660
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:31,878
Speaker 0: so that's the first thing.

661
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:34,690
Speaker 0: so the game theoretically would have near infinite replayability.

662
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:35,626
Speaker 0: but to.

663
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:48,630
Speaker 0: The game was played in real time and while you were walking around and talking to people and doing stuff the other Protagonist or antagonist the other active characters were also doing stuff.

664
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:56,657
Speaker 0: So if you find out that so-and-so is gonna meet so-and-so in the alley at night and you go there They're gonna be there.

665
00:42:57,502 --> 00:43:00,782
Speaker 0: or if you don't go there They're gonna be there and conduct their business.

666
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:01,950
Speaker 0: and now that changes the world.

667
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:12,310
Speaker 1: I mean some of the stuff in the game is time sensitive, but it's like it doesn't matter what day it is Like this day and this night and some stuff is at night and some stuff is a day.

668
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:13,369
Speaker 1: But other than that it no.

669
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:21,277
Speaker 0: But this was more like if you go to the person's house when there's before they go out to meet the guy You'll meet them like outside of the place.

670
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:25,270
Speaker 0: They were at like they go through the game world in real time.

671
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:26,789
Speaker 0: It's tracking what everyone's doing.

672
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:37,310
Speaker 0: So your goals are constantly fluid and it was a really really really ambitious game and a lot of those mechanics I don't think are really possible yet on a real scale.

673
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:37,653
Speaker 0: The game was.

674
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:41,799
Speaker 0: there is a way that game was ass But that was just because of the limitations of the tech.

675
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,385
Speaker 1: there is a way that that's possible.

676
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:44,630
Speaker 1: It's called multiplayer.

677
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:45,474
Speaker 0: No, you know what?

678
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:46,056
Speaker 0: It's called.

679
00:43:46,377 --> 00:43:49,290
Speaker 0: It's called a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

680
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,126
Speaker 0: The problem is what we know an MMO to be.

681
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:52,589
Speaker 0: is not that?

682
00:43:52,629 --> 00:44:07,353
Speaker 0: in fact There was just that article on slashdot talking about like server optimization for MMOs and they made a really really telling point That I think they said something like 95 percent to 90 like the vast majority of Player.

683
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:12,714
Speaker 0: interaction with the game world in World of Warcraft for example is a hundred percent parallel.

684
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:19,640
Speaker 0: very few people are interacting with very few other people at any given time and While the game has a lot of people in it.

685
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:24,039
Speaker 0: There's no actual Massively multiplayer part going on.

686
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,830
Speaker 0: No P. It isn't really massively interactive.

687
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:30,990
Speaker 0: It's just a lot of players playing much smaller games next to each other.

688
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:38,774
Speaker 1: I think something else right that sort of differentiates at least a fallout MMO compared to say a World of Warcraft MMO.

689
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:46,830
Speaker 1: right would be that in Fallout Player the the player right modifies at least the game world, right?

690
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:55,930
Speaker 1: So if you at least had a fallout MMO It would be a little bit better than a Warcraft World of Warcraft because in World of Warcraft the world is static, right?

691
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,458
Speaker 1: We all beat the same boss over and over again, right?

692
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:02,510
Speaker 1: Everyone beats the boss hundreds and hundreds of times and fallout.

693
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,059
Speaker 1: So there's a big monster somewhere in a cave.

694
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,116
Speaker 1: Let's say right someone goes and kills the monster in the cave Someone else shows up.

695
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:13,810
Speaker 1: There's a dead monster in the cave and all the loot is gone.

696
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,251
Speaker 0: It's got.

697
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:18,506
Speaker 0: people have been putting forth that idea since the beginning of MMOs and even since mods.

698
00:45:18,546 --> 00:45:28,709
Speaker 0: the problem is It doesn't scale well and the cost of creating that much content is so prohibitive compared to that's why the content has to be The other players, right?

699
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,100
Speaker 0: Somebody that is the fundamental problem.

700
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:42,128
Speaker 0: if you make an MMO like that remember the rule like 95% of people will consume 4% will interact and 1% will contribute.

701
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:42,510
Speaker 1: man.

702
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:44,936
Speaker 1: If there was an MMO like that I could I would like sign in.

703
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:49,660
Speaker 1: I'd be like I want to be the cave troll today and I'd go and I'd find a bridge And I'd be like, I'm the cave troll.

704
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,550
Speaker 1: I'm gonna harass anyone that comes over this bridge.

705
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:58,118
Speaker 1: So I'm like, I'm sort of just deciding like a role for myself and I could you know That's you know, someone else logs in like today.

706
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:00,207
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be the king like I'm the king today.

707
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:00,970
Speaker 1: They'll be all kingly.

708
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:10,090
Speaker 0: I think one way to do that would be if you had us a large set of NPCs that were NPCs all the time unless a player took charge of them or another way.

709
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:10,531
Speaker 1: That was it.

710
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:25,088
Speaker 0: another way would be if you had a world that was still massively parallelized like World of Warcraft But it was parallelized into discrete game worlds or discrete game areas that themselves were a hundred percent.

711
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:35,510
Speaker 0: either player created emergent content or World, you know were in world changed in the context of the world irrevocably by players content.

712
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:46,501
Speaker 0: So 50 different groups of a hundred people each could all play the same World of Warcraft storyline world through But each one the events are a hundred percent can.

713
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:49,690
Speaker 0: nothing is done except by the drive of players themselves.

714
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:55,790
Speaker 0: But all those things don't make a lot of money compared to a game like wow, so that we're not there yet?

715
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,877
Speaker 1: No, so then I also want to talk about right.

716
00:46:57,897 --> 00:47:01,650
Speaker 1: whenever people talk about Fallout they talk about oh you can do anything, right?

717
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:02,274
Speaker 1: It's so great.

718
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:04,730
Speaker 1: It's like you can just go in there and kill everyone.

719
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,513
Speaker 1: You don't have to.

720
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:07,642
Speaker 1: you know, go like on the railroads.

721
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:09,510
Speaker 1: that compared to say Final Fantasy, right?

722
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:13,630
Speaker 1: And compared to Final Fantasy that is true right Final Fantasy.

723
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,079
Speaker 1: This is the story we deliver you the story.

724
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,327
Speaker 1: you just get through it in Fallout.

725
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:22,799
Speaker 1: You do have Choices, right, but you can't do anything.

726
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,004
Speaker 1: That is that is BS, right?

727
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:32,988
Speaker 1: I mean there the choices are Sometimes interesting sometimes not interesting, but there is always choice, right?

728
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:41,086
Speaker 1: For example There was a mission with like a tree I had to deal with right and I could kill the tree nicely like it wanted me to.

729
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:42,250
Speaker 1: I could kill it painfully.

730
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:46,688
Speaker 1: There was an old lady who wanted me to like rub something on the tree instead of killing it.

731
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:52,829
Speaker 1: There was an old man who wanted me to rub something different on the tree instead of killing it, right?

732
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,372
Speaker 1: it's like.

733
00:47:53,392 --> 00:48:00,466
Speaker 1: I know I had these choices, but There really weren't any Choices that weren't scripted by the game.

734
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:04,390
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, like killing things is always an option.

735
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:16,513
Speaker 1: So the game sort of always has a way of dealing with that because you have weapons but you don't really have any way to interact with the world besides shooting things or dialogue, so Really?

736
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:29,160
Speaker 1: The game is just a scripted like tree of events Not this sort of unscripted freeform thing because all your options are defined by the dialogue choices Or by shooting things.

737
00:48:29,582 --> 00:48:33,117
Speaker 1: is what other way, you know I guess there's hacking and lock picking.

738
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:37,090
Speaker 1: sometimes can like or science can sometimes let you do something differently.

739
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:40,550
Speaker 1: But those are also defined tracks.

740
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,310
Speaker 0: So those really they're no different than you know.

741
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:57,495
Speaker 0: the old quest for glory games where you have the same game world you can play as a fighter a thief a mage or a Paladin and depending on which one you choose and what skills you have There is a. there are four different ways to solve every possible problem in the game And they're also.

742
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:05,929
Speaker 0: each class has a subset of things they can get at or do that are cool That no one else can get at because they don't have the relevant skills or abilities or anything like that.

743
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,917
Speaker 0: So it kind of creates replayability.

744
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:13,790
Speaker 0: but fallout doesn't add anything to that like fallout just reimplements that old game mechanic.

745
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,335
Speaker 0: That's been largely forgotten.

746
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:18,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a do anything you want game.

747
00:49:18,324 --> 00:49:24,190
Speaker 1: It's just a game that makes you feel More free because there are multiple choices.

748
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:29,470
Speaker 1: There are multiple pat different paths to the same end and there are multiple different ends.

749
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,251
Speaker 1: You can choose.

750
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:35,118
Speaker 1: but the thing is most of the choices are sort of inconsequential.

751
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:46,908
Speaker 1: All they do is sort of modify a small area of the game world or change a few statistics or change what items you're gonna get or change something sort of Small and insignificant B?

752
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:48,450
Speaker 0: Well, that was what Yahtzee kept saying.

753
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,634
Speaker 1: There's the end of the game.

754
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:57,010
Speaker 1: only like two or three choices you make actually change the ending and the ending is a small video That you can watch all the different ones on YouTube.

755
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,376
Speaker 1: So who cares which one you get?

756
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,627
Speaker 0: but like Yahtzee was pointing out and I tend to agree.

757
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:08,429
Speaker 0: There's no Permanence or feeling that you're accomplishing anything because almost everything you do in the game Like you said changes a small part of the world.

758
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:12,000
Speaker 0: so like this area either has trees or doesn't or whatever.

759
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:21,430
Speaker 0: or these people these slaves are either free or they're not or The ghouls or the people in Tenpenny's Tower, but you know little things like that and the radio will say like oh, he's the same.

760
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:32,430
Speaker 1: They're really good at doing a lot of Atmospheric things and sort of things that make you go like hey cool It's sort of the same thing you get when you like get superhero comic books, right?

761
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:37,594
Speaker 1: It's like you read a superhero comic book or say spider-man beats up I don't know the lizard.

762
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,742
Speaker 1: right lizard man, right the guy with the lab coat.

763
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:50,178
Speaker 1: and then you're reading say I don't know daredevil right and in the newspaper and daredevil you see like the Picture of the spider-man beating up the lizard.

764
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,190
Speaker 1: and because you read the spider-man comic you're like, oh cool, right?

765
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,947
Speaker 0: This has been going back for a long time.

766
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:58,159
Speaker 0: Scott Paperboy calls it quits exactly.

767
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,690
Speaker 1: It's the same thing in Fallout 3, right?

768
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:05,450
Speaker 1: I said there was this kid early in the game and his parents got killed by nasty fire ants.

769
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:08,101
Speaker 1: So I rescued him and found him a new home.

770
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,981
Speaker 1: and then the radio guy was like Isn't the guy from vault 101?

771
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:12,222
Speaker 1: great.

772
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:13,510
Speaker 1: he found this kid a new home.

773
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,294
Speaker 1: He's the best and it's like hey cool, but it doesn't really change Anything.

774
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:19,382
Speaker 0: like I was saying what I mean.

775
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:20,610
Speaker 1: I can go to the kid.

776
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,430
Speaker 1: It's like now the kid is in his new home instead of being in his old home.

777
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,464
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter really like I was saying as Yahtzee also pointed out.

778
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,888
Speaker 0: There's no sense of permanence.

779
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:32,354
Speaker 0: or change you.

780
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:38,249
Speaker 0: what you get when you defeat these quests really is Some more bottle caps and ammo and maybe a new weapon.

781
00:51:38,734 --> 00:51:40,549
Speaker 0: Yep, and that gets real quick.

782
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:45,830
Speaker 1: There really aren't a lot of different weapons And you don't have enough skill points to be good with all of them.

783
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:49,222
Speaker 1: And it's like if you're not good with the weapon why have it you know?

784
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,290
Speaker 1: and it just more bottle caps.

785
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,214
Speaker 1: It's like all right listen.

786
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,545
Speaker 1: I've got a missile launcher and like 50 missiles.

787
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:55,730
Speaker 1: I've got a minigun.

788
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:59,719
Speaker 1: I've got laser rifles and plasma rifles and gatling lasers.

789
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,483
Speaker 1: really I don't need.

790
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,230
Speaker 1: I can already hose anything down.

791
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,062
Speaker 1: Nothing can stop me anything that I have a mini nukes.

792
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:09,868
Speaker 1: I only used one mini nuke.

793
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:10,310
Speaker 1: the whole game.

794
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,018
Speaker 1: I had like four right.

795
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:13,404
Speaker 1: there was nothing to use them on.

796
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:16,898
Speaker 1: there was actually one cool part Where there's a gigantic gigantic super mutant.

797
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,330
Speaker 1: why didn't they throw something and that was not even near the end of the game?

798
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,810
Speaker 1: They should have thrown something even bigger at me towards the end of the game.

799
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:30,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, instead there's something really big on your side at the end of the game.

800
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:31,130
Speaker 1: Which is way cool.

801
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:34,239
Speaker 1: But I'd rather would have had a bigger opponent.

802
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:41,110
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess it's just that the the story Doesn't grab me that much because the interaction isn't enough.

803
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:49,050
Speaker 0: I mean the story of the Fallout world is great and a lot of the things you do in this game are really cool ideas But they don't grab me enough because I don't have enough interaction.

804
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,137
Speaker 0: We might be asking too much of games like this.

805
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:57,139
Speaker 0: the technology just might not be there yet to make them in a cost-effective manner To where they could actually make money off of a game.

806
00:52:58,164 --> 00:52:58,545
Speaker 0: I don't know.

807
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:07,281
Speaker 1: yeah The game I mean I did play the game the whole way through despite not liking Fallout 1 & 2 and I really liked exploring the world.

808
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:13,670
Speaker 1: even though like the little side quests were like Inconsequential I still sort of enjoyed like exploring them.

809
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,150
Speaker 1: They were almost like little games in and of themselves and some of them were better than others.

810
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:25,553
Speaker 1: You know some of them I cared more about than others, but like if I didn't care about one I could just leave it you know or Like.

811
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:29,590
Speaker 1: I could just sort of you know go and just kill people if I felt like it.

812
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,590
Speaker 1: You know it's sort of a little cathartic FPS thing even though it wasn't FPS thing.

813
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:39,247
Speaker 1: I tried to FPS and not use the stupid auto-aim thing is my pretty much never use those things.

814
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:43,217
Speaker 1: yeah You know I mean some of that.

815
00:53:43,257 --> 00:53:43,659
Speaker 1: they were like.

816
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,841
Speaker 1: you know the game had lots of sort of art in it That was worth enjoying like this.

817
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:54,210
Speaker 1: good music on the radio There's you know really good sort of short stories to experience.

818
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:54,672
Speaker 1: I sort of.

819
00:53:54,973 --> 00:54:03,594
Speaker 1: that's the way I sort of viewed the game, and why it was worth playing despite the mechanics of it not being too exciting or Leveling up.

820
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:05,989
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure book with really good art.

821
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this.

822
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:14,439
Speaker 1: you know good things to look at good stories to be told good things to hear well funny jokes.

823
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,854
Speaker 0: at the time the voice acting was Hit or miss.

824
00:54:17,894 --> 00:54:21,809
Speaker 0: it was really good in some parts and like abominable in others.

825
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,948
Speaker 1: well Yeah, it was but you know it.

826
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:27,302
Speaker 1: I mostly didn't pay attention to voice acting a lot of times.

827
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:28,830
Speaker 1: Just sort of skipped and read the text.

828
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:40,186
Speaker 1: I think the what another area the game should have improved was that sort of You I did sort of I guess things out of order and then things happen that don't make sense.

829
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:53,430
Speaker 1: you know for example There's like a mission go to galaxy news radio to find out what happened to your dad right, so I'm like okay So I can't figure out how to get there right, so I'm trying to get there.

830
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,538
Speaker 1: I can't make it right.

831
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:55,909
Speaker 1: It's really dangerous over there.

832
00:54:56,552 --> 00:55:00,770
Speaker 1: So I've got like three other missions to do and they all say go to Rivet town.

833
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,521
Speaker 1: So I'm like you know what I'm fucking going to Rivet town.

834
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:03,668
Speaker 1: I go there.

835
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:07,301
Speaker 1: Suddenly that whole galaxy news radio thing like disappears.

836
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:09,427
Speaker 1: and now because I went to Rivet town.

837
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:10,330
Speaker 1: I must have jumped ahead.

838
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,522
Speaker 1: I must assume that if I would have gone to galaxy news radio.

839
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:21,930
Speaker 1: They would have told me to go to Rivet town also and There's a scientist lady, and I'm talking to her and all the dialogue options.

840
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,701
Speaker 1: It's like I can sort of figure it out because I'm smart.

841
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:26,990
Speaker 1: right now any human could sort of figure it out.

842
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,916
Speaker 1: You know what they missed like.

843
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:30,601
Speaker 1: oh, I guess I skipped over this.

844
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:36,453
Speaker 1: you know your mind can fill in the blanks because you know What's going on, but it's still Discontiguous.

845
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:39,523
Speaker 1: suddenly I'm talking to this person like I know them.

846
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:43,070
Speaker 1: like I know that I was looking for them even though I've never heard of them before.

847
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:50,450
Speaker 1: Right and even though I can put it together in my mind because I have this you know ability to recognize things.

848
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:57,876
Speaker 1: It's way choppy, and if like you did that in like a movie people would be way confused Like I.

849
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:06,670
Speaker 0: like that time we watched a certain unnamed movie But because of the DVD we skipped the first like 15 minutes of the movie, so it didn't make any sense exactly.

850
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:16,145
Speaker 0: Exactly, I remember watching the first half of the movie at the end going oh Okay, yeah It's exactly like that.

851
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:21,100
Speaker 1: so I mean I guess I feel like the game should have been like is another example.

852
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:26,003
Speaker 1: Right though in the beginning early in the game as a sheriff right as a guy in town Who's bad?

853
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,651
Speaker 1: so you tell the sheriff about the bad guy.

854
00:56:27,953 --> 00:56:29,380
Speaker 1: the sheriff goes take care of the bad guy?

855
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,666
Speaker 1: But then the bad guy shoots the sheriff down, so then you shoot the bad guy down all right Later like I just like okay.

856
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:37,870
Speaker 1: I guess that's over with.

857
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:44,953
Speaker 1: so I leave and I come back like a few days later And like the sheriff's kid is talking to me, but the dialogue.

858
00:56:44,973 --> 00:56:46,880
Speaker 1: He's talking to me as if he knows me.

859
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,568
Speaker 1: I've never met him before.

860
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,840
Speaker 1: I never didn't even know the sheriff had a kid.

861
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:57,571
Speaker 1: I guess I was supposed to meet him earlier and missed him, so it's way It's very startling.

862
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,365
Speaker 1: it takes you way out of it You know and stuff like that happens.

863
00:57:00,405 --> 00:57:00,907
Speaker 1: they need to.

864
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:07,810
Speaker 1: the game should have sort of known that I hadn't met the sheriff's kid yet And thus the dialogue should have been like hey.

865
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,693
Speaker 1: I'm the sheriff's kid.

866
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:10,800
Speaker 1: You didn't meet me before you know?

867
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,345
Speaker 1: Thanks for help.

868
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:17,320
Speaker 1: You know killing the guy who killed my dad instead of you know yeah, now the dad's gone.

869
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:18,223
Speaker 1: How are you doing?

870
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:19,708
Speaker 1: It's like what I don't even know you well.

871
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:24,243
Speaker 0: at the same time are we asking too much of this genre yet, you know if you're?

872
00:57:24,263 --> 00:57:28,014
Speaker 1: if you're you know it, I don't ask you know.

873
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:41,900
Speaker 1: I guess I Ask what for people to achieve what they aimed at and the game was definitely Aiming for that and fell short of what they themselves aimed for but not by that much not by that much.

874
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,940
Speaker 1: But I mean you know it's like I expect people to achieve what they expected themselves to achieve.

875
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,588
Speaker 0: You know maybe this is what they expected.

876
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:51,518
Speaker 0: I mean the game made money as far as I can tell.

877
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:52,662
Speaker 1: yeah Definitely mate.

878
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:52,943
Speaker 1: It was.

879
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:54,067
Speaker 1: it was a good deal for them.

880
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:57,198
Speaker 1: No doubt, but you know I mean it's cuz.

881
00:57:57,238 --> 00:57:57,780
Speaker 1: I mean it's like hard.

882
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,600
Speaker 1: I mean someone makes like you know a Tetris clone.

883
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:04,918
Speaker 1: You're a Tetris clone isn't a flow isn't a freeform MMO world.

884
00:58:04,938 --> 00:58:05,259
Speaker 1: you suck.

885
00:58:05,822 --> 00:58:09,439
Speaker 1: It's like well now that they they set out to make Tetris and they made Tetris.

886
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:13,716
Speaker 1: well They set out to make a game where you know you have this sort of.

887
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:20,620
Speaker 1: you know free Decision-making going on and there were parts that they did not make it all the way, and it was a little choppy.

888
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:22,371
Speaker 1: There you go.

889
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:25,380
Speaker 0: So can we say anything else about fallout?

890
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,865
Speaker 0: I mean we could go through all.

891
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,500
Speaker 0: it was awesome when such-and-such happened, and so it's not necessary.

892
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,138
Speaker 1: There's plenty of those.

893
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:35,251
Speaker 1: There's plenty of parts like that.

894
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:36,779
Speaker 1: You know I don't know.

895
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,025
Speaker 1: All right, I think the game.

896
00:58:39,125 --> 00:59:00,500
Speaker 1: I think the biggest thing is that the that I have left to say is that the game Only has artificial replay value you know and that if you play it again You can like be a hacker instead of a. you know solve your problems with the computers instead of with the guns or solve it With lock picking instead of computers or something like that, but I have no desire to play it again.

897
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:02,930
Speaker 1: That none whatsoever.

898
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,539
Speaker 1: It's it's you know.

899
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,491
Speaker 1: But if it was a true, you know what a fully free thing.

900
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,494
Speaker 1: I'd probably play it forever.

901
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:10,738
Speaker 0: I guess it was just.

902
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:15,260
Speaker 0: it was more Oblivion II than I expected and that's just kind of a big turn.

903
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,931
Speaker 1: I don't know what this you know this oblivion game you keep talking about.

904
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:22,089
