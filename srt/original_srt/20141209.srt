1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,909
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 9th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:11,109
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,120
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,504
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,190
Speaker 0: Tonight, Wizard.

6
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:19,036
Speaker 0: Behold his power.

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,709
Speaker 1: Nah.

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,498
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,039
Speaker 0: AKA the breakout game for Geek Nights at PAX Australia, but we'll get to that.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:43,696
Speaker 0: So, I've been, you know, it's been mostly animation season for me, so I've been watching a lot of cartoons and things lately, and I have been playing a lot of games, but I've mostly just been playing Smash Bros.

11
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:44,820
Speaker 0: and Counter-Strike.

12
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,419
Speaker 1: I've been playing a lot of games.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,460
Speaker 0: And a lot of tabletop.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,320
Speaker 1: I played the South Park game, which I gotta finish that.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I keep forgetting to get that and play it.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,526
Speaker 1: Well, you missed the sale.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's worth paying full price.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get it somehow.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,098
Speaker 1: I got a lot of 3DS action going on.

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,776
Speaker 0: I got a lot of 3DS action going on, a lot of Smash Bros.

21
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:02,219
Speaker 0: going on.

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff, so.

23
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,878
Speaker 0: No, just Smash Bros.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,149
Speaker 1: There's NES Remix.

25
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:08,557
Speaker 1: P-Cross E5.

26
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:10,080
Speaker 0: P-Cross.

27
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:10,758
Speaker 1: P-Cross.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,140
Speaker 0: Those games, my feelings about them are the same way you feel about Myst in terms of, like, how much fun it is as a game.

29
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:21,999
Speaker 1: Myst isn't that bad.

30
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,189
Speaker 0: No, Myst is okay.

31
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:23,959
Speaker 0: You're fine with Myst.

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,020
Speaker 0: I mean, this Myst has- Are you fine with Sudoku and crossword puzzles?

33
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 1: I mean, P-Cross is just better Sudoku.

34
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,332
Speaker 0: So, you're fine with Sudoku.

35
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,280
Speaker 1: You're fine with that- Well, Sudoku's just really bad compared to P-Cross.

36
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:35,899
Speaker 0: How so?

37
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,459
Speaker 1: It's way, way easier and less fun.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,606
Speaker 1: So, how is- But it's basically the same.

39
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,319
Speaker 1: Mathematically, it's the same deal.

40
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,060
Speaker 0: But you have fun playing P-Cross?

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you do P-Cross, like, at the end.

42
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Speaker 1: See, when you finish a crossword puzzle, right?

43
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,438
Speaker 1: Crossword puzzles at least have some trivia and maybe you learn some knowledge, right?

44
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,000
Speaker 1: Knowledge-based.

45
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,460
Speaker 1: Sort of like Scrabble, right?

47
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,580
Speaker 1: Sudoku, it's like, okay, Sudoku's like, you know, brain exercise.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,212
Speaker 1: But when you finish a Sudoku, what do you have?

49
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,079
Speaker 1: A box full of numbers.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,079
Speaker 1: P-Cross is also sort of a math exercise just like Sudoku is.

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,300
Speaker 1: Except when you finish a P-Cross, first of all, P-Cross is better.

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Speaker 1: Especially because you get really big, crazy ones that are way more complicated and harder than any Sudoku.

53
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,340
Speaker 1: But when you finish a P-Cross, there's a picture that is revealed.

54
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,707
Speaker 1: It's like, "Yay, it's Turtle.

55
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,794
Speaker 1: Yay, it's

56
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:25,975
Speaker 1: Mario.".

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Speaker 0: Great, a pixelated monochromatic turtle.

58
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 1: Yay, but if you play it in the DS, it turns into a color turtle.

59
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,440
Speaker 0: But you didn't make that color playing P-Cross.

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Speaker 1: There is actually, the 3DS version doesn't have it, but there are color P-Crosses.

61
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,719
Speaker 0: No, why don't you play those?

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,818
Speaker 1: Because they're not in the 3DS.

63
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but honestly, lately, I've been pretty much playing Counter-Strike.

64
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,400
Speaker 0: And while there is definitely an old man limit to my ability to click heads, I am getting better again.

65
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,839
Speaker 1: You clicked one head.

66
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,896
Speaker 0: I'm doing okay.

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,100
Speaker 0: It's interesting because I'm getting to the point where when I play on puppies, occasionally someone good will join.

68
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:08,480
Speaker 0: But usually now, I'm either the best person on the server, or at least I'm the best person on my team.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Speaker 0: However, Valve, this isn't my news, this is kind of a thing I've noticed.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Speaker 0: Basically, they've done these packs where you can pay money to basically get priority access to different kinds of loot drops and different new maps that are in rotation.

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,018
Speaker 1: Operation Vanguard or some shit?

72
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,960
Speaker 0: Operation fucking bullshit.

73
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:29,000
Speaker 1: Pay money for nothing.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Speaker 1: The same shit they have in Dota.

75
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:33,980
Speaker 1: Buy the Dota Compendium, get a bunch of digital nothing.

76
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:44,180
Speaker 0: I paid for the first one because the way it was framed was that the money was distributed among the people, the fans, who made the crazy awesome new maps.

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:44,900
Speaker 1: Yep, that's true.

78
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,400
Speaker 1: And in Dota 2, when you pay money, it goes into the pot for the world champions.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,580
Speaker 0: And unlike Dota, where it's just skins and stuff, this was actual maps, like really good maps, like CS Thunder quality maps.

80
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:55,420
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

81
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also it lets you- Can you just get those maps by joining a server that's playing those maps?

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,039
Speaker 0: Yes, and basically what happened was- And you don't have to pay for them?

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,280
Speaker 0: Well, what happened was, one, the money just went to those people, which is cool.

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,720
Speaker 0: That's fine.

85
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:07,975
Speaker 0: It's like tipping.

86
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,639
Speaker 1: But two- I'll tip people who make Counter-Strike maps.

87
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:19,480
Speaker 0: For the month or two or whatever that the past thing was active, basically anyone who paid for it had priority access to a whole bunch of servers they spun up and ran that were only running those maps.

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,420
Speaker 1: Official Valve servers?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Speaker 0: Because very few people run their own Counter-Strike servers anymore.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,922
Speaker 1: Really?

91
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:28,220
Speaker 1: Because Valve is running a bunch of them, no one needs to run their own?

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the people who run them now either run default ones that don't do anything special, and most people don't go to a name of a server, like they don't join.

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't use the server browser, they just say, "Play

94
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:38,540
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike.".

95
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:50,400
Speaker 0: But here's what happened now, because of the loot drops and the missions, and it's all just cosmetic bullshit, people are getting really invested in this, and it has ruined the casual mode of Counter-Strike.

96
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,420
Speaker 1: So when you join a casual game of Counter-Strike, people aren't playing Counter-Strike?

97
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,758
Speaker 0: People are literally like, "No,

98
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:54,839
Speaker 0: man.".

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,939
Speaker 1: They're just trying to get loot.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,622
Speaker 0: "No, man.

101
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:57,025
Speaker 0: No, man.

102
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:57,991
Speaker 0: I just need eight more kills.

103
00:04:58,051 --> 00:04:58,816
Speaker 0: I don't give a fuck about the

104
00:04:58,856 --> 00:04:59,138
Speaker 0: bomb.".

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,742
Speaker 1: Yep.

106
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,520
Speaker 1: This is what TF2 did, too, with the hats.

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you know what?

108
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,140
Speaker 0: I can't play Casual mode anymore.

109
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:09,219
Speaker 1: It makes a lot of money for Valve, but it makes the game garbage, because everyone's griefing.

110
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,045
Speaker 0: So I can't play Casual Counter-Strike anymore.

111
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:23,260
Speaker 0: I can play Demolition mode, because at least that mode, because it starts so close to the action, and is so quick, it's not as fucked as the casual mode is.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,520
Speaker 1: Well, gun game is okay.

113
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,122
Speaker 0: But here's my problem.

114
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:41,100
Speaker 0: What I really need is the server- Because the server I ran, the only reason I got rid of the Geeknight server, like, people used it occasionally, and I would use it a lot.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Speaker 0: But it was a pain in the ass to administer, because administering Counter-Strike servers- Maybe that's why there's so few servers out there.

116
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:48,460
Speaker 0: Yes, it's a fucking pain in the ass.

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,107
Speaker 1: If I worked for Valve, that's the one thing.

118
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:53,140
Speaker 1: In Valve, they say you're allowed to work on whatever you want there, right?

119
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,820
Speaker 0: I would work on, yeah, the interface to run a Counter-Strike server.

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,160
Speaker 1: I would work on making it easier to run servers, starting with Counter-Strike, and then moving over to the other one.

121
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,381
Speaker 1: Because

122
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:22,740
Speaker 0: basically what I want is a server that follows most of the game rules of, like, competitive mode servers, but with half as many rounds, so you can go through maps quicker, and switching teams, and the right number of player limits, and cool map rotations, and basically having a server that's cool, and I don't want to actually run it in any capacity.

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:35,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, there's been this history of any game where you run your own server, you then have to get a bunch of community hacks and mods, and they're really hard to install, because there's no official way to do it, and you just put a bunch of files in folders, and hope stuff works, and edit text configuration files-

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,716
Speaker 0: Well, and the documentation is just like, there is no

125
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:38,220
Speaker 1: real documentation.

126
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,559
Speaker 1: And the documentation is garbage, right?

127
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,020
Speaker 1: Anything that the community feels should be put in, like, NS2 even had this.

128
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:48,540
Speaker 1: You had NS2, and then there were all these mods you had to make to your NS2 server.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,836
Speaker 1: They should have just changed the official NS2 server to include every single one of these features that the community was adding.

130
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,520
Speaker 1: that was good, right?

131
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,166
Speaker 1: So that you never had to mod the server.

132
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:07,820
Speaker 1: You just push the buttons and start server, and then there'd be a nice, gooey configuration, that had all the advanced crazy shit that everyone needed to configure the perfect server exactly the way they wanted.

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Speaker 0: Yup.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:08,921
Speaker 1: Right?

135
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:13,460
Speaker 1: And then, if you do that, a lot of people will be able to run servers really easily.

136
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,960
Speaker 0: So, basically what I'm thinking is, I'm not going to run a server, because, guys, I'm an IT professional.

137
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
Speaker 0: Like, I'm a senior, serious IT guy.

138
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,340
Speaker 1: The only thing harder than configuring a game server like this is configuring an email server.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,180
Speaker 0: I was about to say, email is the only, like, good email is the only thing I've ever failed to successfully run.

140
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,319
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone has successfully run good email.

141
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:42,860
Speaker 0: Except maybe Google, Microsoft, yeah, anyway.

142
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:53,936
Speaker 0: So, if any listeners out there run a Counter-Strike server or want to run one just on your own, I'm not saying I'll pay for it, but I might just give you a bunch of money.

143
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:54,680
Speaker 0: I don't care, really.

144
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,120
Speaker 0: Because they're not expensive to get the hosting, but if you'll manage it...

145
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,260
Speaker 1: It is if you want a lot of players and you want it to be fast.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, even then, it's not.

147
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,380
Speaker 0: Scott, by our standards, it's not.

148
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,679
Speaker 1: And public ones are more money, too.

149
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,603
Speaker 0: It's still not.

150
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:16,260
Speaker 0: The amount of money I was paying for that Counter-Strike server, which was, like, a pretty high-performance server, you spend more than that on lunch, like, by Wednesday for a month.

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,304
Speaker 0: It was not a lot of money.

152
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:30,715
Speaker 0: I just don't want to deal with all the bullshit, but if someone has a server and you just want more people on it, I will happily make that also the, "Hey, if you're playing Counter-Strike, that's the semi-official, all Geek Nights fans, go play there,".

153
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,860
Speaker 0: so we have our community thing.

154
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,919
Speaker 1: And then you have that problem where everyone's online and everyone's looking at the empty server, not joining it.

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:44,612
Speaker 0: Yep, but then I will do what I did on the other server, which every time I join, I'll just go to the server and invite a bunch of people, and if no one joins me, then fuck you.

156
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,140
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

157
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the news, there's some Counter-Strike news.

158
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,018
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.

159
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,747
Speaker 0: There's a good forum thread talking about this.

160
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 0: Basically, what happened is at DreamHack, big tournament.

161
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, big-time gaming tournament.

162
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,780
Speaker 1: Has Hearthstone, has everything.

163
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're not talking about the tournament.

164
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,320
Speaker 0: We're talking about the Counter-Strike tournament at the tournament.

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,100
Speaker 0: The best Counter-Strike players in the world, the competitive, awesome, whatever.

166
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,456
Speaker 0: And a team was disqualified for "g".

167
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,671
Speaker 1: Well, they quit.

168
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,117
Speaker 0: Well, they quit.

169
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,937
Speaker 1: They forfeited.

170
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:27,400
Speaker 0: They forfeited/quit, but arguably that might have been to avoid getting an official censure and all that.

171
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,460
Speaker 0: There's a lot of drama around this, and there's even conflicting reports.

172
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,940
Speaker 0: But the gist of it is that there was a team in the final round.

173
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,240
Speaker 1: So they made it to the final round without doing anything shady, so they were really good.

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,599
Speaker 1: They're also reportedly a bunch of assholes.

175
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:42,990
Speaker 0: Which I'm fine with.

176
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,300
Speaker 0: I'm always a fan of the evil team.

177
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,199
Speaker 0: I mean, Mighty Ducks, I'm a fan of the not-Mighty Ducks team.

178
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:49,489
Speaker 1: Yes, you would be.

179
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,679
Speaker 1: Are you a Yankees fan, too?

180
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,560
Speaker 0: I'm more of a Yankees fan than a Mets fan.

181
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:55,840
Speaker 1: You can go dine if you want.

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,662
Speaker 0: I don't care.

183
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:04,220
Speaker 0: I'm actually a Tigers fan, so I either want the Tigers to win or a team near where I live that's not Boston to win.

184
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,860
Speaker 1: I like Boston more than the Yankees.

185
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:15,440
Speaker 0: I think I dislike Boston the most, but that might just be because I have more than once in my life experienced Red Sox fans in person.

186
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least they don't actually say stuff to you and be drunk, unlike, say, Philadelphia fans.

187
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,780
Speaker 0: Well, I've never experienced Philadelphia fans.

188
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:32,556
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to Philly without me and see what it's like?

189
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:33,519
Speaker 1: Go to an Eagles game or two.

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:53,338
Speaker 0: So basically, they, in their spawn, or near their spawn, were able to jump up onto a crate that no one knew you could jump up onto due to what appears to be a transparent pixel or some little edge somewhere on this model that you could just get your character's foot just on it, your little detection box.

191
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,051
Speaker 1: So these guys discovered this.

192
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,120
Speaker 1: No one else knew about it.

193
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,060
Speaker 1: And they must have practiced it in secret.

194
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,253
Speaker 1: And then they didn't whip it out until the final, final round.

195
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,560
Speaker 1: they started using this trick that they discovered.

196
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,920
Speaker 1: The first half was won.

197
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Speaker 1: So the final round, first of all, this only worked because, A, the final round happened to be on this map.

198
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,779
Speaker 1: There wasn't a guarantee of that, I don't think.

199
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:22,800
Speaker 1: Two, they happened to be playing on the side of the map where you could access this thing in the second half of that final round.

200
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:31,180
Speaker 1: If they had to play that side of the map in the first half of the round and they whipped out their secret, the other team would have seen it and would have been able to use it against them.

201
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,416
Speaker 0: So the first half was won 12-3 by LDLC.

202
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:36,280
Speaker 0: That's one of the teams.

203
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,105
Speaker 1: The good team?

204
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,260
Speaker 1: The team that didn't lose?

205
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,460
Speaker 0: The second half, Fnatic, which was down, the evil team, lost the pistol round.

206
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,225
Speaker 1: So clearly, I mean, they were down, right?

207
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:51,300
Speaker 1: They were clearly, you know, by all accounts, they were the second best team there, right?

208
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,539
Speaker 1: Discounting this trick that they used.

209
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:57,957
Speaker 0: So they lost the pistol round, and then they revealed a new trick.

210
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,800
Speaker 0: I'm quoting this article.

211
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,114
Speaker 0: It involves a boost from a counter-terrorist spawn.

212
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,400
Speaker 0: that should be impossible.

213
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,879
Speaker 0: Nothing to stand on, road pixel, blah blah blah blah blah.

214
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,700
Speaker 0: So basically, once you get up there, you can see the entire map, including the terrorist spawn location.

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,571
Speaker 1: Woah.

216
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:24,814
Speaker 0: So, quote, "Fnatic used this spot to enormous effect, turned the score around from losing 12-3 to win the

217
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:24,934
Speaker 0: match.".

218
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:28,523
Speaker 1: Alright.

219
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,499
Speaker 0: Nobody knew what to do about this.

220
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,380
Speaker 1: So apparently in the year before, in 2013, there was a rule, like, in the tournament rules specifically, like no pixel standing or whatever, you know.

221
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,507
Speaker 1: This year, that was not in the rules.

222
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,080
Speaker 1: It was not in the written rules this year.

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,322
Speaker 0: So you know what that'd be like?

224
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:55,120
Speaker 0: What if the rules of football, American football, like, someone messed up and the official published rules left off something about lateral passes.

225
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,064
Speaker 0: And no one noticed.

226
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:01,219
Speaker 0: And then in the Super Bowl, one team that noticed did it.

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,799
Speaker 0: Should they win the Super Bowl?

228
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:03,838
Speaker 1: Yes.

229
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,325
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

230
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:06,912
Speaker 0: They're playing by the rules.

231
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,020
Speaker 0: If no one else read the rules, tough.

232
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,255
Speaker 0: If something awesome and crazy happens, it's sports.

233
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,360
Speaker 0: It's awesome and crazy.

234
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:28,796
Speaker 0: I mean, sports is ideally about the best team winning, but at the same time, I don't care if anyone- The best team is whoever got victory by using everything they could within the rules.

235
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,560
Speaker 1: If the rules are broken, that's the game's fault.

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,201
Speaker 1: Exactly.

237
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:39,420
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of people were saying that this was actually against the rules, but like Scott said, it turns out it technically wasn't.

238
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,251
Speaker 1: Now, I think I agree with Scott- They didn't make a decision on whether to disqualify them or not.

239
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,980
Speaker 1: They just forfeited and let the other team win.

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,938
Speaker 1: Which, I mean, good on them for- I mean, even though they were supposedly the jerks.

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,368
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, within the spirit of Counter-Strike, yeah, that other team was clearly- Wow, this article is great.

242
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,000
Speaker 0: I'm going to quote the article I was reading from.

243
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,899
Speaker 0: "There is no doubt that Fanatics players can be unpleasant

244
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,040
Speaker 0: people.".

245
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

246
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:08,620
Speaker 1: They probably play Heroes of Newerth as their second game of the Counter-Strike.

247
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,139
Speaker 0: That's the full story of this thing, but here's my take on it.

248
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:22,500
Speaker 0: One, there's nothing wrong with what they did, because two, the rules of a video game are the code of that video game.

249
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:34,140
Speaker 1: Yes, unlike any real world game, like a board game or a sport, where you need to have referees or some sort of human watching and administering and enforcing rules that are just known.

250
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:44,000
Speaker 1: A video game and a piece of software, everything that happens in the game is within that software, and so- Well, well, well, see, I already- because here's the thing.

251
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:54,960
Speaker 0: The tournament is a structure built on top of and around the video game that has its own rules, like where people sit, what equipment you're allowed to use.

252
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,039
Speaker 1: Sure, you can do stuff like that, sure.

253
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:11,000
Speaker 1: But at least things that happen within the game can and should be administered and refereed totally by that software, and if the software is flawed in some way, you should fucking fix that shit before the tournament happens.

254
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:17,208
Speaker 0: Basically, in this situation, what you could do is do it like sports ball.

255
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:26,120
Speaker 0: There's referees, and if there's a call that's extremely complicated, they discuss it, figure out how the rules should be interpreted.

256
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:33,256
Speaker 0: Then they immediately explain how they interpreted the rule and how it's all going to go down, and then the game continues.

257
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:35,060
Speaker 0: They address it immediately.

258
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:49,498
Speaker 1: Well, the other problem is that if you look at a mature sport, like football, basketball, hockey, baseball, no matter what happens on that field of play, there is something in the rule book that you could somehow interpret and help you out.

259
00:15:51,921 --> 00:16:06,299
Speaker 1: The real world law, no matter what a human being does, there is some law that we can use to determine whether it's legal or illegal, but the rules for this tournament were so immature that even if you were judging, you could say, "Okay, that's what

260
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:06,700
Speaker 1: happened.".

261
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:11,331
Speaker 1: You might just look through that whole rule book and be like, "I don't

262
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:11,552
Speaker 1: know.".

263
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,539
Speaker 1: There might be nothing that you can interpret.

264
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,002
Speaker 0: Here's an example.

265
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:21,470
Speaker 0: What if the rule said that you're not allowed to use a single pixel glitch?

266
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:23,373
Speaker 0: What if that was two pixels?

267
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,115
Speaker 0: We don't know.

268
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,478
Speaker 0: Who's going to figure that out?

269
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,540
Speaker 0: That rule is bullshit.

270
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:44,039
Speaker 0: Maybe the rule could be something relatively vague but verbose enough to cover obvious unintended glitches to be decided at the moment of the infraction by a panel of referees based on the following guidelines.

271
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,780
Speaker 0: That would have been fine, but they clearly did not have that and didn't have a real way to address this.

272
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,752
Speaker 1: Why didn't they just say, "Hey, look, this map is obviously fucked.

273
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:54,837
Speaker 1: Let's play it again in a different

274
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:55,058
Speaker 1: map.".

275
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:03,760
Speaker 0: There's a million different things they could have done, but e-sports is still baby's first attempt at this.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,460
Speaker 0: They're not learning from sports ball, which probably has the most comprehensive and well-written rules in the history of sports.

277
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,425
Speaker 1: Hockey is the best, really.

278
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:15,089
Speaker 0: If you didn't, you couldn't guess.

279
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,599
Speaker 1: Tennis, the sport of tennis is just so perfect, it doesn't need help.

280
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,839
Speaker 1: But in terms of the officiating technology, hockey, if there's any issue, they fucking call Toronto on the phone.

281
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:37,180
Speaker 1: They're watching every hockey game in this one room, the same team of people, and they will make any kind of hard decision that the ref at the hockey game can't make is made at this one place.

282
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,764
Speaker 0: And look, they make it immediately.

283
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:39,706
Speaker 1: For every game.

284
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,851
Speaker 0: And then they change the rules every year.

285
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:45,279
Speaker 1: You just call them on the fucking phone like, "Hey, Toronto, was that a

286
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:45,540
Speaker 1: goal?".

287
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:46,565
Speaker 1: "Yeah.

288
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:46,988
Speaker 1: All right.

289
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:47,330
Speaker 1: Cool.

290
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,095
Speaker 1: They said it's a goal.

291
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:48,618
Speaker 0: It's a

292
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:48,840
Speaker 0: goal.".

293
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,537
Speaker 0: "Hey, Toronto, they have a goalie who's literally so fat that they shoved him into the goal and he's blocking the entire goal.

294
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:56,359
Speaker 0: What do we do about that?

295
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:56,559
Speaker 0: Is that

296
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:56,700
Speaker 0: okay?".

297
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:57,978
Speaker 0: And then they'll decide.

298
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think part of the problem also is that a lot of the e-sports that happen around the world, there's so many different leagues.

299
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:14,740
Speaker 1: And you look, sports, each individual sport, physical sport, didn't really become mature and big until its leagues unified into a single deal.

300
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:23,840
Speaker 1: The other thing is that every sport in the real world, the people who make the sport and the people who run the league are one and the same.

301
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:24,446
Speaker 0: So thus...

302
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:31,900
Speaker 1: The people who make Valve should be running every... All the Counter-Strike leagues should unify and they should be owned by Valve.

303
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:40,440
Speaker 0: Or in the very least, they should have a base set of guidelines for how tournaments go that Valve administers, but then they get whatever they want.

304
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:45,820
Speaker 1: But if you look, the kings right now of competitive gaming is League of Legends and that is what they're doing.

305
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:53,356
Speaker 1: There are League of Legends tournaments besides the one, but the big ones are all run by Riot Games.

306
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,140
Speaker 1: They run the show, they make the game.

307
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,333
Speaker 1: The biggest, most important tournaments around the world, they run them.

308
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,780
Speaker 1: They got it unified, mostly.

309
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,072
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, you can have the same thing with the NFL, right?

310
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,000
Speaker 1: The biggest, most important football is the NFL.

311
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,970
Speaker 1: There are other footballs, right?

312
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,599
Speaker 1: There are other League of Legendses.

313
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,740
Speaker 1: But the one that matters is made by the same people who run the show.

314
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
Speaker 0: There is, in fact, international football and one year Japan won.

315
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,780
Speaker 1: Well, Japan won, I think, every year until the US started participating.

316
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:20,884
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:21,738
Speaker 0: Because the US wasn't...

318
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,360
Speaker 1: Basically, the team that goes to play in that is all the college football players who didn't make the NFL, like the best of those.

319
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Speaker 0: And they're better the entire rest of the world combined.

320
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,041
Speaker 1: Yes.

321
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,100
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, we're not very good at soccer.

322
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,924
Speaker 0: No, we're not.

323
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:33,670
Speaker 0: But you know what?

324
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:34,800
Speaker 0: We're not the worst at soccer.

325
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:35,404
Speaker 1: No.

326
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,980
Speaker 1: Alright.

327
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:37,999
Speaker 0: So, yeah, you got any news?

328
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,462
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

329
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:43,680
Speaker 1: So Tekken, which is, in my opinion, a not that good fighting game.

330
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:46,960
Speaker 1: But it's been around for a long time and it's really popular.

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,796
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not as bad as Primal Rage or...

332
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,840
Speaker 1: No, it's especially popular in Japan, right?

333
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:58,320
Speaker 1: You know, and Tekken has always been known for not being as good as Soul Calibur.

334
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:04,680
Speaker 1: Besides that, it's been known because it has a lot of crazy characters in it.

335
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 1: It's like a really good arcade game because, you know, you're not really good at fighting games.

336
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,979
Speaker 1: No one you know knows how to play Tekken.

337
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,640
Speaker 1: So even if your friend is really good at fighting games and you're not, you can both go to a Tekken machine to mash buttons.

338
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,299
Speaker 1: And you get to pick the bear.

339
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,400
Speaker 1: And he gets to pick the block of wood or whatever characters are in there, right?

340
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,940
Speaker 1: It's like some, you know, samurai guy.

341
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,880
Speaker 1: So crazy characters.

342
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Speaker 1: So you have a lot of fun just watching how the crazy characters move and interact, even if you can't play fighting games for shit.

343
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,319
Speaker 1: So Tekken 7 is coming soon.

344
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,140
Speaker 1: And there's a new character in it that got revealed called Lucky Chloe.

345
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 1: And she's just sort of like a cute kind of like pink Hatsune Miku hair.

346
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,939
Speaker 1: Well, her hair is blonde.

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,419
Speaker 1: She's wearing cat ears.

348
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,780
Speaker 0: She's wearing an admittedly pretty adorable like weird sort of cat shawl?

349
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,178
Speaker 0: Sort of explain what that thing is.

350
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,575
Speaker 1: It's like paws, right?

351
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,460
Speaker 1: They cover whole arms, but it also goes across the back.

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,839
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know what she looks like?

353
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Speaker 1: It's like a shirt that only covers the back of you and completely covers your arms and has paws at the end of it.

354
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,200
Speaker 0: She looks like a lot of the people I see at anime conventions.

355
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically anime convention girl, right?

356
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,640
Speaker 1: Like roller derby, like knee pads and shoes, but without skates.

357
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:27,539
Speaker 1: And then, you know, obviously kind of cheesecake-ish because it's a Japanese game, right?

358
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,073
Speaker 1: You can't have some covered up woman.

359
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:30,737
Speaker 1: That would be no.

360
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:35,736
Speaker 1: So apparently there are a lot of U.S.

361
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 1: people who are complaining.

362
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,120
Speaker 1: They're like, we don't want no cute girl in this game.

363
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:41,779
Speaker 1: It's like, why not?

364
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,600
Speaker 0: You've got to block up on the seriousness of my bear.

365
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,420
Speaker 1: You've got a block of wood and a bear and whatever other panda and mother nonsense in here.

366
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,650
Speaker 1: You don't want this girl because you're why?

367
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:52,771
Speaker 1: Right.

368
00:21:54,982 --> 00:22:08,520
Speaker 1: And it's like, I'm not sure if they're trying to be if they're being sexist by not wanting the girl or if they're being anti sexist because they don't want a perverted naked girl.

369
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:09,870
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

370
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,120
Speaker 0: I don't get the impression.

371
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,760
Speaker 0: I was just flipping through a lot of comments and a lot of people who were actually like the people are actually mad about this.

372
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:20,320
Speaker 0: They're not mad because that is a bad representation of a woman.

373
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:20,964
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

374
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,340
Speaker 0: They're mad because it's not serious.

375
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:32,040
Speaker 0: And because it's like Japanese moe crap, anime crap getting into my tech, playing a Japanese playing a Japanese fighting game.

376
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:32,864
Speaker 0: Yeah.

377
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,138
Speaker 1: What the fuck do you think this is?

378
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,219
Speaker 0: So, yeah, those people.

379
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:46,340
Speaker 1: So the guy who makes the game or the primary guy who's in charge of the game, Katsuhiro Harada, he said something along the lines of hello, small world.

380
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,718
Speaker 1: I'll make muscular and skinhead character for you.

381
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:49,988
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:51,580
Speaker 1: He tweeted, I'm always serious.

383
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,939
Speaker 1: If you don't need equal, I don't release them.

384
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,753
Speaker 1: If you need equal, I'll release.

385
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,419
Speaker 1: That's all.

386
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,767
Speaker 1: He commented again.

387
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:00,580
Speaker 1: It's your community's choice.

388
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,440
Speaker 1: I'm just hearing the demand and request.

389
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, we are so busy because Tekken 7 development is not finished.

390
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,340
Speaker 1: We are working on arcade version first.

391
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,520
Speaker 1: I think we have planning time for this issue after development.

392
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,201
Speaker 0: You know what?

393
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:18,120
Speaker 0: I wish more people who are in the position to speak officially on matters would answer in the way that he answered that.

394
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:23,380
Speaker 1: I think what's going to be hilarious is, you know, he'll be like, OK, US version of game.

395
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:31,260
Speaker 1: I know put in character, you know, like, OK, oh, you are all importing Japanese version because it's missing character.

396
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:35,579
Speaker 1: Oh, you're paying too much money because Japanese version twenty dollars more.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,825
Speaker 1: Oh, I so sad.

398
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,313
Speaker 1: No, I'm not sad.

399
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,460
Speaker 1: I sell many more copy.

400
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,150
Speaker 1: Thank you.

401
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,480
Speaker 1: We always give American bad version anyway.

402
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,380
Speaker 1: We continue that trend, if that what you want.

403
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:55,840
Speaker 0: So it's interesting because we used to complain like tribes to was ruined because those guys bet for bad reasons, listen to their fans and did the things they requested.

404
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:02,320
Speaker 0: But they I think we always say ignore your fans or pretend to listen to them, but don't do what they ask for.

405
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:06,600
Speaker 0: I like this response of your morons for wanting that.

406
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,684
Speaker 0: And here's why.

407
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,175
Speaker 1: Oh, you want me to make game worse?

408
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:11,080
Speaker 1: OK, I do that.

409
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:13,509
Speaker 1: Oh, what happened?

411
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,380
Speaker 1: I remember last year when we reveal character, you said, you know what?

412
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:25,758
Speaker 0: Now you want to get the first post in this article, I found just a picture of what guy would get guy.

413
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:31,159
Speaker 0: This dumb squabble about a Tekken character makes it clear to me why this character exists in the game.

414
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:43,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I don't get the the the the feeling that the people who play Tekken, right, the Tekken community is among like the high brow fighting game communities.

415
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:44,662
Speaker 1: Right.

416
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,790
Speaker 1: I mean, I bet the people who play Marvel vs.

417
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,858
Speaker 1: Capcom are probably better than the people who play Tekken.

418
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,788
Speaker 0: Where where's my Bushido blade?

419
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like the net runner fighting game.

420
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

421
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,206
Speaker 0: I want that coming back.

422
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,070
Speaker 1: You make it.

423
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:57,994
Speaker 0: Yeah.

424
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:58,819
Speaker 0: I got time for that.

425
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,660
Speaker 0: Right alongside that Twitter idea that we've been throwing around.

426
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,888
Speaker 0: So I don't know if you've seen all those tweets, but the idea is what you've got an RPG where your character, she does nothing more but a list of things you can do.

427
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,580
Speaker 0: You can only ever do any of those things once ever.

428
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:15,669
Speaker 1: So what happens when you run out of things?

429
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,460
Speaker 0: Well, one of the things is die.

430
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,373
Speaker 1: So eventually you just die no matter what.

431
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:21,379
Speaker 1: So.

432
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,873
Speaker 1: But you could only do the things on that list and then the game be over.

433
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 1: So every game be pretty much the same.

434
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:28,589
Speaker 0: You've got like the list, like one hundred things.

435
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,620
Speaker 0: You play like four sessions with these characters.

436
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,253
Speaker 1: That's your four sessions with only one hundred things.

437
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:34,340
Speaker 0: Maybe it depends on.

438
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,179
Speaker 0: I mean, how many how many times you roll the dice and average burning will game.

439
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:38,462
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

440
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:45,760
Speaker 0: And it's a weird vague idea that, yeah, that that's even higher priority in the hopper than remaking Bushido blade.

441
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,419
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

442
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:58,470
Speaker 0: This is relevant to later in the show.

443
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:03,750
Speaker 0: But this is just a video of Daffy Duck as a wizard in a slayers style.

444
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,474
Speaker 0: And it's pretty cool.

445
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:11,610
Speaker 0: And you should learn the lyrics to parts of this song for future reference.

446
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,492
Speaker 1: All right.

447
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,749
Speaker 1: So this is really awesome.

448
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,970
Speaker 1: Shapeways, the people who do all the 3D printing, whatever.

449
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

450
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,651
Speaker 1: Right.

451
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:30,650
Speaker 1: Partnered with this people called nervous system who, I guess, design 3D printed and or clothing fashion stuff.

452
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,294
Speaker 1: They're like a design firm, I guess.

453
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:38,470
Speaker 1: And they designed a dress that you could 3D print at first.

454
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,956
Speaker 1: They were just trying to design a bracelet.

455
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:40,819
Speaker 1: You could 3D print.

456
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,310
Speaker 1: And, you know, there's a lot of problems involved with that.

457
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,511
Speaker 1: Right.

458
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:47,570
Speaker 1: It's like, how do you get something that sort of moves and bends but is printed firmly?

459
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:53,430
Speaker 1: And basically the idea they came up with is, well, you print the thing to be a bunch of pieces that are all linked.

460
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,035
Speaker 1: Right.

461
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:56,843
Speaker 1: So it's small pieces that are linked together.

462
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,330
Speaker 1: So they're all individually.

463
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:00,098
Speaker 1: Every piece is firm plastic.

464
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,349
Speaker 1: But once you take it out, it's like, oh, OK.

465
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,350
Speaker 1: So instead of just, you know, shoot aiming low and making this bracelet, they made a whole dress.

466
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:14,110
Speaker 1: Now, the other problem is the volume of the dress is bigger than the box of the 3D printer.

467
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:16,176
Speaker 1: So they had to.

468
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 1: they took it in the 3D model on the computer.

469
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:24,910
Speaker 1: They crumpled the dress up so that it fit in the area of the 3D printer.

470
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,370
Speaker 1: So it prints crumpled up and then you sort of take it out and uncrumpled it and it becomes, you know, the full size.

471
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:39,610
Speaker 1: And despite being 100 percent solid plastic, it was actually really kind of awesome.

472
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,514
Speaker 1: You just got to see this.

473
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,890
Speaker 0: fully expect to see someone wearing this at PAX South.

474
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,410
Speaker 0: No, I don't think you'll see that someone's going to wear it at a convention and we'll see.

475
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:49,053
Speaker 1: I don't.

476
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,199
Speaker 1: It's not that kind of thing.

477
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,190
Speaker 1: This is like it went to the MoMA or whatever.

478
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:55,228
Speaker 1: It's not the kind of thing that just a normal person can get.

479
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,955
Speaker 0: So there's OK.

480
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:57,722
Speaker 0: So they didn't release.

481
00:27:57,782 --> 00:27:58,730
Speaker 0: I haven't looked at this thing at all.

482
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:05,610
Speaker 0: I've seen similar attempts at things, but they've always been relatively small, like a shawl kind of thing made out of plastic.

483
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,690
Speaker 1: This is like a work of art that one person made.

484
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,218
Speaker 1: I don't it's not something that I don't think.

485
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:11,490
Speaker 1: you went to Shapeways and said, hey, can you print me that dress?

486
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might cost a bit.

487
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,429
Speaker 1: And, you know, I don't know.

488
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:25,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the meta moment, we're going to be appearing at the Penny Arcade Expo South, the inaugural in San Antonio, Texas.

489
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,402
Speaker 0: So on Sunday, January 25th at four thirty p.m.

490
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:31,490
Speaker 0: in the Armadillo Theater.

491
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:33,529
Speaker 1: You mean an armadillo?

492
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,377
Speaker 0: Depends on where you live.

493
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,490
Speaker 1: You are not Mexican.

494
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,907
Speaker 0: We are presenting a new and updated version of Bad Games.

495
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:48,750
Speaker 0: If you've seen us present bad games before, you probably don't need to go to it.

496
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,749
Speaker 0: We're hoping that people who don't know who we are go and see it.

497
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,150
Speaker 1: And hopefully there'll be a lot of those people in the south.

498
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,930
Speaker 0: And otherwise, we're pretty much just going to eat barbecue, play tabletop games and make fun of the south.

499
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:03,689
Speaker 1: And the Tejas.

500
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, Texas.

501
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:06,227
Speaker 1: Let's play.

502
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,130
Speaker 1: Let's play.

503
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,530
Speaker 0: You're giving me shit for Armadillo and you say Tejas.

504
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:12,169
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the titans that live there.

505
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, here's coyotes out in that territory.

506
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,910
Speaker 1: We should bring and play Outlaw in Tejas.

507
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:21,469
Speaker 0: Actually, we should.

508
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:29,070
Speaker 0: Actually, we should set it up on a laptop with two controllers and video people playing it and get their reactions and then run a tournament.

509
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,190
Speaker 1: Outlaw tournament.

510
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had spare time.

511
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,050
Speaker 1: As it's properly known, Pretzel Cowboy.

512
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:38,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I'm going to remake a video game, that's what I'm remaking first.

513
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,048
Speaker 1: Pretzel Cowboy.

514
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:42,390
Speaker 0: Otherwise, the Book Club book is Watership Down.

515
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,528
Speaker 0: I read it a long time ago.

516
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,247
Speaker 0: You should read it.

517
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:44,903
Speaker 0: It's an awesome book.

518
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,889
Speaker 1: Other meta things.

519
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,790
Speaker 1: Come find us on the internet.

520
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,670
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm pretty sure if you found this podcast and you're listening right now, you've already found us on the internet.

521
00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:04,750
Speaker 0: But at the same time, many people who follow us on YouTube did not realize somehow that we obviously think Gamergate is stupid like anyone who's smart.

522
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:10,730
Speaker 0: And they were shocked when they realized through YouTube that that was our opinion.

523
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,170
Speaker 0: Because they only followed us on YouTube and it literally never interacted with us in any other way.

524
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,910
Speaker 0: So you should interact with us in multiple ways.

525
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,870
Speaker 0: That way you can find out what important thing we think that you will be offended by and leave.

526
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:29,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should also internet more because internetting is what cool people like us do.

527
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,590
Speaker 1: If you internet enough, you won't need to listen to this show.

528
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:45,430
Speaker 0: I've also uploaded a whole bunch of video from PAX Australia, which was one of the rare times outside of Kineticons and weird conventions where one of us gave a lecture without the other one.

529
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,007
Speaker 0: It was just me.

530
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,390
Speaker 0: Because Scott didn't want to fly to Australia again.

531
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:52,390
Speaker 1: We also recorded another episode of Geek Nights presents you tennis.

532
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

533
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,208
Speaker 1: Upload that.

534
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:00,710
Speaker 0: I gotta edit it together and do stuff to it to hide the fact that because it's in 4K, you can literally see my pores.

535
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,149
Speaker 1: Alright, well, do that.

536
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:04,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll be up soon.

537
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,667
Speaker 0: As soon as I get a chance to put it up.

538
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,470
Speaker 0: And the last meta thing, just because people asked me a lot about this last year.

539
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,730
Speaker 0: I'm going to go skiing at Hunter Mountain on Saturday.

540
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,069
Speaker 0: If you want to go meet me and hang out and go skiing, let me know.

541
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:17,509
Speaker 0: I'm going to be there all day.

542
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:23,409
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm doing anything this weekend, but if anyone wants to play Netrunner in New York, I mean, I probably already played Netrunner with you.

543
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,759
Speaker 0: So, Wizard.

544
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,171
Speaker 0: The Wizard.

545
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:36,480
Speaker 0: Scott and I met two awesome, smart people at the previous PAX Australia.

546
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,720
Speaker 1: The first PAX Australia.

547
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,964
Speaker 0: Yes, we went to it.

548
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,679
Speaker 0: We were walking around and we were like, "We gotta find some smart people to play a game

549
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:42,859
Speaker 0: with.".

550
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,378
Speaker 0: We saw two people and they were looking for a game and we were like, "Hey, you want to play a

551
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:46,599
Speaker 0: game?".

552
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,560
Speaker 0: And one thing led to another.

553
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,399
Speaker 1: We played Hanavi.

554
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,120
Speaker 0: We played Hanavi, which is Smart Person Detector Alpha.

555
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:53,739
Speaker 1: Yep.

556
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,160
Speaker 0: And they were smart.

557
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,559
Speaker 1: Yep, the Smart Person Detector went bing, bing, bing.

558
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,174
Speaker 0: Yep.

559
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,920
Speaker 1: It's almost like a dowsing rod, but it works.

560
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:07,140
Speaker 0: So, I have to give props to them because Jess and Bain, these two people who were smart and we hung out with them, I hung out with them again at the next PAX OZ.

561
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,040
Speaker 0: Because, like we do, we form PAX-specific posses in every region of the world where there's a PAX.

562
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,139
Speaker 0: And they brought out a game and, as is the Rim and Scott style, I did what we always do.

563
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,798
Speaker 0: Really, I've never heard of this game and you want me to play it?

564
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,059
Speaker 0: Watch how enthused I am.

565
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,800
Speaker 0: Watch me try to avoid learning this game because I actually just want to play this game that I brought.

566
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:33,200
Speaker 0: And I played Wizard, and it was great.

567
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,230
Speaker 1: Wizard.

568
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:37,040
Speaker 1: So, Wizard is actually a mad old game.

569
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Speaker 1: It's published in 1984.

570
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,899
Speaker 1: It is two years younger than us.

571
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:42,639
Speaker 0: Yep.

572
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:53,240
Speaker 1: It received a nomination for the 2011 Netherlands Spelenpriz, which I guess is the Netherlands Game Prize.

573
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,079
Speaker 0: Nederlander das Spiel des Jahrs.

574
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,082
Speaker 1: Right, basically, in 2011.

575
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,320
Speaker 1: So, it took that long for the game to be recognized.

576
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,440
Speaker 0: It wasn't even published commercially until like 1986.

577
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,596
Speaker 1: Right.

578
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:07,100
Speaker 1: And then we only discovered it in 2014.

579
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,820
Speaker 1: So, this game is like a game that I guess has just been sitting in the dark and suddenly popped out of nowhere.

580
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:15,739
Speaker 1: It's designed by a guy named Ken Fisher.

581
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:16,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

582
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,979
Speaker 1: Who I never heard of, but I'm going to look him up.

583
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,600
Speaker 1: Alright, in his board game geek picture, he has a hood on that has a gold lining.

584
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:28,459
Speaker 1: I think Wizard is the only thing that he makes.

585
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,852
Speaker 1: It's WizardCards.com.

586
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,179
Speaker 1: Well, you know what, guy?

587
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,820
Speaker 1: It's an official website.

588
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaker 0: If you've only ever made one game, you're batting a thousand.

589
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:36,637
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

590
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:41,260
Speaker 1: He's made Isaac Asimov's super quiz one, two, and three.

591
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,379
Speaker 0: Okay, I think your batting average is dropping.

592
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:45,760
Speaker 1: Or maybe this is just part of his wish.

593
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:46,255
Speaker 1: I don't know.

594
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:47,778
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

595
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,559
Speaker 1: Wizard's the only thing we care about.

596
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Speaker 1: Sorry, Ken Fisher.

597
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,520
Speaker 0: Wizard is interesting.

598
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,119
Speaker 1: He actually has the username Wizard on BoardGameGeek.

599
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,629
Speaker 1: Wow.

600
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,273
Speaker 1: Yeah.

601
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,340
Speaker 0: So, remember our review of Pendante.

602
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,840
Speaker 0: Pendante is like if poker were designed today to be fun, it's Pendante.

603
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,480
Speaker 1: It's like they take poker and you soup it up with some Euro game skills and some modern design.

604
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,659
Speaker 0: And write rules to it like it's a modern game and all that.

605
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,799
Speaker 1: And put some theme on there.

606
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,112
Speaker 0: Yeah.

607
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,715
Speaker 0: And you know what?

608
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:24,699
Speaker 0: Pendante gives you 90 percent of the fun of actual poker without any of the tedium of actual poker.

609
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,438
Speaker 1: So, Wizard is, well, Pendante is to poker as Wizard is to wist.

610
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,018
Speaker 1: Yes.

611
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Speaker 1: Slash heart, slash huker, slash every trick-taking.

612
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,739
Speaker 0: Trick-taking games.

613
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,239
Speaker 0: Wizard is just a Trump food suit following trick-taking game.

614
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,139
Speaker 1: Now, most people who are in the board game nerd community who are looking to play a trick-taking game go straight to teach you.

615
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,297
Speaker 1: I have teach you.

616
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,456
Speaker 1: I play teach you.

617
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,998
Speaker 1: Teach you is not good.

618
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Speaker 0: Teach you is not.

619
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,549
Speaker 1: I would rather play hearts than play.

620
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:58,079
Speaker 1: teach you, but I would rather play Wizard than any other trick-taking game I've ever seen.

621
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,099
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

622
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,498
Speaker 1: And Bridge is for old people.

623
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:07,940
Speaker 0: So, I grew up in the Midwest where everyone plays trick-taking games.

624
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,140
Speaker 0: Everyone.

625
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,140
Speaker 0: Everyone knows those kinds of games.

626
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,000
Speaker 0: You grow up playing Euchre and Wist and Hearts and P-Nuckle and all these kinds of games.

627
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:16,460
Speaker 0: I hate Bridge.

628
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Speaker 0: I hate P-Nuckle.

629
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:23,280
Speaker 0: I like Euchre, but if you play Euchre enough, it's a solved game that comes down to cheating.

630
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:26,320
Speaker 0: Hearts is a fantastic game.

631
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,019
Speaker 1: Hearts is the best.

632
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,340
Speaker 0: I fucking love Hearts.

633
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,059
Speaker 0: I will play Hearts almost any time.

634
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:30,760
Speaker 1: Hearts is great.

635
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:31,438
Speaker 0: Yes.

636
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:40,420
Speaker 0: But, much like how when we taught Pen Dante, especially when I tried to teach Pen Dante to a bunch of our friends, I learned that a lot of our friends had never played poker.

637
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:43,559
Speaker 0: They didn't know what a flush was.

638
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,079
Speaker 1: They knew what a flush was.

639
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,060
Speaker 0: They were extra surprised by a flush.

640
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,593
Speaker 1: Yup.

641
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,080
Speaker 0: And, this was the same deal.

642
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,080
Speaker 0: It was interesting to read the rules to trick-taking because I had never in my life thought about the rules to trick-taking.

643
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I had to teach him this game, I would say, "Look, all you have to do in this game is...".

644
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:03,200
Speaker 0: Trick-taking.

645
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,119
Speaker 1: It's trick-taking game.

646
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 1: Trump is the top card that gets revealed from the deck after we deal the cards.

647
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:08,540
Speaker 0: You know what?

648
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:09,918
Speaker 0: What I'll do right now for you guys?

649
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,900
Speaker 0: I'm going to teach you the entire game the way I would teach it to Scott.

650
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:14,580
Speaker 1: All right.

651
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:15,840
Speaker 1: But, I already know how to play.

652
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,320
Speaker 1: Exactly.

653
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,219
Speaker 0: This is for the listener.

654
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:26,179
Speaker 0: So, this is basically just a trick-taking game, but the way you're going to do it is you bid how many tricks you're going to take, and then you play a hand of one.

655
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:29,799
Speaker 0: Then, you bid how many tricks you're going to take, and you play a hand of two.

656
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:31,259
Speaker 0: Then, a hand of three.

657
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,919
Speaker 1: So, obviously, in the hand of one, I would only bid one or zero because it would be impossible for me to take two tricks.

658
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,376
Speaker 0: Yup.

659
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,480
Speaker 1: Am I allowed to bid two even though there's only one trick to take?

660
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:50,096
Speaker 0: Well, yes, but that's going to fuck you because the scoring is you get one point for every trick you take if you bid the correct number, and then you get two points because you bid correctly.

661
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:52,140
Speaker 0: So, if I bid one, I get one.

662
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,998
Speaker 0: I get three points.

663
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:03,758
Speaker 1: So, you want to take more tricks and bid correctly, but if bidding correctly is more important because if you're even one off from the correct bid, you lose a point for every one you're off by.

664
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,460
Speaker 0: So, if I bid eight and I take nine or seven, I lose a point.

665
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,079
Speaker 1: But if I bid one and take one and you bid five and take five, you're doing way better than me.

666
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:12,598
Speaker 0: Exactly.

667
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,200
Speaker 0: That way, you can't just be like zero, zero, always taking zero, ducking under.

668
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:21,679
Speaker 1: Even if you always take zero, you're going to play a trump card at some point because you're going to have it in your hand and you're going to take one.

669
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:22,580
Speaker 1: Maybe, maybe not.

670
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,420
Speaker 1: And then you're going to be off.

671
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, because someone else will play the fucking A's and you just duck your trump under.

672
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,598
Speaker 0: That is fine.

673
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,759
Speaker 0: So, that's the game with one trick to it.

674
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:33,219
Speaker 1: All three tricks.

675
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,758
Speaker 0: Three tricks?

676
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:35,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

677
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:38,580
Speaker 0: I was just going to say there are super trump weird cards.

678
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,500
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

679
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:39,817
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,720
Speaker 0: There's only four of each type.

681
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,517
Speaker 0: There are jesters and there are wizards.

682
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:48,900
Speaker 1: I didn't, I don't know any jesters.

683
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,760
Speaker 0: So, the problem is the game is in German, at least the copy of it that we got.

684
00:37:54,581 --> 00:38:01,160
Speaker 0: So, it's Zauberers and Nars, Zs and Ns because that's not in any way visually confusing.

685
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a Z is just a sideways N.

686
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:04,298
Speaker 0: Yes.

687
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,740
Speaker 0: Well, I mean six and nine upside down.

688
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:08,260
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

689
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,500
Speaker 1: That's why you draw a line on one side of it so you know.

690
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Speaker 0: A wizard is, it is trump and it is infinity.

691
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,979
Speaker 0: So, it always wins the trick.

692
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,619
Speaker 1: What if two people play wizards at the same hand?

693
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:26,460
Speaker 0: If multiple wizards are played, whichever wizard was placed first wins the trick.

694
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,120
Speaker 1: So, if I get the first play because I took the last trick and I play a wizard, I get the next trick and everyone else can dump a card?

695
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:33,460
Speaker 1: Yes.

696
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,940
Speaker 0: So, if you lead a wizard.

697
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,100
Speaker 1: And clear out a suit or whatever?

698
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,200
Speaker 0: There is no suit for that hand.

699
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,480
Speaker 1: So, wouldn't I want to play my wizards later in the round?

700
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,340
Speaker 1: Because I mean I'm going to take a trick with a wizard anyway.

701
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 1: Possibly.

702
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,380
Speaker 1: So, if I play it later in the round, I'm basically preventing people from dumping suit early.

703
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,200
Speaker 0: But you don't want to be in a situation where you don't have the lead anymore and then the last three people all lead wizard and then your fourth wizard is just fucked.

704
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:53,763
Speaker 1: Ah.

705
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,699
Speaker 0: That could happen.

706
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,820
Speaker 0: Or you might accidentally take a trick in the mid and now you don't want to take a trick with that wizard.

707
00:38:59,680 --> 00:38:59,723
Speaker 0: Ah.

708
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,320
Speaker 0: And then the jesters.

709
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:04,720
Speaker 0: They are negative infinity and are not Trump.

710
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:06,418
Speaker 0: They have no suits.

711
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,197
Speaker 1: So, obviously, even if two people play gnar, one of the other players is going to take the trick.

712
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,020
Speaker 1: But what if all players play gnar?

713
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
Speaker 0: Whoever led that gnar gets fucked.

714
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,239
Speaker 0: Oh no.

715
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,420
Speaker 0: I've never seen it happen.

716
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,558
Speaker 1: I doubt that would ever happen.

717
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Speaker 0: The day it happens, I'm going to yell and scream because it's just going to be so beautiful.

718
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,016
Speaker 1: Well, so it says here on board game you can play with three to six players but there's only four gnars.

719
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,780
Speaker 1: So, it can only happen with three or four players.

720
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,540
Speaker 1: It can only happen with four or fewer players.

721
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,720
Speaker 0: I think the game is best with four players, like all trick taking games are.

722
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,914
Speaker 1: If you play with five or six, I mean, obviously, the all wizard or all gnar situation can't happen.

723
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:45,940
Speaker 0: So, if a gnar is led, then the next player to play sets the suit for the trick.

724
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:46,385
Speaker 1: Ah.

725
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:47,115
Speaker 1: Okay.

726
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:51,460
Speaker 0: So, that's pretty much the whole game.

727
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:00,940
Speaker 0: Now, if you don't know, if that doesn't mean anything to you, the way trick taking games work, fundamentally, one, you should go back and listen to our episode on hearts.

728
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,920
Speaker 1: Everyone who is in the game has a hand of cards.

729
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,360
Speaker 0: Yes.

730
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,660
Speaker 1: Someone goes first.

731
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,200
Speaker 1: That person plays a card.

732
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,059
Speaker 1: Any of the cards.

733
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
Speaker 1: Cards have a suit and a value.

734
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,720
Speaker 0: So, whatever suit was played is now the suit for that hand, that trick.

735
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,940
Speaker 1: So, the next person now has to play one card from their hand.

736
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,080
Speaker 1: If they have a card matching the suit of the already played card, they must follow suit.

737
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,940
Speaker 1: That's why you ever heard the phrase follow suit?

738
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:25,079
Speaker 1: That's what that means.

739
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:32,340
Speaker 1: So, if Rym goes first and he plays a spade, and I have a spade in my hand, I must play a spade.

740
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,679
Speaker 1: I may not play one of the other cards in my hand and people, if I cheat, people can figure it out easily and ruin me.

741
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Speaker 1: Pointing out, so, I have to play a spade.

742
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,540
Speaker 1: If I don't have a spade, I may play any of the other cards in my hand.

743
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:46,079
Speaker 0: Exactly.

744
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,020
Speaker 0: So, one suit will be determined by some fashion.

745
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,340
Speaker 0: In some games, players can kind of decide through a process.

746
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,960
Speaker 0: In this game and in many games, it's just random.

747
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,159
Speaker 0: And not all trick-taking games have this.

748
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,640
Speaker 0: But one suit will be determined to be Trump.

749
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:05,540
Speaker 0: That suit will trump any other suits.

750
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:13,920
Speaker 0: So, if I played the ten and Scott played the four and someone else played the two of the suit that was the trick, then I would get it.

751
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,678
Speaker 0: I have the highest number.

752
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:21,980
Speaker 1: And if someone else plays a card from some other suit because they didn't have the appropriate suit in hand, they don't get to take the trick.

753
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 1: Because it's only, you have to follow suit for your card to count as taking the trick.

754
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,220
Speaker 0: But a two of Trump beats the highest number of non-Trump.

755
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,597
Speaker 1: Right.

756
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,660
Speaker 1: So, it's like if I want to take tricks, a lot of them, I want to have a lot of Trump cards in my hand and dump a suit.

757
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,559
Speaker 1: So, let's say I get rid of all the spades in my hand.

758
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:40,220
Speaker 1: But I have a bunch of Trump cards.

759
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:40,838
Speaker 1: Hearts are Trump.

760
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,880
Speaker 1: Then other people still have a ton of spades.

761
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:44,878
Speaker 1: And they play them.

762
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:48,360
Speaker 1: And on my turn, I don't have to play a spade because I don't have one.

763
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,140
Speaker 1: So, I play my heart cards that are Trump.

764
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:51,719
Speaker 1: And I get to take those tricks.

765
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:53,760
Speaker 1: Regardless of the value of my heart cards.

766
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,060
Speaker 1: Unless someone else.

767
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,079
Speaker 1: As long as someone else also ran out of spades and plays heart cards that are higher value than mine.

768
00:41:59,611 --> 00:41:59,800
Speaker 1: Right.

769
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:01,500
Speaker 1: So, because the hearts are the Trump.

770
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,440
Speaker 1: If someone just starts the hand with the hearts, well.

771
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:05,640
Speaker 0: That's awesome sometimes.

772
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,060
Speaker 1: But you have to follow suit.

773
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,060
Speaker 1: You have to follow suit.

774
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,979
Speaker 0: So, in like a state, like in hearts.

775
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,320
Speaker 0: Well, the hearts is an example.

776
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,172
Speaker 0: So, in Euchre, if I play, Euchre's not a good example because then I have to explain fucking, whatever.

777
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,620
Speaker 0: So, in Wist, if I play the ace of Trump.

778
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:22,738
Speaker 0: And I lead that.

779
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,400
Speaker 0: And Scott only has a king of the Trump suit.

780
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,840
Speaker 0: He's got to just throw it down and lose it.

781
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:29,700
Speaker 1: And he doesn't do anything.

782
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,880
Speaker 1: Even though that is an extremely powerful card.

783
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:32,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

784
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:34,159
Speaker 1: I was forced to play it and lose it.

785
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,559
Speaker 0: So, the final rub in Wizard is that you may play a Gnar or a Zauber-er.

786
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,780
Speaker 0: Regardless of following suit at any time.

787
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,019
Speaker 0: You can always play one.

788
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,700
Speaker 1: So, even if I can follow suit, I can Wizard or Gnar instead.

789
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:53,780
Speaker 1: So, if I was in a situation like Rym just said where I have a really powerful card.

790
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,237
Speaker 1: But I'm going to be forced to lose it.

791
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 1: I can just Gnar or Wizard instead and keep that powerful card in my hand.

792
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,260
Speaker 1: And then play it later and get the value from it.

793
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,000
Speaker 0: So, the game is great.

794
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:14,853
Speaker 0: You can play it with a normal deck of cards as long as you have eight cards beyond the deck of cards that can be labeled Zauber-er and Gnar.

795
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,180
Speaker 1: So, usually if you buy a deck of playing cards at the drug store, it's going to have two learn to play cards and two jokers.

796
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:31,580
Speaker 1: You might need to get two decks of cards at the same back and take the aces and doodle on them and write Zauber-er and then take some deuces and write Gnar on them or something.

797
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,459
Speaker 0: Do something like that.

798
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,179
Speaker 0: Or you can just buy.

799
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,780
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people that make pre-made decks.

800
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,958
Speaker 0: The one we bought has the- The official one?

801
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:41,280
Speaker 0: Has the best worst art ever.

802
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the artist is Franz Vowinkel and the art is simultaneously good and bad.

803
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,440
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not the worst art I've seen.

804
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,500
Speaker 1: It's not Sentinels of the Multiverse, which looks like a child drew it.

805
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,260
Speaker 1: Sorry, whoever did that, but yeah, it's bad.

806
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,460
Speaker 0: The art's special and if you play with this deck, your players will comment on the art.

807
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's noteworthy, which I think is actually a positive, right?

808
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,380
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter for the game, you know, a lot.

809
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:09,195
Speaker 1: This is the way it does for a collectible or living game.

810
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,420
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I just realized what it says on the back.

811
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,780
Speaker 0: Game contents, 60 character cards, one score pad of truth, one set of instructions.

812
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:21,460
Speaker 0: I love how it's not even branded as a card game.

813
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,280
Speaker 0: It's the character cards.

814
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:28,740
Speaker 0: It has this whole story and the story in the game is amazingly succinct.

815
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:30,720
Speaker 1: What's the story?

816
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 0: The story is we unearthed Stonehenge and found the game that Wizards used to play back when Wizards existed.

817
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,357
Speaker 1: Nice.

818
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,176
Speaker 0: Here are the rules.

819
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,011
Speaker 1: Dude, that sounds true to me.

820
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:43,338
Speaker 1: I believe it.

821
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:50,939
Speaker 0: So, if you have never played a trick-taking game ever, get this game and play it.

822
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:06,779
Speaker 1: It says on Board Game Geek that Wizard originated from Oh Hell or also known as Up and Down the River, which are played with a standard deck of 52 cards with a proprietary 60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus four wizards and four jesters in the first hand, one card and so on and so on.

823
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:16,399
Speaker 1: So apparently there was another trick-taking game called Oh Hell, also known as Up and Down the River, which was the game that came before Wizard but did not have the wizards and Nars in it.

824
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,060
Speaker 0: Yep.

825
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:21,740
Speaker 0: But then you're getting close to Wist or Gops or all those other kinds of games.

826
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:28,180
Speaker 0: But seriously, if you've never played a trick-taking game, get Wizard somehow.

827
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:36,680
Speaker 0: And this is the best way to learn trick-taking games, to learn to get good at them, and then it'll be really easy to play Hearts and Euchre and all these other kinds of games.

828
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,820
Speaker 1: I think you should just play Hearts first on your Windows PC.

829
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,280
Speaker 0: Well, so it's tricky because...

830
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,118
Speaker 1: Or Yahoo Games.

831
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,180
Speaker 0: What's interesting is that...

832
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,480
Speaker 1: And then you'll be able to play Wizard very easily.

833
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,640
Speaker 0: Hearts has the... Hearts teaches you de-suiting and ducking and all those kinds of strategies.

834
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:52,097
Speaker 1: Very important things to know for Wizard.

835
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,620
Speaker 0: But Hearts has no Trump, and Hearts has the card passing mechanics.

836
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,899
Speaker 1: Well, Hearts are Trump in Hearts.

837
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,198
Speaker 0: Well, they're not Trump.

838
00:45:59,123 --> 00:45:59,739
Speaker 1: Uh, sorta.

839
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:00,774
Speaker 0: No, they're not Trump.

840
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,160
Speaker 1: They're like reverse Trump.

841
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:03,038
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

842
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:04,079
Speaker 1: They are.

843
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:04,820
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

844
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:08,100
Speaker 0: They don't count extra for taking a suit.

845
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,800
Speaker 0: No, but they're the... Trump only means it lets you take a trick that you wouldn't otherwise take.

846
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:13,318
Speaker 1: Sure.

847
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,900
Speaker 1: Doesn't mean anything else.

848
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,720
Speaker 1: But they're the special suit in that you don't... Yes, Trump does mean the special suit.

849
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,900
Speaker 0: They're the point suit.

850
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:21,840
Speaker 0: Don't fuck with me on trick-taking games.

851
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,698
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan.

852
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:24,660
Speaker 1: You're being a pedantic nonsense.

853
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,040
Speaker 0: If you called that Trump among anyone who plays these games, they would laugh you out of the room.

854
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,360
Speaker 1: You'll still be able to easily understand the concepts of Wizard after playing Hearts.

855
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,480
Speaker 0: Scott, other... In America, other than one teaching game, I'm fucking undefeated at Wizards.

856
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,299
Speaker 0: Don't you even.

857
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,298
Speaker 0: Don't you even.

858
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:46,100
Speaker 0: So... But yeah, Hearts and Euchre are the two, like, arctic, typical games.

859
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,699
Speaker 0: I'd say Wist, but no one fucking actually plays Wist.

860
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:49,760
Speaker 1: Well, people did.

861
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,920
Speaker 0: No, yeah, no one modern plays Wist.

862
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,680
Speaker 0: And also, Euchre is basically just, like, Wist with a tiny deck.

863
00:46:56,142 --> 00:47:02,540
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like... It's almost like... Euchre is almost to Wist what pandanta is to poker as well, in a sense.

864
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,419
Speaker 1: There's also Bridge.

865
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate Bridge.

866
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,540
Speaker 0: But to articulate why requires...

867
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,800
Speaker 1: Bridge is a big deal, though.

868
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:09,636
Speaker 0: I know it is.

869
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,680
Speaker 0: I respect Bridge, but I don't like playing Bridge.

870
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,779
Speaker 0: But... So, let's talk about Wizard.

871
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:17,478
Speaker 0: Because just play it.

872
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,532
Speaker 0: But strategy-wise...

873
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:20,040
Speaker 1: Oh, strategy-wise.

874
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,580
Speaker 0: This is a good game with a very high skill cap.

875
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,337
Speaker 1: So I think the thing is...

876
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,440
Speaker 0: Playing this with people with noobs is like beating babies to death.

877
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:31,560
Speaker 0: It's just... Right.

878
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,580
Speaker 1: So you look at your hand and you say, "How many tricks can I possibly take with this

879
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:35,889
Speaker 1: hand?".

880
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:39,940
Speaker 1: And the thing is, well, you could... You might have a hand.

881
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,599
Speaker 1: It's got, like, Wizard.

882
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,840
Speaker 1: Okay, I gotta bet at least one.

883
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,320
Speaker 1: I got a Wizard.

884
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:42,654
Speaker 1: Yep.

885
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
Speaker 1: Then I got, like, two high trump cards.

886
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,740
Speaker 0: Well, I should probably bet... Scott, I saw a game.

887
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,420
Speaker 0: In the first round, two Wizards were in people's hands.

888
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:50,933
Speaker 1: Yep.

889
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,200
Speaker 0: So shit happens.

890
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:52,820
Speaker 1: Exactly.

891
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,120
Speaker 1: So, let's say it's the hand of five.

892
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,240
Speaker 1: You've got a Wizard, two high trumps, and two mech cards.

893
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:01,879
Speaker 0: Are those mech cards the same suit?

894
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:03,699
Speaker 1: Maybe.

895
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:04,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

896
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,780
Speaker 0: If they're the same suit, I'm definitely bidding fucking four.

897
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:10,719
Speaker 1: How are you gonna get four?

898
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,660
Speaker 0: Because I'm gonna control with the Wizard, lead my other stuff.

899
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,320
Speaker 0: The odds of other trump being out in the five hand, probably pretty low.

900
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,460
Speaker 1: You're basically counting that one of those mech cards will be able to take a trick.

901
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,239
Speaker 0: Because I'll be leading it toward the end.

902
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:35,520
Speaker 0: And because they're mech, if someone else fucks me somehow and takes control, I'll probably be able to use those trump to get control back pretty easily because the odds of the highest trump being in the game are pretty low.

903
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,839
Speaker 0: And two, because I'm de-suited, there's a decent chance I can use one of those trump to get back in right away.

904
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:50,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would just bet three because even if I am able to take one of the tricks with one of those mech cards, right, I know that other people all have five cards in the hand.

905
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,600
Speaker 1: Someone's gonna fuck me when I play one of my high trumps with a Wizard or some shit.

906
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:01,440
Speaker 1: So I basically can't, those two, those, you know, the advantage I can do if I try to take the tricks versus the someone's gonna fuck me cancel out.

907
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,417
Speaker 1: So I go three.

908
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,240
Speaker 0: Here's the real thing.

909
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,000
Speaker 0: My heuristic there, which was similar to yours, is just based on your hand.

910
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,940
Speaker 0: Which is how like in the hearts, your hand is the only real core direction.

911
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,520
Speaker 1: You don't get to see anyone else's hand.

912
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,159
Speaker 1: That's all you got to go.

913
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,820
Speaker 0: There's no bidding.

914
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,140
Speaker 0: But in Wizard, players openly bid on how many tricks they're going to take in turn order.

915
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,860
Speaker 1: So depending on who bids first and what they've bid, it's the hand of five.

916
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,720
Speaker 1: The first player, let's say rim goes, he has the hand we just discussed.

917
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,660
Speaker 0: If I'm bidding first, I would bid three.

918
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,080
Speaker 1: All right.

919
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,759
Speaker 1: So he going first, he bids three.

920
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:37,840
Speaker 1: If he's correct, that means among the three other players, only two people should take the tricks.

921
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,219
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'm sitting to the left of rim.

922
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,319
Speaker 1: I look at my hand.

923
00:49:40,663 --> 00:49:41,840
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous luck day.

924
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:42,760
Speaker 1: I have two wizards.

925
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,339
Speaker 1: So, but all the other cards in my hand are like twos.

926
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,380
Speaker 0: But you know that I'm really confident because I bid three not knowing anyone else's bid.

927
00:49:50,902 --> 00:49:51,880
Speaker 1: But I'm bidding two.

928
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,679
Speaker 1: I got two wizards.

929
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,780
Speaker 0: So the other two people either know they're not taking shit, are dumb and bid anyway.

930
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,020
Speaker 1: So now it's a round of five and five people have already bid.

931
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:03,299
Speaker 1: Two people have bid on all five tricks.

932
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,219
Speaker 1: The other guy's holding like a really high trump card.

933
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,013
Speaker 1: He bids one.

934
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,779
Speaker 1: And the other person's got some high trump cards too.

935
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,179
Speaker 1: They bid one or two.

936
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,540
Speaker 0: Now this is where the game gets interesting.

937
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,997
Speaker 1: So now the people have bid a total of like seven or eight tricks out of only five available tricks.

938
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,340
Speaker 1: Someone's wrong.

939
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:21,520
Speaker 0: And funny, sometimes it'll go way under.

940
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,020
Speaker 0: Like I saw a game, a couple of games were like in one hand, the bids will be like one, one, zero.

941
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:30,280
Speaker 0: And then the fourth person's like, uh, seven.

942
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:31,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

943
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,980
Speaker 1: They got a really bad hand, but everyone else bid way low.

944
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:36,020
Speaker 1: And the other thing is sometimes you'll underbid.

945
00:50:37,141 --> 00:50:37,740
Speaker 1: By accident.

946
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,679
Speaker 0: Well, that was really it.

947
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:46,120
Speaker 0: So when your example, the guy with that high trump, maybe he gets scared away from bidding because he knows like, all right, these guys got fucking wizards or whatever.

948
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,372
Speaker 0: Right.

949
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,318
Speaker 0: So he bids zero.

950
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:53,180
Speaker 0: So now my shit hand is more likely to win because he's doing everything he can to not take any tricks.

951
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:57,140
Speaker 1: So let's say I'm in a situation where I got like, I got a high card of every suit and a wizard.

952
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:02,360
Speaker 1: So I've got, I think I'm going to take five tricks, but I'm pretty sure one of these is going to get fucked over.

953
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,614
Speaker 1: It's a 10 and not a 13 and green or something.

954
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,588
Speaker 1: So I'm like, yeah, someone's going to probably take an 11 or 12 green and I won't get that one.

955
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:10,980
Speaker 1: So I'll go under by one.

956
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,642
Speaker 1: I'll bid for.

957
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:17,739
Speaker 1: then as we play all the I'm forced to play those high suit cards by following suit.

958
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:21,920
Speaker 1: And I end up taking my four tricks and I still have my wizard in my hand.

959
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,820
Speaker 0: So the other thing is when the bidding ends, usually you'll see like a lot like amongst people who are like really smart and good at trick taking games.

960
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:33,380
Speaker 0: The bids are almost always within one or two of the actual number of tricks.

961
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,279
Speaker 1: I've never been off by more than one.

962
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been.

963
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,240
Speaker 0: I was off by two or three or four or five in toward the end.

964
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,380
Speaker 0: If you're behind fucking just bid extra.

965
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:43,580
Speaker 1: If you're going to lose.

966
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:43,900
Speaker 1: Right.

967
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,715
Speaker 1: Then your only hope to catch up is to try to take more tricks.

968
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:53,378
Speaker 1: and nothing is like I'll play a hand and I'll bid three and I will take exactly three and say what a good job that was.

969
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,520
Speaker 1: I got it exactly right.

970
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:56,240
Speaker 1: But I didn't get it exactly right.

971
00:51:56,641 --> 00:51:59,340
Speaker 1: I could have taken four or five tricks.

972
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,080
Speaker 1: I just didn't bet four or five.

973
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,940
Speaker 1: So I chose during the round to not take tricks I could have taken because I bid too low.

974
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:14,880
Speaker 1: So even though I got the right number and got the points and didn't lose points, I could have had more points because I made bidding was not aggressive enough.

975
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,060
Speaker 0: So basically the game has the bidding aspects of bridge.

976
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:26,458
Speaker 0: It has the trump protection aspects of Euchre and it has the ducking and de suiting tactics of hearts.

977
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:29,480
Speaker 0: So it combines a lot of my favorite cards.

978
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,665
Speaker 1: It's pretty much everything.

979
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:33,240
Speaker 1: there is about trick taking games all in one game.

980
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,640
Speaker 0: So it comes with a bunch of variants.

981
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,217
Speaker 0: Plus wizards.

982
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,719
Speaker 0: But whatever.

983
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,940
Speaker 0: There is one problem with the game as written.

984
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,819
Speaker 0: The game does not give you a way to deal with Renee.

985
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:52,579
Speaker 0: So in like in Euchre if you fuck up and forget like you don't follow suit and then later it's like oops I had a heart and I should have played it.

986
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:54,000
Speaker 0: That doesn't ruin the game.

987
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,220
Speaker 0: The rules basically like the rules deal with that.

988
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:57,780
Speaker 0: There's a rule for if someone Renee.

989
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,839
Speaker 1: So let's say Renee.

990
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,760
Speaker 0: Or if you live in the Midwest Renee because they just can't pronounce words.

991
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,160
Speaker 1: So let's say Rym has a green card in his hand and I play green and he chooses to play some red card.

992
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,879
Speaker 1: He forgets that he had green in his hand.

993
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:19,020
Speaker 1: Then we find out later when he plays a green card I say Rym why didn't you follow that green card on the previous two turns ago and I played green.

994
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,420
Speaker 0: Fuck we've ruined the game.

995
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:21,919
Speaker 0: No way to fix it.

996
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,000
Speaker 1: There's no fix written into the rules.

997
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,204
Speaker 1: Now I know

998
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:34,864
Speaker 0: I want I'm trying to come up with a rule that we as like our friend group is just going to agree upon as the rule for Renee just so that we don't have to deal with it because the fact

999
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:41,460
Speaker 1: that I think the rules should be something along the lines of whoever takes that trick should take it according to the cards that were played.

1000
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:45,880
Speaker 1: But if you are caught basically you just lose chips.

1001
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:46,619
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1002
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,860
Speaker 0: You just lose points because you screwed up.

1003
00:53:48,981 --> 00:53:50,577
Speaker 0: I'm trying to figure out like a number of them right.

1004
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,580
Speaker 1: I think the number has to scale up as you get deeper in the game.

1005
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,365
Speaker 1: It has to be.

1006
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:56,620
Speaker 1: the penalty should become worse.

1007
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,141
Speaker 0: How about this?

1008
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:01,336
Speaker 0: you lose a number of chips equal to the number of cards.

1009
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:02,797
Speaker 1: that might be too much though.

1010
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,720
Speaker 1: But at the same time it also depends on like how significant was the mistake you made.

1011
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:07,300
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1012
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:15,020
Speaker 1: It might not have mattered like oh you would have played it earlier and not taken the trick and the other card that you did play earlier would have not taken this trick.

1013
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:17,920
Speaker 0: And also you fucked up everyone else's card counting.

1014
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:18,764
Speaker 1: That's all.

1015
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:19,900
Speaker 1: the counting cards are very important.

1016
00:54:20,603 --> 00:54:26,780
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure and if anyone has any suggestions discussed in the forum because that's the only flaw with this game.

1017
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:35,680
Speaker 0: The other thing is that there's a variant I really want to try because one thing that hearts has that makes hearts shooting the shooting the moon.

1018
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,104
Speaker 1: No.

1019
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:39,240
Speaker 0: So in hearts in the first hand.

1020
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:40,760
Speaker 1: Oh the passing.

1021
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,577
Speaker 0: You pick three cards and pass them to the dude to your left and the dude to your right passes three to you.

1022
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:49,840
Speaker 0: So I know that I gave this motherfucker three spades.

1023
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,700
Speaker 0: So I know he's got a bunch of high spades and I don't have any spades.

1024
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,579
Speaker 0: It's going to be awesome.

1025
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:55,112
Speaker 1: Sorry.

1026
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:58,240
Speaker 1: So you can easily add that to wizard as a variant rule.

1027
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:58,799
Speaker 1: No problem.

1028
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,819
Speaker 1: Here's the question though.

1029
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:03,380
Speaker 1: Do you bid before or after passing?

1030
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,179
Speaker 0: I think after by default.

1031
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,580
Speaker 0: But hardcore mode is before.

1032
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:16,590
Speaker 1: I mean you could choose the cards you're going to pass, then bid, then see the cards you're picking up.

1033
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,040
Speaker 1: Because remember that you're still getting information from the other people's bids.

1034
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,439
Speaker 0: You could also have something cool where like you're allowed.

1035
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:28,059
Speaker 0: After you get your cards you're allowed to raise your bid but you can't lower it.

1036
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,776
Speaker 0: Like something like that.

1037
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:34,080
Speaker 0: This game is ripe for custom house rules.

1038
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,480
Speaker 1: The thing is with passing cards people are going to dump suit like pretty much immediately.

1039
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what happens in hearts.

1040
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,840
Speaker 1: Trump cards become way more powerful.

1041
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,980
Speaker 1: And you'll be able to take way more tricks if you have any Trumps whatsoever.

1042
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,697
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1043
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,840
Speaker 0: Much like with Dune.

1044
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,040
Speaker 1: So do you reveal Trump before or after the bidding and passing?

1045
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,320
Speaker 0: Much like with Dune.

1046
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,778
Speaker 1: The order matters so much.

1047
00:55:56,481 --> 00:56:00,320
Speaker 0: Even then Scott, much like with Dune everybody has that power.

1048
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,080
Speaker 1: That's correct.

1049
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:01,959
Speaker 1: And two.

1050
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,899
Speaker 1: But then luck becomes a big factor too.

1051
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:11,660
Speaker 0: In high level hearts play for example, I would pass my dad two high clubs and a middling to low club.

1052
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:15,300
Speaker 0: But maybe I didn't desuit myself of clubs.

1053
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a low club.

1054
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,416
Speaker 1: I mean you're going to get rid of that.

1055
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:17,640
Speaker 1: no problem.

1056
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,459
Speaker 1: You kept the low one.

1057
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,110
Speaker 0: No, but I gave away a low one to imply that I had gotten rid of all my clubs.

1058
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:29,020
Speaker 0: and I'm probably some motherfucker who's going to heart and/or queen of spades someone.

1059
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,660
Speaker 1: You held one middling club.

1060
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1061
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,539
Speaker 1: That's still not going to take a trick.

1062
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,518
Speaker 0: Hopefully not.

1063
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,826
Speaker 0: So you get into like the card.

1064
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:41,240
Speaker 0: in high level hearts play, the cards you pass themselves are a whole game of their own.

1065
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:50,540
Speaker 1: So it's like there's a whole process of seeing your cards, choosing which cards to pass, seeing the cards that were passed to you and seeing what Trump is and seeing the other players bids.

1066
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:58,240
Speaker 1: And you're also like when in that process the order that you do the things and when the people bid really changes the game a zillion.

1067
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:04,040
Speaker 0: So if you're an aspiring game designer and you think none of those things sound like a big deal, they're such different games.

1068
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,960
Speaker 1: If you don't understand why the order of those things changes the game like ten thousand percent, don't make any games.

1069
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,720
Speaker 0: And if you want to be good at this game when you first teach it to your friends, one, play a bunch of hearts online.

1070
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:26,820
Speaker 0: But two, a basic heuristic that a lot of noobs use is guess how many tricks you think you're going to take and go for one less than that because you're probably wrong.

1071
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:27,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

1072
00:57:27,522 --> 00:57:29,086
Speaker 1: You'll probably get wizarded or something.

1073
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:34,200
Speaker 1: It's like count the number of awesome trick taking cards in your hand that are powerful, the high Trumps and the wizards and whatever.

1074
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,600
Speaker 1: Take that number, subtract one and then try to take that many tricks and you'll probably beat most people who don't know what they're doing.

1075
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:43,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1076
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:50,453
Speaker 0: And we're going to play, I mean, we're going to play a lot of games at PAX South, but I think wizard is going to be the like, it's going to be the default warm up game or the default.

1077
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:54,180
Speaker 0: four of us are waiting for you guys to finish eclipse before we do another thing game.

1078
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:54,921
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

1079
00:57:57,044 --> 00:58:07,300
Speaker 0: Also, uh, at least our thing as came up at PAX offices, anytime someone plays a wizard, they basically sing that thing from Daffy Duck.

1080
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:16,920
Speaker 0: Behold, the wizard is incredible power that that you're pretty much obligated to say that out loud, possibly loudly every time you play a wizard.

1081
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1082
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,364
Speaker 0: So, uh, linked to that much like the posing in pen Dante.

1083
00:58:21,384 --> 00:58:25,547
Speaker 1: This game is also, you know, it's a good, right?

1084
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,130
Speaker 1: Any good board game, any good tabletop game is going to have a thing that people say.

1085
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,402
Speaker 0: Y'all got a brick.

1086
00:58:30,562 --> 00:58:32,246
Speaker 0: Y'all got wood from my sheep.

1087
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:32,988
Speaker 1: That's right.

1088
00:58:33,529 --> 00:58:38,160
Speaker 1: So the fact that this people are playing this game going wizard shows a good game.

1089
00:58:44,262 --> 00:58:46,527
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
