1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,032
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday July 10th 2019.

2
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:12,056
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:14,365
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:20,270
Speaker 0: We are judging Anime by its cover the summer 2019 anime that we have not watched.

5
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:22,548
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:31,473
Speaker 1: So back in the day way back in the day, New York like 1857 1940 something.

7
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:35,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were parades in New York all the fucking time.

8
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:36,647
Speaker 1: You didn't really mean.

9
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:37,790
Speaker 0: what else do you do back then?

10
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:43,610
Speaker 1: Sure, but like back in those days you had you started to do something really great to get a parade.

11
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:49,874
Speaker 1: But like if you were just a fancy person like a king or something and you visited New York You would get a parade.

12
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:56,950
Speaker 1: if you did something like win some Olympic gold medals You would get a parade right now again because there was nothing else going on.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:09,330
Speaker 1: Like you're bored and then someone's like hey this Kings in town right nowadays Right the bar that there's much fewer parades Okay, and and the bar for getting a parade is so much higher.

14
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:14,910
Speaker 0: I mean what the Rangers got won by winning Lord Stanley's car so you can win one.

15
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,961
Speaker 1: Basically, they're almost these days almost every parade.

16
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,472
Speaker 1: I think the last parade that I can remember Happening.

17
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,961
Speaker 1: I'm sure someone might find one on Wikipedia or something.

18
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,915
Speaker 1: I'm like list of parades, but the last parade I remember being in New York City.

19
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:31,768
Speaker 1: That was not sports related was when the Pope visited.

20
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:32,430
Speaker 0: No, we gotta be clear.

21
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,290
Speaker 0: We're not talking about like the Puerto Rican Day Parade like.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,556
Speaker 1: We're talking about the actual right.

23
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,464
Speaker 1: so if you don't like the ticker tape, right.

24
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,939
Speaker 1: if you're not in New York City You had to realize there is an area downtown.

25
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,786
Speaker 0: There's a Wikipedia page that lists everyone.

26
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:45,248
Speaker 0: ever, right?

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,850
Speaker 1: So if you if you don't know New York City Right Battery Park is at the bottom of the city and you go north a little bit on Broadway It's called Battery Park because there were batteries of cannons there.

28
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:02,879
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's called and that stretch of Broadway is known as the quote Canyon of Heroes And then it ends at City Hall.

29
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,416
Speaker 1: and what you do is if you did something really fucking awesome You get your.

30
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,889
Speaker 1: you get a parade that goes down that little bit of road.

31
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,490
Speaker 1: Oh, dude, it's real narrow and everyone throws shredded paper out the window.

32
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:19,646
Speaker 0: This is great because the list of them there aren't that many These days there are that I want to list the first few because they're really funny.

33
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:29,635
Speaker 0: So the first one 1886 October 28th The Statue of Liberty was dedicated and people just had an impromptu parade like it just happened Sounds good.

34
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,044
Speaker 0: that started the tradition.

35
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,351
Speaker 1: That's the bar That's like.

36
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:35,079
Speaker 1: that's how great a thing has to be to be parade worthy.

37
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:41,004
Speaker 0: three years later in 1889 the centennial of George Washington becoming the first president.

38
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:51,958
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, uh Admiral Dewey returning from Manila Theodore Roosevelt returning from his African safari That's not that that's a pretty low bar that one.

39
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,664
Speaker 1: That's the US Olympic Games.

40
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,731
Speaker 0: athletes returning in 1912.

41
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:59,170
Speaker 0: There you go, not even winning just coming back because the Olympics were kind of new back.

42
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,584
Speaker 1: Let us hear a bigger deal then.

43
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:10,655
Speaker 0: Yeah General Pershing coming back from the with the commander of the American Expeditionary Force Edward Albert the Prince of Wales Daining to visit.

44
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:15,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I say a lot of them are like fancy person the marshal of France.

45
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,519
Speaker 1: That was a lot of the visit ones were before there were planes.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,707
Speaker 1: visiting a place is a big fucking deal right?

47
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:29,741
Speaker 1: Yeah Titanic before it crashed Sending off parade, but they basically they slowed.

48
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,728
Speaker 0: it looks like they slowed down in the 70s, right?

49
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,310
Speaker 1: So the reason they slowed down at least as far as I'm aware is not like a specific mandate or anything.

50
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:43,610
Speaker 1: it's simply that you know a Humanity has achieved a lot less things that are parade worthy.

51
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, there hasn't been an Apollo like moon landing in a while, right.

52
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,350
Speaker 1: And be even if you did something worthy, right?

53
00:03:51,470 --> 00:04:04,523
Speaker 1: So for take for example Like Michael Phelps if Michael Phelps who won a huge mountain of gold Olympic medals had just been born 50 years earlier he would have gotten one or more parades.

54
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:08,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, right but in you know 2015 whatever.

55
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,830
Speaker 1: whenever he won his you know pile of medals and when was the last Summer Olympics 2016?

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,592
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

57
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:17,745
Speaker 1: I mean in the point is who would show up for the Michael Phelps parade?

58
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:22,610
Speaker 1: who would even show up for the American Summer Olympians parade, right?

59
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:23,834
Speaker 1: It's like you will.

60
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:25,764
Speaker 1: people would not turn out for that.

61
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:29,761
Speaker 0: in the 70s There were a grand total of one two, three, four five six of these.

62
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:30,765
Speaker 0: Yeah in the 80s.

63
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:31,910
Speaker 0: There were four.

64
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:33,641
Speaker 0: Yeah in the 90s.

65
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,385
Speaker 0: There were a few more.

66
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,010
Speaker 1: right now you got it.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:43,322
Speaker 1: You know, I I will take all the New York sports team parades As long as they're not Yankees or Islanders.

68
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,550
Speaker 0: or I was about to say these 70s were in order.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,438
Speaker 0: Yes, Apollo 14.

70
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, Apollo 15.

71
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:53,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh Some bicentennial operation sale thing with sailors.

72
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:59,590
Speaker 0: Yeah Yankees winning the World Series Yankees winning the World Series and Pope John Paul the second day.

73
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,590
Speaker 1: I see I was tired, you know, then the Pope visiting all I get over 81 the Iranian hostages being released.

74
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:05,554
Speaker 1: That's one of them.

75
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:09,028
Speaker 1: yeah, right but the point is Oh 86 the Mets right?

76
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:16,863
Speaker 1: Yeah I was like, it's like right, you know, I was thinking I was like I was there at the parade for you know The women is a lot of World Series.

77
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:21,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't say yeah It's almost like there are great baseball teams like that evil team.

78
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:22,709
Speaker 0: I like the evil teams.

79
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:30,959
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, the women's team won the World Cup which is way, you know, that's like American All right, so New York level stuff.

80
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 1: you happen to get in New York parade because it's New York.

81
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:49,059
Speaker 1: I mean the last three the last seven were sports victories right - Yankees Giants Yankees Giants World Cup World Cup, right, but the World Cup ones are significantly better because that's a world accomplishment Not a New York us-only account.

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,690
Speaker 1: I mean the Super Bowl is a world accomplishment kind of Right, but I'm thinking like what the fuck do you have to do to get a parade?

83
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,250
Speaker 0: Well, like you said it's like one higher honor come back from Mars, right?

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,792
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

85
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,362
Speaker 1: Like what honor aids, right?

86
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,510
Speaker 1: How great do you have to fucking be?

87
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,170
Speaker 1: It's like you could win the Nobel Prize and not get a parade.

88
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,421
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people win the Nobel Prize and don't get this parade.

89
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,250
Speaker 1: I mean like you have to be an American.

90
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:19,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of how many Americans win the Nobel Prize a lot of Nobel Prizes.

91
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,450
Speaker 0: Sure Obama won a Nobel Prize.

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,173
Speaker 1: Pray no praise.

93
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:23,715
Speaker 1: or Obama.

94
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:28,390
Speaker 1: to get a New York parade is like it's like harder than like almost anything.

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,341
Speaker 1: Like sports are like the only reasonable route because it's like.

96
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:35,850
Speaker 1: it's just like the bar of accomplishment and heroism required.

97
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,924
Speaker 1: So it's just so high.

98
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:38,810
Speaker 1: Here's another list.

99
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,702
Speaker 1: You have to be like an all-time great human to be like this.

100
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,790
Speaker 1: Is there even a person alive?

101
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,430
Speaker 1: Right that you can just say, you know what that is a person who is alive and they're just so great that they are parade worthy.

102
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:55,002
Speaker 0: So I learned some great facts about human being alive in 2019 anyone.

103
00:06:55,042 --> 00:07:00,622
Speaker 0: so there's a list of People who were so fucking awesome.

104
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:02,130
Speaker 0: they had more than one.

105
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:11,310

Speaker 1: Yep, and they've won a lot more than nine World Series.

108
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't get a parade every and we've rescinded one of them.

109
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,288
Speaker 1: Well, there's the Nazi guy.

110
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:35,790
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, these are the Marshall pretend but basically the Collaborator shithead who ran the martial law state that was later occupied by the Nazis.

111
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,144
Speaker 0: They removed the plaque and they were like, nope, that parade does not count.

112
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,470
Speaker 1: His name's still on the ground over there.

113
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,848

119
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,357
Speaker 1: We should go vandalize it.

120
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:09,707
Speaker 0: We'll get a jack full disclosure if it gets vandalized.

121
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,530

00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,349
Speaker 0: You live-streamed yourself doing it?

127
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:39,090
Speaker 1: All right, the point is is like if you set your goal in life to get parade good fucking luck.

128
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,515
Speaker 1: It's like what honor.

129
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:45,188

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,482
Speaker 1: It's a con like it's not like all these small medium sized anime cons.

148
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:37,007
Speaker 0: Like New York Anime Festival.

149
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,396
Speaker 1: Even Anime Boston Which is large.

150
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,324
Speaker 0: Anime NYC good to go to.

151
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,188
Speaker 1: New York Comic Con?

152
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,717
Speaker 1: Completely different from anime expo.

153
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,062
Speaker 1: Anime expo is bad.

154
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:49,621
Speaker 0: But anime expo is not just bad for those reasons It's also really badly run.

155
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,930
Speaker 0: It's a miserable experience.

156
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,923
Speaker 0: Like every year you can watch Twitter and see the garbage fire.

157
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,628
Speaker 1: There is no reason to be at it.

158
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,898
Speaker 1: and this year They were earthquakes.

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,180
Speaker 1: Yeah That's why I don't go to- I've never been to California.

160
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,365
Speaker 1: earthquakes are part of the reason.

161
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,309
Speaker 0: I mean the oh the.

162
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:06,461
Speaker 0: I've never been to California except for work.

163
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,645
Speaker 1: I've been there for the airport.

164
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:08,970
Speaker 0: I've been there for work a bunch of times.

165
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,849
Speaker 1: I might go there soon, but I gotta wait for earthquake season to stop.

166
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,655
Speaker 0: I mean earthquake.

167
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,464
Speaker 0: the earthquakes are not causing that much damage because of regulations.

168
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:16,985
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

169
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,530
Speaker 1: I still don't really want to be in one.

170
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been in minor earthquakes.

171
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:21,281
Speaker 0: They're a big deal.

172
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been in New York earthquakes.

173
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:23,650
Speaker 1: They're fine.

174
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,155
Speaker 0: Yeah I remember that earthquake.

175
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:29,210
Speaker 0: cuz I was on the street and suddenly people come running out of the buildings and running out of the subways.

176
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,570
Speaker 1: You know, it feels like someone, you know, like stomped around a little bit.

177
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,929
Speaker 0: Well, cuz if you're on the street, you know, feel it.

178
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:39,313
Speaker 0: But if you're in a old building in New York the buildings sway a lot Cuz they're old.

179
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:45,577
Speaker 1: It just feels like someone was stomping around on the on the roof above you and like hey cut it out And it's like no that was the whole world joking.

180
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:46,601
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna go through.

181
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,167
Speaker 0: some of the news is from Anime Expo.

182
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,494
Speaker 0: number one Katsuhiro Otomo.

183
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,545
Speaker 1: If you don't know who is the creator of Akira.

184
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:58,523
Speaker 0: Yep Directed part of robot carnival done a lot of stuff.

185
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,490
Speaker 0: He is getting a new movie, right?

186
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:04,575
Speaker 1: So I guess he's running out of money because this is like the least You think about.

187
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:16,458
Speaker 1: most of the creators of great animes and mangas are known for being Ultra prolific work of workaholics like Satoshi God made as many movies as he could while he was a lot He's like, uh, he just freaking cranked him out like a machine.

188
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:20,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Otomo is famous for barely making fucking anything.

189
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:30,170
Speaker 1: He made a handful of Really awesome artsy indie mangas the most famous of which is like Domo right, which is great.

190
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,870
Speaker 1: And then he made Akira which is like one of the best manga ever created.

191
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:38,204
Speaker 1: He sort of did some work on this manga called Legend of Mother Sarah.

192
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,850
Speaker 1: That was sort of published in the u.s.

193
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,856
Speaker 1: It's really hard to get and he was actually by another dude metropolis Really involved in metropolis.

194
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:46,318
Speaker 1: that much.

195
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,165
Speaker 0: Well, he was involved.

196
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,008
Speaker 1: His name was on it.

197
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:54,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But basically he made the Akira movie, which is great, even though it you know only bore some resemblance to the manga.

198
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:59,508
Speaker 1: And then he didn't make anything fucking else until steam boy, which was not great.

199
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,239
Speaker 0: Nope See boy was really pretty but it was not good.

200
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,260
Speaker 1: and then he sort of I don't know how much he worked on the frame Cup noodle freedom thing.

201
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I don't even know Everything is great because it just has a line at the end that says it's like the things they picked.

202
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,801
Speaker 0: to associate Him with is pretty funny quote.

203
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:19,026
Speaker 0: He also collaborated on Harmageddon barely erosion Z.

204
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:23,516
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Reagan Which everyone forgets.

205
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,799
Speaker 0: who remembers spring in?

206
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,124
Speaker 0: yeah metropolis cup noodle?

207
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,490
Speaker 0: and he pira the little vampire.

208
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,680
Speaker 0: We've reviewed it on fucking gig nights.

209
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,241
Speaker 1: Yes.

210
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,087
Speaker 0: I don't remember you don't remember he.

211
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,030
Speaker 0: it was not great.

212
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:40,221
Speaker 0: Okay, the point is Like show with the cute little vampire.

213
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,608
Speaker 1: I don't remember this anyway.

214
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:55,136
Speaker 1: Otomo is like this dude who's clearly shown the potential to create like all-time great parade worthy works 2011 tonight on gig nights the cute he Peter and the fun walk food Both.

215
00:12:55,317 --> 00:13:02,450
Speaker 1: the point is Akira is parade worthy But Otomo is not because since then he's done jack and shit basically, right?

216
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:06,470
Speaker 1: So they're redoing Akira in HD, which I guess is a good thing.

217
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,450
Speaker 1: You know, you know, but he's making another thing called the orbital or something.

218
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, the image the promotional image looks very Otomo esque and involves.

219
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:27,970
Speaker 0: All I think of Otomo is there's someone probably wearing a helmet of some kind Standing in the middle of a big mostly empty thing holding something maybe with a motorbike, right?

220
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:32,915
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I hope it's good obviously because I love Otomo when he's good.

221
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:39,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really wish the thing is if you look at the things he's worked on animation wise You know where he's had heavy involvement.

222
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:43,348
Speaker 1: He's only had the one hit where it was based on a manga.

223
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But all of his manga which he I don't.

224
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,249
Speaker 1: he's made any manga since Akira none of note or significant.

225
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:54,670
Speaker 1: anyway I really wish he would just make manga cuz he's basically never made a bad manga.

226
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:55,536
Speaker 0: You know what?

227
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:56,080
Speaker 0: I was about this.

228
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,570
Speaker 0: This is the monkey's paw situation.

229
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,296
Speaker 0: You're like, I wish Otomo would make more stuff.

230
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,849
Speaker 0: The monkey's paw is like he's gonna make another mediocre movie, right?

231
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,144
Speaker 0: Makes great comedy anime and what he ends up like.

232
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:13,559
Speaker 0: all he wants to do is make a really boring Terrible live-action stuff that nobody likes.

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,506
Speaker 1: It's like if Otomo would just make a manga.

234
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:20,050
Speaker 1: it would be great Hopefully and then he could make an anime based on that manga.

235
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and then that would hopefully also be great, but you just go and direct to you know movie and it's not.

236
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:26,389
Speaker 1: you know.

237
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:27,773
Speaker 1: I I can.

238
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:35,837
Speaker 1: I can hope it's great, but I'm going to set expectations low because that way I won't have any disappointment or Excitement or anticipation.

239
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:38,428
Speaker 1: Yep, you know if it is I do hope it's great though.

240
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:38,950
Speaker 1: That'll be awesome.

241
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:49,351
Speaker 0: so in another news from Expo promare, which Imagine just kill la kill - right promare is a new animated movie from studio trigger Who.

Speaker 0: So make sure you go see it on the weeknight after work like I am so crunchy roll now There's an update to this crunchy roll adult swim and a bunch of other people are joining HBO max, right?

254
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,566
Speaker 1: So if you don't know about this Let's say you want to do legal streaming and you don't want to pirate anything.

255
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:30,570
Speaker 1: You don't have cable, right?

256
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,589
Speaker 1: So if you want if you're interested in HBO your options are HBO go.

257
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,635
Speaker 0: Well, your options are your parents.

258
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:44,309
Speaker 1: HBO go exactly you don't have HBO go means you have cable and you log in with your cable And then you can watch HBO.

259
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:51,030
Speaker 1: HBO now is a thing that lets you watch some limited amount of HBO mostly Game of Thrones.

260
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much the Game of Thrones.

261
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:58,220
Speaker 1: HBO now effectively is Pay money to watch Game of Thrones if you don't have HP.

262
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:05,698
Speaker 1: if you can't get HBO go or pirate or do anything else I mean, yeah, right And I don't even care about Game of Thrones right.

263
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,150
Speaker 1: HBO max is a new thing.

264
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:14,150
Speaker 1: It's basically going to be like a real streaming service just like fucking Netflix and you pay for it.

265
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,199
Speaker 1: And not only do you get a bunch of HBO stuff?

266
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,450
Speaker 1: You're also gonna get all the Warner stuff, right?

267
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,180
Speaker 1: You're gonna get Cartoon Network stuff.

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:29,929
Speaker 0: You're gonna get all kinds of Almost all the Warner media brands like Warner Brothers stuff new line DC entertainment CNN TNT TBS Out of the box.

269
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:38,010
Speaker 1: If they put enough content into this out of the box then like that is a Netflix level competitor right there.

270
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,037
Speaker 1: you're gonna be choosing between like.

271
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,529
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be switching between Netflix this one and the Disney one like.

272
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:46,134
Speaker 0: I hate that.

273
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,700
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get the Disney ones.

274
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,270
Speaker 1: I'm gonna switch between the three depending on what I'm watching.

275
00:16:50,531 --> 00:17:01,833
Speaker 0: So what's interesting is because they're gonna bring a bunch of content from their subsidiaries Subsidiaries because one of the subsidiaries of Warner media is otter media and I otter media owns a whole bunch of crap Mm-hmm.

276
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,041
Speaker 0: I can think they own crunchyroll.

277
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,047
Speaker 1: I don't know.

278
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:12,916
Speaker 0: So all this stuff is gonna be on HBO max, but to be clear here I'm gonna just quote anime news network crunchyroll.

279
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:20,128
Speaker 0: clarified with anime news network on Wednesdays like recently that only select content from crunchyroll Will be available on HBO max, right?

280
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,750
Speaker 1: For crunchyroll, so if you want deep cuts from crunchyroll, you're gonna have to get crunchyroll.

281
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,630
Speaker 1: But if you just want to watch some anime and you have HBO max, you're gonna see some anime.

282
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

283
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:37,609
Speaker 1: So if you're the kind of person who maybe watches like the top animes and not the deep cuts then maybe HBO max.

284
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,251
Speaker 1: or you Know Netflix or any, you know Any of this?

285
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:47,842
Speaker 0: all the services seem to have a little bit anime going on with my my current strategy of I have Netflix I have crunchyroll and I have pirate Bay.

286
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:48,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,650
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what I have right now.

288
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:56,376
Speaker 1: But I also I do know I have those two things and I have Criterion Channel, but yeah, I do Movies and shows on Amazon.

289
00:17:56,436 --> 00:18:02,752
Speaker 1: I haven't been watching crunchyroll recently, but the problem is I have an annual membership So I can't cancel and uncancel Right.

290
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:06,506
Speaker 1: So but I probably won't renew it until there's a show I need to watch on crunchyroll.

291
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:12,703
Speaker 0: So lastly is Neon Genesis Evangelion we talked about at length is now available on Netflix.

292
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,750
Speaker 1: We talked about that last and yeah Wednesday show.

293
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:37,241
Speaker 0: I just want to point out if you for whatever reason listen to geek nights, but haven't watched Evangelion we don't need to re-review it because back in 2007 we reviewed Neon Genesis Evangelion and We in 2008 did a full deep final thoughts spoilers everywhere Like talk about Neon Genesis Evangelion.

294
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:49,090
Speaker 0: So rather than us do this again You can just go listen to those old geek nights episodes And you'll get the weird novelty of Scott doing the opening introduction to the show instead of me because we used to alternate back in 2007.

295
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,122
Speaker 1: you get some old ass 2007 news.

296
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:53,286
Speaker 0: Oh, well, what's the news here?

297
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:58,382
Speaker 0: Let's see in the news Michiko and Hachin is an anime and Tatsunoko vs.

298
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,189
Speaker 0: Capcom is going crazy.

299
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:00,550
Speaker 0: go nuts.

300
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,578
Speaker 0: I don't know what that news was.

301
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:06,400
Speaker 0: and for the other show Let's see, we review Neon Genesis Evangelion in the news.

302
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,526
Speaker 0: Speed Racer and Boku Ra.

303
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,810
Speaker 0: I think Boku Rano came out.

304
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:10,733
Speaker 0: Maybe we?

305
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:11,917
Speaker 1: I don't know.

306
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,843
Speaker 0: None of these links are valid anymore.

307
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:14,866
Speaker 0: They're all 404s.

308
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,930
Speaker 0: There's no way to find out what the hell.

309
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,496
Speaker 0: Oh Boku Rano.

310
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,487
Speaker 0: Oh, you know our news was Boku Rano.

311
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:25,300
Speaker 0: the anime Changed the ending because the manga ending was too depressing.

312
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,266
Speaker 1: the manga and anime are significantly different.

313
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,470
Speaker 1: I watched all the anime.

314
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,474
Speaker 1: I have all the manga.

315
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,278
Speaker 1: I haven't read it all yet.

316
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:31,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, that anime is pretty good.

317
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:32,408
Speaker 0: Actually.

318
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,277
Speaker 0: It's way good I could watch it again someday.

319
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,630
Speaker 0: go finally this weekend.

320
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,068
Speaker 0: If you are not aware there is a convention in Connecticut in Hartford called Kinetic Con.

321
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:43,764
Speaker 1: now Isn't it usually the same weekend as San Diego Comic Con?

322
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:48,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, it moves around But it's this coming weekend like this weekend.

323
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:57,895
Speaker 0: All right If you live within like a couple hours drive San Diego Comic Con if you live within a couple hours drive or a reasonable train ride You should go to Kinetic Con.

324
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:02,810
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good con, but it's not a fly to Connecticut convention.

325
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,335
Speaker 0: Don't fly there.

326
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:06,220
Speaker 0: But if you live nearby, you should probably go.

327
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:09,310
Speaker 1: Okay, San Diego Comic Con is the week after that.

328
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,322
Speaker 1: It's the 18th through the 21st.

329
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:12,590
Speaker 0: So we used to go every year.

330
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,410
Speaker 0: We used to run the entire like panels and workshops department.

331
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:23,183
Speaker 0: We were tired from that position our good friends cold guy and they took over Running that area and they do a really good job.

332
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,870
Speaker 0: The convention is just as good as it's always been.

333
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,302
Speaker 0: So we'll probably return someday.

334
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,870
Speaker 0: We can't return because actually Scott has something going on this weekend.

335
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,390
Speaker 0: So it would have been just me and the only just me con I do is Zenkai Con.

336
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 0: But if you're anywhere near Connecticut, you should totally go to this con.

337
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,928
Speaker 0: They got a lot of Steven Universe voice actors and it's always a good time.

338
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:53,318
Speaker 0: also, frankly Other than PAX's and magfests like weirdly enough Kinetic Con is like one of the better Tabletop gaming cons you could go to in the East Coast.

339
00:20:53,399 --> 00:21:06,030
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like you wouldn't think that you wouldn't even know that It is a better gaming con just inside of this con than most gaming cons are And gaming is just like one area of the con.

340
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,249
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

341
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:15,710
Speaker 0: What do you got?

342
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:24,400
Speaker 0: So here are some people presumably in Russia But maybe not right, you know I also got a Russia vibe based on the with the laughter and based on that old ass control.

343
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:25,907
Speaker 1: So what's the name of the Twitter account?

344
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:26,871
Speaker 1: men's corner?

345
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know but I don't know about this Twitter account.

346
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,805
Speaker 0: Oh this Twitter account probably just agree I don't know.

347
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,734
Speaker 1: But the point is the video in this tweet is excellent.

348
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:41,781
Speaker 1: There are two stupid people on train tracks walking Yeah Don't.

349
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:50,656
Speaker 1: and reason the train which the camera is inside of is Sneaking up on them and they don't hear that train even though it's going slow.

350
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,720
Speaker 1: trains are loud slow.

351
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Speaker 0: Well electric trains that are not accelerating or decelerating that are relatively modern and well maintained are actually really quiet.

352
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, uh hilarity ensues.

353
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a real good tweet.

354
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:08,760
Speaker 1: very very you're not gonna get much more laughter in 25 seconds than you are with this one.

355
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:17,380
Speaker 0: So thing of the day So my thing of the day, I'm like 70% sure this is real because I've seen some shit in my life.

356
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:23,608
Speaker 1: I mean, I it could be real could be fake but in the absence of proof that it's real I have to lean towards fake.

357
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,260
Speaker 1: even though I don't I'm not gonna say a hundred percent.

358
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:32,631
Speaker 0: I feel like it's real because I have encountered Similarly weird situations like that.

359
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:38,680
Speaker 0: saxophone house is clearly fake and Sephiroth house is pretty but this feels like it happened.

360
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:52,840
Speaker 0: but basically, you know, there's a place on reddit where people will semi anonymously ask for relationship advice and The most common reason you would go to that place is to see what a shit show other people's lives are so you can feel Better about yourself, right?

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:02,260
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the person who wrote this relationship advice post says they originally Posted on our a ITA which if you don't know is am I the asshole?

362
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is another great place to go on reddit because basically you have people who either are assholes or People who are.

363
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,119
Speaker 1: you know in situations?

364
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,729
Speaker 0: Entangled with assholes how we should make one.

365
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:17,480
Speaker 1: you get to go there and you get to basically vote on.

366
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,508
Speaker 1: You are the person posting this.

367
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,713
Speaker 1: you're the asshole or no?

368
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,446
Speaker 1: the person you're posting about is the asshole Assuming you're not lying.

369
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,034
Speaker 0: I feel like we should make the spin-off.

370
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:25,919
Speaker 0: Am I that guy?

371
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,489
Speaker 1: Okay, yes, you're that guy if you have to ask well To ask if you're that guy you're not that guy.

372
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,460
Speaker 0: like I have almost anyone who's ever worried about a guy.

373
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,340
Speaker 1: You're not that probably not that guy.

374
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy has no idea that he's that guy and hates all the other that guys.

375
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:50,094
Speaker 0: So anyway, I'm just gonna read the very beginning of this because you got to read it.

376
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:55,350
Speaker 0: It's it swerves Very delicately and in a wonderful way that I love.

377
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:58,619
Speaker 0: I'm female 34 pregnant and struggling with my husband.

378
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,814
Speaker 0: male 35 lack of support regarding my regarding my in-laws behavior.

379
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,300
Speaker 0: How could I prove the situation?

380
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,073
Speaker 0: I've been happily married for 10 years.

381
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:07,979
Speaker 0: I'm very much in love.

382
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:14,080
Speaker 0: I'm not sure of the blah blah blah, but basically quote the relationship with his parents has been strained.

383
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:17,439
Speaker 0: They own a number of mouse figurines.

384
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,507
Speaker 0: Okay That's already.

385
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,959
Speaker 1: a lot of people collect stuff.

386
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,660
Speaker 0: They're made from different materials and one is a giant papier-mâché one called Timothy.

387
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:33,480
Speaker 0: Okay, each of them has a whole character profile with backstories personal pressure preferences family relations, etc.

388
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,064
Speaker 1: Okay So they not only do they collect but they take it the extra mile with fan fiction and all of them are seen as part Of the family.

389
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,660
Speaker 0: Timothy is my in-laws grandchild.

390
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:46,493
Speaker 0: What unsettles me is that they constantly talk to them and with other my.

391
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:55,440
Speaker 0: they constantly talk as them With other mice or each other and guess they used high-pitched tones and they'll talk in this manner that little children to use for instance.

392
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:58,313
Speaker 1: Okay, so that they have mental problems and they need help.

393
00:24:58,675 --> 00:24:59,760
Speaker 0: My father will squeak.

394
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,429
Speaker 0: My husband's father will squeakingly say my tummy hurts.

395
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,740
Speaker 0: I am hungry while wiggling a mouse plushie in my face.

396
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,185
Speaker 1: Assuming this is true.

397
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:11,700
Speaker 1: He's got problems that needs help, but the entire family is in on the whole family needs.

398
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:20,248
Speaker 0: Oh, all I'm gonna say is that You're if you read this like usually when you read these stories the swerve is like oh wow Your husband's an incel.

399
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,119
Speaker 0: or like yeah, your wife is cheating on you.

400
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,900
Speaker 0: This one swerves in a direction that I did not anticipate.

401
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so weird and so specific that it's it's like it would be a very creative person who made this up.

402
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,083
Speaker 0: Yeah like I'd like.

403
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:39,940
Speaker 0: I feel like if someone made this up they need to make a choose your own adventure video game because they would Come up with like the best adventure book ever.

404
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,466
Speaker 1: Yeah with their creative mind.

405
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:46,543
Speaker 0: in the meta moment the geek nights book club book is apparently still pages of pain By Troy.

406
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,191
Speaker 1: it is the first book ever.

407
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:52,439
Speaker 1: Well the first novel ever which is the tale of Genji.

408
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,315
Speaker 0: so let's get right into it.

409
00:25:55,436 --> 00:26:03,171
Speaker 0: because Usually as you know, we do a YouTube show on Scott's YouTube channel Which you subscribe to called judge anime by its cover.

410
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,419
Speaker 1: We used to do it in anime Boston as a panel.

411
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:13,531
Speaker 0: Yep One year we were like, let's review all the anime that's coming out based on a screenshot And it was really fucking funny and really fun to do.

412
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:16,000
Speaker 0: and we're like, we're really accurate.

413
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's I'm not gonna say we're 100% accurate.

414
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,343
Speaker 1: we get stuff wrong But we're still.

415
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:23,914
Speaker 1: the thing is people, you know who say oh, we're super dumb.

416
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:24,576
Speaker 1: It's first of all.

417
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:26,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, we admit we're super dumb We don't know stuff.

418
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:33,490
Speaker 1: and be you know, it's like yeah, we got something super wrong, but percentage-wise We're getting mostly hits.

419
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,073
Speaker 1: It's like yeah.

420
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:38,360
Speaker 1: Look I got ten bull's-eyes You know two in the red and like one missed the target.

421
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,693
Speaker 1: It's like really you're gonna say that I suck cuz you know.

422
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,296
Speaker 1: to mr.

423
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:41,840
Speaker 1: Target three.

424
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:51,020
Speaker 0: So normally we do temples as we do this with high production value is not as a podcast But just as a YouTube thing, but we've had a lot of travel and we've been busy So we did not have time to do that, right?

425
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,650
Speaker 1: Well, I mean as we speak the summer season of anime is happening.

426
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:01,411
Speaker 1: episodes twos and threes of different shows are coming out Like within a few days I have avoided or watching.

427
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:05,652
Speaker 1: so we're already late even though we haven't watched any anime Some of these shows.

428
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:07,276
Speaker 0: so we could do this and we haven't done it.

429
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:09,380
Speaker 1: We didn't have any other show idea for tonight.

430
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:12,534
Speaker 1: I didn't have any video stuff set up in my house.

431
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:16,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, the weather is You know, the AQI is not so good.

432
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, the air quality is pretty bad today in New York, right?

433
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:24,880
Speaker 1: So yeah a variety of circumstances like alright, let's be lazy bums.

434
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,599
Speaker 1: We are no reason to deny that we are lazy bums.

435
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:35,740
Speaker 1: We will make one episode the some, you know The summer episode of this show just as a geek nights episode and not make a video.

436
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,280
Speaker 0: So what I will say if you like this go subscribe to Scott's YouTube channel because we've been doing this on his channel for a while.

437
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:51,550
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess our policy is like whoever edits the video posted on their channel because we don't have the geek nights YouTube channel You can give them to me to post on mine cuz mine has a lot more followers.

438
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever mine makes my makes money.

439
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:59,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually my youtube channel covers the Libsyn bills now like completely, okay, that's actually.

440
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:00,660
Speaker 0: I was surprised by that.

441
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,059
Speaker 0: I looked I didn't notice for a while that it's been making money.

442
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:07,860
Speaker 0: Right, but I know the listener is smart because that money is almost entirely YouTube, right?

443
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,879
Speaker 0: Well not read anymore YouTube people who pay for YouTube.

444
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:17,212
Speaker 0: YouTube gives us money because they watched our videos because anyone who's not paying for YouTube I assume is blocking ads.

445
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:22,059
Speaker 0: if you're not blocking ads block ads like ad block works on YouTube guys.

446
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,126
Speaker 0: So, let's get right into it.

447
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,811
Speaker 0: Scott can't really see this.

448
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:28,898
Speaker 1: unless I got my own I got my head.

449
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,701
Speaker 0: so Dr.

450
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:33,969
Speaker 0: Stone One day I'm already feeling this.

451
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:34,752
Speaker 0: It looks good.

452
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:38,972
Speaker 1: You build his confesses to a girl He loves and the sky is filled with a strange light.

453
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:40,740
Speaker 1: Everyone's touched by the light is turned to stone.

454
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,009
Speaker 0: Oh kind of like the everyone's trapped to stone.

455
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:49,640
Speaker 1: He breaks out and he explores a crazy world And he finds some other people who were freed from stone, but not everyone.

456
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,333
Speaker 1: So basically it's like what if everyone was turned to stone.

457
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,320
Speaker 1: it's like that old sci-fi on the whole planet.

458
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:15,772
Speaker 1: But then some people were slowly released over time and then the main character gets released and he's not necessarily the first or only to Be released but you then explore the world of what happened And when everyone was turned to stone for an unknown amount of time and then unstoned Through the eyes of that character great concept definitely unique.

459
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:20,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, the art looks like interesting at least Some kind.

460
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:31,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, this reminds me There's that old sci-fi movie where the comet goes over and anyone who looked at the comic is permanently or comet is permanently blinded the Next day and then just like the world disintegrates.

461
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:35,860
Speaker 0: Mmm This is definitely worth a one episode watch.

462
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:43,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is one of those Concept ones but the concept is I think way more unique and way better than a lot of the other concept ones.

463
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:50,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we just talked about Bocorano, which is great because this is like a no concept is a lot less Unique and interesting than this one.

464
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, this one.

465
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,077
Speaker 0: I definitely want to watch.

466
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,906
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Dungeon, I'm getting a.

467
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:59,636
Speaker 1: my guess is that it will be pretty close to like the abyss show.

468
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:00,940
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, which I really liked.

469
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:02,624
Speaker 0: Dungeon knee day.

470
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,268
Speaker 0: I will mote a metal.

471
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,855
Speaker 1: No, that's all you're gonna pronounce all these now.

472
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't you know day?

473
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,024
Speaker 0: I will mote a metal.

474
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,953
Speaker 0: No, wah matcha got a root out.

475
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:16,791
Speaker 1: Okay - Okay - sequel to another dungeon.

476
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:23,880
Speaker 0: second season of a show We didn't watch that has vague fantasy like Goku do kind of not Goku more like Sarah more serious than Goku?

477
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,371
Speaker 0: No, maybe it just looks like serious people.

478
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,200
Speaker 1: No one listening to this knows what Goku do is.

479
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said I feel like people listening to this are the only people who know what Goku do is.

480
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:36,628
Speaker 0: Okay Uh, I see a girl with fox ears.

481
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:42,440
Speaker 0: I see generic the most generic possible characters This shows.

482
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:50,715
Speaker 0: This show is probably as Generic and fantasy and self-insert as Utawarerumono.

483
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:51,378
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

484
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,000
Speaker 0: Remember that show?

485
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:59,313
Speaker 1: just know the English translation is Something I have heard of which is is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

486
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:00,075
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what.

487
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:00,838
Speaker 1: that's what it is.

488
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,046
Speaker 0: It's probably genero comedy.

489
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:03,768
Speaker 1: You've never heard of it.

490
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:04,992

Speaker 1: It's uh, yeah No one the reason.

493
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,980
Speaker 1: I've heard of it and then have not bothered to investigate any further beyond the title.

494
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,251
Speaker 0: No one talked much about season one in our circle.

495
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,174
Speaker 0: So I assume season two.

496
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,760

497
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,946

Speaker 1: This looks like firemen.

502
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,568
Speaker 1: They're not actually so.

503
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:41,886
Speaker 0: if you read that the text in year 198 of the solar era in Tokyo special fire great brigades are fighting spontaneous human cabal I'm less interested in this now.

504
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:48,209

517
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:33,700

525
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,400

533
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,939

Speaker 0: It could be a harem one girls getting a little chubby and she decides to join a gym tries to find a casual gym meet someone else who is a weightlifter and It's like a romantic seems like an excuse to draw lots of athletic girls with boobs.

Speaker 1: It just has this sort of dark steampunk Victorian ish aesthetic going on.

577
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like this show is gonna have the thing where aesthetically it looks a little bit like La.

578
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:26,880
Speaker 0: I don't like Dura Dura kind of characters, but I feel like it's gonna be super generic and Feel like it's going somewhere and feel like it's the second time rem said generic.

579
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,870
Speaker 0: I feel like it's not gonna go anywhere though.

580
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:30,840
Speaker 1: put a counter on this on the non screen.

581
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,943

Speaker 0: This show is going nowhere.

584
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,017
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no interesting mystery.

585
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:47,890
Speaker 0: All right I Karakai juzu no taka guys on to Takagi-san to the second season of tatagi-san.

586
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:49,795
Speaker 1: I didn't see the first season.

587
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:50,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, and do we?

588
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:50,838
Speaker 1: I don't.

589
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:51,700
Speaker 1: it's so weird.

590
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,407
Speaker 1: We're seeing these second seasons of things.

591
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:59,169
Speaker 1: even though we've been judging anime for like over a year now I don't remember ever judging the first season of this.

592
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,338
Speaker 0: Maybe we have and I just forgot maybe they were so generic No one talked about them.

593
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know but it had.

594
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,457
Speaker 1: it would have been on the any chart if they were just airing right.

595
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:15,218
Speaker 1: so that first season Was either so long ago or so mad that we just brought breezed over it without even thinking about it.

596
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:17,148
Speaker 0: Yep I feel like that happens a lot.

597
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,420
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's this comedy slice-of-life romance.

598
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,797
Speaker 1: It's just like a cute little show with you know, kids middle school ish romance.

599
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:25,539
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know.

600
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,272
Speaker 0: All right, here we go kind of town.

601
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,546
Speaker 0: Oh, astra Space travel.

602
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:30,734
Speaker 1: I think it's Astra cuz.

603
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:31,318
Speaker 1: it's like space.

604
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:36,070
Speaker 0: Yeah Commercially viable high school students embark to planet camp.

605
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:42,224
Speaker 0: an unforeseen sentient light sphere warps them to outer space Stranding them.

606
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:45,920
Speaker 1: This is the second show where a whole class of kids has been warped to another place.

607
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,670
Speaker 0: Is that is that the theme for this summer?

608
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,694
Speaker 1: have to work together?

609
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,079
Speaker 0: This does not look like.

610
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,959
Speaker 0: however Here's the big difference in space.

611
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:59,198
Speaker 0: This one does not appear to have the generic shitty self-insert character from a light novel.

612
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,000
Speaker 1: not in the description.

613
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:04,080
Speaker 0: This looks like it has the ensemble cast of co-equal main characters.

614
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:11,895
Speaker 1: One person with the spiky hairdo does drawn much larger than the other characters Yeah, but I feel like he will be a character as opposed to a self-insert.

615
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:15,712
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I think this show could be good.

616
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:20,930
Speaker 1: if the mystery of how they were Teleported is like a good terrible secret of literally space.

617
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,314
Speaker 0: There's a it edges into.

618
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:23,297
Speaker 0: they were 11 territory.

619
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:24,140
Speaker 0: They find an old.

620
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:26,420
Speaker 1: It's a group of kids in space.

621
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,560
Speaker 0: Yes They they find an old unmanned spaceship and they must stay strong and manage their limited resources and remain united in the darkness of space.

622
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:35,884
Speaker 1: Maybe it is.

623
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:36,847
Speaker 1: they were 11.

624
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,474
Speaker 0: I feel like this could be like only as they were nine.

625
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:45,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Am much more interested in watching this than the other show.

626
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:47,160
Speaker 0: That is a class of people sent somewhere.

627
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:55,634
Speaker 1: I mean, I think they just because Because it doesn't have the self-insert light novel You don't know it just not in the description but the just the space theme.

628
00:38:55,674 --> 00:39:06,149
Speaker 1: I think it gives it that extra boost Yeah, versus the teleported to another fantasy world where there are stats on the people Speaking of stats.

629
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,020
Speaker 0: isekai cheat magician.

630
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:19,086
Speaker 0: It's even in the title centers around a guy and a girl like a transported to a fantasy world in that the guy is a normal person who has higher than Average reflect.

631
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, not even to talk about this.

632
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,800
Speaker 1: Oh, so you get transferred to a fantasy world where you're a badass, which is basically what Superman is.

633
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,147
Speaker 1: It's like I'm creeped on.

634
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:33,751
Speaker 1: he's a normal bro, but he comes to earth and he's a bad In the title, there's no way this is good.

635
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,273
Speaker 0: It's got.

636
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,158
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not even gonna talk about it.

637
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:41,340
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Toharu kagaku no accelerator The espers, okay.

638
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:42,884
Speaker 0: No, this is bad too.

639
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:48,300
Speaker 0: the espers of Academy City are classified into six levels where level zero lacks power.

640
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:52,500
Speaker 0: Well level five possesses an overwhelming amount of isekai crap.

641
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,080
Speaker 1: It's so weird how like these RPG elements started out as stats on like a war game D&D character sheet.

642
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:06,393
Speaker 1: Then they edge their way into video games which lacked all the agency of the player in storytelling But still had the combat of sort of.

643
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:07,620
Speaker 0: but no the nerd actually.

644
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:14,480
Speaker 1: But now they've even taken that away and they're bringing the RPGs with stats, right?

645
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,300
Speaker 1: I mean, they've been in anime for a while now, but it's like it feels like it's getting even worse.

646
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,493
Speaker 0: Imagine imagine an anime based on Final Fantasy.

647
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:24,220
Speaker 1: It's like you're a Final Fantasy character.

648
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,112
Speaker 1: You don't know that your strength is 47, right?

649
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,312
Speaker 0: But here Dragon Ball Z it was a joke right in Dragon Ball Z.

650
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:37,253
Speaker 1: They joked like oh your power levels are 9,000. but here it's like nope, literally not a joke.

651
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:38,336
Speaker 1: Your power level is 9,000.

652
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,400
Speaker 0: You know what this is?

653
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,804
Speaker 0: It's a Final Fantasy.

654
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:45,037
Speaker 0: 6 was turned into an anime and the anime was literally just every fucking fight.

655
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:50,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it Yeah, and then like looking at the character screens and like oh my his strength is too higher.

656
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
Speaker 0: now We can cast white and it'll do a little more damage.

657
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:04,480
Speaker 1: Whoo, at least anime like get baggers with abstracted away and like oh we're going we've made it to the next level of the spooky Tower As opposed to like literal god damn it Astro boy.

658
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,441
Speaker 1: He leveled up mid, you know, now he has X thousand horsepower, but it wasn't like, you know That was.

659
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,705
Speaker 1: that's the thing that makes sense here.

660
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:12,110
Speaker 1: It's literally like aha.

661
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,993
Speaker 1: Your stats are up.

662
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:15,100
Speaker 0: All right, that's a really long title.

663
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:17,328
Speaker 0: Uchi no kono.

664
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,193
Speaker 0: Tame nara.

665
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,988
Speaker 0: They are a wah moshikashi Tara.

666
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:30,670
Speaker 1: Wow, no Tausaru Kamo shit and I in English it translates to if it's for my daughter I'd even defeat a demon lord.

667
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:37,160
Speaker 0: I'm already not Super into this because I see a lot of really young girl characters.

668
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,128
Speaker 1: So a dude goes into the forest.

669
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:47,880
Speaker 1: He comes across a devil girl who's not doing too Well, he's gonna leave her there to die, but nope takes her home become her adopted father.

670
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:49,778
Speaker 1: She's really cute.

671
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:53,100
Speaker 1: It seems kind of like a moe situation.

672
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, I worry this is gonna be scary moe and I worry that if it's based on a manga It's okay.

673
00:41:59,243 --> 00:42:00,949
Speaker 1: I brought a demon girl home.

674
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:03,437
Speaker 1: I didn't bring an actual little human girl.

675
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:03,718
Speaker 1: Huh?

676
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:07,069
Speaker 0: My worry Thousand years old.

677
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:10,620
Speaker 0: I guess my worry is that this might be a bunny drop situation.

678
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:12,571
Speaker 1: It's bunny needs demon drop.

679
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,079
Speaker 1: even drop demon drop.

680
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,617
Speaker 0: Alright, oh, I'm just gonna read the English names of these.

681
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:22,431
Speaker 0: from now on No maidens in your savage season.

682
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:23,234
Speaker 1: I think that one.

683
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:26,984
Speaker 1: you should read the Japanese name Arabaru he said soon.

684
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:27,807
Speaker 0: Oh, oh tomorrow.

685
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,672

Speaker 0: Okay, the girls in a high school literature club Do an icebreaker?

687
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,470
Speaker 0: One thing you want to do before you die.

688
00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:38,715
Speaker 0: one of them says sex.

689
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:44,719
Speaker 0: I think it's just a Slice-of-life funny like it's just a story about girls and sex.

690
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,786
Speaker 1: Oh, is this like it depends?

691
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:47,930
Speaker 1: isn't no automata show.

692
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,180
Speaker 1: Maybe it seems like it might be romance slice-of-life drama.

693
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,532
Speaker 0: I think it's a serious.

694
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:54,804
Speaker 1: These are girls Based on a manga.

695
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, this could possibly be good.

696
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like this is not, you know a perverted situation.

697
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,062
Speaker 1: This is like an honest, you know legit, you know Situation.

698
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, this could be an earnest show about sexuality and growing up.

699
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:09,896
Speaker 1: Mmm.

700
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,240
Speaker 0: I don't see a lot of warning signs.

701
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good deal.

702
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:12,606
Speaker 1: All right.

703
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:15,800
Speaker 1: No one's drawn in a perverted way or is highly exposed.

704
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,573
Speaker 1: I don't even see a male character here.

705
00:43:17,613 --> 00:43:21,852
Speaker 1: I see ladies It doesn't say the word Yuri on it.

706
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:28,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that that would be bad But you know the genre stuff people saying it's a coming-of-age female protagonist school club like.

707
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:28,956
Speaker 1: yeah.

708
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:29,919
Speaker 1: Mmm.

709
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:32,583
Speaker 0: Wow I'm a good job anime.

Speaker 0: All right.

Speaker 0: - do you love your mom and her?

715
00:43:41,073 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 0: to it multi-target attacks?

716
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,699
Speaker 1: What the what would you do if you got transported into a video game?

717
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:52,600
Speaker 0: We know in one hand every video game I play the mom that that is a fantasy world.

718
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,560
Speaker 0: The moms are the only good characters and you can't date them or really interact with that, right?

719
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:05,690
Speaker 1: So this does have the leg up and that the mom is gonna be there like all the time because that's the point of the Yet another RPG stat show yet another.

720
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:09,020
Speaker 1: well, my life is actually literally a video game now.

721
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,811

Speaker 0: Mm-hmm hard you and your mom is a new sailing overpowered dual wielding multi-target specialist.

724
00:44:17,316 --> 00:44:25,953
Speaker 0: So on one hand an Anime in a fantasy world where like you're trying to be an adventurer But your mom is way stronger than you and follows.

725
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:29,768
Speaker 0: you could be great But I don't think this is gonna be that.

726
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,280
Speaker 0: I think this is gonna be another stat based garbage.

727
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,896
Speaker 1: It's mostly just gonna be like silly and try, you know pandery and that sort of thing.

728
00:44:37,957 --> 00:44:43,499
Speaker 0: Yep All right, the hentai something already not interested in this.

730
00:44:49,284 --> 00:44:52,438

731
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:54,786
Speaker 0: She found a love letter.

732
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:57,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, no pain makes a girl the pervert.

733
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,647

Speaker 0: The show is gonna be proper noun II and super serious.

755
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,008
Speaker 0: Probably not that good.

756
00:46:13,028 --> 00:46:15,681

Speaker 1: All right.

759
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:29,851
Speaker 1: So this one looks interesting but also not right.

760
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,177
Speaker 1: so you have it says cop craft.

761
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:35,083
Speaker 0: that art looks Different.

762
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:43,053
Speaker 1: so what I'm getting the vibe here a buddy police action series follows a detective and The alternate world night, right?

763
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:51,080
Speaker 1: So there's like a Girl wearing it, you know, not not the most boob armor I've seen but still not very protective armor.

764
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,817
Speaker 0: It's panty boob armor, but it's like Naga from slayers level as opposed to like really perverted.

765
00:46:56,837 --> 00:47:00,360
Speaker 1: It's not an armored bikini It's armored one-piece bathing suit.

766
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,560
Speaker 1: But anyway, so you have a serious detective like imagine like guy and it's like guy.

767
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,073
Speaker 1: Who's the guy the human and goes in the shell?

768
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,047
Speaker 0: Oh God, why do I forget his name?

769
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:11,429
Speaker 0: I don't know.

770
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,535
Speaker 1: I forgot his name right now.

771
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:15,408
Speaker 0: Yeah Why did I forget his name?

772
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:23,900
Speaker 1: I forgot right but like imagine a Serious detective who's you know, but the the buddy partner Togusa Togusa, right?

773
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,074
Speaker 1: I actually was thinking that but I'm like, no, that's not right.

774
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:27,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was same thing.

775
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:41,189
Speaker 1: I was like Togusa but his buddy cop isn't also the serious major It's a magic girl from a buddy cop is a magical girl wearing, you know Slightly not great armor where the sword.

776
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:46,007
Speaker 1: so it's like crossing the two genres in a way But seems like she's also serious.

777
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:49,320
Speaker 1: Like she's actually trying to solve whatever demon problem.

778
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:53,955
Speaker 0: Couple buddy cop except it's a fancy girl and a normal guy with a gun.

779
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:54,839
Speaker 1: You know what?

780
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,847

Speaker 1: Oh, it's an idol show.

887
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:55,853
Speaker 0: Okay, uh Machikado mazuko 15 year old girl awakens with demonic power.

888
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:56,997
Speaker 0: Is it a magical?

889
00:52:57,037 --> 00:52:57,960
Speaker 0: It's a magical girl show.

890
00:52:58,281 --> 00:52:59,726
Speaker 1: It says comedy fantasy.

891
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:00,689
Speaker 1: So it's like.

892
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:06,083
Speaker 1: I guess, you know, maybe it has the kind of feel of Risky safety.

893
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:09,915
Speaker 0: Well, I could see that but it looks more like straight magical girl.

894
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:13,187
Speaker 1: Hmm So she has a curse.

895
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:19,579
Speaker 1: the curse is you have to live on 40,000 yen a month 365 US dollars a month.

896
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:21,426
Speaker 1: You gotta live poor.

897
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:23,693
Speaker 1: you got you can live but you live somewhere cheap.

898
00:53:23,974 --> 00:53:25,800
Speaker 0: move upstate and away from the throughway.

899
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,169
Speaker 0: You could live pretty well on 365 dollars a month.

900
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,173
Speaker 1: All right, the next one.

901
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,879
Speaker 1: actually that looks like it has something going on.

902
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:34,347
Speaker 1: The anime will have its no bunga.

903
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,354
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but no banaga.

904
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:46,459
Speaker 1: So basically it's a dramatic sort of crazy interpretation of the story of Oda Nobunaga and his life as an early teen.

905
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:55,469
Speaker 1: So basically taking history and then making it really sort of outrageous and anime Turning him into a moe girl or anything.

906
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:02,976
Speaker 0: No, nothing like that, you know, I Don't feel like I need to give this a try because if I'm gonna give a show like that a try I'm gonna watch Vinland saga first.

907
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:09,075
Speaker 1: Try nights, it looks like a sports show about a high school rugby team.

908
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:10,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it probably takes itself seriously.

909
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,260
Speaker 0: It's probably really hyper accurate to the rules of rugby.

910
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,454
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm feel like it's me about the rugby, right?

911
00:54:16,515 --> 00:54:19,246
Speaker 1: Yeah is a cute Super young idol.

912
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:25,435
Speaker 1: girl show like elementary school level idols Re-stage dream days Pony Canyon.

913
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:26,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not gonna be for it It's just.

914
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:27,383
Speaker 0: it's for kids.

915
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:32,415
Speaker 1: and this star move 3 which looks like boys idols again third season of that.

916
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:35,304
Speaker 1: and then there's Wari show our Shota Butsu.

917
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:40,120
Speaker 1: I go link I which translates to looks like a funny weird short anime.

918
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,979
Speaker 0: Yeah Girls come from another planet to save mistreated animals on earth.

919
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:49,312
Speaker 0: Black cat squirrel and rabbit all make their way to earth.

920
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,000
Speaker 1: It looks just like a little cutie kids show like yeah.

921
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:58,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think this is in the genre of yay Notably this season there were no card games.

922
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:01,900
Speaker 1: There were no beyblades cuz it's all.

923
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:09,097
Speaker 0: It's all generic dudes with no lives getting transported into RPG worlds.

924
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:13,960
Speaker 0: pretty much Don't watch shows that are generic dudes getting transported in RPG worlds.

925
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:14,943
Speaker 1: No Do not.

926
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:21,580
Speaker 0: if you really feel like you should go watch One episode of hack sign and pretend that's the entire show and it was just a movie, right?

927
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:33,070
Speaker 1: So, yeah that we have now judged all the TV anime from the summer season of 2019 according to the amazing website Annie chart net a n ich a RT net.

928
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:35,237
Speaker 1: that's where we figure out what animes are coming out.

929
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:38,500
Speaker 1: We look at the Scant information on that site.

930
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:45,686
Speaker 1: we judge the anime based on what that site says and no other information because we don't know anything else because we're dumb dumbs and We didn't bother research.

931
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:46,914
Speaker 0: We tell us if we're right.

932
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:47,960
Speaker 0: tell us if we're wrong.

933
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:49,949

936
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:05,714
Speaker 1: Who knows?

937
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:08,619
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see if we made how lazy we are.

938
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:18,039
Speaker 1: We've actually been doing this for like a surprising amount of time now, even though we're frequently a few weeks late We do manage to somehow never not do it.

939
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:23,640
Speaker 1: We've been doing it for like over a years and I guess it'll continue even no matter how people care or not.

940
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:37,231
Speaker 0: Whatever, you know if only anime and my NYC were earlier or later We could start going there and doing it as a like an event at a kind of anime NYC like mid-november Exactly when like November 15th through 17th.

941
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,595

00:56:43,216 --> 00:56:51,383
Speaker 1: Like I always want to go I just I'm always a little bit of stuff like VIP tickets I'm not a fan of but it does seem to be a high-quality Anime con.

947
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:55,498
Speaker 1: the true successor to New York Festival is the packs of anime cons.

948
