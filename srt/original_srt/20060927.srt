1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,537
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday September 27th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:18,838
Speaker 1: We review Let's do this.

3
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:31,340
Speaker 0: So I got to say I had a slightly Disappointing experience a little while ago today when I decided out of the blue because I haven't played Mario Kart for the DS in Quite some time really I mean the game kind of played itself out.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,647
Speaker 0: I just didn't play it for a while.

5
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:39,119
Speaker 0: So I decided I wanted to get on a Nintendo You know Wi-Fi network and own some punk-ass bitches.

6
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:42,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't used that Wi-Fi a lot lately.

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:49,767
Speaker 1: You know a lot of games that should have used it didn't use it and a lot of games Just haven't come out that use Wi-Fi.

8
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:50,711
Speaker 1: that are good games.

9
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:53,100
Speaker 1: I mean, I think we're just gonna have to wait for the Pokemon.

10
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:55,529
Speaker 1: That's when it's really gonna get used constantly.

11
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,844
Speaker 0: Well, I got sick of Metroid pretty quick and then this Mario Kart.

12
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,296
Speaker 0: All right, Mario Kart is probably my favorite game on the DS.

13
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:08,628
Speaker 0: still other than you know Advance Wars DS and Castlevania DS Those other better DS games.

14
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem actually I really like the game.

15
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:11,459
Speaker 0: the problem is game.

16
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:16,054
Speaker 0: I went online and for the life of me, I couldn't start a game.

17
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,080
Speaker 0: There was just no one playing.

18
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:22,295
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we've checked on the Nintendo website and there were about a hundred people playing.

19
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,744
Speaker 0: Yeah a hundred that's bad That's not enough.

20
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:32,816
Speaker 1: I know but the thing is if they had a better matchup system It should theoretically take a hundred people and make 25 games or people.

21
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:34,080
Speaker 0: you realize that what happens?

22
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,416
Speaker 0: It's not that there were a hundred people on at the same time.

23
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:37,060
Speaker 0: a hundred.

24
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:44,474
Speaker 0: It means that over the course of that hour a hundred people logged on Probably tried to play a game for like a minute or two and then gave up.

25
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:49,119
Speaker 0: because if I don't get a game Or two I just give up because obviously it's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:52,700
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird because I'm used to playing games online.

27
00:01:52,841 --> 00:02:03,979
Speaker 1: You know on Steam if even if you try to play a less popular game like ricochet there's a server with some people on it and the people can clump together when they have this sort of automatic system where the.

28
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:11,320
Speaker 0: I think the difference here is more that with those games the server People can come and go and it doesn't disrupt the game at all.

29
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,780
Speaker 0: You can't just come and go in a set of Mario Kart match.

30
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 1: I know I mean I can understand why they have their game matchup system this way.

31
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,496
Speaker 1: But now we're seeing.

32
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:28,835
Speaker 1: you know The true effect of that is that Wi-Fi play of a game dies out because people can't Get games set up even when there are a bunch of people playing.

33
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:33,140
Speaker 0: so granted I know a lot of people would still use it, but they'll use it with their friends.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,156
Speaker 0: You know on a weekend, which we keep saying we'll do we just never have the freaking time to do it.

35
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:37,698
Speaker 0: Yeah.

36
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,185
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, someday.

37
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,980
Speaker 0: I will own some punk ass geek nights bitches.

38
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,614
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, we got some news.

39
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:53,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so a Lot of people have been yelling about fan subs and digital anime sales and all that lately.

40
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,629
Speaker 0: Anime world order recently did a big thing.

41
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:58,340
Speaker 0: They were talking about, you know, how do you deal with the piracy problem?

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're responding to some listener email.

43
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,578
Speaker 1: that listener didn't know shit.

44
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:12,740
Speaker 0: Actually, we were gonna send them a feedback about that and then as we talked about what we would say We realized that we would have basically made an entire episode of geek night.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,039
Speaker 0: So we're gonna do a whole episode about anime distribution in the u.s Yeah, probably in some time in the future.

46
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:25,929
Speaker 1: But anyway ATV has put out a new Service called ATV universe.

47
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,940
Speaker 1: It's an unpackaged media download service.

48
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:33,560
Speaker 1: Basically what this means is you pay ATV money and they let you download anime.

49
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:35,879
Speaker 1: Now here's the details.

50
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:52,848
Speaker 1: They've got a whole bunch of series including Gilgamesh area 88 Princess Tutu that are $25 an episode and they've got a movie and an OAV that are available for $20 for the whole OAV or the whole movie.

51
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,031
Speaker 0: They've also got a free.

52
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:58,325
Speaker 0: you can get guy for the bio boosted shit fest For free.

53
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

54
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,679
Speaker 1: you can watch the guy for for free.

55
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,688
Speaker 1: The guy was not the worst anime ever.

56
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,420
Speaker 0: know that that title reserved solely for it's better than MD guys.

57
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:11,200
Speaker 0: I must say, you know MD guys provided a lot of entertainment.

58
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:16,055
Speaker 1: You know the guy for entertained me what back in the day the hell's wrong with.

59
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,220
Speaker 1: not now now it's crap.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,198
Speaker 1: But back in the day, I kind of like, you know, I hadn't seen too many shows with a guy wearing armor.

61
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:26,648
Speaker 1: So So guy wearing armor was enough in those days.

62
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:30,240
Speaker 0: nowadays not so much at least with MD guys to have a football uniform.

63
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,529
Speaker 0: This is just some are diver is actually a cool armor.

64
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bio boosted armor.

65
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:37,280
Speaker 1: How can you anyway?

66
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,766
Speaker 0: It's no match for a rust hurricane.

67
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,498
Speaker 1: yes now here's what I got to say about this particular service.

68
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,650
Speaker 1: number one It's dubs only it seems number two.

69
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,477
Speaker 1: It's only available in the US.

70
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:49,219
Speaker 1: So there's no.

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,839
Speaker 1: What's it called re-importation to Japan?

72
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,830
Speaker 1: You you're actually buying it.

73
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,680
Speaker 1: when you paying the five bucks you get it.

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,844
Speaker 1: It's not a rental like some other services are you know, like some of those unlimited music services But this DRM.

75
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:06,950
Speaker 0: they don't say what the DRM will be.

76
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,215
Speaker 1: they don't say the DRM is but this DRM.

77
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:10,679
Speaker 1: now, here's the thing.

78
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:17,070
Speaker 1: even with the DRM This is gonna fail because it's five bucks an episode.

79
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,919
Speaker 1: five bucks an episode means $20 for four episodes.

80
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 1: Guess what?

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,370
Speaker 1: No one buys DVDs for $20.

82
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,180
Speaker 1: Everyone buys their DVDs for less than that.

83
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,522
Speaker 1: No one's gonna pay for less than a DVD for $20.

84
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:32,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially when you get a DRM encumbered thing with no goodies and no physical media.

85
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean anime world order hit on a lot of this.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Speaker 0: So one we're not gonna play their promo just because I really don't like podcast promos in general.

87
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,712
Speaker 0: But you should go listen anime world or anime world order calm.

88
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:44,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, we like them.

89
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:56,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they were talking a lot about this and the one thing they hit on is the collector mentality Which in my opinion is very rapidly dying in terms of anime DVD collecting.

90
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need to do a whole episode on the collector mentality.

91
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:05,220
Speaker 0: But the thing is you can't ignore it and the fact that they're charging the same amount for something that gives you less.

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:15,560
Speaker 0: I mean to quote Lord of Pi who posted in the forums on animators network about this quote Five freaking dollars an episode and it's still dub only are you guys insane?

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if the D it's if they were charging $2 an episode 250 Then it would be cool because you're paying less.

94
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:30,600
Speaker 1: you're paying 10 bucks for you know Four episodes which is less than what a DVD costs.

95
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,136
Speaker 1: You're getting less than what a DVD offers and you're paying less.

96
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:39,939
Speaker 1: it makes sense You know, you're getting a DRM encumbered file with no subtitle track.

97
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:47,266
Speaker 1: But if you're getting less than what a DVD offers and paying more than what a DVD costs No one's gonna use this.

98
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,858
Speaker 1: who has half a brain except to watch the guy for free.

99
00:06:50,380 --> 00:07:02,460
Speaker 0: now I actually agree with one of the people who wrote or said or spoke or something into anime world order about What if there were a Napster like service where you had unlimited access to all the anime someone put out for a monthly fee.

100
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,383
Speaker 1: That'll be cool.

101
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:04,125
Speaker 0: download and watch.

102
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:23,115
Speaker 0: now Clarissa really poo-pooed it and while her critique of that idea was valid it was valid from her perspective as a fan and I would just like to note that Scott and I and I think there are a lot of anime fans like us We Netflix is the single primary reason we don't buy anime anymore.

103
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we do buy anime.

104
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,780
Speaker 1: What is a crazy deal when it's a really good show?

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,238
Speaker 0: We don't buy anime the way we used to that.

106
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:41,140
Speaker 0: There was a time when if I wasn't if I wanted to see a show I'd plunk down 2025 bucks to buy the first DVD to see if I liked it or if I wanted to watch a show.

107
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,171
Speaker 0: I'd wait until I saw those and that anime on sale and I'd buy the box set.

108
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,036
Speaker 0: now any show.

109
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,520
Speaker 0: that isn't crazy amazing.

110
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:49,868
Speaker 0: There's no way in hell.

111
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,472
Speaker 0: I would buy it.

112
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:51,760
Speaker 0: I just put it in the Netflix queue.

113
00:07:52,122 --> 00:08:01,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then if we watch something on Netflix and it's super awesome And we want to own it to watch it again rather than Netflixing it again Cuz that's just dumb to Netflix something twice, you know.

114
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,332
Speaker 1: What we'll do is we'll put it will write the name down and then a few years later at a convention when we see the slim Case box for super cheap.

115
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,782
Speaker 1: We'll pick it up Now.

116
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:19,937
Speaker 1: if there was a way to get it for super cheap online and download the whole thing You know with subtitles and everything and no DRM's or even maybe with DRM's.

117
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:25,540
Speaker 1: probably not though We would do it but not if you're gonna charge more than the DVD.

118
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:29,094
Speaker 1: I mean, I got all of Zeta Gundam for $40.

119
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:33,931
Speaker 1: that ran it 50 episodes less than a dollar an episode.

120
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,500
Speaker 1: You can't charge five dollars an episode.

121
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:46,140
Speaker 0: I don't like having all that anime around the subscription service would be great because then I want my anime and I say I want To watch, you know Ghost in the Shell standalone complex again.

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,583
Speaker 0: So I log on and I just start watching it cuz I can watch as much anime as I want from the service for a Monthly fee.

123
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,045
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,717
Speaker 0: And if I want to show it to someone else, I'll download it again.

125
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:55,300
Speaker 0: We'll watch it.

126
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:17,690
Speaker 0: We'll have a good old time but I don't want to have to buy and keep those physical DVDs around mostly because There was a point in my life at which I moved from Rochester, New York to Beacon, New York And after driving a 24-foot semi truck down a twisty mountain road for five and a half hours I don't want to own stuff anymore.

127
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,160
Speaker 1: No, I really don't want to own stuff either.

128
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:30,531
Speaker 1: But you know they just make the bit way people do business just makes it practical to buy and own stuff and Impractical to do things the way I'd like.

129
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:35,740
Speaker 1: and until that changes I really have no choice if I want to do certain things.

130
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:41,690
Speaker 0: So I think it was also Daryl on AWO to keep pimping them where he said something to the effect of Maybe it was general.

131
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:52,529
Speaker 0: I don't remember who said it That the industry should really look at how much a show that they sell for like some stupid stupid price Sells versus a show for the normal price.

132
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:02,271
Speaker 0: because I have a feeling that whenever they discount a show You know to like 30 bucks for the box set they probably sell crazy crazy numbers of shows that otherwise wouldn't sell.

133
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,665
Speaker 0: because I'll buy almost any show if it's 30 bucks for The whole thing.

134
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:08,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, just about any show.

135
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,140
Speaker 0: It has to be a pretty bad show for me to not shell out 30 bucks for the box set.

136
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:13,222
Speaker 1: I know.

137
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:17,839
Speaker 1: I think what really the anime companies need to do is they should bring over the show.

138
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,489
Speaker 0: Wait, wait American anime company American one.

139
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,280
Speaker 1: Well, the Japanese ones have a lot of things they're doing wrong.

140
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:31,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if the American companies what you should do is you have you already have licensed a bunch of anime.

141
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:38,640
Speaker 1: a Lot of this anime is either no longer available on DVD, you know, it's hard to find on DVD is a long-lost show.

142
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,394
Speaker 1: I mean the shows that you were putting out on DVD in the 90s.

143
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:42,419
Speaker 1: Where are they now?

144
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:45,589
Speaker 1: The only shows that are really selling you're the hot new shows.

145
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:48,920
Speaker 1: the Naruto's the bleaches the Inuyasha is all that trick.

146
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:00,280
Speaker 1: So take all those old shows that you know The DVDs are already made and done with and put those all of them online for download at a cheap price.

147
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:06,785
Speaker 1: It's pretty much a pure profit at this point because you still have the licenses for those shows But you're not doing anything with them.

148
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:10,817
Speaker 1: You should have everything you own making money for you all the time.

149
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:11,860
Speaker 0: or how's this?

150
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:18,092
Speaker 0: I thought about this just now and I've seen people do half-assed attempts at this But I've never really seen it on the scale.

151
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,039
Speaker 0: that would make them a lot of money.

152
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:29,680
Speaker 0: They the companies in the US should as long as the licenses didn't expire anything like say uh, eska flown a right Eska flown a was one of the top shows when it was coming out.

153
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,230
Speaker 0: It was crazy popular and a lot of people have forgotten about it.

154
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:35,597
Speaker 0: What if they took eska flown a?

155
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,664
Speaker 0: they made You know the thin pack.

156
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,014
Speaker 0: not even a collector said just a cheap thin pack.

157
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:46,655
Speaker 0: They've mass produced it again They put it all out over the market and they coupled it with a huge advertising campaign about.

158
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,999
Speaker 0: this is classic awesome freaking anime.

159
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,439
Speaker 1: You don't even need to do that.

160
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:58,418
Speaker 1: just when you go to make a limited run bring it to a convey bring it to all the conventions and sell it.

161
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:06,026
Speaker 1: and You know, you're really at because you've already paid for the license and you've already made the profit on the show long ago You just.

162
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,438
Speaker 1: the only cost is the printing and the press.

163
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,144
Speaker 1: You know of the boxes and and the DVDs and the cases and all that jazz and the mastering of the DVDs You know.

164
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,120
Speaker 1: and you could just use the old DVDs, whatever.

165
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:23,160
Speaker 1: Just print up a whole mess of them and sell them at some stupid price like 50 bucks for a whole show.

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,957
Speaker 1: We're 40 bucks for a whole show and you'll rake it in.

167
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:37,705
Speaker 1: I mean if that guy's selling anime for five bucks a DVD is profiting Then you got to be profiting if you're selling them at like ten bucks a DVD plus like in the case of an old Good classic like escaflowne.

168
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,290
Speaker 0: You've already paid for the license.

169
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:49,417
Speaker 0: You've already paid for all the work except reprinting it yeah, and That this I'm sure shows like that would sell especially because you know There are a lot of people who get into anime on.

170
00:12:49,457 --> 00:13:01,955
Speaker 0: you know The Inuyasha and whatever crap is on right now Because it seems like the stuff that's popular right now in America among new anime fans is kind of crap though I'm definitely gonna temper that with the fact that I liked a lot of crap.

171
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:05,028
Speaker 0: when I first got into anime I liked a lot of crap.

172
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,354
Speaker 1: I just said I like the Guyver.

173
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Can't be friends with you anymore.

174
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:10,952
Speaker 0: All right, that's just.

175
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:12,440
Speaker 1: I think we should move on to another news.

176
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, my news really isn't related to anime at all.

177
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:15,570
Speaker 0: I'll just skip it.

178
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:17,937
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I want to keep talking about this.

179
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,256
Speaker 0: Okay But really I mean a show like that.

180
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,653
Speaker 0: It'd be really easy to make it popular again.

181
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:36,879
Speaker 0: and all these people who you know They're just on the verge of transitioning from watching the crap to watching the good stuff You know in my mind at least in our, you know, cultured minds the quote unquote good stuff.

182
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:47,617
Speaker 0: And if there were like signature series classic series gold series Like here's the old anime that was crazy awesome and popular in the 90s.

183
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:55,543
Speaker 0: This is the stuff that the people who are two are older than you watching anime watched back when they were your age Mm-hmm.

184
00:13:55,884 --> 00:14:02,265
Speaker 0: I think some sort of ad campaign like that definitely stressing that this is the real stuff This is the good stuff.

185
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:06,919
Speaker 0: All that other stuff just got you to this point where you can see this stuff.

186
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really think they could make a lot of money and I wish I was in charge of.

187
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:20,860
Speaker 1: maybe I should start an anime Company, you'd have to collect all the licenses that the current anime companies aren't using and then try to sell them.

188
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:25,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I wonder if I could just get a job with some anime company and then convince them to do this.

189
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,187
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm pretty sure it would work.

190
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:29,572
Speaker 0: I'm almost certain.

191
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:32,220
Speaker 0: I would bet a significant amount of money on it.

192
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,190
Speaker 0: Of course, I don't have any money to bet.

193
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:37,906
Speaker 0: So yeah, yeah, I'll put all the money I've got my pockets right now toward this.

194
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:48,029
Speaker 0: I will do things of the day.

195
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,970
Speaker 1: How is this a great thing of the day?

196
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,890
Speaker 1: Even though it is not related in any way to anime manga or comics not at all.

197
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,826
Speaker 0: However, I will say that I have watched this entire thing twice.

198
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,790
Speaker 1: Oh my god I watched it once and I was glad when I found out I didn't have to watch it again.

199
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:16,069
Speaker 0: I only watched it again to make sure that I didn't miss anything because I will never need to watch anything like this At least for another five years while the idiots of the world work diligently to create enough material to make part two.

200
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:30,437
Speaker 1: Yes, well, I'm sure you may or may not know it is one of my favorite hobbies to peruse YouTube and Google video in search of what is known as Owned videos.

201
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:36,490
Speaker 0: now this came out of a lot Well, but this you might get argued that this came out of like the style projects.

202
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:45,416
Speaker 0: Yeah originally, but to skip a whole internet history lesson this came out of these photoshops which weren't really photoshops.

203
00:15:45,817 --> 00:16:02,064
Speaker 0: if you found a picture of someone getting in the vernacular owned as in Getting their full comeuppance in some way or in other way in some way getting totally hosed by something Photoshopping the word owned onto the picture and putting it on Fark.

204
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:11,790
Speaker 1: Yep now go again to Videos on the internet that are funny and YouTube has really helped this along and so is Google video.

205
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:30,590
Speaker 1: But prior to that, you know There were still websites like College Humor and others where there would be videos and on peer-to-peer networks there would be videos win a max and such and These videos would be very short one to two minute videos that usually involve someone getting hurt such as puddle jumper.

206
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:39,544
Speaker 0: Yeah see there was this set of them like this set of these videos that Circulated the internet far and wide and pretty much everyone our age has seen all of them.

207
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:44,582
Speaker 1: Yeah bus Dodge bus Dodge 2000 which is at RIT death chaos.

208
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:45,145
Speaker 0: What's it?

209
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,330
Speaker 1: That's that's different.

210
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:49,549
Speaker 1: That's not an owned video, but some of it has some owning in it.

211
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,425
Speaker 0: In the similar vein to the owned video

212
00:16:52,546 --> 00:17:15,309
Speaker 1: it is now Someone very smart a very smart person who is much smarter than we are went around the Internet's mostly the youtubes and Google videos and they collected 450 owned videos 450 idiots hurting themselves 450 guys on bicycles falling down and hitting their heads

213
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,628
Speaker 0: Yamakazis failing to make that critical leap across two high buildings

214
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,656
Speaker 1: People at weddings fainting

215
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,349
Speaker 0: a whole section of people getting hit in the balls with balls.

216
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:40,167
Speaker 0: It is just an idiot jumping down an escalator landing on his face and breaking it Someone deciding that the best thing in the world they can do is run up to a jack-o'-lantern Full of gasoline and on fire and hit it with a golf club.

217
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:51,709
Speaker 1: Yeah he took Four hundred and fifty owned videos and combined them into a single 33 minute long owned video.

218
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:58,070
Speaker 1: If you watch this you will not need to watch another owned video for probably the next five years.

219
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:06,639
Speaker 0: I also think you will lose any sense of compassion for any human being that harms themselves Due to no reason other than their own stupidity.

220
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:09,430
Speaker 1: Yes, that's pretty much what this is for.

221
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:18,390
Speaker 1: It will also make you laugh hysterically unless you're a bad human being in which case See, the thing is really well crafted and well timed.

222
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,650
Speaker 0: I mean it's set up in all these sections like there'll be a section of people getting hit with balls.

223
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:34,010
Speaker 0: There'll be a section of people almost getting owned but not getting owned Like a fee and a few of them like you cringe like oh, oh wow that oh my god.

224
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,689
Speaker 0: But then right after that there's a really funny one just like a guy's pants fall down.

225
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:39,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there are.

226
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:45,553
Speaker 1: you know, I've seen a lot of owned videos in my day and I'd say 99% of them made it into This compilation.

227
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:51,410
Speaker 1: However, there were some that didn't make it into the compilation and I hope those will be compiled in the future.

228
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,173
Speaker 0: Yeah Now a little warning.

229
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:59,672
Speaker 0: technically this is a snuff film because I am sure that at least one of those people died It.

230
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,642
Speaker 1: some of those people had to have died or come near death.

231
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:03,685
Speaker 0: Luckily it is.

232
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:07,610
Speaker 0: there's no other than well No, there's really no obvious like wow that guy's dead.

233
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:21,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also though there's one that with this train where you're certain that you're gonna see someone die Like oh my god, this is oh, you're about to look away and then nothing bad happens and the guy totally dodges the train.

234
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:29,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty crazy Very crazy, but all this is is a video of people doing stupid shit in some way or another and getting hurt.

235
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:30,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually getting hurt.

236
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,590
Speaker 1: Sometimes they barely escape pain.

237
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:46,105
Speaker 0: See now I wouldn't enjoy a video like this at all except for the fact that most of the people involved It's not like these are people who are just innocent normal guys getting hurt Seriously, it is innocent people getting hurt in minor and funny ways.

238
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:51,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean or stupid people harming themselves Horribly.

239
00:19:51,252 --> 00:20:02,655
Speaker 1: Yeah for some reason it's like if I see a video of a guy like, you know Getting bumped on the head walking down the street by like, you know some punk kids I get all like.

240
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:09,609
Speaker 1: hey, you know if I see someone getting hurt and it wasn't their fault Like let's say, you know a building just collapses on them I'm like, oh shit.

241
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:24,230
Speaker 1: but if I see someone do something to hurt themselves like that idiot who is wearing the polyester banana suit and set himself on fire with rubbing alcohol and got you Know horribly horribly burned and was like, you know, like should have gone to the hospital.

242
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,577
Speaker 1: I just laughed because he did it to himself.

243
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:28,623
Speaker 1: and that's what owned videos are all about.

244
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:33,782
Speaker 0: now fitting with the owned video That my thing of the day is the exact opposite.

245
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,631
Speaker 0: This is the one guy I mean.

246
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:50,210
Speaker 0: a lot of these stunts in the own video are people getting hurt trying to do very dangerous or very difficult things like Skateboarding in loops or you know jumping bicycles over things and all sorts of dangerous shit.

247
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:59,677
Speaker 0: Yep, but this is a video of the one guy the one out of a four hundred and fifty who tried to do these things Didn't die and got very good at it.

248
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:04,630
Speaker 0: this guy whose name is Ryan leech and the lifestyles of the rich and fabulous.

249
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:16,800
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, this guy is probably the almighty god of Doing weird stunts with mountain bikes.

250
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you've seen those guys at the stunt bikes.

251
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:28,917
Speaker 1: You know the ones with the the pegs and they're really the small wheels and you know They do all kinds of stunts of those things, you know, they grind down rails And then all currently go up ramps.

252
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:36,987
Speaker 1: This guy has a mountain bike meant for mountain biking Yeah, and he does some crazy shit with it crazier than those stunt bike guys.

253
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, good god I mean, I'm an amateur mountain bike.

254
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,230
Speaker 0: I've been biking for almost my entire life.

255
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,738
Speaker 0: I've been mountain biking for a long time like not nothing crazy.

256
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:44,702
Speaker 0: Don't get the wrong idea.

257
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:47,130
Speaker 0: I'm not like this crazy mountain biker.

258
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,599
Speaker 0: I'm actually pretty tame but I enjoy it a lot.

259
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:54,338
Speaker 0: and when Scott shows me the video I'm thinking alright He's never been mountain biking.

260
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,624
Speaker 0: This is probably lame.

261
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:59,358
Speaker 0: I doubted Scott I doubted him and the video starts.

262
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,306
Speaker 0: the guy does a couple of minor stops whatever.

263
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,153
Speaker 0: that's kind of tricky But it's not so bad.

264
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:07,348
Speaker 0: and then he does some pretty freaking amazing things.

265
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:14,210
Speaker 1: suddenly Most of what he does is he rides his mountain bike on very narrow railings without falling off.

266
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:29,010
Speaker 0: Yeah not even just riding but like he's on some railroad tracks like he's on the the bar the Railroad and then he hops his bike up and like two spins around now And he lands on the other Railroad track and he just starts riding.

267
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:45,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, like he'd let he's on one rail and he jumps in the air with the bike and lands on the other rail and he jumps distances on his bike that I Have tried to do things of an order of magnitude less danger and hurt myself severely.

268
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're not talking like horizontal distance.

269
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,054
Speaker 1: There's like in vertical distance There's one.

270
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:53,670
Speaker 1: he can go from a standstill and jump his bike like five feet in the air.

271
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:58,864
Speaker 0: He I saw he dropped at least 15 feet onto a slope at one point and was just fine.

272
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's pretty crazy.

00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:04,310
Speaker 0: This is an amazing video and you should watch it.

275
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,810
Speaker 1: They really need to have some sort of competition for this sort of thing.

276
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,416
Speaker 1: I want to see if anyone else is better at.

277
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:09,862

292
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:10,124
Speaker 0: The show is called gag manga Biore.

293
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:18,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also known as Masuda Kosuke theater because the guy who created it is Masuda Kosuke.

294
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was directed by Akitaro Daichi.

295
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:23,334
Speaker 1: Akitaro Daichi is actually a pretty hot director.

296
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:28,211
Speaker 0: I think he directed fruits basket and He did a whole bunch of things.

297
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:32,330
Speaker 0: I've never heard of Jubei-chan, he was the director of screenplay.

298
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,097
Speaker 1: It was a director of kotocha.

299
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:37,247
Speaker 0: Yep Whole bunch of other stuff never heard of.

300
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,696
Speaker 0: Oh God, he did storyboards retention universe.

301
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,847
Speaker 1: He was the Cameraman on grave of the fireflies.

302
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:45,154
Speaker 0: Hey, he did storyboards for an episode of mushishi.

303
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,960
Speaker 1: He directed elf princess rain.

304
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:48,904
Speaker 0: We got to review that.

305
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:54,200
Speaker 1: fucker sure do all right, so he's directed some other crazy crazy anime.

306
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:58,797
Speaker 1: I got to say this guy he's the director and original creator of now and then here and there.

307
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,513
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, I wouldn't expect that.

308
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,460
Speaker 0: Oh, well, wait a minute.

309
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:13,477
Speaker 0: Now if any of you out there have seen both elf princess rain and now and then here and there Would you have ever in a billion years thought that the same guy directed both of them?

310
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:14,360
Speaker 0: not ever.

311
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:20,519
Speaker 1: I mean to put it very very simple Hell you would you couldn't have told me the same guy directed fruits basket and Gog manga VR.

312
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,575
Speaker 0: But princess rain is a show that is I can't describe.

313
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:27,120
Speaker 0: It's just beyond silly.

314
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:27,863
Speaker 1: It makes.

315
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,011
Speaker 1: I'm so cool smart.

316
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:31,195
Speaker 1: I'm so cool.

317
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:32,259
Speaker 1: I'm so smart.

318
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:38,100
Speaker 0: But that show makes Excel saga look like a serious tragedy.

319
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:39,467
Speaker 1: It sure does.

320
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:49,789
Speaker 0: and yet now and then here and there is Nothing more than children being raped and ravaged by the horrors of war with absolutely no Possible redemption.

321
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what that is.

322
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,992
Speaker 1: So that's that's where guts who made Gog manga VR.

323
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,039
Speaker 1: now, what is Gog manga VR II?

324
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,587
Speaker 1: well It's it's an episodic show.

325
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:10,179
Speaker 1: some of the episodes carry into others, but not much and they're very short episodes You know and the opener and the closer combined are usually as long as the episode itself.

326
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:23,800
Speaker 0: I mean this shows like five minutes long and It's basically a wacky wacky comedy, you know in terms of wacky wacky comedy It's actually a as Emily told us and we then did a little research on our own.

327
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:26,891
Speaker 0: It is a very specific type of Japanese comedy.

328
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:32,399
Speaker 1: Yes in in Japan There is a type of comedy called Mon's eye.

329
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,140
Speaker 0: now It's had different names over the years and different kanji and all this stuff, but don't worry about that.

330
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,760
Speaker 1: Basically what Mon's eye is at its core is a style of comedy in which there are is a duo two people.

331
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:59,275
Speaker 1: One of them is the straight man And one of them is the goofy guy just like, you know, Evan Costello and all those olds to old-school American comedy teams and It's the tsukomi and the bokeh.

332
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,559
Speaker 1: Yes The bokeh is the funny guy and the tsukomi is the straight man.

333
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:23,202
Speaker 0: Now the typical humor generally is along the lines of the funny guy says something stupid He's usually forgetful or slow or just dumb or weird or insane and just says things that don't make sense Or things that are dumb and the straight man just basically yells at him like wow, you're stupid to the stupidest bad I've ever met.

334
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:23,926
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

335
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:27,000
Speaker 0: How could anyone be as stupid as you and interrupts him and hits him over the head.

336
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:33,660
Speaker 1: Yeah now in as among Adele you might remember these scenes where Tomo-chan would you know hit or you know?

337
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:37,979
Speaker 1: slightly slap Osaka and then say something like what the hell?

338
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:46,940
Speaker 1: or Yeah, they were making fun of Monzai comedy because Monzai comedy has been associated with Osaka.

339
00:27:47,401 --> 00:28:01,240
Speaker 0: It was to to quote a probably the least credible source in the world from Wikipedia here quote in recent times Monzai has often been associated with the Osaka region and Monzai comedians often speak with a Kansai dialect during their acts, right?

340
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,249
Speaker 1: So what Tomo-chan is doing?

341
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:19,076
Speaker 1: the joke is that you know because Osaka is from Osaka He's trying to do this Monzai act, you know to show that you know, she's more Monzai funny than Osaka is I guess and that's why it's not funny to us.

342
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:20,580
Speaker 1: and you go what the hell what the hell?

343
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:32,813
Speaker 0: But I mean that it if you haven't seen these shows it might sound like it's stupid But if you haven't seen Abbott and Costello, it sounds like the stupidest thing ever.

344
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:34,559
Speaker 0: you got a role with this.

345
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:43,887
Speaker 0: Yeah You gotta just watch this show with an open mind and I guarantee you'll be laughing by the end of the first episode Which is probably the best episode.

346
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:46,499
Speaker 1: the way Gog manga biore goes is you know?

347
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:57,895
Speaker 1: mo basically the format of an episode is there's some sort of setting and some sort of set up for a plot and There's one character who is the straight man and one character who is crazy.

348
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:12,217
Speaker 1: and the crazy person See in got at least most of the time in Gog manga biore seems to be saying things seriously like something serious Something serious like and the straight man is go who you know is intelligent and isn't a crazy person is going.

349
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:13,742
Speaker 0: Oh my god Oh my god.

350
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:14,265
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

351
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:14,928
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

352
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:20,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'm going to visit the Emperor of China I'll advise you I'm going to bring him.

353
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,180
Speaker 0: I don't remember what the episodes without but I'm going to do something really really really really really really really stupid.

354
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,620
Speaker 0: There's like what but it'll kill you.

355
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,205
Speaker 0: Oh my god What's wrong with you is like.

356
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:32,919
Speaker 0: and then I'm going to blah blah blah blah and the show just goes nuts from there.

357
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,746
Speaker 1: a Good example of the show.

358
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:41,238
Speaker 1: I think is the second episode really the second episode the one with the the girl who draws the?

359
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:42,944
Speaker 0: No, that's in them.

360
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:49,109
Speaker 0: That's the second half of the first episode in the second half of the first episode Ruin the first half of the first episode.

361
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first episode is probably the funniest thing in this show.

362
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:57,959
Speaker 1: I'm gonna explain the second half of the first episode to give you an idea why this is funny.

363
00:29:58,582 --> 00:29:59,265
Speaker 1: Here's the setup.

364
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:09,992
Speaker 1: The straight man is a guy who runs a company that sells bread I think or some sort of cookie or something and In the cookie is included a collectible dokka Mon sticker.

365
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:12,500
Speaker 0: Doki mod is obviously play on Pokemon.

366
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:17,252
Speaker 1: Yes, now he has one employee who was drawing the dokka Mon stickers.

367
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,939
Speaker 1: who is the not straight person the bokeh.

368
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,338
Speaker 0: The thing is she acts very calm the whole time and very serious and he just loses it.

369
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,245
Speaker 0: Yes They're playing these reversed roles.

370
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:27,565
Speaker 0: Yep.

371
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:33,926
Speaker 1: So she says something like, you know, he's like why look at this Takara kun that you drew.

372
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:37,380
Speaker 1: takara kun is like the ash Ketchum and he's like look at the one in the anime.

373
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:38,830
Speaker 1: Why aren't they the same, you know?

374
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:44,880
Speaker 1: and he says, you know How come you haven't drawn any monsters the monsters of the reap but kids like in dokka Mon.

375
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,546
Speaker 1: Why are all the stickers takara kun?

376
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:49,980
Speaker 1: and she's like takara kun is the only one in my dokka Mon world.

377
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:56,148
Speaker 1: And then she says it perfectly seriously and he's like, oh my god How am I supposed to sell bread with all these stickers?

378
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,580
Speaker 0: Oh my god, like she starts going like she's touched saying crazy things.

379
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,720
Speaker 0: She's like the epitome of scary fanfic writing fangirl crazy person.

380
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:09,220
Speaker 0: But she's saying it in this that kara kun is the only person in my dokka Mon world.

381
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like any of the monsters.

382
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:19,640
Speaker 1: and dokka Mon Look when I tried to draw the monsters They're not very lively and she got a picture of like a chicken cooking over a fire.

383
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:24,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, like she's drawn the dragon from the show dead cooking over a fire and the guys just like what you're insane.

384
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:34,155
Speaker 0: Yeah now again, it might not sound that funny with us describing it There is no way I can express to you how hilarious the show is because there's no.

385
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaker 1: it's kind of like trying to Describe a joke without telling the joke exactly exactly now in future episodes There's a lot of stuff that kind of plays on Japanese history and old Japanese stories a little bit.

386
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:54,180
Speaker 0: Yes, the one I really like to talk about is everyone remembers when you know Perry and the black ships coming and opening up Japan.

387
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,673
Speaker 0: But there was another man sent somewhat later named Harris.

388
00:31:57,974 --> 00:31:59,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one really remembers hair.

389
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,140
Speaker 0: Well, Emily remembered Harris, but she knows a lot about Japan.

390
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I heard his name maybe once before watching this show.

391
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:10,519
Speaker 1: But people in Japan know who Harris is because they learn about him in history class.

392
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:15,360
Speaker 0: So Paris is there and he's talking about how he wants to be known in Japan.

393
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,080
Speaker 0: He wants to make his mark like Perry did and he has this Japanese guy with him as the advisor.

394
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:37,679
Speaker 0: And he gets to the point where he's like I know how I'll be remembered and he opens his notebook and he's drawn this Geiger as horrid like monstrosity of a monster train like it's got this Medusa face on like this this fucked up thing and he's very calmly.

395
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:44,644
Speaker 0: he's like I will build this and I will ride about in Japan and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah And then people will remember me.

396
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:47,654
Speaker 0: I will have a legacy and the Japanese guys like what.

397
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:48,798
Speaker 0: that's crazy.

398
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:49,560
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

399
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:50,380
Speaker 0: This is insane.

400
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,423
Speaker 0: You can't build that.

401
00:32:51,744 --> 00:33:01,260
Speaker 0: and then he pulls the book down and there's a window behind the book and he's already built the thing And it's sitting out there and all of its horrid glory ready to go and then it just gets crazier from there.

402
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,614
Speaker 1: I think that's actually the second episode with Harris.

403
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:07,012
Speaker 1: in the first episode with Harris He's like, I know I'll run around naked and he runs around.

404
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,640
Speaker 0: He's like, I know I'll eat some dirt.

405
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,136
Speaker 0: That'll make the Japanese notice me and the guys like they're noticing you, but they just think you're insane.

406
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:14,180
Speaker 0: What the hell's wrong with you?

407
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,283
Speaker 0: I should just kill myself.

408
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:16,007
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

409
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:17,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

410
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:29,830
Speaker 1: it's a bunch of jokes Just like that and it's it's just crazy stuff happens Which is funny and then the one normal guy watching the crazy stuff happens reacts in a funny way and it's funny again.

411
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:36,240
Speaker 1: and Any one of these jokes would get old if you know, you tried to carry them on for a long time.

412
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:43,127
Speaker 1: But since each episode is maybe five minutes and some of the jokes only go for half an episode You know, it gets funny.

413
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:47,020
Speaker 1: and then as soon as the joke runs out shows over watch the next episode.

414
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,380
Speaker 0: Yep, like the first episode because I really can't ruin or even talk about what goes on in the first episode with the stickers.

415
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:58,100
Speaker 0: I hope I'm not hyping it up too much, but I Almost I couldn't breathe laughing.

416
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:17,880
Speaker 0: but because it like a little funny thing happens and a weird thing happens and a funny thing happens and as you're watching like you're you're kind of chuckling a little bit like hey, yeah, and With every few seconds as some more things happen the laughter grows and like the feeling of humor in your gut Grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and then it tapers off at the end.

417
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:29,103
Speaker 0: You know the guys walking out to his car to the end of the episode and then at the very end The very last thing that happens is like the little boy pulling his finger out of the dike and the dam collapses And you just lose it.

418
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:34,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, another thing you had to know about this show is that the pacing is very fast.

419
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:36,020
Speaker 0: I mean they talk like this.

420
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,620
Speaker 0: They just keep talking as fast as fast as possible.

421
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,070
Speaker 0: You can almost barely understand what they're saying.

422
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,540
Speaker 0: if there were some tells everybody be able to deal with it all.

423
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, the sub thought I mean if we knew Japanese you'd probably be okay, you know, cuz it's like the micro machines guy.

424
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:50,331
Speaker 1: We can understand what he's saying But barely yeah, the subtitles are gonna disappear pretty quick.

425
00:34:50,371 --> 00:35:07,200
Speaker 1: if you want to get everything you can out of an episode You're probably gonna need to watch it twice unless you're just really good at reading subtitles and looking at the pictures because there's a lot Of also subtle jokes that are hidden without the episode that you have to yet to be quick about like in the very first episode.

426
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:18,159
Speaker 1: You know it like pans across this room with four characters and their names are written in very small subtitles Like, you know someone the bear eater or something like that?

427
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:27,049
Speaker 1: These are all like market marketing executives in a company and one guy's like John the human computer in Jake the chain wielder.

428
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:33,252
Speaker 1: and if you don't if you don't look closely You're not gonna see the joke that hey that guy's name is chain wielder.

429
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 0: or even listening to what they're saying I mean in the Harris episode, you know He's built this monstrosity and they're about to take it out across Japan and a reign of terror and the guy's like.

430
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:47,400
Speaker 0: I'm going to sit in the control booth with blah blah blah blah blah and a comfortable leather chair.

431
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:56,394
Speaker 0: You will sit on this platform and the bottom of the machine that will be moving up and down Incredibly fast to the point that it will probably kill you and the guy's like.

432
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:56,776
Speaker 0: what?

433
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:57,760
Speaker 0: but that's just crazy.

434
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,747
Speaker 0: Why does my scene have to move up and down and the guy's like?

435
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:02,377
Speaker 0: well obviously because it's attached to the wheel.

436
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:07,856
Speaker 0: Yeah But then he goes on and he talks about how there are only two options.

437
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,160
Speaker 0: now, this is just like a throwaway.

438
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,990
Speaker 0: There are only two options in the control booth.

439
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,880
Speaker 0: The first option is bomb the wrong place.

440
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:17,189
Speaker 0: The other option is self-destruct.

441
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,896
Speaker 1: Why would you make those buttons?

442
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:19,840
Speaker 0: Why would you make?

443
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:26,008
Speaker 0: I Hope that's not just an error in the translation But I don't think it was because Emily watched the episode with us.

444
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,199
Speaker 0: but bomb the wrong place.

445
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:33,039
Speaker 0: What kind of mind thinks of a joke like that?

446
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,973
Speaker 1: Someone who's making fun of the u.s Who makes devices that has a button?

447
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,060
Speaker 1: This is bomb the wrong place.

448
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:42,229
Speaker 0: I don't know if he was making fun of the u.s.

449
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,614
Speaker 0: Or if he's just insane.

450
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:47,383
Speaker 1: I don't know but It's it's hilarious.

451
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:49,029
Speaker 1: I mean it is a gag manga.

452
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:50,354
Speaker 1: It's not meant to be serious.

453
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:51,919
Speaker 1: It's just wacky wacky wacky.

454
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,660
Speaker 0: now I would also like to say that I mean I like the opening song.

455
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:55,623
Speaker 0: I really like it.

456
00:36:55,704 --> 00:36:58,414
Speaker 0: I like it too, but the closing song.

457
00:36:58,695 --> 00:37:00,120
Speaker 0: I mean you'll be last priceless.

458
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:26,170
Speaker 0: Now That is just a sampling of the closing song because someone Different sings it in every episode and it is different in every episode.

459
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,621
Speaker 0: I mean one time it's like this animated thing one time.

460
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:36,009
Speaker 0: It's this sketchy animation of a fat guy Singing it and this other guy pinching his nipples.

461
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't ask me about that.

462
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:38,341
Speaker 1: one.

463
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:51,330
Speaker 0: one time and I fell off the couch laughing it was it was this robot this poorly animated robot and Super imposed a normal person's lips singing the song and for some reason it was just disturbing and hilarious.

464
00:37:56,752 --> 00:38:11,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a different voice making that series of noises every time and you know in a very short show where the opener And the closer take up a significant portion of the time in the episode It's good to see that the closer is actually worth watching.

465
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,535
Speaker 1: You know the opener.

466
00:38:12,615 --> 00:38:15,310
Speaker 1: you can watch once and it'll be okay, even though it's a crazy opener.

467
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:21,053
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean some shows are like that and some shows aren't like Wolf's reign or Evangelion.

468
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:24,634
Speaker 0: the openers were just useless Absolutely useless.

469
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:25,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've seen him once.

470
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,084
Speaker 1: you've seen him the whole show you're done.

471
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,970
Speaker 0: I mean, oh, it's a naked ray And she's spinning while someone sings flying me to the moon.

472
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least in Gundam seed, you know the opener changes.

473
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:38,116
Speaker 1: So you have to watch all the different openers and closes But you still need to watch them once.

474
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,284
Speaker 1: and Gog manga B or E you can watch.

475
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:41,690
Speaker 1: every closer is different.

476
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:49,259
Speaker 0: You can at the end of every show you stay for the closing and at any moment when you think all right This joke is played out.

477
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,129
Speaker 0: They immediately change to another joke.

478
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,860
Speaker 1: Yeah the timing of joke changing is pretty much spot-on.

479
00:38:55,141 --> 00:39:01,688
Speaker 0: now if we haven't sold you on the show which I don't know how well we Can because it's really really hard to explain this type of humor

480
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:10,320
Speaker 1: pretty much You're either going to find it absolutely Hysterical or you're gonna think it's the weirdest thing you've seen in your life and that anyone who likes it and laughs at it is Fucked up.

481
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:21,730
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll say very simply if I showed that if you showed this to anyone who wasn't familiar with Japanese culture or anime and at least some way the only possible thing they could say to you is what the fuck was that?

482
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:35,284
Speaker 0: exactly Now I guess if we haven't sold you on it if you like, I don't know Cromartie High School or Excel saga or Abbott and Costello or elf princess rain.

483
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:40,809
Speaker 0: Oh god, I'll princess rain You will probably enjoy this show

Speaker 0: We're gonna be on this huge Podcasting panel with among other people perhaps my favorite cop-fought podcast in the world fast karate for the gentlemen And they're rust hurricanes.

499
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:42,730
Speaker 1: David Joel calm.

500
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:49,989

501
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:56,210
Speaker 1: They They're pretty unprofessional but the thing is but that's what makes them awesome.

502
00:40:56,311 --> 00:40:57,749
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt their show at all.

503
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,599
Speaker 1: It doesn't because their shows all about what they say and nothing else.

504
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,445
Speaker 0: their show is about being unprofessional.

505
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:07,402
Speaker 0: They're unprofessional professionally That's damn right, but and a whole bunch of other people.

506
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,446
Speaker 0: I don't even remember who all we're gonna.

511
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:32,498
Speaker 0: Sorry Yeah, unless it might be funny.

512
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,844
Speaker 0: It might have nothing to do with hentai.

513
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,914
Speaker 1: That is a possibility I'll have to invest.

514
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:38,630
Speaker 0: I mean Dave and Joel have nothing to do with karate or gentlemen.

515
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,543
Speaker 1: Oh, they have much to do with gentlemen.

516
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:41,349

Speaker 0: We pick up at the convention.

520
00:41:56,551 --> 00:41:59,179

Speaker 1: Yeah, what's it called the rough?

531
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,634
Speaker 1: What's the word for?

532
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,621
Speaker 1: not a hundred percent sure again.

533
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:30,986
Speaker 0: ninety-five percent sure.

534
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:31,990
Speaker 1: no preliminary.

535
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,896
Speaker 0: Yeah preliminary works.

536
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,823
Speaker 1: What's the one that most people use?

537
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:36,687
Speaker 1: a tentative?

538
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:37,390
Speaker 0: tentative?

539
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,252
Speaker 1: Um What?

540
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:42,301
Speaker 1: there's another word that's a synonym that I'm missing.

541
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,625
Speaker 0: come up with plenty of words.

542
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:45,210
Speaker 1: I know but there's one synonym.

543
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,353
Speaker 1: That's the one I'm looking for.

544
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:48,519
Speaker 0: Well, you haven't given me enough to give you a synonym.

545
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:49,542
Speaker 0: That'll probably work.

546
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:51,387
Speaker 0: the projected plan.

547
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:55,096
Speaker 1: No Yeah, hold on.

548
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:56,260

Speaker 0: Hold on what website?

550
00:42:57,465 --> 00:43:01,233
Speaker 0: All right, we're not Way to go.

551
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:06,610
Speaker 0: yep, you know if it weren't for the fact that we'd be stealing there'd be a thought bird right about there.

552
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,453
Speaker 1: There would be.

553
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:12,350
Speaker 0: well today is just the anime world order and fast karate for the gentleman episode of geek nights.

554
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:15,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might as well just let them do our super chill.

555
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,010
Speaker 1: What do we need us for?

556
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,233
Speaker 0: Well, I'll say one.

557
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:21,790
Speaker 0: both of you out there YouTube podcasting duo trios.

558
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,114
Speaker 0: I don't want to leave Clarissa out.

559
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:30,957
Speaker 1: should watch guy like colors is assumed to be the one left out when it's a duo Because Clarissa is always the voice of reason.

560
00:43:30,977 --> 00:43:33,145
Speaker 0: I know I mean I don't.

561
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:38,847
Speaker 0: I often disagree with her But she's always the reasonable one whenever Gerald and Darryl go off on a rant.

562
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:39,570
Speaker 1: That's right.

563
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:42,742
Speaker 0: If you put her on fast karate, I don't know what would happen.

564
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:43,424
Speaker 1: Oh god.

565
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:45,809
Speaker 0: Okay, I think someone would die And I don't think it would be her.

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,454
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

567
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:49,070
Speaker 1: it wouldn't work because it's a show for gentlemen and she's a gentle woman.

568
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,803
Speaker 0: But regardless go to sit a con.

571
00:43:57,812 --> 00:44:06,899
