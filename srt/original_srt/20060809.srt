00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:35,604
Speaker 1: Yeah By the time you're listening to this Otacon will be over and we will be far away on a beach or something And we won't be able to record anything.

7
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:41,707
Speaker 0: So yeah, yes Hence we thought we'd do these short specials to one fill out the feed while we're gone and two.

Speaker 0: Hence is a geek night special.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,145
Speaker 0: if you want to know what the show is all about I suggest you look for any episode that doesn't have the word special in the title.

15
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,350
Speaker 1: That would be a good idea.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,220
Speaker 0: There are about a hundred and sixty of them.

17
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:01,789
Speaker 1: Who knows how many?

18
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,266
Speaker 1: I Think we should just stop using episode numbers and use the numbers that we use on the.

19
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:13,386
Speaker 1: we don't use episode numbers Anyway, I know but like stop counting the episodes just actually say episode.

20
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:13,868
Speaker 1: Oh six.

21
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,319
Speaker 0: Oh, whatever We just say what day the episode is.

22
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, we've never said what the episode number was ever.

23
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:19,734
Speaker 1: I think we did like.

24
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:20,657
Speaker 0: no we didn't.

25
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:26,574
Speaker 1: we've never introduced the show that way not introduced the show that way but talking about it That way at all Okay.

26
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only one who's ever done that is you maybe.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,686
Speaker 0: Anyway, since it's anime day our special will involve a story from the days when we used to run the RIT anime club.

28
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,490
Speaker 1: scary days.

29
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:52,475
Speaker 0: well, they were good days, but one time we were at this convention and Some people from case Western who they also also have a fairly large anime club, you know We met him and they're talking to our club people.

30
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,324
Speaker 0: and after a while they realized wait a minute.

31
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,070
Speaker 0: You're the RIT anime people.

32
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,147
Speaker 0: We have a warning for you.

33
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:04,126
Speaker 0: And they were dead serious like the tone because cease to become jovial.

34
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,070
Speaker 0: and they were dead serious.

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,985
Speaker 0: They said we've got this guy and his name is Steve.

36
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,073
Speaker 1: and we said whoa We have Steve's.

37
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,839
Speaker 1: yeah know all about Steve's.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,150
Speaker 0: we know everything there is to know about guys named Steve and anime clubs.

39
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:24,830
Speaker 0: In fact, we had two of them and they said no this guy And they couldn't really even describe him.

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,634
Speaker 0: They just said he's going to RIT next year and we said, oh great We'll have three Steve.

41
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:36,595
Speaker 0: and then they said we felt the need to warn you about this guy And we totally blew these guys off.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're like, okay if you know if this isn't just complete BS either.

43
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:47,876
Speaker 1: Okay, we have two Steve's already a third Steve isn't you know, whatever we if we can handle the two We got we can handle a third one.

44
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:53,621
Speaker 0: now to back up a bit the whole thing about Steve's there were we know a bunch Of people named Steve and one of which is good.

45
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:55,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of which is a very good friend of ours.

46
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,817
Speaker 0: There are a couple other Steve's we know who are general.

47
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:58,499
Speaker 0: Okay people.

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:19,660
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but in the anime club, it seemed that a Greater number of people than is statistically probable who were named Steve were also fanboys of the highest order as in Bonboys as in my favorite anime is the baby Anime Like to watch it all night.

49
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,270
Speaker 1: I sit in my room with no friends.

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of them actually used to follow us around describing hentai to us.

51
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you think we're kidding.

52
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:42,750
Speaker 0: But no, no, you just follow us around like yeah, he told me remember one day I was trying to eat my brunch at Gracie's and he starts telling me about this Disembodlement porn that he'd been looking at the previous night and I was like, ah Something I need to do and I got up to leave and I hadn't even finished my food and he's like, oh, what are you?

53
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,529
Speaker 0: Up to I'll follow and I was like Something you can't come along to do.

54
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,705
Speaker 1: Eventually, we got rid of that Steve by saying no one likes you.

55
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:58,264
Speaker 0: go well no No, we got rid of him because Pete who is not a spineless coward told him.

56
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,247
Speaker 0: No one likes you.

57
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,130
Speaker 0: Please go away.

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the rest of us just stood there.

59
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:02,339
Speaker 0: Yep.

60
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:04,750
Speaker 0: That's the story for another time.

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,382
Speaker 0: I don't know if we actually told that one or not either.

62
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't matter But all of these Steve's were fanboy fanboy fanboy.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,700
Speaker 0: We were used to running this huge club and run.

64
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,390
Speaker 0: dealing with fanboys was just the power and cars were par for the course.

65
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,062
Speaker 0: We were used to it.

66
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,279
Speaker 0: then Club starts up the next year and lo and behold.

67
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,107
Speaker 0: There's a new member and his name is Steve.

68
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,734
Speaker 1: Oh and They weren't lying.

69
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:37,130
Speaker 0: He's wearing this bicycle helmet, which he wore all the time as far as I could tell and This guy was a scruffy looking fanboy, but whatever a lot of people in the anime club were kind of scruffy looking.

70
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,489
Speaker 0: Then he opened his goddamn mouth.

71
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:45,610
Speaker 1: Got damn is not even close to the correct words that need to be used to describe his mouth.

72
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,466
Speaker 0: I mean there were people before us like before the front row crew took over this club.

73
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,312
Speaker 0: the crew before that They all had like.

74
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:59,518
Speaker 0: there was God boy and fanboy and art boy and fanboy was a slightly derogatory term But it wasn't a bad word.

75
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:02,110
Speaker 0: like calling someone a fanboy wasn't a terrible offense.

76
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:06,284
Speaker 0: We felt that this word did not do this person justice not at all.

77
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,850
Speaker 0: So we did not call him fanboy.

78
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,617
Speaker 0: We called him Fanboy with with a huge emphasis.

79
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,784
Speaker 0: I mean that was his name as far as the entire.

80
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,052
Speaker 1: if you just say fanboy That's not.

81
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:17,794
Speaker 1: no that's not him.

82
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,162
Speaker 1: That's some other word fanboy.

83
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,767
Speaker 1: That's the correct way to say his name.

84
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:29,410
Speaker 1: this dude motherfucking insane Holy shit, and there's stories of him doing crazy shit outside of anime club, too.

85
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:34,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, like banging his head against the wall in the lab and freaking out lab attendants and screaming and yelling.

86
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:38,060
Speaker 1: He was a CS student and see the way CS.

87
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:42,770
Speaker 1: a lot of CS projects go at RIT is they have a date and then They have like a minimum due date.

88
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:55,710
Speaker 1: And if you don't get the minimum requirement in by the minimum date Then you don't pass the class and all this stuff and you have to submit your project Electronically and this computer tests your program to make sure it works properly and all this stuff.

89
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:00,044
Speaker 1: So, you know, he was having trouble with his project.

90
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,150
Speaker 1: He was probably gonna fail.

91
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:11,376
Speaker 1: I don't know if he did or not But you know, he was in this lab full of people working on their projects and you know And obviously he had some sort of social Disorder.

92
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:17,434
Speaker 1: Yes, it's called being a fun boy Yeah, and he was like getting up and screaming and you know The little the.

93
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:28,459
Speaker 1: there was like some girl who is running the lab at the time and you know She's just a person who watches the computer lab, you know and hands you your piece of paper after you print it out and you know Restarts the computer if you have trouble.

94
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,750
Speaker 0: that was the most sought-after job in all of our IT.

95
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,710
Speaker 0: Nothing, except your homework and you got paid.

96
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:49,708
Speaker 1: I mean she knows something about computer science because you know, it's a CS lab but She's not just gonna she's not supposed to tell the guy how to do his project or anything like that and this guy's like screaming and yelling and he's going crazy and he's hitting things and he hits his head against the wall.

97
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,419
Speaker 1: and Crazy guy.

98
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:56,350
Speaker 0: now at the anime club He was generally just disruptive and bothersome and he yelled a lot.

99
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:00,270
Speaker 0: I talked a lot and he talked about hentai and things we didn't want to hear about.

100
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:10,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, the general rule at anime club was you know, you're not supposed to talk during the show But if you have something incredibly clever to yell out, right then it's all good.

101
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:16,205
Speaker 1: And the way you can tell this is you yell something out and if everyone laughs that was good.

102
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,433
Speaker 1: if people groan That was bad.

103
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:24,470
Speaker 1: if people don't say anything that's also bad and it's generally sort of a one-strike deal.

104
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:32,149
Speaker 1: You know if you if you say funny things all the time and you don't do it too often to be annoying then You know, you got a free pass.

105
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,835
Speaker 1: This guy everything he said was a groan Absolutely everything.

106
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,979
Speaker 0: He just yelled stuff out.

107
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,681
Speaker 0: at any anime we showed like two girls would see each other and he'd be like Oh boy, Yuri time.

108
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:50,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Generally as soon as you get one groan you're supposed to shut up forever forever and ever and ever.

109
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean didn't shut up.

110
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:57,758
Speaker 0: the primary means of punishment in the club were simply social ostracizing Ostracizing.

111
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:03,322
Speaker 0: Yep Ostracification There's not really a word that we wanted to use there.

112
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:09,534
Speaker 1: I Guess there isn't no ostracization, I guess That's what he was.

113
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:10,739
Speaker 1: He was ostracized.

114
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, that didn't stop him.

115
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:13,550
Speaker 0: That didn't stop him.

116
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:24,430
Speaker 1: no, he would just come up to you and try to talk about things that you didn't care about and Scary scary anime stuff and yep, like I'd be ready to start the the anime club meeting, you know, yell my classic.

117
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,516
Speaker 0: Hi everybody.

118
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:26,400
Speaker 0: Hi rim.

119
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,150
Speaker 0: Welcome to anime club blah blah blah blah.

120
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:39,350
Speaker 0: He would just kind of be standing in front of me at the front of the room and he you know The other couple hundred people are sitting down and he's just kind of standing right in front of me in my way And I'm like, could you please sit down so I can start the meeting?

121
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,650
Speaker 0: now also as Fanboys do he often would work up a sweat and then there were oh, yeah, that was the same dude.

122
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the same dude.

123
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:52,348
Speaker 0: So there'd be odors associated with the sweat.

124
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:56,270
Speaker 0: and okay Yeah, well we I'll start the first and Scott can finish what actually happened here.

125
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,759
Speaker 0: All right We had a very strict policy on smell.

126
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:06,495
Speaker 0: if you smell bad a member of our Administration would take you aside and tell you that you smell bad that you need to go home and shower or you're gonna be kicked Out of the club.

127
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,310
Speaker 1: It's not kicked out of the club.

128
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,455
Speaker 1: I thought out of the meeting.

129
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,825
Speaker 0: if you kept doing it you would be barred from the club.

130
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,070
Speaker 0: We never had to bar anyone.

131
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:20,050
Speaker 1: It's basically He has a crowded room full of people watching something on a screen or a crowded room full of people playing games or dancing.

132
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:28,207
Speaker 1: If you were giving off an odor and the people around you were disturbed we said, all right You have to leave the room and you can't come back and say you no longer give off an odor.

133
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,403
Speaker 0: now We had those hundreds of pounds of soap that we had Commandeered from our IT at one point.

134
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:40,421
Speaker 1: basically you're out of college so they get all sorts of free shit to give out to students all the time.

135
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:46,139
Speaker 1: and somehow we ended up with 44 pound boxes of zest soap.

136
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,270
Speaker 1: now it was shitty soap zest rainforest, whatever.

137
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,602
Speaker 0: This is crap soap, but they were all individually wrapped.

138
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,750
Speaker 0: and think 44 pounds per box.

139
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,197
Speaker 0: I took a box for me.

140
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,263
Speaker 0: Scott took a box for him.

141
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:58,530
Speaker 0: Our friend Pete took a box for him.

142
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,195
Speaker 1: So that was no.

143
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:00,163
Speaker 0: Pete took two boxes.

144
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:00,848
Speaker 0: I think Diddy.

145
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:05,619
Speaker 1: So 8860 76 boxes of pounds of soap.

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:05,901
Speaker 0: Yep.

147
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,010
Speaker 1: I mean we couldn't almost 200 pounds of soap.

148
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,690
Speaker 0: We couldn't even carry it back to the dorms.

149
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:23,131
Speaker 0: We stashed it under some stairs in the liberal arts building and we wrote like some bullshit on them like I put a piece of paper on him and I wrote like temporary storage care of and I made up a name and then I put a number on it and I figured that would look official enough To.

150
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,416
Speaker 0: people would leave it alone and they did.

151
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:24,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

152
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,330
Speaker 1: Hey, no one took any soap out of it besides us.

153
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, every time I needed soap.

154
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,205
Speaker 0: I just stopped by there open one up take whatever soap I needed.

155
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:36,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, so We had this soap and one of the boxes belong to the anime club.

156
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,816
Speaker 1: and if someone gave off an odor You know, we try.

157
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:44,296
Speaker 1: we said hey we can use this soap really discreetly, you know Just kind of hand someone a soap and that's like.

158
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,982
Speaker 1: now they know that they smell.

159
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:53,610
Speaker 1: they have to go without saying you smell And everyone around here as you say it now, what would a normal human being do when given a bar of soap?

160
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,476
Speaker 1: They would go.

161
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:59,962
Speaker 0: Oh And leave shower and come back hopefully with the soap or some other kind of soap.

162
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:00,563
Speaker 1: Yep.

163
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,870
Speaker 0: What did fanboy do?

164
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,149
Speaker 1: Well, he took the soap and he rubbed it in his underarms.

165
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,488
Speaker 1: immediately a dry bar of soap.

166
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:14,710
Speaker 0: and Then he said thanks We were we were dumbfounded.

167
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:19,506
Speaker 1: This is not a. was he a homeless person before going to college.

168
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,430
Speaker 0: I don't know.

169
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,318
Speaker 0: I have no idea what his deal was.

170
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,970
Speaker 0: I never will know I'll probably never see him again.

171
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, thankfully very thankfully.

172
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:31,887
Speaker 0: I mean he really was probably the the epitome of all.

173
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:32,770
Speaker 0: that is fun boy.

174
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, as soon as we had him the other Steve's were like, okay cool.

175
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know talk about hentai whatever.

176
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,409
Speaker 1: You're not rubbing soap under your arm.

177
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:47,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily I mean smell is a problem apparently with a lot of anime clubs, but we really kind of had it under control.

178
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's cuz he recognized the problem.

179
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:56,349
Speaker 1: a lot of other anime clubs and conventions where smells a problem They kind of ignore it or they don't recognize it.

180
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,430
Speaker 0: I think a lot of those cons because they were run by people who also gave off those smells.

181
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know by bringing the problem out into the open.

182
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,509
Speaker 1: We really were able to manage it.

183
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:09,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus honestly, nothing will make a fanboy shower faster than public humiliation.

184
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:24,982
Speaker 0: So in closing I urge you if you're at Otakon or any other big anime convention and a dude smells like an open sewer full of cheese tell him that openly Loudly and the people if you're playing DDR, it's inevitable.

185
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,288
Speaker 1: You're going to smell that's okay.

186
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:27,890
Speaker 1: That's okay.

187
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,645
Speaker 1: It's just when you're done playing DDR go back to your hotel.

188
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,750
Speaker 1: Take a shower and come back.

189
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, I swear to God.

190
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:38,997
Speaker 0: if you play DDR for two hours and then you're sitting next to me at the cosplay I'm going to kill you.

191
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,949
Speaker 1: And also some people are fat.

192
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:43,042
Speaker 1: well you shouldn't be but you know.

193
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:56,550
Speaker 1: if you're fat and if you sweat a lot and smell a lot and you're waiting in line for two hours in the heat of Baltimore or wherever else your Convention may be and thus you sweat and smell after you get your badge go take a shower.

194
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:00,683
Speaker 0: If you don't and you're sitting next to me at the cosplay, I will kill you.

195
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:06,968
Speaker 1: I'll publicly humiliate you as well Which might be worse than killing considering there's tens of thousands of people there.

196
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:24,860
