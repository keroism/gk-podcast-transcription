1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,460
Speaker 2: It's Wednesday, August 24th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,681
Speaker 2: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:13,230
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,655
Speaker 2: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:18,510
Speaker 2: Tonight we are talking about the feature films of Hayao Miyazaki.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,808
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:31,170
Speaker 1: I did a whole bunch of stuff over the weekend that would have been Open-E-Bit on Monday, if I had remembered.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,070
Speaker 2: Well, I jumped in with my previous show, Open-E-Bits, that were long.

9
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:42,190
Speaker 1: Right, so I tried to think, well, what happened over the weekend that could possibly be an Open-E-Bit?

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:49,070
Speaker 1: Because, you know, my current job, I only work the four days a week, which is still incredible, even though I've been doing this for a couple months now.

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,030
Speaker 2: So I gotta tell you, as a random aside, today I was-- It's pretty terrific.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:00,369
Speaker 2: I was coaching a coworker, like, doing some mentoring, and we were talking, and they were like, "Yeah, I just feel like I work too

13
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:00,629
Speaker 2: much.".

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,170
Speaker 2: So I actually told them, like, you know, I got a friend, you know, the guy I do the podcast with.

15
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,975
Speaker 2: He actually works four days a week.

16
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:10,850
Speaker 2: He totally pulled it off, and there was, like, the look on this person's face.

17
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:17,429
Speaker 2: It's like they had never considered that this was even a possibility in their lives, and they got really excited about it.

18
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:22,310
Speaker 2: And I don't think any company in capital markets would ever do something like that, but anyway.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,727
Speaker 1: Someone posted a thread on a website, and they said, "Ask, you know, anyone working a four day a week here as an

20
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:29,149
Speaker 1: employee?".

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,274
Speaker 1: "This is a question mark.

22
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:32,227
Speaker 1: This is a question for salaried employees,

23
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:32,388
Speaker 1: etc.".

24
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:34,679
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Yes!

25
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,804
Speaker 1: That is me!

26
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,010
Speaker 1: Here is how I did

27
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,090
Speaker 1: it.".

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,716
Speaker 1: And I got 171 upvotes.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,007
Speaker 2: I think you could just post an AMA and get surprising traction.

30
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:44,690
Speaker 1: Like, AMA!

31
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,550
Speaker 1: I only work four days a week.

32
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:52,170
Speaker 2: I only work four days a week, but I have a real job in a real company paying a normal salary.

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,450
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of a startup, but they're paying money, I guess, you know, as long as they don't run out.

34
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,870
Speaker 2: I mean, I have been approached by startups that aren't even at that point.

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,323
Speaker 2: They're like, "Yeah, we can't actually pay you in anything but

36
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:05,886
Speaker 2: equity.".

37
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, they're paying real money.

38
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,510
Speaker 1: They got from some investors, which usually I'm against, but obviously...

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,901
Speaker 2: Even companies like Google and Amazon don't really pay in money.

40
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,790
Speaker 2: They mostly pay in stock.

41
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:28,030
Speaker 1: But there's customers who are paying and, you know, I'm somewhat believing that the product has uses and has a chance of success, right?

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,750
Speaker 1: That's exciting.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,914
Speaker 1: Obviously not a huge chance.

44
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:32,022
Speaker 1: It's still some startup, but not zero.

45
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:33,850
Speaker 1: It's not garbage, right?

46
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:35,308
Speaker 1: Not too shabby.

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,803
Speaker 1: But yeah, so the weekend happened and most of the stuff that happened on the weekend is just, you know... I was doing stuff, but it was mostly personal stuff.

48
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,270
Speaker 1: It's not stuff I'm going to talk about in an opening.

49
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:58,450
Speaker 1: But one of the things I did over the weekend was there was a party and the person running the party hired some people to set up a balloon decoration at the party, right?

50
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:09,910
Speaker 1: So when I woke up and I went outside, right, there were people blowing up a shit ton of balloons, tying them together, tying them to sticks and creating like an arch kind of deal, right?

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,424
Speaker 1: You know, real fancy balloon decoration early in the morning.

52
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:14,529
Speaker 1: Not that early, like 10 a.m.

53
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,460
Speaker 1: You know, and they set it up and it looks pretty good.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,141
Speaker 1: They did a good job.

55
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,549
Speaker 1: And then they leave and the day goes on.

56
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:29,488
Speaker 1: A little while later, you know, I hear a pop and I'm like, yeah, balloons are going to pop, right?

57
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,070
Speaker 1: There was no way.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,252
Speaker 2: I got a guess.

59
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,419
Speaker 2: I have no... Scott has not told me the story.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,590
Speaker 2: My guess is the air temperature was high.

61
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:37,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

62
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:48,670
Speaker 1: But, you know, you knew that even if it was cold as crap, there's no way all the balloons are going to survive the whole day.

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,271
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:57,190
Speaker 1: But, yeah, they did not under inflate as they should have, knowing the heat wave and the sun coming out.

65
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:06,290
Speaker 2: I mean, every time I go to my bike, I look at, especially in this climate, I look at what the weather is going to be and I'll take five or 10 psi out of my bike tires, depending on the temperature.

66
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:07,572
Speaker 1: Yeah.

67
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:10,319
Speaker 1: But, you know, there was there was popping throughout the day.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,010
Speaker 1: And then once the shade came right later in the day, the popping receded.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,184
Speaker 1: And, you know, also once the under inflated balloons are the only ones that were left.

70
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:18,524
Speaker 1: Right.

71
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,649
Speaker 1: There was less popping.

72
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:19,890
Speaker 1: Right.

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,276
Speaker 1: There were some periods where there was a lot of popping.

74
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:26,449
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's just interesting because the popping is like, well, they messed up.

75
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:26,910
Speaker 1: Right.

76
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,144
Speaker 1: They, you know, they'll learn their lesson the next time those balloon people set up a thing.

77
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:31,665
Speaker 1: Right.

78
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 1: And they won't make the mistake again.

79
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,540
Speaker 1: They'll under inflate if they set up before the sun comes out, et cetera.

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,643
Speaker 1: Yeah.

81
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,468
Speaker 1: And it's like, there's nothing we could do about it now.

82
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:40,230
Speaker 1: It's unfixable.

83
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,752
Speaker 1: It's like, whatever.

84
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,259
Speaker 1: You know, the popping is not bothering or hurting anybody.

85
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,101
Speaker 1: Whatever.

86
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,742
Speaker 1: Right.

87
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:50,790
Speaker 1: But, you know, some people were like, just so fustered by the popping.

88
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:54,424
Speaker 1: And it's like, I could understand if someone had like a PTSD from loud noises.

89
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,810
Speaker 1: That's perfectly understandable.

90
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:57,916
Speaker 2: It was outdoors.

91
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:03,170
Speaker 2: So, balloons popping in an unobstructed outdoor area, unless they're Mylar balloons, not that loud.

92
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,353
Speaker 1: No, they're normal.

93
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,549
Speaker 1: These are like, you know, normal balloons, like rubbery, you know, the standard ones.

94
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:07,810
Speaker 1: Right.

95
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,119
Speaker 1: And it's like, some people are just like, you know, getting upset.

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,924
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, we paid for these balloons.

97
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,129
Speaker 2: And I'm like, there's nothing we could do about it.

98
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:21,139
Speaker 2: Well, that's that specific problem of people care way too much.

99
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,245
Speaker 1: And like, is your anger going to improve this situation?

100
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,570
Speaker 1: Then just ignore it and go on with your life.

101
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,413
Speaker 2: Oh, there's the amusement question.

102
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:28,777
Speaker 1: You're going to throw these balloons away.

103
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,582
Speaker 1: The party's only three hours long.

104
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,010
Speaker 1: You're going to throw them all away in an hour anyway.

105
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:34,893
Speaker 1: Why are you so mad?

106
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:43,550
Speaker 2: I feel like the correct response is to, like, if someone's like that and you want to just like stop it, just start yelling like, whoa, whoa, everybody, everybody, calm down, everyone be quiet.

107
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:48,899
Speaker 2: We have to end the party right now because the balloons might pop.

108
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:50,282
Speaker 2: Everybody go home.

109
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,144
Speaker 2: It's all over.

110
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,090
Speaker 2: Talk to Joey Jojo here who's bothered by this.

111
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,698
Speaker 1: The way I see it is like, I see it as a benefit that the balloons pop.

112
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,385
Speaker 1: And the way I see it that way is because, you know, what was that?

113
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,290
Speaker 1: If that, let's say the balloon arch, no balloons popped.

114
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,330
Speaker 2: You would never, you would never, I would never have known there was a balloon arch because you would not have said I was at this party.

115
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,670
Speaker 2: Right.

116
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,394
Speaker 1: And there would have looked nice.

117
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,163
Speaker 1: It would have looked nice and been there and been pleasant in its appearance.

118
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,526
Speaker 1: And then it would have gone in the garbage.

119
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,027
Speaker 1: Right.

120
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,170
Speaker 1: And that would have been the end of it.

121
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,472
Speaker 2: I suppose there's a tiny chance.

122
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,834
Speaker 1: Because it popped.

123
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:23,555
Speaker 1: Right.

124
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,859
Speaker 1: We now got a funny story.

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,910
Speaker 1: And, you know, even as soon as next year or even sooner, you'll be like, ah, remember that time all the balloons are popping.

126
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:37,476
Speaker 1: That is more valuable than the day of balloons.

127
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,258
Speaker 1: Now one could argue.

128
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,280
Speaker 1: Just being nice.

129
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,705
Speaker 2: There is a possibility that the balloon art would have been so impressive.

130
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,648
Speaker 2: Like I was at a wedding once where for weeks.

131
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,470
Speaker 1: It was good, but it was not that impressive.

132
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:53,096
Speaker 2: There's a possibility a balloon arch could have been constructed in such a way.

133
00:06:53,116 --> 00:07:01,550
Speaker 2: When I was a kid, we went to a wedding once and I remember all the adults for like months would keep bringing up how good the flowers were at this wedding.

134
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,354
Speaker 2: Like it was just a thing among every adult we knew.

135
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:08,020
Speaker 2: But this actually gets us some extra benefit.

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,770
Speaker 2: And this is relevant to my thing of the day because I was involved in a balloon related incident when I was a kid.

137
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:18,601
Speaker 2: And I know my mom is watching the live stream, so she's probably already laughing because she knows what happened.

138
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:19,543
Speaker 2: We were in...

139
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,950
Speaker 1: You grabbed too many helium balloons and flew away?

140
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,653
Speaker 2: It's actually relevant to your thing of the day as well.

141
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:39,210
Speaker 2: So we were in the fancy mall, not the one in Detroit that we would go to like for normal stuff, but like the fancy mall the family would go to for like, we're going to go shopping on a Sunday, like drive out to the suburbs and go to the big fancy new mall.

142
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,239
Speaker 2: And I had this Mylar balloon and I'm walking around with it like a little kid, you know, really, really happy about it.

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,623
Speaker 2: And I turned to my parents and I'm just like, can I pop it?

144
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,147
Speaker 2: And they're not paying super attention to me.

145
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,670
Speaker 2: So they're just like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

146
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,701
Speaker 2: So I just, as a kid, I put this balloon on the ground and I stomp on it.

147
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,570
Speaker 2: It is so loud.

148
00:07:59,481 --> 00:07:59,730
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

149
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,734
Speaker 2: It sounds like a for real gun went off.

150
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,056
Speaker 2: Everybody goes silent.

151
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,818
Speaker 2: People in the distance start yelling.

152
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,480
Speaker 2: A stampede starts.

153
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,604
Speaker 2: It is just like chaos everywhere.

154
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:16,530
Speaker 2: And my parents very intelligently are just like, keep walking, get up, keep walking, don't acknowledge it.

155
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:23,605
Speaker 2: And we're trying to just not be involved in any of this chaos that we have caused.

156
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,970
Speaker 2: and it's trying to get out of the mall.

157
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,367
Speaker 1: Correct move.

158
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,853
Speaker 2: Long story short, we did meet some police.

159
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:33,517
Speaker 2: They determined that no foul happened.

160
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,518
Speaker 2: Everybody calmed down.

161
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,679
Speaker 2: No one was injured.

162
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:44,049
Speaker 2: And my advice to you is to not randomly pop a Mylar balloon in a giant echoey eighties mall.

163
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,573
Speaker 2: Unless you desire this outcome, in which case

164
00:08:48,793 --> 00:09:03,470
Speaker 1: my advice to you would be if you're going to inflate balloons outside in warm weather and it's not at the peak warmth of the day or and or the balloons are going to be in direct sunlight, you should under inflate them.

165
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 2: I would say if you are a person who has access to public schooling in America, pay a little bit of attention in like middle school pre physics, but in your life, you might know the physics, but you just might not think of that.

166
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,171
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,837
Speaker 1: It's not about not knowing hot air expands.

168
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:29,630
Speaker 1: It's about having that come to your mind and like thinking about that moment when you're inflating balloons.

169
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,071
Speaker 1: Right.

170
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:30,753
Speaker 1: It's not about.

171
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,958
Speaker 1: it's like, yeah, you know, hot air expands.

172
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:33,399
Speaker 1: And it's like.

173
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:34,822
Speaker 1: but it's like, what?

174
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,566
Speaker 1: Why would you think of that at this moment?

175
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:37,649
Speaker 1: There's nothing you know.

176
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:45,498
Speaker 2: So in the news, there's actually we had a ton of news, which I won't try to dwell on all of it, but I want to start it.

177
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:46,400
Speaker 1: We can do pretty quick.

178
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,740
Speaker 2: Yeah.

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,370
Speaker 2: But I will start with one non animation anime manga comics news because it's actually a huge deal.

180
00:09:53,991 --> 00:10:06,630
Speaker 2: The United States, our president, Joe Biden, basically just signed an order that cancels arguably the majority of people's student loans in America.

181
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:12,638
Speaker 2: A lot of it, a significant the far majority of all student loans are ten thousand dollars or less right now.

182
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:20,530
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, all the countries with just free secondary education are like, oh, yeah, believe me, college should be free.

183
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,113
Speaker 2: It should continue from high school for anyone who wants it.

184
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:24,175
Speaker 2: But I digress.

185
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:28,200
Speaker 2: But at least the public ones, I guess this is a huge deal.

186
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:35,250
Speaker 2: And if you have student loans, pay attention to this, because the reason I'm making my news is I have a couple of reasons.

187
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:42,260
Speaker 2: One, a lot of people who maybe don't understand much about American politics but are mad about it.

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,722
Speaker 2: It's fine to be mad about it.

189
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,585
Speaker 2: It's even fine to not understand it.

190
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,370
Speaker 2: But don't be publicly mad about things you don't understand if you're going to be wrong.

191
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,835
Speaker 2: He said he was going to do it.

192
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,584
Speaker 2: People were swearing up and down he would never do it.

193
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,507
Speaker 2: And he did it.

194
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:56,290
Speaker 2: So that's one.

195
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,027
Speaker 1: He did it kind of.

196
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,174
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean, he did it.

197
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:02,290
Speaker 2: This is this is obviously only the first step.

198
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,850
Speaker 1: You didn't cancel all student loans, period.

199
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,492
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's common.

200
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:07,034
Speaker 2: I would say we give that time.

201
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:16,407
Speaker 2: But two, much more important, the ten thousand dollar limit and the Pell Grant limit that everyone's talking about, that is only the tip of the iceberg.

202
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,710
Speaker 2: That is actually not the most important part of this.

203
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:24,043
Speaker 1: The other parts are extra parts in the fine print that were not publicized enough.

204
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,226
Speaker 1: Well, I think they were.

205
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,389
Speaker 1: they were publicized.

206
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:26,830
Speaker 2: fine.

207
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:34,150
Speaker 2: The problem is the media didn't talk about them because they're kind of complicated and the people who are affected by them don't understand them.

208
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:41,930
Speaker 2: But basically, it is so much more than just canceling ten grand of student debt that it's going to cap interest.

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:50,770
Speaker 2: It raises by a huge, huge margin, like what income they are allowed to just talk to you and give you a discretionary exemption.

210
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,077
Speaker 2: It forgives loans less than 12K remaining.

211
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:59,786
Speaker 2: If after 10 years you still haven't paid off that last bit, excess interest.

212
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,730
Speaker 2: There is so much going on in this bill.

213
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,009
Speaker 2: I would say go to the government website.

214
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,579
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it's an order, which is because that's actually kind of relevant.

215
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,164
Speaker 2: We can't pass bills like this.

216
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,030
Speaker 2: There's literally no way to pass a bill like this.

217
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:17,910
Speaker 2: So the only way we can do this is an executive order, which means there are limits to exactly how far it can go.

218
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,076
Speaker 2: But this is a huge goddamn deal.

219
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,870
Speaker 2: I would say go to the government website to check out exactly how it affects you.

220
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,538
Speaker 1: If you're a United States person who has student loans left.

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,130
Speaker 1: However, I hope you didn't refinance them with some non-government place.

222
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:31,771
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

223
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:37,565
Speaker 2: However, one, that government website is down the fuck down right now.

224
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,790
Speaker 2: So give it a few days.

225
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:53,710
Speaker 2: And two, if there is, I doubt there's anyone listening to this podcast who believes this, but if you're the kind of person who somehow thinks this is unfair, especially because you paid off your student loans and you're mad that other people...

226
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,710
Speaker 1: I paid off my student loans.

227
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:55,569
Speaker 2: I paid off mine.

228
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,990
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't even be able to get this because I make too much money.

229
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,477
Speaker 2: But I would say if you're mad about this, you're a prick.

231
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:09,530
Speaker 2: If I'm not going to make an economic argument or a political argument, you are just a bad person who wants people to suffer for no reason.

232
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,825
Speaker 1: You just believe that because, right, it's like you had to suffer and therefore you believe other people should also suffer.

233
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,226
Speaker 1: Right.

234
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,809
Speaker 1: It's like you're just a piece of shit.

235
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,508
Speaker 1: People who really suffer.

236
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,010
Speaker 2: If we diverted the trolley to the track with no one on it, it wouldn't be fair to all the people the trolley already killed.

237
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:28,932
Speaker 1: Right.

238
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,976
Speaker 1: It's like most people who really suffer.

239
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:31,637
Speaker 1: Right.

240
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:37,007
Speaker 1: They, you know, it's like they say no one else should ever have to suffer like I suffered.

241
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,270
Speaker 1: That's what a good person says.

242
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,470
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

243
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:47,002
Speaker 1: If you say, right, I suffered so you should also have to suffer, you're a bad person who's not good for society.

244
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,205
Speaker 1: We should either fix you or get rid of you or something.

245
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:49,706
Speaker 1: Right.

246
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,447
Speaker 1: You got problems.

247
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,549
Speaker 1: You're the problem with the world.

248
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:52,430
Speaker 1: Get the hell out of here.

249
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,083
Speaker 1: There are some people who are concerned about inflation, which I guess is not entirely wrong.

250
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:02,450
Speaker 1: There is some amount of truth there.

251
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:10,303
Speaker 1: But what I would say to them is that, okay, let's, you know, y'all just give them, I'll just give it to them.

252
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:10,624
Speaker 1: Okay.

253
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,407
Speaker 1: Let's say that, what, $300 billion, whatever, you know.

254
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,037
Speaker 2: Oh, you're using one of my favorite rhetorical constructs.

255
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:17,498
Speaker 2: All right.

256
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,343
Speaker 2: I'll agree to 90% of what you said.

257
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,749
Speaker 2: just to get to the part that's the stupidest thing you said.

258
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:22,991
Speaker 1: Exactly.

259
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:23,212
Speaker 1: Right.

260
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:28,640
Speaker 1: So we're just going to let you pretend that, that the thing that's not true, that you're arguing for is true.

261
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,100
Speaker 1: Right.

262
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:33,707
Speaker 1: Cause that's how wrong you are is that we can pretend that your assertion is true when it's not.

263
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,230
Speaker 1: And you'll still be wrong.

264
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,470
Speaker 1: Right.

265
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:42,610
Speaker 1: Let's say that this, this is the equivalent of just printing $300 billion, which would cause some amount of inflation.

266
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,490
Speaker 2: I mean, one that rounds down to zero in terms of like how money works.

267
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:58,310
Speaker 1: If you're really concerned about that, right, that amount of inflation and in that printing of that money, this is a much better way to spend $300 billion than a lot of things in the U S budget.

268
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:05,824
Speaker 1: You should instead argue for cutting the defense budget by $300 billion for one year or $30 billion a year for 10 years or something like that.

269
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:30,250
Speaker 1: And so if you are saying that this is the inflation problem, you're basically saying that helping people whose lives are incredibly burdened and uplifting all of society is a worse way to spend money than bombs or subsidies to big companies or any of the other awful things.

270
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:45,530
Speaker 2: I won't even grant people the, well, we could cut defense spending because the reality is we could not only keep defense spending at the level it is, but radically increase it and, and homelessness and, and hunger and of universal healthcare in America.

271
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:50,849
Speaker 2: And all we'd have to do is raise taxes on the very rich by not even that much.

272
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:51,671
Speaker 1: Yeah.

273
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:57,643
Speaker 1: If you're worried about inflation, then you should just say, okay, canceling student loans is good.

274
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:01,490
Speaker 1: And then we should raise some taxes to make up for it, which would cancel out.

275
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,860
Speaker 1: Why don't we just delete, delete favor of raising the taxes on the rich and that why are you against the student loan thing?

276
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,770
Speaker 1: Why don't you just argue for, if the inflation is your concern, just argue for something else, right?

277
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,963
Speaker 1: Like cutting spending or raising taxes to balance it out.

278
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,270
Speaker 1: Don't argue against the student loan spending.

279
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:27,810
Speaker 2: Pay off the student loans and delete an equivalent amount of money from the hundred, from the thousand highest balance saving accounts in America.

280
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,690
Speaker 1: Right.

281
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:43,250
Speaker 1: The point is if someone is arguing, you know, for the, with the inflation argument, trying to hide the fact that they're a prick, the fact that their solution is to get rid of the student loan spending and not some other solution to cancel it out.

282
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,938
Speaker 1: Inflation wise shows they're just hiding.

283
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,850
Speaker 1: the truth is that they believe that I suffered, therefore you should suffer.

284
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,092
Speaker 2: Well, similarly.

285
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:57,786
Speaker 2: So people who are mad about this, who are saying, well, I shouldn't have to pay for someone else's student loan.

286
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:58,548
Speaker 2: Let's skip the.

287
00:16:58,808 --> 00:16:59,630
Speaker 2: you're a bad person.

288
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,723
Speaker 1: You pay for everyone else's social security.

289
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:02,690
Speaker 1: You pay for everyone else.

290
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:12,829
Speaker 2: Because how this is actually being paid for, uh, effectively there are people who will pay for these loans through taxes and people who won't.

291
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:20,962
Speaker 2: Anyone who is, who says they have to pay for these is already a multimillionaire or billionaire.

292
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:26,150
Speaker 2: And most of the people who are mad about this will pay zero more dollars in taxes.

293
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:27,609
Speaker 1: Yeah.

294
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,052
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah.

295
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,754
Speaker 2: Getting into some, uh, anime news.

296
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,915
Speaker 2: Uh, you just watched the documentary.

297
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,396
Speaker 2: We've talked about this before.

298
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:53,190
Speaker 2: I don't need to say much about it, but if you are unaware of the live action animated crossover sailor moon that was, that they tried to produce for American TV and then scrapped, but they filmed a whole pilot, uh, Mike tool, you'd like to show the clips that you've all seen from this thing.

299
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:00,559
Speaker 2: Well, uh, someone found the entire pilots, the entire library of Congress.

300
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,360
Speaker 1: I think they found it.

301
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,510
Speaker 2: They found it in the library of Congress, the entire episode, all the footage, and they not only published it, but they put, they made a documentary about it.

302
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,551
Speaker 1: Yep.

303
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:26,130
Speaker 1: If you don't know about it, basically there was, you know, a children's animation company back in the day that, you know, tried to make a U S version of sailor moon, get rid of all the Japanese stuff and make it palatable to a multicultural American audience.

304
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:28,894
Speaker 2: That was the target demographic of kids TV.

305
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:33,760
Speaker 1: Uh, well, they weren't doing that, you know, cause the original sailor moon was palatable.

306
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,405
Speaker 1: They were just making it palatable to their own adult senses.

307
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:37,805
Speaker 1: Right.

308
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,528
Speaker 1: Of what's American advertisers are.

309
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:41,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

310
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:42,992
Speaker 2: Palatable to what?

311
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,856
Speaker 2: producers of entertainment, racist people.

312
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,638
Speaker 1: I don't know.

313
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:48,659
Speaker 2: It's bad.

314
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:48,980
Speaker 2: Yeah.

315
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:56,790
Speaker 1: They, you know, and it, it never started, but they, they met, they produced the one, the one thing, and now we can watch that one thing.

316
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,631
Speaker 2: Yup.

317
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:02,554
Speaker 2: And, uh, we'll see, we'll see if any, if we ever talk about this again, but you can watch it.

318
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:03,795
Speaker 1: It's a fascinating history.

319
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:04,335
Speaker 2: It is.

320
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:05,216
Speaker 2: It absolutely is.

321
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,258
Speaker 2: Uh, real quick, I got a mini geek bite here.

322
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:18,966
Speaker 2: As you all know, I was a big fan of Beavis and Butthead when I was young, uh, much like that for a hundred D. The reason I got into Beavis and Butthead is because my mom actually got me and my little brother to watch it.

323
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,167
Speaker 2: Like when it first aired.

324
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,069
Speaker 1: I watched it a bit, but I wasn't that into it.

325
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,790
Speaker 2: The family would sit around and watch it.

326
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,312
Speaker 2: This was, this was as important as the Simpsons to us as a family.

327
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:34,196
Speaker 2: So, but I'll say is Beavis and Butthead was rebooted once, but it was rebooted again recently.

328
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,819
Speaker 2: The first season of the new Beavis and Butthead is airing right now.

329
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,180
Speaker 2: You can watch it on Paramount Plus.

330
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,922
Speaker 2: Uh, I think there's like four episodes that are out so far total.

331
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,486
Speaker 2: And as a brief geek bite, I will say one, it is hilarious.

332
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,167
Speaker 2: Two, it is worth watching.

333
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:53,950
Speaker 2: Three, it is deeply a spiritual successor.

334
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:01,676
Speaker 2: Like it is true to what made Beavis and Butthead funny in the old days, but it has advanced the writing.

335
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,118
Speaker 2: Like the writing's a little better.

336
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,119
Speaker 2: It has more modern sensibilities.

337
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,124
Speaker 2: Uh, they've excised some of the grosser and less entertaining or more dated parts of Beavis and Butthead.

338
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:17,830
Speaker 2: Uh, and it almost has a Looney Tunes style of humor in terms of how situations escalate.

339
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,711
Speaker 2: It is dense with comedy.

340
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,333
Speaker 2: Uh, I'm going to watch every goddamn episode of this.

341
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:37,183
Speaker 2: And the most important thing, they have continued, they brought back the part of Beavis and Butthead that was actually the most important part, which was not the cartoon itself, but the meta show where it's just them on the couch watching music videos and making fun of them.

342
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,544
Speaker 2: They still have that.

343
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,525
Speaker 2: Sometimes they watch music videos.

344
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:45,229
Speaker 2: Sometimes they're watching whatever YouTube videos or TikToks are viral at any given time.

345
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,170
Speaker 2: And if you see nothing else from the show.

346
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,792
Speaker 1: Are they paying to license those TikToks?

347
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:50,533
Speaker 1: Yes.

348
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,997
Speaker 2: If you watch nothing else, find the clip.

349
00:20:55,017 --> 00:21:05,105
Speaker 1: I guess if you make a TikTok and then Beavis and Butthead tries to include it in their episode, they only have to pay TikTok and not you because TikTok turns to service.

350
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,406
Speaker 1: They own that shit, right?

351
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,267
Speaker 1: So that sucks.

352
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,849
Speaker 1: But I guess you get some fame, maybe?

353
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:10,870
Speaker 2: I think you'd get some fame.

354
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:20,044
Speaker 2: So the one clip you should watch, if you're not sure if you'd like this or not, Beavis and Butthead, watch one of those ASMR videos.

355
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:24,030
Speaker 2: And it is a peak moment of comedy, this segment.

356
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:27,512
Speaker 2: You got any news?

357
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,435
Speaker 1: We got some more news.

358
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,238
Speaker 1: So Paprika, right?

359
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:35,065
Speaker 1: The last Satoshi Kon movie was based on a book, right?

360
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,228
Speaker 1: The book was by, what was that guy's name?

361
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,230
Speaker 1: Tsutsui, I think?

362
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:40,393
Speaker 2: Uh, do you think so?

363
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:43,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never remember his first name, right?

364
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:47,341
Speaker 1: But basically he's this really famous Japanese, like, contemporary sci-fi author.

365
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:55,130
Speaker 1: And he also, I believe, wrote Girl Who Leapt Through Time, the book, whatever it was based on, I believe, same author.

366
00:21:56,711 --> 00:22:08,530
Speaker 1: Anyway, so somebody is going to make a Hollywood live action series based on the book that Paprika was based on by the novelist Tsutsui.

367
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:27,810
Speaker 1: And obviously, even though that technically means that there's no connection to Paprika the movie, right, they obviously are going to use the fact that Paprika is a great movie based on the same work as part of the hype for their series that they're making.

368
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:35,361
Speaker 2: Total aside, I'm just going to read what the listener just typed, because in this case the listener is my mom.

369
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:38,146
Speaker 2: Late to the stream, oh my god, the balloon story.

370
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:40,510
Speaker 2: I will never forget the whole mall panic it caused.

371
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,313
Speaker 1: Alright, so that's the thing that's happening.

372
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:51,383
Speaker 2: There are, I would say, charitably, there is a wide range of how this is going to go, this show.

373
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:55,068
Speaker 2: This could be terrible, this could be amazing.

374
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,510
Speaker 2: We'll just have to see.

375
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:03,504
Speaker 1: I would like to see, because I've heard about this author quite a few times and never actually read any of their books.

376
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,190
Speaker 1: I don't know how many, if any, are available in English.

377
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:15,610
Speaker 1: But I would like to see this author, maybe if they get elevated to the Murakami level, or at least the level where their books all come out in English and I can read them.

378
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:22,482
Speaker 1: Because it seems like a lot of people have taken a lot of interest in this author's works.

379
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:27,070
Speaker 1: And I remember when I was watching the Satoshi Kon documentary, there was a lot of mention of this author.

380
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:33,210
Speaker 1: And like Satoshi Kon, often blurs the line between fiction and reality.

381
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:44,970
Speaker 2: Plus, randomly, Harley Quinn, the show, just had a weirdly long reference to 1Q84 because all the characters are into it and reading it, just in an episode for some reason.

382
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,530
Speaker 2: What the hell?

383
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:49,929
Speaker 2: That show's actually pretty good and you would probably enjoy it.

384
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,145
Speaker 1: Anyway, in other news, in the United States, we have these mega movie theaters all everywhere, owned by a few chains.

385
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,850
Speaker 1: And AMC, I think, is the biggest one.

386
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,869
Speaker 2: Also the bankruptest one.

387
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,212
Speaker 1: Right.

388
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:13,762
Speaker 1: So AMC was sort of in on the GameStop stock shenanigans, and what they're doing is they're going harder on those shenanigans.

389
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:19,350
Speaker 1: They're creating some security of some kind called ape, right?

390
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,350
Speaker 2: Now obviously they are referencing bored ape NFT bullshit without saying it out loud.

391
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:34,750
Speaker 1: I think it's that the people who were all in on AMC stock around the GameStop time also coincidentally called themselves ape, apes, right?

392
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:40,670
Speaker 1: Which might have stood for something, like AMC proppers, I don't know.

393
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:50,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's definitely a cultural commonality between that group and the NFT groups of people, right?

394
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,969
Speaker 1: There's clearly the same crowd, right?

395
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:53,850
Speaker 1: It's the same humans.

396
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,409
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, they're going to sell some kind of security called ape as the symbol.

397
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,156
Speaker 2: I didn't read all the details.

398
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,970
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure it's a preferred stock of some kind.

399
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:04,668
Speaker 1: I don't know what the deal is.

400
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,589
Speaker 2: Here's the best way I'm going to try to explain this in like...

401
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,690
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, it's a scam to just get money from fools.

402
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:20,310
Speaker 2: In my personal opinion, but not the opinion of any employer I may work for or have worked for in the past, this is probably a scam.

403
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:31,790
Speaker 2: But the way the rules work is, I would say, in my opinion, companies like AMC, you can tell when I'm thinking about what the lawyer would say if he was standing over my back.

404
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:38,750
Speaker 2: They have to do this by the book and be very transparent about what they're doing and why.

405
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:56,710
Speaker 2: And all the dipshit investors who are buying these meme stocks, who have no idea how the stock market works, are basically giving them cover to fleece people because they can point to their stock price and point to this interest and say, "Because of that, we are doing

406
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:56,930
Speaker 2: this.".

407
00:25:57,511 --> 00:26:08,629
Speaker 2: And the SEC has to look at it and say, "Yeah, I guess technically that is true because we can't actually take action against you just because a whole bunch of people are extremely

408
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:08,930
Speaker 2: stupid.".

409
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:17,590
Speaker 1: So that's happening, but at the same time, Regal Cinema, another major big time theater chain, might be going bankrupt.

410
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,778
Speaker 2: Theaters across the country are going bankrupt.

411
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,963
Speaker 2: We've talked about this on Geek Nights.

412
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:23,830
Speaker 2: for as long as Geek Nights has been going.

413
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:35,046
Speaker 2: I remember, even when we were living in Beacon, every movie theater anywhere near us, if we ever went to the movies, there'd be like two people in the theater with us, even back then, at any time.

414
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,630
Speaker 2: Weekends, weekdays, any time, no one was at the theater.

415
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:38,811
Speaker 1: Nope.

416
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:47,967
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's, you know, theaters, you know, we thought theaters were in trouble during the pandemic times, but now those, you know, are the pandemic times over?

417
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,850
Speaker 1: No, they're not, not even close.

418
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,098
Speaker 1: But, you know, people have largely come outside, right?

419
00:26:54,138 --> 00:27:00,270
Speaker 1: People are going to the movies and I guess they don't miss going, most people don't seem to miss going to the theater that much.

420
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:05,610
Speaker 1: I think going to the theater will mostly be a thing for people who really care about that sort of thing.

421
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:10,521
Speaker 2: I like to go to the theater for big movies I care about.

422
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,706
Speaker 2: Like I'll go see Dune in the theater at some point.

423
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,290
Speaker 2: I'm sure it'll be in the theater again.

424
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,614
Speaker 1: I think, you know, the point is there's going to still be a theater going crowd.

425
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:33,570
Speaker 1: It will reduce over time and it'll, you know, there'll be the, you know, certain special places that have a theater for, you know, special runs of things and then other things, just most people might not ever go to one, right?

426
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:47,207
Speaker 2: In some tragic news, a gentleman who most of you would probably know as the voice actor of Fuyutsuki in Evangelion, Motomu Kiyokawa has passed away at the age of 87.

427
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,329
Speaker 2: Once again, Godspeed.

428
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,070
Speaker 1: I'll take 87.

429
00:27:51,070 --> 00:28:00,949
Speaker 2: Every time I see someone who was famous and popular and seemed like a good person and seemed to be in good health and made it like past 80 something, I would take that.

430
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:01,630
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

431
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,631
Speaker 1: Yep.

432
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:10,370
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you look at the photos of the dude, I've never seen the guy before in my life or even a photo of him until now.

433
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,693
Speaker 2: He kind of looks like my grandma.

434
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,646
Speaker 2: Like I'm not even joking.

435
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,950
Speaker 2: He kind of looks like my grandma.

436
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:22,470
Speaker 1: But he's definitely got that, you know, cool old Japanese guy style, right?

437
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,169
Speaker 2: I think it's because he's wearing the same glasses my grandma always wore.

438
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,412
Speaker 1: The gradient, right?

439
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:29,578
Speaker 1: You know, the cool suit and whatever.

440
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:34,026
Speaker 1: But it's like you look at this guy, you could probably guess he's the voice actor of Fuyutsuki.

441
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,310
Speaker 1: just looking at this photo, right?

442
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,905
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, just looking at that photo gives me the feeling like that was one badass dude.

443
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:42,326
Speaker 1: Anyway.

444
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,676
Speaker 2: But anyway, things of the day.

445
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,963
Speaker 2: So I said this was also relevant to my opening bit.

446
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:58,410
Speaker 2: So for those of you who are somehow unaware, I grew up in Detroit.

447
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,500
Speaker 2: Detroit was an interesting place when I was a kid in the 80s.

448
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,765
Speaker 2: But there's a place in Detroit.

449
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,226
Speaker 2: It is.

450
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,670
Speaker 2: Detroit's a fascinating place.

451
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:25,350
Speaker 2: I think Detroit will be a very important city in the years to come because Detroit might be, and Chicago together, are the biggest real cities in the world that are in some of the places that are geographically the safest from climate change the longest.

452
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,078
Speaker 1: Okay.

453
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:38,570
Speaker 2: So if you haven't lived in Detroit, you've probably never heard of Belle Isle, which is basically this island that's like in the Detroit River between Detroit and Canada.

454
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,621
Speaker 2: It's like a giant park.

455
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:42,950
Speaker 2: It's like this giant park island.

456
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,674
Speaker 1: We looked it up.

457
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:45,883
Speaker 1: It's five square miles.

458
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:46,910
Speaker 1: So it's kind of big, actually.

459
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,592
Speaker 2: It is kind of big.

460
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,859
Speaker 2: When I was a kid, it had a reputation for a few things.

461
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,790
Speaker 2: One, a lot of violence happened there, like a lot of gang shootings, a lot of fights, a lot of trouble.

462
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,376
Speaker 2: There were fallow deer that used to live on the island.

463
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,740
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure they're all gone now.

464
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:04,470
Speaker 2: There were a lot of nature parks, like there'd be field trips there that we'd go to as kids.

465
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,655
Speaker 2: But there was this thing.

466
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:10,243
Speaker 2: It was built in like 1966 or 1967 that we just used to call the Belle Isle Slide.

467
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:21,050
Speaker 2: It is just this gigantic, dangerous-as-shit metal slide that you would just get in a burlap sack and ride.

468
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,943
Speaker 1: Now, there's plenty of big slides that you ride in a burlap sack.

469
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,169
Speaker 2: I've done that tons of times.

470
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:38,689
Speaker 2: This is the kind of thing, if you saw a video of this, even without seeing the danger of it, the first thing you would think is, "Oh, is that an action

471
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:38,910
Speaker 2: park?".

472
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:43,630
Speaker 2: I would be hard-pressed to argue against that if I didn't know the Belle Isle existed.

473
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,490
Speaker 1: Action Park had an alpine slide, even more dangerous.

474
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:54,870
Speaker 2: Fun fact, more people are injured at ski resorts on the alpine slides than are ever injured at ski resorts actually skiing.

475
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,390
Speaker 1: And that's a large amount because a lot of people are injured skiing.

476
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,117
Speaker 2: Do not ever get on an alpine slide.

477
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:04,550
Speaker 2: But anyway, do not ride the giant slide at Belle Isle either.

478
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,460
Speaker 2: So I guess it closed.

479
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:07,569
Speaker 2: I rode this as a kid.

480
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:15,910
Speaker 2: Stories of its danger and its jankiness are not unfounded, nor are they exaggerated.

481
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:21,242
Speaker 2: But this thing was closed in like 1994.

482
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:22,345
Speaker 2: I think it was closed until 2014.

483
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:24,290
Speaker 2: They opened it again, they closed it again.

484
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:29,749
Speaker 2: Long story short, it is now a meme, and the whole world knows about it.

485
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,109
Speaker 1: A pile of rubble is what it should be.

486
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:48,270
Speaker 2: So Detroit rapper GM Cash wrote a song about the slide, and what I'm going to link to is a tweet where someone has taken this song and juxtaposed it with images of this slide when it just reopened.

487
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,050
Speaker 2: I think Jimmy Kimmel even talked about it, so this is looming large in pop culture out of nowhere.

488
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:00,810
Speaker 2: Basically, they reopened it, they polished it too much when they cleaned it, and it was already dangerous before.

489
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,150
Speaker 2: Like you have to ride it with a special technique that I learned as a kid, or you will very likely lose a tooth.

490
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:11,470
Speaker 2: And people did not know this technique, and it was way slicker than it should have been.

491
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,670
Speaker 2: And I guess I would say it is like jumping off a roof riding the giant slide.

492
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,819
Speaker 2: Just watch this video.

493
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:20,350
Speaker 2: This is kind of amazing.

494
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,778
Speaker 2: This brought back so many memories of my childhood.

495
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:25,486
Speaker 2: Do not go to Belle Isle and ride this slide.

496
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:26,750
Speaker 2: I cannot stress that enough.

497
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:28,869
Speaker 1: Hopefully they don't let anyone do that.

498
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:33,310
Speaker 2: They reopened it after degreasing it and spraying it with water.

499
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,349
Speaker 1: But it's still open?

500
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:43,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it is back to the level of danger I remember from the late 80s in Detroit, and not the level of danger from like a week ago.

501
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,089
Speaker 1: The danger is too damn high.

502
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,319
Speaker 2: The lyrics to this song are something else.

503
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,101
Speaker 2: What was it?

504
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:52,310
Speaker 2: If your kids are annoying you, put them on the giant slide.

505
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,431
Speaker 1: That's right.

506
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:58,970
Speaker 1: Alright, so when I was a kid, we did safe things like go to the fancy mall.

507
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,130
Speaker 2: Hopefully someone doesn't pop a balloon and cause a stampede.

508
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:11,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in the 90s, the economy was fucked the fuck up in a different way than it is now.

509
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,270
Speaker 1: And that meant that shopping malls were like amusement parks basically.

510
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,518
Speaker 2: Well, the nice shopping malls were.

511
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:21,270
Speaker 2: When we were a kid, we would go to Eastside Mall like in Detroit.

512
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,270
Speaker 2: No store like this was in that mall.

513
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:32,950
Speaker 1: There were regular malls and then there were fancy malls that had, like I said, carousels and you know, all kinds of, you know, it's like go to amusement park.

514
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,010
Speaker 2: We would like get in the car as a family on a Saturday and go to Lakeside Mall out in the suburbs.

515
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,010
Speaker 1: There would be an arcade there, there would be a food court.

516
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,450
Speaker 2: Lakeside Mall had two indoor water slides and a pool.

517
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:45,572
Speaker 1: Yep.

518
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,323
Speaker 1: It was, you know, get Nathan's, right?

519
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,950
Speaker 1: It was like an event to go to the, anyway.

520
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:58,950
Speaker 1: So, one of the things, one of the key features of any 90s US fancy mall was a Warner Brothers Studio store.

521
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:09,350
Speaker 1: And the thing about a Warner Brothers Studio store is that, you know, it had, the store itself was just fun to be in because there was all sorts of animatronics and things on display.

522
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,850
Speaker 2: I would say it was Warner Brothers stuff.

523
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:18,489
Speaker 2: The average Warner Brothers store like this was higher quality than the Disney equivalent stores that were contemporary to them.

524
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:25,610
Speaker 1: The Disney stores were pretty equally fancy in terms of the arrangement of the store.

525
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,750
Speaker 2: True, but the Warner Brothers store had way higher quality merchandise.

526
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:35,909
Speaker 1: The Warner Brothers Disney store mostly just sold Disney merch, like shit with Mickey's face on it, right?

527
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:43,050
Speaker 1: It wasn't like you went to the Disney store, it's like there wasn't anything special on sale there typically, right?

528
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,268
Speaker 1: It's like I think my cousin collected this one kind of statue they had there, but it's like that was about it.

529
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,350
Speaker 2: Oh my god, the statues I had, anyway.

530
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:58,630
Speaker 1: The Warner Brothers Studio store had like rare, unique merch, like collectibles and shit.

531
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:08,363
Speaker 1: Like at all these stores they were selling animation cells and like, you know, film pieces and like, like if you were a film nerd, they actually had.

532
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:18,669
Speaker 1: like all these rare, or like, you know, in a day when there wasn't so much internet or no internet, it's like this kind of stuff was not accessible to the average person anywhere, you know?

533
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,849
Speaker 1: Videotapes of things that you couldn't get anywhere else.

534
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,816
Speaker 2: If they still had t-shirts with Batman on them, right?

535
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,840
Speaker 2: Think about how you felt when you went to an anime con before.

536
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:32,190
Speaker 2: you could buy stuff online and there was a dealer's room.

537
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:35,907
Speaker 2: That was what it felt like to go to one of these stores in a mall in the 80s and early 90s.

538
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:52,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they just had like this unbelievable stuff there, like you couldn't believe that like, it's the kind of stuff you might expect to see at like an amusement park gift shop right in the fancy section, but it's like they were able to gather so much stuff and produce so much stuff and have it in malls everywhere.

539
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,289
Speaker 1: It was like, that was, it was pretty awesome.

540
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:59,770
Speaker 1: Even though we really didn't buy any of it, it was still really great to go to the store, maybe that's why it went out of business.

541
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,030
Speaker 1: Because people going in a store and not buying anything isn't a great way to profit.

542
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:10,090
Speaker 1: Anyway, so someone made a video about the rise and fall of the Warner Brothers store.

543
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,477
Speaker 1: Honestly, the video is not the best video.

544
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:18,970
Speaker 1: It's not like defunct land where they super researched and give you all this interesting info and you know, whatever.

545
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:26,350
Speaker 1: But, the video does comprise of, is comprised of, a lot of old footage.

546
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:34,830
Speaker 1: So you can see shit going down at Warner Brothers stores back in the day and that is worth watching this video.

547
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:43,590
Speaker 1: You can see like, you know, grand openings of big stores and the interiors of normal ones and interviews with customers and some of the merch and all this stuff.

548
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,489
Speaker 1: And if you didn't experience these stores yourself, it's a thing to see.

549
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:53,065
Speaker 1: And if you have experienced the stores yourself, it's a nostalgia to see.

550
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,490
Speaker 1: So, why not?

551
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,619
Speaker 2: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is binti.

552
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:02,410
Speaker 2: We'll see when we do the show because we're going to miss a ton of Geek Nights.

553
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:11,630
Speaker 2: I think I'm even going to pause the Patreon for September because I'm going to be with Emily, doing a panel at PAX West, losing on Sunday.

554
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,809
Speaker 2: I will also be doing a bunch of work travel and- No, that's this Sunday.

555
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:20,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it is- No, it's two Sundays from now.

556
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,087
Speaker 2: It is next Sunday, not this Sunday.

557
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:27,430
Speaker 2: I am very happy that you have agreed with me on this versus next Sunday.

558
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:33,706
Speaker 2: Otherwise, you know, work travel, that bike trip- I said two Sundays from now.

559
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:35,687
Speaker 2: Two Sundays from now.

560
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,935
Speaker 2: But website's coming along.

561
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:44,110
Speaker 2: I don't really think we have any other big updates to share just yet.

562
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,170
Speaker 2: Maybe Scott can finish some of the website stuff while we're not doing Geek Nights while I'm doing all this travel.

563
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:49,717
Speaker 1: It depends on the weather.

564
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,969
Speaker 1: This weekend is looking a lot more letter B.

565
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:57,761
Speaker 2: Bike and beach than it is looking- Yeah, no, this weekend is 100% a B weekend.

566
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:00,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

567
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,590
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's go.

568
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:13,730
Speaker 1: So, yeah, what happened was is last week we went to go and see a Radio City Music Hall where I haven't been inside since last millennia.

569
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,030
Speaker 1: Just because there never was a show that I went to see there, just coincidentally.

570
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:35,810
Speaker 1: And we went to see Joe Hisaishi and a large orchestra with choirs and opera singer and his daughter singing and pianists and a guy playing an instrument I don't know the name of that looked like a ukulele and a banjo got together and had a baby.

571
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:48,568
Speaker 1: And they played the works of Hayao Miyazaki while on a giant screen they played clips from movies to accompany the music and the whole place was 100% sold out.

572
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,479
Speaker 1: And it was actually way- I thought it was going to be pretty good.

573
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,605
Speaker 1: It was I'd say better than I thought.

574
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,130
Speaker 1: It was pretty fantastic.

575
00:38:57,691 --> 00:39:00,990
Speaker 1: If you have a chance to ever go to that, I recommend it.

576
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:07,960
Speaker 1: But yeah, he had to cancel his London shows because he got COVID and the US shows got delayed.

577
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,210
Speaker 1: but somehow we still went and it happened and he was alright and it was real good.

578
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,705
Speaker 1: So, but that made me think, hey, we need a Wednesday idea.

579
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:17,670
Speaker 1: We haven't watched the anime.

580
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:21,401
Speaker 1: But how many episodes have we really done about Miyazaki, right?

581
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:24,170
Speaker 1: The legendary anime director, right?

582
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:29,367
Speaker 2: Maybe the most legendary anime director in ancient times in like 2006 or something.

583
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,831
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

584
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:38,948
Speaker 1: I looked it up and even though we talk about him all the goddamn time in the news and other things, we did an episode on Laputa, a whole episode.

585
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:39,790
Speaker 1: It was the main bit.

586
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:47,670
Speaker 1: There were some opening bits or geek bites about other works that we saw but we didn't both see them at the same time or whatever.

587
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,157
Speaker 1: And it's like we really haven't done a whole lot of full episodes about him.

588
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:55,860
Speaker 1: We're like, well, you know what?

589
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,990
Speaker 1: We're not going to like, I don't see us rewatching all of these soon to do full episodes on all of them.

590
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:08,885
Speaker 1: That would be like a year long project for us because it was like, how many just feature films he made that he directed?

591
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,450
Speaker 1: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, twelve.

592
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,489
Speaker 1: Well, the twelfth one is being worked on.

593
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,630
Speaker 1: Only two of them were released.

594
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,617
Speaker 1: Twelve Wednesdays?

595
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,390
Speaker 1: That's like half a year of geek nights.

596
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,690
Speaker 2: Only two of them were released while geek nights was in production.

597
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,720
Speaker 2: I think we had to review The Wind Rises.

599
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,650
Speaker 2: We saw it in the theater and we had a lot to say about it.

600
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:29,721
Speaker 1: I didn't see it.

601
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:30,189
Speaker 1: You saw it.

602
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:33,300
Speaker 1: I saw Princess Kaguya and you didn't.

603
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,330
Speaker 1: You didn't direct but it was still Studio Ghibli.

604
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,198
Speaker 2: You should watch The Wind Rises.

605
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,770
Speaker 2: I could do a review on it right now without even needing to see it again.

606
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,543
Speaker 1: I heard some music from the soundtrack live.

607
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:43,429
Speaker 1: I performed live.

608
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,910
Speaker 2: It's the one where a lot of the background sound is human beings doing foley with their bodies.

609
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:49,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

610
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:54,980
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm like, hey, let's just, you know, get an easy Wednesday idea.

611
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,310
Speaker 1: Let's go and talk about these movies and Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli briefly as a whole.

612
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:01,477
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:02,210
Speaker 2: I think we can focus.

614
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,978
Speaker 1: How can you not have an episode on that?

615
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:06,350
Speaker 1: That seems like a necessary episode to have.

616
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:24,830
Speaker 2: If there is one thing I associate, if you just say the words Miyazaki movie, the things that I think of just off the top of my head immediately are environmental messages and lush backgrounds, lush landscapes, scenes with lots of little shit moving around everywhere.

617
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:34,090
Speaker 1: You love to do that animation, that particular kind of animation that you see, the boar in Manonoke and Panyo, all the water, right?

618
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:41,150
Speaker 1: It's like the motion of like just lots of snakes or like a blob or, you know, even Spirited Away also, right?

619
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,836
Speaker 2: Or people, whenever there is one character, they're animated in a certain way.

620
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:52,950
Speaker 2: Whenever there's a bunch of characters, like in In La Pita, there's the blob of pirates that just appears over and over again doing pirate stuff together.

621
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:53,631
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:41:53,651 --> 00:42:05,170
Speaker 1: It's like this certain, I don't know how they did, just like this is his look of, you know, animating a mass in a certain way that he like keeps going back to and reusing that sort of aesthetic over and over.

623
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,849
Speaker 1: And it's just, it's like an eye candy kind of thing.

624
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:16,329
Speaker 2: I think of with few exceptions, a certain amount of childhood whimsy, strong female protagonists who often look very similar to one another.

625
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:32,150
Speaker 1: You know, that feeling of being in a warm, cozy cottage in the woods alone, but the cottage is full of interesting shit, like, you know, sort of in a maybe like a Roald Dahl kind of way a little bit.

626
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:34,190
Speaker 1: A little bit of that feeling.

627
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,830
Speaker 2: And also just...

628
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,180
Speaker 1: A little bit of Dr.

629
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,810
Speaker 1: Seuss feeling.

630
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,027
Speaker 2: I can say there's definitely a little bit of that in there.

631
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,786
Speaker 2: An absolutely like mind, not mind bending, but just an absolutely fantastic score that gets stuck in your head.

632
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:50,690
Speaker 2: You even think about one of these movies.

633
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:53,690
Speaker 1: Like we just discussed, that's Joe Hisaki's fault.

634
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,429
Speaker 1: Someone chose to hire him, I guess.

635
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,064
Speaker 2: Right.

636
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:01,400
Speaker 1: So, yeah, let's, uh, let's go through.

637
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,010
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about the full length animated features that Miyazaki directed, right?

638
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,628
Speaker 1: So Studio Ghibli is his studio.

639
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,370
Speaker 1: You got to remember a lot of things made by that studio.

640
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:13,769
Speaker 1: He did not direct, you know, someone else directed it.

641
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,890
Speaker 1: He had a different level of involvement in those things, right?

642
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:21,370
Speaker 1: Or, and some of them that they produced were shorter, right?

643
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:25,650
Speaker 1: So, for example, like Pompoco, it was a Studio Ghibli movie.

644
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:27,330
Speaker 1: He was the executive producer.

645
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:28,796
Speaker 1: He was not the director.

646
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:31,506
Speaker 1: He didn't, you know, who knows, did he draw anything for it?

647
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:32,430
Speaker 1: Maybe, right?

648
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,950
Speaker 1: But it's like, doesn't count, right?

649
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,790
Speaker 1: You know, Arrietty, right?

650
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,970
Speaker 1: It's like he was just a co-screenwriter and planner, right?

651
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,630
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, he had some involvement there, but you can't really call that a Miyazaki movie.

652
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,610
Speaker 1: It is clearly a Studio Ghibli movie, right?

653
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:55,710
Speaker 1: There were other ones where, like, he was the director, but they were short, right?

654
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:59,270
Speaker 1: They weren't full-length animated features.

655
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:06,550
Speaker 1: So usually, these are like those ones that they show at the Ghibli Museum only, and you can't see them anywhere else easily.

656
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,079
Speaker 1: I have seen exactly one of those.

657
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, On Your Mark, the music video, right, for example.

658
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,789
Speaker 1: But yeah, so the movie is in chronological order.

659
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:24,530
Speaker 1: The only one from before we were born was, you know, Castle of Cagliostro, which I think we might have done a full episode on that.

660
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:25,928
Speaker 2: If we did, that's an easy show.

661
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,881
Speaker 1: I don't think that was Studio Ghibli, though, right?

662
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,290
Speaker 1: That was just a thing he directed.

663
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,348
Speaker 2: He just directed it and he wrote it.

664
00:44:32,531 --> 00:44:41,270
Speaker 2: And what I love is that Lupin has this already, like, this history that we know today as different people do their take on Lupin.

665
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,729
Speaker 2: Just like Bon, we've talked about that before.

666
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:51,570
Speaker 2: And this Lupin was a mold breaker in that there aren't really other Lupins quite like the Miyazaki Lupin.

667
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,298
Speaker 2: And this is my favorite.

668
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:59,950
Speaker 2: I don't even count it my favorite Lupin because I consider it separate.

669
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:08,110
Speaker 2: It is one of my favorite Miyazaki movies, but it is so different from a lot of the Lupin canon that I wouldn't say it's my favorite Lupin movie.

670
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:14,050
Speaker 2: But it's also my favorite Lupin movie if I combined all the Lupin canons together.

671
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:25,844
Speaker 1: Before this, he had worked on a bunch of these other movies where you can sort of see the one we always go to as a Horus Prince of Sun.

672
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:33,507
Speaker 1: Sort of like the pre-Miyazaki Miyazaki.

673
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:46,530
Speaker 1: You can watch Horus Prince of Sun that he contributed significantly to and you can see a lot of Studio Ghibli Miyazaki stuff in there even though Studio Ghibli didn't exist yet.

674
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:56,390
Speaker 1: And then in Castle of Cagliostro where he's actually directing, you can see it even more even though this is an existing property.

675
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,292
Speaker 1: He didn't write it.

676
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:03,770
Speaker 1: I think he made the screenplay, but he didn't create Lupin, right?

677
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,131
Speaker 2: Yeah, he just took Lupin.

678
00:46:05,152 --> 00:46:18,250
Speaker 2: He took these characters and somehow was able to seamlessly have all of them fit into a Miyazaki kind of story that's lighthearted and earnest and fun and whimsical but also a little dark.

679
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:23,037
Speaker 2: And yet be somehow pretty true to those Lupin characters.

680
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:32,070
Speaker 2: It's kind of amazing considering what those Lupin characters are like in the vast majority of Lupin that came up to the year 1979.

681
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,098
Speaker 1: It also helped that he sort of minimized their involvement in the story, right?

682
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:41,690
Speaker 1: There is not like a shit ton of Jigen in that movie as compared to other Lupin.

683
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,950
Speaker 2: But where he appears with your sword and my anti-tank rifle.

684
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:47,732
Speaker 1: Sure.

685
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:53,330
Speaker 1: Alright, so then the real Studio Ghibli begins and Naoshika comes out right after we're born.

686
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,755
Speaker 1: And now the real deal has begun, right?

687
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,478
Speaker 1: He made the manga Naoshika.

688
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:00,800
Speaker 1: That was his manga.

689
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,905
Speaker 1: He made it all, you know, at least his name is the only name on it.

690
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,468
Speaker 1: He had assistants clearly, right?

691
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,870
Speaker 1: Like all manga authors do.

692
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:10,401
Speaker 1: And the manga, if you haven't read it, it's available in English.

693
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:12,088
Speaker 1: You can buy this big ol' box with it in there.

694
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:12,650
Speaker 1: I've read it all.

695
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that manga is a hell of a thing.

696
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:18,580
Speaker 1: And it tells this huge story.

697
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,090
Speaker 1: And much like Akira, where the movie is, you know, clearly related to the original manga.

698
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,418
Speaker 1: But, you know, sort of does not tell the whole vast sprawling story that the manga tells.

699
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:39,690
Speaker 1: It tells a much more condensed, focused, brief story in the same characters, in the same universe with some similarities, right?

700
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,680
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's sort of like, we didn't just adapt it straight over, you know?

701
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,410
Speaker 1: But yeah, Naoshika is a hell of a thing.

702
00:47:50,050 --> 00:48:00,590
Speaker 2: Yep, it's definitely, even despite only covering such a tiny part of the manga and being pretty constrained in that way, it still tells a very sweeping, epic story.

703
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,593
Speaker 2: And it does a pretty good payoff.

704
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,997
Speaker 2: Like, there's a lot going on in that movie that I very much enjoyed.

705
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:12,889
Speaker 2: I quote it pretty often that "if not now, then when" from the very end of the movie with the weapon.

706
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,610
Speaker 2: I guess, no spoilers for people who somehow have not seen every Miyazaki movie.

707
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,895
Speaker 1: You probably should.

708
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,990
Speaker 1: Any movie we mention here, you should probably watch.

709
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,204
Speaker 2: Yeah, if there's any movie we mention that you have not heard of or seen, just go watch it, like, tonight.

710
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:26,810
Speaker 2: You will not be disappointed.

711
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,730
Speaker 1: They're all on HBO Max.

712
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,188
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see how long that lasts.

713
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,118
Speaker 1: If you're in the US, they're legally available on HBO Max.

714
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:36,744
Speaker 1: And if you're elsewhere in the world, figure it out.

715
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,129
Speaker 1: And no matter where you are in the world, yarrrr.

716
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:50,062
Speaker 2: So, Laputa Castle in the Sky, it might be my favorite Miyazaki movie.

717
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:55,770
Speaker 2: Partly because I am big into precursor technology and stories around that kind of story.

718
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,729
Speaker 1: Well, Naoshika has some of that.

719
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:57,474
Speaker 2: Oh, it does.

720
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,380
Speaker 2: I'm not saying it doesn't.

721
00:48:58,461 --> 00:48:59,789
Speaker 2: Actually, a few of these have that.

722
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,769
Speaker 1: Even Cagliostro has, sort of.

723
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:21,270
Speaker 2: I guess what I liked about Castle in the Sky, specifically, is that it is a movie, a little bit apart from the rest of his movies, where the environmental storytelling tells this extremely sweeping, epic tale of the rise and fall of civilizations.

724
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:26,750
Speaker 2: Like, the background of this movie tells a bigger story than a lot of movies tell in their foreground.

725
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:40,610
Speaker 2: But the foreground movie, somehow, is just this very narrow story about some people who are just existing in this tiny fraction of the time that the background is telling this story about.

726
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:47,324
Speaker 2: Like, the opening credits tell you this entire rise and fall story of civilizations, and there's no words.

727
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:49,830
Speaker 2: You just see it in these very simple imagery.

728
00:49:50,492 --> 00:50:02,570
Speaker 2: I think Laputa, more so than any other movie he made, other than Maybe the Wind Rises, trusts the audience to get it, and trusts the audience to understand what it's trying to say without saying any of that out loud.

729
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,391
Speaker 1: Yeah.

730
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:04,734
Speaker 1: I mean, we did the whole episode on it.

731
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:10,270
Speaker 1: You can listen to that, but I will say that when I think about Laputa, I also think about Zelda games.

732
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:11,013
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

733
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:14,690
Speaker 1: In a Zelda game, there's not a lot of talking too much, right?

734
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:21,150
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, Link walks around a dungeon, and there's an environmental storytelling to it, right?

735
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,179
Speaker 1: It's like just experiencing this place, right?

736
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:28,150
Speaker 1: You now understand, like, what happened here, right?

737
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,654
Speaker 1: And Laputa is the same thing.

738
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:36,310
Speaker 1: All the dialogue in Laputa is about, you know, the people and their, like, current conflict that they're dealing with.

739
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,796
Speaker 1: Pretty much most of the dialogue anyway, right?

740
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:55,490
Speaker 1: But it ends up, you know, they're traveling in the world that they're in, usually in airplanes and other things, and they end up in places that are, you know, amazing, and it's like when you just see the places, you now understand what happened, right?

741
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:05,090
Speaker 1: And that's, you know, you get this really sort of, you know, sense of awe of, like, as if you were yourself standing in some sort of amazing place like that.

742
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:14,510
Speaker 2: That is one thing that most Miyazaki movies do very well, is there will be scenes that inspire a sense of awe, very specifically in a particular way.

743
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:22,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though Laputa carries over a lot of the, you know, the tropes that Naoshika started that you see in all the Ghibli movies, right?

744
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,150
Speaker 1: Like the magical girl heroine character, and all these things we already discussed, right?

745
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:37,270
Speaker 1: You know, it's one of the only ones that has that sort of, like, you know, going to the secret place deal, right?

746
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,162
Speaker 2: Yep.

747
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:40,392
Speaker 1: Anyway, all right.

748
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:43,820
Speaker 1: Totoro is next one, right?

749
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:46,146
Speaker 1: That's probably the most famous one.

750
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:47,590
Speaker 1: It's the one that they use for their logo.

751
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,310
Speaker 2: Totoro and Kiki's are the ones I've seen the least recently again.

752
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:59,030
Speaker 1: Totoro is maybe the one I've seen most least recently, but I've seen Kiki's somewhat recently.

753
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:07,400
Speaker 1: But yeah, Totoro is like, it's just, you know, the story it tells isn't honestly that much of a story.

754
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,221
Speaker 2: Well, because the story it's really telling is that, like, why is this family here?

755
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:17,330
Speaker 2: Like, the story it doesn't tell is sort of the context for the story of Totoro.

756
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:21,790
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of an imaginary friend kind of deal.

757
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:28,850
Speaker 2: How do kids cope with, like, what the adults are talking about and what's actually happening and why we've gone to live in the summer house?

758
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,677
Speaker 1: Right, and I think you do see, there's again a commonality with Zelda, right?

759
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:40,490
Speaker 1: Miyamoto always talks about how he made Zelda 1 by, you know, going into the woods and whatever behind his house, right?

760
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:44,075
Speaker 1: And that sort of feeling, and this is basically that feeling, right?

761
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:53,650
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, the kid goes outside into the woods behind their house and has, you know, their imagination and their adventures even though it's just a small woods behind a house.

762
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:58,330
Speaker 1: Which actually, that's a theme that brings out the cat boss and it brings out everything.

763
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:02,137
Speaker 2: You want to talk about a very specific theme that is common to almost all Miyazaki movies.

764
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:09,310
Speaker 2: There will be a child who has real agency over their own world and the world around them.

765
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:11,592
Speaker 1: Usually.

766
00:53:11,612 --> 00:53:12,756
Speaker 2: Almost all of them.

767
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:15,063
Speaker 2: The ones that don't, like, The Wind Rises does not have that.

768
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,270
Speaker 2: The Wind Rises is a very different movie.

769
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,390
Speaker 1: Parkaroso, not so much.

770
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,870
Speaker 2: Parkaroso is very much like The Wind Rises.

771
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:23,490
Speaker 1: The airplane ones, right?

772
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,230
Speaker 2: Yeah, the airplane ones are about a very different thing.

773
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,494
Speaker 1: Well, Lapita is also an airplane one.

774
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:28,819
Speaker 1: Nachika is also an airplane one.

775
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:29,722
Speaker 1: That's another thing.

776
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:32,030
Speaker 1: Miyazaki fucking loves airplanes, right?

777
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,990
Speaker 2: I would argue that Lapita, I refuse to explain this in detail because we don't have that much time left on the show.

778
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:47,230
Speaker 2: Lapita is the intersection of the rest of what Miyazaki likes to do and specifically the themes of The Wind Rises and Parkaroso.

779
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,723
Speaker 2: But I refuse to explain that further.

780
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:50,750
Speaker 2: I will not elaborate.

781
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,516
Speaker 2: But Pokemon does that too.

782
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:56,950
Speaker 2: And you see this very specifically in Kiki's Delivery Service.

783
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:05,510
Speaker 1: You've got a young girl in Kiki's Delivery Service who comes to a town and creates a business and starts paying rent.

784
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:09,390
Speaker 1: And it's like becoming an instant adult basically.

785
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,890
Speaker 2: Kiki's is just such a delightful, charming movie that everyone should watch.

786
00:54:16,271 --> 00:54:28,910
Speaker 1: The story of it is not a particularly amazing story, but it's just that you don't see that kind of story become a mass media item.

787
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:31,458
Speaker 1: No one sells a book with that kind of story.

788
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,244
Speaker 1: No one sells a movie with that kind of story.

789
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:34,629
Speaker 1: Except this one, right?

790
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:42,062
Speaker 2: So when we get past that, these movies all are very similar to one another in a lot of ways.

791
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:45,430
Speaker 2: They have these very clear thematic connections.

792
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,590
Speaker 2: And then Parkaroso I think hits a lot of people who are watching a Miyazaki canon like a curveball.

793
00:54:53,070 --> 00:55:02,170
Speaker 2: Because it is about fascism, it is about chauvinism, it is an adult movie, but it's animated the same way as all the rest of them.

794
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,682
Speaker 2: It's got the blobs of people and that amazing fist fight scene.

795
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,190
Speaker 2: It's got all the Miyazaki scenes.

796
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:15,465
Speaker 2: That fist fight scene is like, that goes on a top ten list of animated scenes in all movies ever for me.

797
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:17,630
Speaker 2: Maybe top twenty.

798
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:26,210
Speaker 1: It's definitely more, most of Miyazaki movies, all of them, are clearly movies for children first.

799
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:29,156
Speaker 1: Like George Lucas likes to pretend.

800
00:55:29,236 --> 00:55:31,743
Speaker 1: He's like Star Wars is for the children.

801
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,370
Speaker 1: Miyazaki's movies are for the children.

802
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:41,710
Speaker 1: Except, Parkaroso, even if he wants to say it was for the children, I don't think a lot of children would enjoy or understand it.

803
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,893
Speaker 1: I can't imagine how they would.

804
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:54,030
Speaker 1: I don't think I would have enjoyed, I might have slightly enjoyed it, but not understood it when I was a child until maybe at least I had two digits or plus in my age.

805
00:55:54,591 --> 00:56:02,665
Speaker 2: I expect as a child I would have loved Parkaroso and not realized what it was about and be like, "Yeah, the cool pig.

806
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,168
Speaker 2: He's got an airplane.

807
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:04,709
Speaker 2: Yeah!".

808
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:18,810
Speaker 2: But, Parkaroso, much like The Wind Rises, is very much like this deep interrogation of what it is to be a man or what are the consequences of the decisions we make.

809
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:30,230
Speaker 2: It'd be hard to get into it much deeper without getting into Parkaroso, which I feel like we can do a show on at some point, but Parkaroso is a standout movie for me specifically.

810
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:45,970
Speaker 2: It's got this sort of mid-century, it reminds me of a lot of plays and musicals that are sort of set in this Americana mid-century, just in terms of the style of the way people interact and how the towns on these islands act.

811
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:51,589
Speaker 2: Even though it's not set in that setting, it has a similar aesthetic or a similar sort of feel to me.

812
00:56:55,152 --> 00:57:03,730
Speaker 1: Those first four, Naoshika, Laputa, Totoro, Kiki's, those are huge deals, but they were huge deals on the other side of the world.

813
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:10,266
Speaker 1: People still didn't know about any of that stuff outside of that geography in and around Japan.

814
00:57:12,151 --> 00:57:26,270
Speaker 1: Princess Mononoke was sort of the breaking point, where I remember in the year 2000, in between high school and college, I went to Israel and one of the kids I was on the trip with was talking about this movie, Princess Mononoke.

815
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,798
Speaker 1: I didn't know who Miyazaki was, I didn't know anything.

816
00:57:31,142 --> 00:57:32,946
Speaker 1: But he's like, "Oh, you gotta see this movie, it's the

817
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:33,267
Speaker 1: best.".

818
00:57:33,347 --> 00:57:33,688
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

819
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:34,089
Speaker 1: "Alright.".

820
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:41,003
Speaker 1: And then I remember we walked past a movie theater and the poster for the movie was there.

821
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:44,069
Speaker 1: and I'm like, "Oh, this dude was talking about a movie that's out

822
00:57:44,149 --> 00:57:44,390
Speaker 1: now.".

823
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:48,270
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that, I thought it was some older movie I had missed or something.

824
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:55,621
Speaker 2: I had pirated Mononoke Hime with subtitles to watch before it even made it to the US.

825
00:57:55,941 --> 00:58:01,370
Speaker 2: I already had the soundtrack that I pirated, because by then I was already like eight years into being a weeb.

826
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:11,069
Speaker 2: But it was the first anime movie in my entire life where non-weebs knew about it without me being the one to tell them about it.

827
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,890
Speaker 1: Right, well Akira I think was the first one of those.

828
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,409
Speaker 2: Non-weebs in my area did not know about Akira, weirdly.

829
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:21,410
Speaker 1: It was in a local newspaper and shit.

830
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:29,250
Speaker 2: All the people I knew who were into weird sci-fi stuff when I was a kid, they were also already into anime, mostly because I got them into anime.

831
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:35,762
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it was in the theaters around the world to some extent where the other ones weren't.

832
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:39,390
Speaker 1: It got the big time Hollywood dub in the US.

833
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:47,609
Speaker 1: Disney got the famous people to dub it, which was a big deal that hadn't been done, I don't think it had been done before at all for any anime that I'm aware of.

834
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:50,269
Speaker 2: For its minor fault, pretty fantastic.

835
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:54,570
Speaker 1: Not that no anime had been dubbed before, but none had been famous Hollywood big time dubs.

836
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:58,510
Speaker 2: Kiki's actually had a pretty for real dub, but not on the level of Mononoke Hime.

837
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,142
Speaker 1: Wasn't that dub made after?

838
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,049
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, I don't know.

839
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,830
Speaker 2: Yeah, I forget what year that dub was made, I'm not gonna dig through all the Wikipedia's right now.

840
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know when they did that.

841
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,530
Speaker 1: Regardless, was Kiki in the theaters in the US?

842
00:59:11,191 --> 00:59:15,678
Speaker 2: But that was Mononoke and then Spirited Away, like one after another a few years apart.

843
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:23,650
Speaker 2: Those were mainstream movies in America, a lot of people saw them, a lot of people found out who Miyazaki was because of them.

844
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:32,550
Speaker 1: Right, well Mononoke was like, you know, here I am, rest of the world, and it's like, now we know who you are, and then Spirited Away, it's like that guy's back.

845
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:35,029
Speaker 2: From the person who brought you Princess Mononoke.

846
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,777
Speaker 1: Exactly, and that sort of, it was sort of like a combo, right?

847
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:45,070
Speaker 1: Mononoke was the jab, and Spirited Away was the big hook that knocked out the rest of the world.

848
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,610
Speaker 2: I think Spirited Away is the best put together movie.

849
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,170
Speaker 1: But certainly the most popular, best selling, most grossing number one of all.

850
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,496
Speaker 2: I think it's the best put together movie he's ever made.

851
00:59:56,037 --> 01:00:01,130
Speaker 2: I think it's the most technically well made, it's got the tightest script, the tightest story.

852
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:04,450
Speaker 2: Spirited Away is nearly, it might just be a perfect movie.

853
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:08,537
Speaker 1: I think it's clearly the peak Miyazaki, right?

854
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:14,510
Speaker 1: Not to say that everything, the things that came after Spirited Away were still excellent in their own right.

855
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:19,930
Speaker 2: Well I would argue that Wind Rises is more poignant than Spirited Away, but I think Spirited Away is a better movie.

856
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:33,910
Speaker 1: Right, but if you just take in all, if you consider all factors, I feel like Spirited Away was the peak of the Miyazaki mountain, and since then, I'm not saying it's been downhill into the dumps, right?

857
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,464
Speaker 1: But it has not been as high as it was at that point, right?

858
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:38,869
Speaker 1: It is lower than it was then.

859
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:48,230
Speaker 2: Because after that, four years later, we get Ponyo, which was beautiful, and I loved it, but it does not tell much of a story compared to pretty much any Miyazaki movie.

860
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:54,329
Speaker 1: It's kind of a mess a little bit, it's the cohesion of what's going on here, why, why do we care, right?

861
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:00,386
Speaker 1: You know, it has a little bit of that Totoro thing going on where it's like, okay, the kid is Ponyo, right?

862
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:01,409
Speaker 1: Or the kid has the imagination.

863
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:07,110
Speaker 2: I appreciate that it doesn't explain anything and just lets, like, you're just supposed to just roll with it.

864
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,735
Speaker 1: It explains a little bit, right?

865
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:13,650
Speaker 1: There's that weird underwater mad science hatter kind of guy going on, you know.

866
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:18,124
Speaker 1: I'm sure someone out there is mad, like, they know the plot of Ponyo completely.

867
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:19,610
Speaker 1: I saw it once in the theater and that's it.

868
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,451
Speaker 2: I mean, I'd say I know.

869
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:31,150
Speaker 2: The movie does the thing that Lapita does where it just shows you some stuff that's in the background, that's the world, and it trusts that you're just gonna understand it enough to engage with the movie.

870
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,116
Speaker 2: What's really familiar is, in Lapita, that was done extremely well.

871
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:43,190
Speaker 2: In Ponyo, I thought it was done well enough, but a lot of people who saw the movie just did not pick up on those things and were just confused.

872
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,349
Speaker 2: Which is sad, but that's just how movie-watching audiences are.

873
01:01:47,092 --> 01:01:48,570
Speaker 1: Oh, we skipped over Howl's moving cast.

874
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,352
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

875
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:53,925
Speaker 2: Well, Howl's was all fun, but there was, like, no substance there.

876
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:55,850
Speaker 2: It didn't really line up with the book.

877
01:01:56,971 --> 01:02:00,544
Speaker 1: For some reason, like, there's a lot of people I know, like, that's their favorite one.

878
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,950
Speaker 1: Like, they love the shit out of it.

879
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,604
Speaker 2: If you didn't read the books this is based on, what the hell?

880
01:02:05,704 --> 01:02:07,030
Speaker 2: What story did it tell?

881
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:21,310
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, yeah, there's not a lot of context for, like, what's going on, you know, and it's like, I just couldn't, like, bring myself to care about what was happening in Howl's Moving Castle.

882
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:32,810
Speaker 1: Even though the environment and the characters and everything about it were, you know, basically amazing, I couldn't care because I didn't understand without the context.

883
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:39,330
Speaker 2: Much like Howl himself, both in the movie and the books, Howl's Moving Castle, the Miyazaki movie, is just a hot mess.

884
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,238
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say a hot mess.

885
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,209
Speaker 1: I've seen much bigger messes, but...

886
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,790
Speaker 2: Well, as in, it is beautiful.

887
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:47,147
Speaker 1: It's clearly not as...

888
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:54,250
Speaker 2: It is beautiful, it is fun, it is worth watching, but it's just a goddamn mess of a movie.

889
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,390
Speaker 1: Also, Cowsl for the Talking Fire is, like, my favorite game.

890
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:03,870
Speaker 2: Yeah, like, I would watch Howl's Moving Castle again, but it doesn't really fully explore any of the themes it raises.

891
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:08,047
Speaker 2: Like, it raises a lot of interesting ideas and then just drops them.

892
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:12,157
Speaker 2: And it kind of just peters out toward the end.

893
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:14,142
Speaker 2: Like, the movie just gets less and less...

894
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:22,390
Speaker 1: It's a kind of magnifiable, like, you know, flow with a big climax and a, you know, resolution.

895
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:28,703
Speaker 2: And while Ponyo has similar problems, at least Ponyo sort of gets more and more dreamlike.

896
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:31,710
Speaker 2: and then there's this moment where you feel like you woke up from a dream.

897
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,478
Speaker 2: Howl's doesn't really have a moment like that.

898
01:03:34,498 --> 01:03:37,890
Speaker 2: Howl's just meanders off into nowhere and then the credits roll.

899
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:39,371
Speaker 1: Alright.

900
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:40,557
Speaker 1: And then there's Wind Rises.

901
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:46,510
Speaker 1: that was Miyazaki going off on his own... Yeah, the Wind Rises... Airplane fanboyism again.

902
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,762
Speaker 2: And I would argue it is Miy- because you know what it's about, right?

903
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:51,230
Speaker 2: Do you know what this movie is about?

904
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:52,925
Speaker 1: It's about the dude...

905
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:02,490
Speaker 2: It is about the dude who basically designed the Zero, like, the fighter that Japanese forces used in World War II.

906
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:12,630
Speaker 2: And the story is basically this guy made these death machines because he loved the beauty of their mechanism and their design.

907
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:18,530
Speaker 2: And he willfully turned a blind eye to what they were going to be used for.

908
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,457
Speaker 2: That is what this movie is about.

909
01:04:20,518 --> 01:04:22,389
Speaker 2: He was in love with aviation.

910
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:30,250
Speaker 2: The only way to express that was by making war machines that killed countless people in one of the worst conflicts in human history.

911
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:40,690
Speaker 2: And the movie is about the disconnect between the craft and the progress of humanity and the reality of those weapons being used by fascists to murder people.

912
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:47,730
Speaker 2: And the movie does this in many layers, and I will elaborate in a show at some point.

913
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,964
Speaker 2: And he's got a new one coming!

914
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:51,910
Speaker 2: How do you live?

915
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,470
Speaker 1: The one that he's trying, you know, he refuses to retire.

916
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,549
Speaker 2: I feel like he's asking this question of himself at this point.

917
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,069
Speaker 1: Well that's the title of the book it's based on.

918
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,587
Speaker 1: So the author, Genzaburo is the author, right?

919
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:10,349
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yoshino Genzaburo.

920
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:12,065
Speaker 1: Right.

921
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:12,230
Speaker 1: Right?

922
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:15,717
Speaker 1: But yeah, the book is called How Do You Live?

923
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:19,950
Speaker 1: It's like a famous book that I haven't read.

924
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:26,170
Speaker 1: But the book is, I think we did a news or a thing of the day or something, when the book became available in English.

925
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,101
Speaker 1: And I put it on my list to read it at some point.

926
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:30,808
Speaker 1: Maybe it could be a book club book.

927
01:05:30,828 --> 01:05:31,250
Speaker 1: Who knows?

928
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,426
Speaker 1: Maybe when the movie comes out we'll read it.

929
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:33,910
Speaker 1: I don't know.

930
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,230
Speaker 2: I think this is very important.

931
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,449
Speaker 1: Will the movie come out?

932
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:47,492
Speaker 2: It's the movie about the coming of age of a teenager, but more importantly it was published in 1937.

933
01:05:47,492 --> 01:06:01,110
Speaker 2: And knowing that, and knowing what Miyazaki's previous movie was about, it is easy to see that he's exploring these themes of fascism and its intersection with art and its intersection with life.

934
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:09,810
Speaker 2: And we'll see what this movie is, but I feel like this is going to be a lot more like The Wind Rises and a lot less like Kiki's Delivery Service.

935
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we'll see if it comes out.

936
01:06:12,197 --> 01:06:15,650
Speaker 1: And if it does come out and he's still alive, is he going to keep going?

937
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,869
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you feel like he's, you know.

938
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,270
Speaker 1: Right?

939
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:20,012
Speaker 1: I don't know.

940
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:25,430
Speaker 1: I have the book about Miyazaki, the starting point book that I haven't read at all.

941
01:06:26,952 --> 01:06:31,390
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's like he's a cranky old man who smokes a lot.

942
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:36,948
Speaker 1: You know, it's like wow, but he's still at it somehow.

943
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:37,410
Speaker 1: Alright.

944
01:06:37,851 --> 01:06:38,679
Speaker 1: And he works too much.

945
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,810
Speaker 1: All he does is draw.

946
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:51,730
Speaker 2: Well I guess the important takeaway is that regardless of which of his movies you like or don't like or your opinions on any of them in particular, Miyazaki and his works are absolutely unignorable.

947
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:56,030
Speaker 2: They are deeply important to the history of animation and the history of cinema.

948
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:59,070
Speaker 2: And I think every one of them is worth watching.

949
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,270
Speaker 2: Without exception.

950
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:03,097
Speaker 1: Who else, right?

951
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:07,630
Speaker 1: We've seen like, you could say Disney as a whole, but it's like, alright.

952
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:13,790
Speaker 2: There are some Disney animated features that are not actually required viewing in the year 2022.

953
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,612
Speaker 1: Oh, there's plenty.

954
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:17,820
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is like, what individual animation...

955
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:22,536
Speaker 2: ...animated feature?

956
01:07:22,556 --> 01:07:24,690
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's some sinkers in there.

957
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:36,450
Speaker 1: If you have taken any person in throughout his history, right, who has directed animated movies, right, and you compare their entire bodies of work up against each other, right?

958
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,850
Speaker 1: It's like Miyazaki's just gonna win by a lot, right?

959
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,669
Speaker 1: It's just an avalanche.

960
01:07:41,631 --> 01:07:43,250
Speaker 1: Like who's even in second place?

961
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,375
Speaker 2: Like Tezuka.

962
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:46,909
Speaker 2: You're already talking about Tezuka in terms of volume of output.

963
01:07:47,752 --> 01:07:51,340
Speaker 1: What movies, what animated movies did Tezuka direct?

964
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:53,004
Speaker 1: And how many of them?

965
01:07:53,044 --> 01:07:54,869
Speaker 1: He drew a lot of manga, right?

966
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:55,390
Speaker 1: Tons of it.

967
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,141
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, that's quantity, right?

968
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:02,110
Speaker 1: Not all of them are quality, even though many are the highest quality.

969
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:05,541
Speaker 1: It's like, just look at directed animated movies.

970
01:08:05,903 --> 01:08:07,549
Speaker 1: It's like there's no one even close.

971
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:20,450
Speaker 2: Miyazaki's like, it's almost like a Babe Ruth situation, but imagine if there was a Babe Ruth type baseball player who, every three or four years, just suddenly is on the bench on the team, out of nowhere.

972
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:21,792
Speaker 2: You're like, "Oh, I guess he's

973
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:22,073
Speaker 2: back."

974
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:27,609
Speaker 2: And he comes out, and his at-bat is a spectacle, and then he disappears for a few years.

975
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:33,750
Speaker 1: I think it's like Wayne Gretzky, like he's got numbers that no one else is gonna, no one's breaking, they're just not, it's not happening.

976
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,095
Speaker 1: It's like no one's gonna break the records that they have.

977
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,599
Speaker 1: He's too strong.

978
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:43,390
Speaker 1: But I think he'll be a legendary artist, right?

979
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,173
Speaker 1: I think if you wait like a century or so, right?

980
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:58,609
Speaker 1: It's like, I think it's pretty clear that Miyazaki's gonna be like a Van Gogh level of famous, you know, Michelangelo level of, you know, art history, like he'll be in the art history book, right?

981
01:08:58,669 --> 01:08:59,710
Speaker 1: Next to all those people.

982
01:09:04,482 --> 01:09:06,728
Speaker 2: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

991
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,643
Speaker 2: Stop all the downloading.

992
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:59,020
Speaker 2: The next station is Downsview Park, Downsview Park Station, and a bunch of people whose names I'm not gonna say.

993
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:06,620
Speaker 2: Like I said, I am probably going to pause the Patreon during September, just because we'll be skipping so many shows due to all that travel.

994
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,520
Speaker 2: So that'll save those of you whose names I have said at least five bucks.

995
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,606
Speaker 2: And yeah, just enjoying summer.

996
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:19,740
Speaker 2: Stay safe out there, and I will simply leave you right now with something you should have expected.

997
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:30,504
Speaker 0: Hey, you can break your back.

998
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:31,507
Speaker 0: On the giant slide.
