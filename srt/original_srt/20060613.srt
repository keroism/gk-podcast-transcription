1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,133
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 13th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,980
Speaker 0: We reminisce about counter-strike.

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,670
Speaker 0: Let's do this today in white Plains.

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,550
Speaker 0: I discovered an abomination unto man Really?

5
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:28,491
Speaker 0: I wanted to go to a mall down there and I drove and I parked far away because I was doing some other stuff.

6
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:32,299
Speaker 0: and then I walked over to the mall and I Realized that I didn't see the entrance.

7
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:40,290
Speaker 0: So I started walking around the mall and I walked all the way around it twice and then it came to me that no Long walk to walk around a mall twice.

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:40,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

9
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:47,302
Speaker 0: I had some free time But it turns out that there is absolutely no pedestrian entrance to this mall Whatsoever.

10
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:51,460
Speaker 1: Oh, is there like a giant cement concrete wall surrounding the whole thing?

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,141
Speaker 0: No, it was.

12
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:54,528
Speaker 0: just imagine a mall with no exits.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,400
Speaker 1: I mean so to the building itself or to the parking lots around it.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,624
Speaker 0: There's no parking lots around it.

15
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,030
Speaker 0: There's a big parking garage in it.

16
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,820
Speaker 1: Okay, and you couldn't walk into that parking garage?

17
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,259
Speaker 0: No, there's only four cars.

18
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:10,929
Speaker 1: So the only way to get into this mall would be to park in the parking garage Yes, and then walk into the mall.

19
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:17,593
Speaker 0: there were lots of emergency exits But they were very formidable and industrial looking and there were absolutely no ways in.

20
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,639
Speaker 1: also so into the building itself.

21
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,170
Speaker 0: you mean Into them if there's no way in anywhere.

22
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,582
Speaker 0: I think it's a pretty simple concept Huh?

23
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,289
Speaker 0: There was no way in unless you drove.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,179
Speaker 1: so it's a building sitting in the middle of what a field.

25
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:36,380
Speaker 0: No, it's in white plain surrounded by hundreds of other buildings, okay, so it's bordered by roads and a parking garage.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,524
Speaker 0: Well, the parking garage is in it.

27
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,015
Speaker 1: Okay, as I said and the only door to get in.

28
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:45,710
Speaker 0: Well, there's no doors There's just elevators in the parking garage that go to the mall parts.

29
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,358
Speaker 1: Oh, it's one of those now.

30
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:48,819
Speaker 1: I get it.

31
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,118
Speaker 1: I've seen those before.

32
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:54,514
Speaker 1: Okay, the way you're describing I thought maybe it was like like why?

33
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,220
Speaker 0: what could you possibly be imagining?

34
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,449
Speaker 0: This is like when you thought up was away from the Sun.

35
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,624
Speaker 1: well because and I think about a mall a mall is a you Know is is separated.

36
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:05,291
Speaker 1: It has a big field of parking lots all around.

37
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,755
Speaker 0: what a lot of malls don't.

38
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,539
Speaker 1: this isn't some mega mall.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,392
Speaker 1: This is you know, this is a building in the middle of a city.

40
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,176
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's.

41
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,140
Speaker 0: oh, it's a mega mall.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,426
Speaker 0: It's absolutely huge.

43
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not in fact, it's bigger than the mall in Rochester I think in terms of the amount of space in it.

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,934
Speaker 1: Well, the ball in Rochester is tiny but the you know It doesn't have the same structure as the the usual mall.

45
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:31,151
Speaker 0: whatever you seem to have trouble with Imagining architecture as we learned in that D&D.

46
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:31,795
Speaker 1: It's not like.

47
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:32,720
Speaker 1: you described it very well.

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,440
Speaker 1: You said it as a mall with no entrances, which it was a descriptive because that's all that.

49
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,007
Speaker 0: That's the operative part of the story.

50
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:40,252
Speaker 0: It was a mall with no entrances.

51
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:41,497
Speaker 0: That was behind of the cars.

52
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:41,899
Speaker 1: get in.

53
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,633
Speaker 0: Well, there's an entrance for the car and I said specifically pedestrian entrances.

54
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, why didn't you walk in where the cars went in?

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,183
Speaker 0: They wouldn't let me.

56
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:50,556
Speaker 0: there's a guy there and he said this is for cars only.

57
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,139
Speaker 0: you can't walk in.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,955
Speaker 0: Okay, I Walked through a loading dock and a urine-soaked hallway and got into the mall.

59
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:00,138
Speaker 1: Wow Wow, that's kind of crazy.

60
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:05,116
Speaker 0: But for my news in that mall, I bought the cheapest Mac mini money can buy.

61
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,284
Speaker 0: Hooray And an iPod.

62
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,208
Speaker 1: All right, everyone.

63
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,352
Speaker 1: It's time to tell rim.

64
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:13,489
Speaker 1: we convinced him to buy something Expensive for you know what he needed.

65
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,960
Speaker 0: I was probably going to buy it anyway.

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried to buy it before but you can't ship Apple things to yourself without signatures before.

67
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,438
Speaker 1: Yeah before meaning yesterday meaning after we were convincing you.

68
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:32,540
Speaker 0: now I like it and I'm gonna use it mostly for podcasting once I figure out garage band and all that.

69
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,250
Speaker 0: But long term at least for my initial uses.

70
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,600
Speaker 0: I really couldn't use a Mac as my primary desktop.

71
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,947
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about that next Monday.

72
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:42,054
Speaker 1: Yep, because that's not what today's about.

73
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,980
Speaker 1: today's about two games.

74
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,751
Speaker 0: Well, weren't you gonna do your news?

75
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,080
Speaker 1: yep to gaming news.

76
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,360
Speaker 1: Okay, my gaming news.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,911
Speaker 1: So there's this guy and he decided to make a World of Warcraft strategy guide and that kind of reminds me I had a friend who?

78
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:03,920
Speaker 1: bought himself a Super Nintendo by making Mortal Kombat strategy guides back in the olden days and selling them in school.

79
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:07,419
Speaker 1: And then he got in trouble for it because you're not allowed to sell stuff in school.

80
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:10,192
Speaker 0: We used to just play poker straight up in school.

81
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,237
Speaker 0: Yeah for money.

82
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:11,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,012
Speaker 1: So anyway, this guy wrote a World of Warcraft strategy guide and you know Regardless of what you think about gold farming.

84
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,526
Speaker 1: It was a gold farming guide Whatever.

85
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:24,800
Speaker 1: That's not the point of the story.

86
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:37,235
Speaker 1: the point of the story was that he was selling it for $15 as a PDF on eBay, you know by now 15 bucks and Blizzard came down on him like a ton of bricks and he said screw you.

87
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,880
Speaker 1: and he kept trying to make new eBay accounts.

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:59,819
Speaker 1: He didn't take it like most people take it in the ass And he kept fighting it and fighting it and fighting it and eventually without even having to go to court Blizzard just gave up and they agreed just recently to Let him go about his business as long as a. he leaves the disclaimer that was already in the book in the book

89
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,249
Speaker 0: Saying that he's not affiliated with World of Warcraft or Blizzard and

90
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,080
Speaker 1: that he's not using any copyrighted materials of World of Warcraft or Blizzard

91
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:13,060
Speaker 0: Even though he could use a significant number of copyrighted materials per fair use especially since it is a guide

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,718
Speaker 1: Yep, but he's not using any.

93
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:24,206
Speaker 1: He also has to not publish any sort of cheats and hacks or links to cheats and hacks in the book Which I don't think he was.

94
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,176
Speaker 0: but even if he did that's not illegal.

95
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:26,940
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,540
Speaker 0: They can't they really can't go after him for that.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Speaker 1: But he did now he you know to basically keep Blizzard from fighting against him and pestering him.

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,790
Speaker 1: He made that agreement with them.

99
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,100
Speaker 1: So now it's a contract I guess.

100
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:50,935
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see but the point of this story is if someone comes after you like an evil company for something that you know is perfectly Legal don't take it if you fight back if they realize that they're wrong.

101
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,719
Speaker 1: They pretty much have to give in to you.

102
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,465
Speaker 0: Not always.

103
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,279
Speaker 0: they could just sue you and win if they have good lawyers and you can't afford one.

104
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:07,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when it's in the problem is when it's an open and shut case like this The lawyers are like, alright don't we don't want to go to court But I don't want to sound like idiots when they go there.

105
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,129
Speaker 0: But then again, is it so open and shut?

106
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:16,655
Speaker 0: because I mean if they have lawyers and money They could probably talk about implied contracts and EULA's and talk their way into a conviction to something.

107
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:18,279
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

108
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,205
Speaker 0: We see it happen a lot.

109
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:22,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not when it's something so obvious.

110
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:23,495
Speaker 1: It's like god.

111
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

112
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:27,978
Speaker 1: Plus hey, you know the.

113
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:36,919
Speaker 1: If it was something so obvious that I knew I could win I would go out and get like the best lawyers I could but they usually won't work for free for something like that.

114
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I know I'm gonna win I won't care why because you still have to pay the lawyer?

115
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll get the lawyers to counter sue to get their money.

116
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:46,455
Speaker 0: It doesn't always work.

117
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:47,759
Speaker 0: So well, I think it'll work.

118
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,897
Speaker 0: Maybe you should ask my lawyer about that.

119
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,865
Speaker 1: How'd you go ask your lawyer?

120
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,970
Speaker 1: Cuz I can't ask your lawyer.

121
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,155
Speaker 0: Oh, you can ask him through me.

122
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,462
Speaker 0: You can just call him Whatever.

123
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a bother him soon.

124
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:00,990
Speaker 0: I got some questions.

125
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,515
Speaker 1: You got any news action.

126
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:08,080
Speaker 0: I had my news about a Mac Scott took forever doing his laundry and it's real late.

127
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,855
Speaker 0: My laundry was done at like 10.

128
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:15,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, my law I just started mine later because you know, we can only have one washing machine.

129
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:19,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it helped that your laundry was sitting idle for quite some time.

130
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,111
Speaker 1: while you dick There's only sitting around idle for like five minutes.

131
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

132
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:27,526
Speaker 1: Yeah Just Cuz you can't wait for me to do.

133
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,354
Speaker 1: I said I'd had three loads and you're like.

134
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,419
Speaker 1: you said you had two loads.

135
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,189
Speaker 0: You listen what I talk now cuz you talk wrong.

136
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:33,991
Speaker 0: I should have recorded it.

137
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:38,096
Speaker 0: I said anyway, it's late So we're gonna do a short episode.

138
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,127
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

139
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,659
Speaker 0: I actually found something kind of cool.

140
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:52,516
Speaker 0: There's this video of a plane a passenger plane a big jetliner landing at an airport.

141
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:53,419
Speaker 0: I don't know what Airport.

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:08,079
Speaker 0: and There's this really really strong crosswind and as the planes coming down it kind of turns sideways and Hovers there using its engines to hold itself into the wind and slowly lowers itself and then turns back around.

143
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,146
Speaker 0: and Lance It's crazy.

144
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,479
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

145
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,007
Speaker 1: You got to wonder what the pilots doing there.

146
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,675
Speaker 0: I imagine he's either real lucky or real skilled.

147
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:23,041
Speaker 1: I Mean if that plane would have not turned back in the right direction Whoo, it looks like there's some water there.

148
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,926
Speaker 1: they would have ended up in.

149
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,390
Speaker 0: yeah But I don't think there's any other way to land over there.

150
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:30,230
Speaker 0: I I have this feeling that that sort of thing is a common occurrence and the pilot just knew what to do.

151
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:34,429
Speaker 1: Here's a hint don't build airports places like that.

152
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:39,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I've heard that actually Hong Kong Airport is a lot like that because there was nowhere else to put one.

153
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:41,590
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah, you got no choice.

154
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,729
Speaker 0: But and actually I heard on NPR today that experts said if New York, New Jersey don't build another Airport real soon The state's screwed.

155
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,563
Speaker 0: Really JFK is already running at full capacity and LaGuardia is at about 95 right?

156
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:58,023
Speaker 1: No, because it JFK There's the old TWA terminal.

157
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what they're unused.

158
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:12,550
Speaker 0: There's this huge thing on NPR this morning where they talked about how JFK and LaGuardia can't handle the air load into the New York City anymore at all and How if we don't build a new airport then within ten years there will not be a way.

159
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:21,864
Speaker 1: I'll have to go check that out because Because what I've been to JFK and they have terminals that are sitting there abandoned that they could use Yeah, apparently they can't or something or they can't.

160
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:25,337
Speaker 1: there's not enough Runway and not a terminal.

161
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:25,799
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

162
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,050
Speaker 0: there's not enough capacity there for the expected load.

163
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:33,130
Speaker 0: Could be since New York City is one of the few cities where the economy is in the upswing and crime is going down.

164
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:33,632
Speaker 1: Yep.

165
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:34,395
Speaker 1: All right.

166
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,283
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is actually game related.

167
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:36,886
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

168
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:37,569
Speaker 1: Really?

169
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:48,294
Speaker 1: Yep This is a guy named flying omelet and he made a website with his top 50 favorite video game ending songs Extravaganza part one.

170
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,438
Speaker 0: All right, what's number one?

171
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,255
Speaker 1: Number one, I believe is an RPG Named.

172
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,449
Speaker 1: it's an RPG heavy list, by the way.

173
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,239
Speaker 0: Well RPGs tend to have the best music.

174
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,365
Speaker 1: Yes, some of them number one.

175
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,756
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 6.

176
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,291
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 4.

177
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,618
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 4. at a great 3 chrono trigger.

178
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:14,828
Speaker 1: number 4 is the first is the one of the only non RPGs in the top of the list Panzer Dragoon saga.

179
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:26,190
Speaker 1: and You know number 5 is Metroid 6 earthbound, you know, the list is pretty Expected but some of them with the real good part of this list is number one.

180
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,548
Speaker 1: He's got an mp3 for pretty much every song in the whole thing.

181
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:37,588
Speaker 1: he's got MIDI's for a whole lot of them and Some of them are games you never even heard of.

182
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:39,182
Speaker 1: like.

183
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,382
Speaker 1: What's the crazy one?

184
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:44,353
Speaker 1: I never heard of Hyperzone.

185
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,638
Speaker 1: you ever heard of hyperzone?

186
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,667
Speaker 0: never I don't really care to either.

187
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,350
Speaker 1: How about skyblazer?

188
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,273
Speaker 0: I've heard of that.

189
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,677
Speaker 0: I've heard that before.

190
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:54,587
Speaker 0: I don't know what the game is, but I've heard the word skyblazer.

191
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:59,243
Speaker 1: Yeah Megaman 2 and 3 were on the list, but they were pretty low.

192
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:02,598
Speaker 1: but considering the top 50 I'll let it slide a little bit.

193
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, Megaman 2 didn't have the greatest ending music.

194
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,838
Speaker 1: Megaman 2 had excellent ending music.

195
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,124
Speaker 0: you talking about a good music.

196
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,310
Speaker 0: the ending song wasn't that special.

197
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:13,462
Speaker 1: Number 49 is Drakken, which is one of those games.

198
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:18,390
Speaker 0: It's impossible God Drakken I could do a whole show about how bad that game was.

199
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:24,630
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of bad games on this list that I for some reason or another this guy thinks they have good ending music.

200
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,101
Speaker 0: I definitely agree with the guys top three at least.

201
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,170
Speaker 1: I don't say they're the numb.

202
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,778
Speaker 0: Do you remember the ending song to Final Fantasy 4?

203
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:33,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

204
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,764
Speaker 1: and while ending songs.

205
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,709
Speaker 0: Oh, oh do you how'd it go?

206
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:39,564
Speaker 0: But I thought you said you remembered.

207
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,988
Speaker 1: I do but I can't sing it.

208
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,570
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, when something like this, let me push the button on the computer here, right?

209
00:11:46,771 --> 00:12:03,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, you know while RPGs have you know, usually the good epic music There are plenty of musics in other Genres of video game music that are better, you know It's sort of like it's picking Final Fantasy 6 and 4 and krona trigger.

210
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,241
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you're picking the same song three times now.

211
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,345
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 6 is ending.

212
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:12,149
Speaker 1: song was vastly different from fours Yeah, but it's the same kind of song.

213
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:13,414
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

214
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:14,758
Speaker 0: the same kind of song?

215
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:24,065
Speaker 1: It's like if I made a list of best Songs ever period and I chose all like rock songs for the top 25.

216
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:30,110
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, seriously You know, it's like picking best video game songs ever and choosing mostly RPGs.

217
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:35,550
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's partly that RPG music tends to be more classical and more complex in nature.

218
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:40,750
Speaker 1: Yep, that's true, which generally but that doesn't make it necessarily better than other music.

219
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:48,884
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what criteria is using for better and I think yeah the guys criteria I have to let him slide also is that it's his top 50 favorites.

220
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,490
Speaker 1: So this is this guy's favorites.

221
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,801
Speaker 1: He's not claiming that these are the best ones.

222
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,530
Speaker 0: Well, I at least agree with him.

223
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:59,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I slight I would take his top 50 and just put him in a different order probably.

224
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:05,835
Speaker 1: So because rim is all tired and wussy and yeah, Scott's tired, too I'm not tired.

225
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:06,881
Speaker 0: We got to get this done.

226
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,570
Speaker 0: It's late and I want to play with my max amor.

227
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:09,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're late.

228
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:09,979
Speaker 1: It's late.

229
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,129
Speaker 1: You want to play with the Mac and I don't care anyway.

230
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,886
Speaker 1: Today we're gonna talk about something real easy to talk about real old not that old.

231
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,110
Speaker 1: It's still being played today.

232
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,033
Speaker 0: I haven't though.

233
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:26,450
Speaker 0: I haven't personally played it in over a year me either but that's besides the point hasn't changed very much.

234
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:34,653
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about the classic perhaps number one FPS ever in existence multiplayer FPS Counter-strike.

235
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:54,827
Speaker 0: I mean for anyone who doesn't really realize it counter-strike was the number one FPS in terms of number of players for pretty much the entirety of the time we were in college pretty much from the end of the quake 2 era Until the World of Warcraft era when people just started the FPS has started dropping out of favor.

236
00:13:55,348 --> 00:14:10,289
Speaker 1: even so counter-strike is still played by thousands and thousands of people around the world at to this day is Perhaps the most popular multiplayer online game ever to exist and it is doubtful whether it will ever be beaten

237
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:14,223
Speaker 0: Other than lineage possibly in terms of raw numbers, but that is

238
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:14,945
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft.

239
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,270
Speaker 1: is beaten lineage in numbers now?

240
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,878
Speaker 0: Oh now it is.

241
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:28,650
Speaker 1: Yeah So, but this is you know counter-strike is a game where there were always around the world Thousands perhaps tens of thousands people playing it constantly no matter where you live.

242
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:37,490
Speaker 0: There were low ping servers near you that were full all the time and it's been going on For how long since since about the year?

243
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,353
Speaker 0: 1999.

244
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:42,261
Speaker 1: so seven years give or take something like that.

245
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:45,371
Speaker 0: It really really took off the summer of 2000.

246
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:49,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's when it lost and then it took off again.

247
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:54,236
Speaker 0: I forget which beta came out, but there was one I think was 1.3 Something.

248
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,364
Speaker 1: 1.3 wasn't beta.

249
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:56,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was one point.

250
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:57,397
Speaker 1: Oh was non.

251
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:02,079
Speaker 0: 1.0 was non beta and one of those versions Shortly after there is when the game exploded crazy like it.

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,410
Speaker 1: at one point one was an explosion and beta 7 was an explosion.

253
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, beta 7 is the one I think I was thinking of.

254
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:12,270
Speaker 1: yeah, so let's talk about how we started playing counter-strike.

255
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,012
Speaker 0: All right.

256
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:19,010
Speaker 0: Well that thing is I tried it first before Scott, but Scott played it before I did.

257
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:32,007
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird, but I'd heard of this counter-strike and so I think it was can or someone told me to play it and I got it and I played it and I died right away and then I died again and the game was just frustrating and difficult and I quit immediately.

258
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:43,090
Speaker 1: and that was it For me in high school, we only had dial-up modem so I couldn't play too many online games besides Diablo 2 else would never play again.

259
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:51,928
Speaker 1: And I had half-life 1 which I beat and I really like half-life 1 And I wanted to play some multiplayer games.

260
00:15:51,948 --> 00:16:07,017
Speaker 1: and So when I got to college, I played Team Fortress classic mostly the hunted type Which is where you which is sort of like counter-strike with a VIP You know, you got to get this VIP to the to the garage so he's safe But the other guys are trying to snipe him.

261
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,349
Speaker 1: It's it's actually the only decent Team Fortress scenario.

262
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:18,790
Speaker 1: anyway in CS1 lab the lab instructor was like, oh you got to play counter-strike.

263
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you die, you don't come back.

264
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,484
Speaker 1: and I was like, well that sucks.

265
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,490
Speaker 1: I'm gonna die and then sit around doing nothing.

266
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,246
Speaker 1: I'll just turn the game off or you know quit and go find another game to play.

267
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:30,089
Speaker 1: and what's the point of that?

268
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:36,789
Speaker 1: Now I had heard of counter-strike, but I didn't really Know that it was a free half-life mod.

269
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:41,970
Speaker 1: I thought it was some game and that's all I knew is there was a game named counter-strike that I didn't want to play.

270
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:49,350
Speaker 0: See at least cuz I had a cable modem Early early on like me and my friend Ken got cable modems when they were still kind of being rolled out in the country.

271
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,843
Speaker 0: So we were playing for every freaking mod quake 1 and quake 2 online pretty all through high school.

272
00:16:54,863 --> 00:17:03,329
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm counter-strike was just another one and Honestly when I first played it, I thought this is like a crappy version of action quake.

273
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:06,290
Speaker 1: Anyway.

274
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,910
Speaker 1: So then, you know, someone told me that counter-strike was actually a free half-life mod.

275
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,807
Speaker 1: So, of course, I'm gonna try it because I'll try it once why not free.

276
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:25,609
Speaker 1: Hey So I tried it and then whoa There's counter-strike from there on till tribes 2 and then counter-strike again and then natural selection and then counter-strike again.

277
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:34,939
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz Scott tells me not too long because this is when we we knew and this is the crew would all come together But we were still freshmen at RIT So we weren't really the front row crew fully yet.

278
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,188
Speaker 0: and I still have all the chat logs from back then when I used ICQ.

279
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,876
Speaker 0: Oh, those were good days.

280
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:41,619
Speaker 1: Nah.

281
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,422
Speaker 0: Yeah.

282
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,485
Speaker 0: I see you as the bomb.

283
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,759
Speaker 0: Javert does more and better Yeah, but Javert wasn't around back then.

284
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

285
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:48,549
Speaker 1: it was just not as good as it is now.

286
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:52,030
Speaker 0: It was not around in a form that I would have used.

287
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,250
Speaker 1: No No one that you you don't use anything.

288
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:55,474
Speaker 0: But Scott messaged me.

289
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:59,810
Speaker 0: one is I'm playing counter-strike and it's great and I remember thinking I remember trying that game.

290
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,778
Speaker 0: It was just a slow version of action quake.

291
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:13,550
Speaker 0: No, I don't know why I would play that half-life one was crap Mmm, because the back then Quake 2 was still really big for the mods and the quake 2 mods were just about to die.

292
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:18,029
Speaker 1: It's like as counter-strike gained in popularity quake 2 dropped off a cliff.

293
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:30,929
Speaker 0: Yep, because before counter-strike took off I mean action quake and weapons factory and even like mega TF for quake 1 were still super super super popular Relatively, I mean if you compare it to the popular of games now.

294
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:31,712
Speaker 1: It was.

295
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:41,102
Speaker 1: it was there a popular relative to the time when you see when an FPS gaming wasn't Super crazy huge and not in broadband wasn't widespread.

296
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, the pills games were wicked more popular than any other game.

297
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people who had broadband were pretty much guaranteed to be in that culture of you know mod FPS quake 2 style gaming.

298
00:18:51,891 --> 00:19:04,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, if graphic in game development had gone slower and network speeds had gone faster Then quake 2 would be now And we all had broadband and it would be the number one game.

299
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:08,690
Speaker 0: Yep And we could do a whole show about the progression of like the quake 2 era.

300
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,420
Speaker 1: I think we already did a show about FPS is.

301
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,210
Speaker 1: so yeah, we'd let's stick to the counter-strike.

302
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:23,533
Speaker 0: but I tried the game again and I started getting it and I started liking it and I played it pretty much continuously until Natural selection.

303
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:30,495
Speaker 0: I was discovered by me and then I went back to it and then tribes 2 came out and tribes 2 came out Before natural selection.

304
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:31,781
Speaker 0: try well long before.

305
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,550
Speaker 0: I don't really remember the chronology.

306
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,356
Speaker 0: All I remember is when tribes 2 came out.

307
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:39,070
Speaker 0: We stopped playing counter-strike pretty much until tribes 2 died.

308
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how it went.

309
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:44,000
Speaker 1: Tribes - it's like counter-strike was this game.

310
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,570
Speaker 1: You could always go back to because there are people always playing it.

311
00:19:46,610 --> 00:20:04,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, like every other FPS that came out, you know was just a dent in Counter-strike, you know unreal would come out and a few counter-strike people would go to unreal and then some of them would come back And every time a new big FPS came out counter-strike would go down a little bit and then go back up a little bit less Than that.

312
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:12,147
Speaker 1: So, you know after it reaches peak it's been declining but It's still there with still thousands of players.

313
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:19,696
Speaker 0: Yep I still I'll still bet that it's probably one of the most played FPS is still oh Absolutely, if not the most played.

314
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,140
Speaker 1: just think about all those FPS.

315
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,710
Speaker 1: is that put a dent in counter-strike over the years are now mostly dead.

316
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:25,754
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean the.

317
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,929
Speaker 0: the only real survivor that I know of is natural selection, which is hanging on.

318
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,879
Speaker 1: There's that battlefield.

319
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,623
Speaker 1: people play then.

320
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:33,026
Speaker 0: Yep.

321
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:33,570
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

322
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,011
Speaker 0: I'm just.

323
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:38,327
Speaker 1: some people playing unreal some people play sin and some people play quake.

324
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,377
Speaker 0: for yeah Not so many people play the newer quakes.

325
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, like quake 3 was a flash in the pan.

326
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:44,446
Speaker 1: Yep.

327
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:45,349
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of.

328
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,655
Speaker 1: well Quick, there's.

329
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:48,981
Speaker 1: we'll talk about quick three another time.

330
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do a whole show on the reason anomaly.

331
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are a lot of half-life mods that have a small following.

332
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:59,055
Speaker 1: you can always get a game as Sven co-op if you want or Science and industry.

333
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, none of them, you know, maybe a hundred players at most.

334
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,790
Speaker 1: that would be insane.

335
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,726
Speaker 0: You can't just do with counter-strike with these games what you can do with counter-strike.

336
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,835
Speaker 0: log on There's a server.

337
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,121
Speaker 0: just click on the top server and play.

338
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:22,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's people there and they're good Mm-hmm, or they're punk kids punk kids All right, now we're not gonna talk about counter-strike cheating yeah, but the culture of counter-strike.

339
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:28,137
Speaker 0: a lot of people pointed to it as the End-all or the bottom of the internet.

340
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,099
Speaker 1: and that's just not true because the bottom of the internet is like style project and F Net and style project and fortune and fortune.

341
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,082
Speaker 1: That's the bottom.

342
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:40,978
Speaker 0: but people always make jokes about about the Terribleness of the people in counter-strike.

343
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,930
Speaker 0: and there were a lot of assholes playing counter-strike, but they're mostly just 12 year olds.

344
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,957
Speaker 1: They weren't assholes.

345
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:47,347
Speaker 1: They're just there like every other 12 year old.

346
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:57,930
Speaker 0: I think it's that so many people played counter-strike that Every server it was like a million different countries and depending on where you played there any every walk of life was represented in counter-strike.

347
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,078
Speaker 1: Well every teenage male walk of life.

348
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:01,881
Speaker 1: that is true.

349
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,005
Speaker 0: true though.

350
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,490
Speaker 1: I'd a few females here and there.

351
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew some pretty badass females at that game.

352
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:21,190
Speaker 0: Oh, there are plenty of badass ones but but like I remember the people who complained the most about counter-strike were the people who never played it or Played some other obscure mod Like say the people who still played action quake long after counter-strike at one.

353
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,550
Speaker 0: Those people had a very close-knit community where everyone knew everyone.

354
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:45,006
Speaker 0: So when they get into counter-strike and not only does no one recognize or fear their clan tag but no one recognizes them or talks to them and there are people speaking strange lingos like stfu nub nub Jew I Think around back bomb number two.

355
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:50,024
Speaker 1: Oh my god Go go go.

356
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,137
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the end of the counter-strike radio jokes.

357
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:54,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

358
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,323
Speaker 0: Yeah fire hole.

359
00:22:56,664 --> 00:23:00,781
Speaker 0: now bear in mind that this is before I mean when counter-strike was super popular.

360
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,368
Speaker 0: There wasn't the voice chat built in.

361
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, all you could do is say the built-in things.

362
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:10,103
Speaker 0: some people would use things like team speak But some people consider that cheating.

363
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,238
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of dead speak going on.

364
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:18,393
Speaker 1: So they didn't want anyone to use any out-of-game chat Things.

365
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:26,750
Speaker 1: while you play counter-strike, I have to admit Scott and I were the masters of oh We were totally the masters because we'd be in the same room playing cat for anyone doesn't know the way counter-strike works.

366
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,714
Speaker 1: Let's do a short description.

367
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:28,416
Speaker 0: We should we should.

368
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:31,869
Speaker 1: so there's two teams the terrorists and the counter-terrorists.

369
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:42,935
Speaker 1: There's three scenarios the DE Demolition scenario the CS counter-strike scenario and the a s the long-forgotten Assault scenario.

370
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:45,846
Speaker 0: Well, no as was assassinate assassinate.

371
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:51,776
Speaker 1: a scenario ultra long lost Escape es scenario.

372
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:52,698
Speaker 0: Oh escape.

373
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,168
Speaker 1: now, let's talk about the ultra long lost never to be played again.

374
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:59,529
Speaker 0: escape scenario It was a really cool idea, but it didn't work.

375
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:06,549
Speaker 0: Well, the reason it didn't work is that back when that was around and even that even today It's hard to make maps in half-life.

376
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,549
Speaker 0: Oh real hard you because you have to make the map by modeling it, but you also have to program the map.

377
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,182
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically you're writing code really the map making tools.

378
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:21,050
Speaker 1: while they're better now than they were ass They're really not easy to use at all.

379
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,522
Speaker 0: Plus some people like one map.

380
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:25,750
Speaker 0: I think it was docks.

381
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,610
Speaker 0: I don't remember all the details because I didn't really care but the map was a terrible terrible terrible map.

382
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:32,940
Speaker 0: It just didn't work.

383
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,190
Speaker 0: It was not a dead guy.

384
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

385
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,570
Speaker 0: But then the guy the kid the punk kid who made the map killed himself not long after making the mat.

386
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,922
Speaker 0: so all the servers kept playing the map and talking about awesome.

387
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,960
Speaker 0: the map was as a tribute to this kid and While it's horrible the kid died.

388
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:51,870
Speaker 0: the map he made was terrible.

389
00:24:52,493 --> 00:25:02,310
Speaker 0: There's no reason that we should have to subject ourselves to that and in fact I got banned from a server for saying that that map sucks because the admin was like a kid died for this map.

390
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,090
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah Yes, yes is an escape map.

391
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:18,510
Speaker 1: This is where the terrorists are in a prison of some sort and they have to escape Which means they all have to get to some other place on the map before the counter-terrorists kill them all.

392
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,421
Speaker 0: They usually don't start with weapons.

393
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:21,870
Speaker 1: Yes, it really sucked.

394
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:33,469
Speaker 1: It was a good idea and if it was executed properly would make a really fun game but it was never executed properly and Everyone would go change the map or servers would just take the map out of the rotation and that would be it

395
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:33,911
Speaker 0: Yep,

396
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,541
Speaker 1: and then they took the maps out of counter-strike all together.

397
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:41,950
Speaker 0: Now as was probably my favorite Was also my favorite there were only a few maps where it actually worked.

398
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:43,495
Speaker 0: Yep, now the whole thing is.

399
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,482
Speaker 0: one guy was the VIP.

400
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:46,305
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

401
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,589
Speaker 1: He was a counter-terrorist.

402
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,592
Speaker 0: Yeah I think he was giving a. he was given a pistol and he had a whole bunch of body armor on and he was a Person.

403
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:57,057
Speaker 0: his only goal was to escape to the helicopter Yep, and it really suck.

404
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:04,482
Speaker 0: as if you were a counter-terrorist you would be randomly selected to be the VIP Which sometimes it was like you could tell because it always kind of randomly picked.

405
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:08,101
Speaker 0: but there if you were good and you kept surviving It tended to keep picking you

406
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:19,124
Speaker 1: kinda yeah yeah, but but it really sucked because it threw this big kink in the game where if whoever got picked to be the VIP suck Your game was basically screwed no matter how good the rest of the CT's were.

407
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:25,830
Speaker 0: or by the same token Sometimes you really didn't like say the terrorists are just owning you and every round they just gun the guy down.

408
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:27,839
Speaker 0: Suddenly you're the VIP.

409
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:28,945
Speaker 0: You have no weapons.

410
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:29,970
Speaker 0: You've got a little pistol.

411
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:33,549
Speaker 0: You got to worry about all your friends and then here come the terrorists to gun you down.

412
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're running away high corners.

413
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,387
Speaker 1: my situation it was usually I was a counter-terrorist.

414
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:39,310
Speaker 1: we'd lose lose lose.

415
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,346
Speaker 1: I would be the VIP and I would go my patented VIP oil rig guaranteed escape route.

416
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,114
Speaker 0: Yeah every single time My what was the snow one?

417
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:48,138
Speaker 0: That was my favorite.

418
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:50,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tundra was my favorite assassinate man.

419
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:51,870
Speaker 1: No, it's all about oil rig.

420
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,138
Speaker 1: Anyway, then comes the CS.

421
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:57,210
Speaker 1: the CS and the DE maps are pretty much most of the maps.

422
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,397
Speaker 1: Yep, CS is counter-strike.

423
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:00,521
Speaker 1: This is where the.

424
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,110
Speaker 1: there are some hostages which are not actual players.

425
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,237
Speaker 1: They're just kind of standing there.

426
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, they used to be tricks you could do with them.

427
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,815
Speaker 0: we'll talk about.

428
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:11,670
Speaker 1: yeah, they're in some part of the map and The counter-terrorists need to rescue these hostages.

429
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:21,470
Speaker 1: so they need to go to where the hostages are touch the hostages then go to Back to where the counter-terrorists started and then the hostages are rescued.

430
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:27,610
Speaker 1: So you have to go into the enemy base and out and the terrorists all they have to do is prevent the counter-terrorists from rescuing.

431
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:32,890
Speaker 0: Now for the long job the game was set up where to grab a hostage.

432
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,122
Speaker 0: You basically run up to him and use him and then he'll follow you around like a dude.

433
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,949
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm now terrorists could do this, too.

434
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:46,712
Speaker 0: so Smart terrorists would grab one hostage and hide him somewhere or they grab all the hostages and stash him in a closet somewhere and guard That yep.

435
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:50,250
Speaker 1: No, you couldn't kill the hostages because then you would lose your money, which we'll talk about later.

436
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're killing the hostages no matter what team you are on screwed you.

437
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,180
Speaker 1: So unless you were desperate you wouldn't kill all the hostages.

438
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:07,616
Speaker 1: a lot of times hostages got gunned down just in a firefight But that was a because a terrorist would sit near the hostages waiting for the counter-terrorists to come and rescue them And then the counter-terrorists would show up.

439
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:11,347
Speaker 1: There'd be a billion bullets everywhere and some you know hostages get killed.

440
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,184
Speaker 1: It just happens Yeah, anyway, and then there's the DE map.

441
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:16,370
Speaker 1: DE is demolitions.

442
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:25,126
Speaker 1: This is where there are two one or more bomb spots Usually two sometimes three and the terrorists want to blow up any of these bomb spots.

443
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,752
Speaker 1: if they blow up just one of them They win.

444
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:44,569
Speaker 1: one guy randomly selected on the terrorist team has a bomb The only bomb and he has to bring that bomb to one of the bomb spots set it up Which takes like five seconds then wait around for it to explode and hope that a counter-terrorist doesn't come and defuse it.

445
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:50,810
Speaker 1: now If you die before you plant the bomb someone else on your team can pick it up and go do the job.

446
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,345
Speaker 1: If the bomb is defused it's over because you only have one bomb.

447
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:58,524
Speaker 1: and once you plant the bomb You can't pick it up and bring it somewhere else.

448
00:28:58,584 --> 00:28:59,410
Speaker 1: It's you planted it.

449
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,449
Speaker 1: That's where it's gonna be until it either explodes or is defused.

450
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:07,923
Speaker 1: Yep You could also always win any game of counter-strike by killing the other team to a point.

451
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:14,762
Speaker 0: if the terrorists plant the bomb and then They all get killed but the bomb still goes off terrorists win the terrorists still win.

452
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:15,363
Speaker 0: That's right.

453
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,850
Speaker 1: terrorists win suicide terrorist bombers.

454
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:23,930
Speaker 0: I was just thinking of some natural selection things, but I'll talk about those another day.

455
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:24,652
Speaker 0: Yes another.

456
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:27,926
Speaker 1: the thing that made counter-strike real popular were two things.

457
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:34,975
Speaker 1: number one in Any route counter-strike is played in rounds you play until someone wins then you do it again then do it again Then you change the map.

458
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,201
Speaker 0: there's short rounds.

459
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,637
Speaker 0: Yeah the game itself You know, there are games like SWAT.

460
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:42,328
Speaker 0: there are games that involve terrorism counterterrorism action.

461
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:49,788
Speaker 0: Basically, the premise of counter-strike is that the round begins the moment that negotiations broke down.

462
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,013
Speaker 1: Yep So it's the.

463
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,597
Speaker 1: you know, the terrorists made some demands.

464
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:56,165
Speaker 1: the counter-terrorists didn't agree to the demands.

465
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,753
Speaker 1: and then you know You go click.

466
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:03,989
Speaker 1: they said the counter-terrorists decided to go in or the terrorists decided.

467
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,623
Speaker 1: All right We're gonna go plant this bomb.

468
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:06,350
Speaker 1: fuck those guys.

469
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,434
Speaker 1: They didn't meet our demands.

470
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:10,848
Speaker 1: and then as soon as the game says let's go team.

471
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,490
Speaker 1: That's the minute that you know, you decided that you're gonna go do the job.

472
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, you make your dynamic entry a big firefight.

473
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:18,782
Speaker 0: someone comes out on top.

474
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:19,323
Speaker 1: Yep.

475
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,407
Speaker 0: There's a time limit.

476
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,130
Speaker 0: you have an objective.

477
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:23,510
Speaker 0: It's not just kill other people like most FPS is were.

478
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:28,370
Speaker 1: Yes, the one problem in counter-strike is that if you don't end up with good players, they won't try for the objective.

479
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,567
Speaker 1: They'll just try to camp or kill all the other players and they won't help you plant the bomb.

480
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:39,750
Speaker 1: many a time I would go with the bomb or and plant it on my own or rescue the hostages all on my own.

481
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,694
Speaker 0: Well, everyone else is fighting somewhere else and if Scott and I were on a team and our team sucked It just didn't matter.

482
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:45,599
Speaker 0: we could handle it.

483
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,081
Speaker 0: Yep.

484
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:49,215
Speaker 1: As long as the other team wasn't really really good I mean, I don't want to brag.

485
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:56,419
Speaker 0: Well, I love bragging but Scott and I were Extremely badass at counter-strike.

486
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:02,590
Speaker 1: I don't know how badass we are now now Counter-strike source where we mostly played the older counter-strike.

487
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:06,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean when we played when we played we were pretty good.

488
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:10,910
Speaker 0: I mean we the to one of us joining a team could pretty much turn the tide.

489
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:14,150
Speaker 1: I would say most of the time that we lost it was because of a cheater.

490
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would honestly agree with that.

491
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,307
Speaker 0: I mean We're just really freaking good at that game.

492
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,609
Speaker 1: But also many times when we won it was because the cheater was on our team.

493
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:24,456
Speaker 0: You want to know why we were so good.

494
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:29,773
Speaker 0: We wasted countless hours when we refresh whenever we weren't Class.

495
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:33,050
Speaker 1: you're playing counter-strike until nighttime when we did something else instead.

496
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:40,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we'd all get together and play D&D and battle tech and stuff at night But during the day between classes we just played counter-strike.

497
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, what else are you gonna do for that short amount of time?

498
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,870
Speaker 0: five rounds of CS duh, and you know, what's amazing?

499
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,674
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone else did too.

500
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:51,610
Speaker 0: Yeah walking walking around the dorms at RIT at any given daylight hour.

501
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:59,558
Speaker 1: All you could hear in any room was either ticketing Or Those are the two things you heard at RIT dorms.

502
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:00,380
Speaker 0: Sometimes you heard both.

503
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,508
Speaker 0: Oh, you know one roommates playing doesn't notice.

504
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:09,050
Speaker 1: the other roommates The two gimmicks they're not really gimmicks they're the gate.

505
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:13,944
Speaker 1: They're the gameplay aspects that make counter-strike unique and awesome.

506
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:14,807
Speaker 0: Yeah the gimmicks.

507
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:20,224
Speaker 1: Yes One of them is that when you die you don't respawn.

508
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:25,490
Speaker 1: now if you've ever played quake the second you die You push a button and now you're in the game again immediately.

509
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,952
Speaker 1: I know just keep playing and playing and playing until you get enough kills and the game's over and Counter-strike.

510
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:36,550
Speaker 1: when you die you're out for the rest of the round until one of the team's wins.

511
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:40,309
Speaker 1: You can just float around doing nothing usually watching what's going on.

512
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,825
Speaker 1: Well early on you could watch what was going on and now you can too.

513
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,636
Speaker 1: I remember in one version They added the black screen of death.

514
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:50,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you couldn't see or at least you could only see what your teammates could see.

515
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, because otherwise here's the scenario.

516
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,529
Speaker 0: it is now which Scott and I did occasionally just for fun.

517
00:32:56,132 --> 00:33:01,949
Speaker 0: Usually when we were on opposite teams, like I was a terrorist and he was a counter terrorist But then say he died because one of us shot him.

518
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:09,058
Speaker 0: He would then tell me where the last guys were just different in the round quicker But alright, so we're on the same team.

519
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,668
Speaker 0: Let's say in a tournament whatever and I die.

520
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:17,690
Speaker 0: What's to stop me from floating around and then calling Scott on his cell phone and telling him?

521
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:22,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, the last terrorist is hiding behind the box at the far end of bombsite.

522
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:28,164
Speaker 1: be yep and That was known as ghosting and it's kind of cheating but not really.

523
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:29,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much cheating.

524
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:34,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is no one ever did it in a real match And if you did you were just kind of an asshole.

525
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:35,668
Speaker 1: no one did it in a real match.

526
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:40,969
Speaker 1: No but anyway The second thing about counter-strike was the weapons.

527
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:46,430
Speaker 1: The way it worked is when you started a game of counter-strike you had what like eight hundred bucks.

528
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, eight hundred dollars not really hundred dollars.

529
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:58,510
Speaker 1: eight hundred dollars in the game and with those eight hundred dollars You could buy Weapons and different weapons cost different amounts of money and you had to pay for ammo and you had to pay for armor.

530
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:08,089
Speaker 0: you had to pay for grenades and the weapons were Varied enough to where you really felt good buying a different weapon and the weapons were all modeled after real weapons.

531
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,400
Speaker 0: now They weren't realistic in a literal sense.

532
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:12,123
Speaker 1: Not yet.

533
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,089
Speaker 1: A military fanboy would be pissed off.

534
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,885
Speaker 1: However, I compared to quake or doom or wolfenstein.

535
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:18,909
Speaker 1: these things are awesome.

536
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,310
Speaker 0: They were extremely realistic from a minor pseudo military fanboy perspective exactly.

537
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,891
Speaker 0: You know the kids.

538
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,594
Speaker 0: you like the kids.

539
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:25,976
Speaker 0: you hear any.

540
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:32,532
Speaker 0: you hear them all the time online talking about the merits of the stair versus the m4 carbine Carbine.

541
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,717
Speaker 0: a lot of people say carbine whatever.

542
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,764
Speaker 0: anyway those kids they eat it up.

543
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,929
Speaker 0: kids love talking about desert eagles.

544
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:45,181
Speaker 1: They are So usually in the first round of counter-strike on a prop on a server.

545
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:45,925
Speaker 1: that didn't you know?

546
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,975
Speaker 1: cuz servers could say you could start With more money, but most of them didn't.

547
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:52,746
Speaker 1: it would be the pistol round because you could only afford pistols.

548
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,750
Speaker 1: now everyone starts No matter what you get this shit pistol.

549
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,459
Speaker 1: And the other thing is different teams have different weapons.

550
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,575
Speaker 1: the counter terrorists have in my opinion much better weapons But they're more expensive.

551
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:03,439
Speaker 1: They are more.

552
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,171
Speaker 0: terrorists get all the AKs and Mac 10.

553
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:16,984
Speaker 1: Terrorists get AK-47s Mac 10s and SIGs while I mean terrorists get those and counter-terrorists get Augs, and I remember when they added the p90 p9.

554
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,931
Speaker 0: there's both.

555
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:26,072
Speaker 1: people got that or the five seven pistol the five seven pistol the and then the terrorists have the The elites.

556
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:28,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, the elites Oh elites.

557
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,907
Speaker 0: That was the dumbest thing ever the best pistol.

558
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:36,086
Speaker 1: Oh my god I went through a phase where I would try to elite all I could.

559
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:39,478
Speaker 1: I always kept my elites And then I would whip them out whenever I had a chance.

560
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,943
Speaker 0: I have for some reason.

561
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,950
Speaker 0: I love using the normal shotgun.

562
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,934
Speaker 0: Really pump shotgun.

563
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:45,636
Speaker 0: it was terrible.

564
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:49,850
Speaker 0: I usually died, but there was nothing more satisfying better than using the noob cannon.

565
00:35:50,111 --> 00:36:04,189
Speaker 0: There's nothing more satisfying in the world than standing there and a terrorist war runs around the corner And he stops and he's about to shoot you and you turn and you put one Shotgun blast into him and he flies over and falls dead.

566
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:08,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, his friends and you gotta reload and pump and someone kills you.

567
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:09,043
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah.

568
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:14,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, no the the super shotgun the Benelli in counter-strike is known as the noob cannon.

569
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:18,105
Speaker 1: Some people who don't know might call some other guns the noob cannon.

570
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,210
Speaker 1: They're idiots.

571
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,589
Speaker 1: The noob cannon is the Benelli shotgun.

572
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:25,521
Speaker 1: The thing about the Benelli shotgun is an automatic shotgun.

573
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:39,859
Speaker 1: It's real you could fire it like how many times it was But it was like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Until you ran out of shells and you could fire like eight times I think before you had to reload.

574
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:49,310
Speaker 1: now reloading took a while because you had to go click Click click as you filled it with shotgun shells But you could interrupt the loading process to shoot which most other guns you couldn't yep.

575
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,147
Speaker 1: So you'd be like, you know, you would start with a full loadout, you know And you'd go you'd see a guy and you go doo doo doo doo.

576
00:36:55,207 --> 00:37:04,686
Speaker 0: now The reason a lot of people call it the noob cannon is that in in close quarters I mean someone skilled could deal with it and team tactics could definitely take it out.

577
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:05,930
Speaker 0: It wasn't the best weapon.

578
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:11,150
Speaker 0: It was however the best weapon for someone who had absolutely no skill and they probably kill someone.

579
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:20,602
Speaker 1: yeah, if you have absolutely no accuracy in your aiming and You need to kill someone and do a lot of damage Your best bet is to use the noob cannon.

580
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:26,070
Speaker 1: you get a bunch of guys in front of you You push the button as fast as you can and you're likely to deal out a lot of damage.

581
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:37,899
Speaker 1: It's like the real world if you had an auto shotgun and you're in a room full of I don't know five-year-olds If you had an auto shotgun and you in a room full of Navy SEALs You would still hose them until and they would kill you.

582
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,030
Speaker 1: maybe like, you know five after you shot a bunch of shells.

583
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:44,690
Speaker 1: Yep, you could get plenty of shots off if you knew what you're doing.

584
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:53,195
Speaker 1: You can't miss a target with an automatic shotgun, especially not like across the room maybe across the field but not across the room.

585
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:59,736
Speaker 1: and counter-strike had a lot of rooms and not so many fields because of the half-life engine didn't really allow For outdoors so much.

586
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,509
Speaker 1: Yep, half-life 2 engine fixes that.

587
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:05,825
Speaker 0: now We actually at one point decided to run a counter-strike server on.

588
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:09,302
Speaker 0: well How slow was that piece of crap computer we had?

589
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:15,447
Speaker 1: it was a piece of shit, man I think it was in my old Pentium 3 450 or no, it was even slower.

590
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,732
Speaker 1: It was a Pentium 200.

591
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:17,998
Speaker 0: I think it was a Pentium 200.

592
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:18,500
Speaker 0: It might have been a 233.

593
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,284
Speaker 0: It was old and shitty.

594
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:25,752
Speaker 0: We were we just we really wanted to run a counter-strike server, but we didn't have money or extra computers Mm-hmm.

595
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,481
Speaker 0: So we took this crap old computer.

596
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,269
Speaker 0: We put counter-strike on it.

597
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:41,935
Speaker 0: we discovered that as long as less than seven people were on the server the ping was okay if More than seven people were on or if the map was actually a real map as opposed to icy world Which is the only map we could run.

598
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:45,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, the icy world if you don't know is the smallest tiniest map.

599
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,150
Speaker 0: It's also a map with no objective.

600
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,499
Speaker 0: It's one of the FY maps which unofficially stands for fuck you.

601
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all those maps are is kill the other guys And it's real small and you can.

602
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,490
Speaker 1: this is weapons lying on the ground at the start of the map.

603
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:03,670
Speaker 1: So all you would do is you would start pick up a weapon and go and then it would be over in five seconds.

604
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:07,203
Speaker 1: Yeah And that's why our server was able to run it because it was the simplest map.

605
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:12,140
Speaker 0: now when we made the server Servers that ran those maps weren't that common yet.

606
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:18,350
Speaker 0: So our server was in high demand and full Constantly despite the fact people wanted to play icy world.

607
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,799
Speaker 1: Our server was always full and we had a good.

608
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,573
Speaker 1: was a 10 on 10 going on or was an 8 on 8?

609
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,065
Speaker 1: It was a good number for icy world.

610
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:26,630
Speaker 1: I remember that.

611
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem was if any if all those people connected the servers ping got real bad.

612
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,163
Speaker 1: No, I remember we set the limit to like the max the server could handle.

613
00:39:35,183 --> 00:39:37,090
Speaker 0: Yeah point which wasn't so much.

614
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:38,395
Speaker 1: It was good enough.

615
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:39,057
Speaker 0: We had.

616
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,904
Speaker 0: we often kick people off so we could play.

617
00:39:40,924 --> 00:39:41,767
Speaker 1: that's true.

618
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:42,530
Speaker 1: That's true.

619
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:46,810
Speaker 1: It's because we couldn't setting up all the stuff that lets you reserve slots is a pain in the ass.

620
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, setting up setting up any sort of Counter-Strike server was an incredibly painful process.

621
00:39:52,607 --> 00:40:04,542
Speaker 1: It's less painful now Thanks to steam But it's still to set the mods on the server to make the server do fancy things is still sucky Mostly because it's that was from the previous generation of mods.

622
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:07,090
Speaker 0: I mean playing the old quake 2 mods.

623
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:20,330
Speaker 0: Try yeah, all of you kids now who played these new games, you know, like Counter-Strike source and natural selection Go find a copy of quake 2 and try to even figure out how to shoot in some of those mods for quake 2.

624
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:25,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, those games you would have to write your own scripts to do anything.

625
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:27,390
Speaker 0: Yep, those games were nuts.

626
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:35,765
Speaker 0: You really have it easy these days but the servers for a lot of the early half-life 1 mods and Counter-Strike Were about that level of pain in the assness.

627
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:48,630
Speaker 1: the other problem But really was even when things were easy to do which they often were they were poorly Redocumented and the websites for the software were hard to find because there really weren't official websites for any of these things.

628
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were all other websites You know distributing them and he was all.

629
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:59,741
Speaker 1: it was very hard to find out exactly the latest and greatest Information and the complete information was like a big secret.

630
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:04,441
Speaker 0: PC gaming is a lot easier now Thanks to the Xbox 360 mostly.

631
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:10,744
Speaker 1: Yeah and steam But yeah, so counter-strike Good memories.

632
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:19,148
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean when I think back that game It's weird to think that I have so many fond memories from such a simple stupid game, but I played it constantly.

633
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:22,416
Speaker 1: Yep Let's think of some good counter-strike memories.

634
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:24,804
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember this one time.

635
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:34,774
Speaker 0: It was in Kabul and Not Kabul as in Iraq But Kabul as in this place full of cobblestones and I was a terrorist with an ak-47 And I'm walking.

636
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:35,798
Speaker 0: then Scott was on the server.

637
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,762
Speaker 0: I think he was dead.

638
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:55,385
Speaker 0: He was watching and I was walking around and For some reason like this is just random because I would just shoot my gun around a lot because I like doing that and I just kind of flipped around and fired a shot off in the distance and then it I saw a headshot from Shazar and I'd gotten someone and then they kicked me off the server for cheating.

639
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,386
Speaker 0: Holy crap I don't know what the odds of that were.

640
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:03,141
Speaker 1: I Had a similar situation on this map.

641
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,650
Speaker 1: I forget the name of it.

642
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,415
Speaker 1: Actually, it was it's.

643
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:11,770
Speaker 1: it was like the Spanish castle or something and it was water and you would run into the castle.

644
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:12,974
Speaker 1: I don't really remember.

645
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:15,182
Speaker 0: I remember that map and there was a.

646
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,828
Speaker 1: I think there was a sundial somewhere.

647
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,636
Speaker 0: Yes Yes, I don't know what it was called.

648
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:20,787
Speaker 0: Not many servers ran it, but I love that map.

649
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:26,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think we had the bomb planted or I was looking for the bomb.

650
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,830
Speaker 1: I remember I was a terrorist.

651
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:33,282
Speaker 1: I wanted to plant the bomb and I was walking around And I had a desert eagle and that was about it.

652
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:46,419
Speaker 1: I had used up everything else and this guy's coming down the stairs and I pretty much turn and fire one shot and his he just falls over dead and I'm like, holy crap And the guy was like lucky shot and I'm like, yup that was.

653
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:59,198
Speaker 0: I've had a lot of moments where it was real dicey like my whole team gets killed and I'm on my own and I got like a pistol and the bomb and Somehow I'd weasel my way through.

654
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:02,330
Speaker 0: everyone plant the bomb kill a bunch of people go on a rampage.

655
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:08,487
Speaker 1: I have a lot of great moments where My favorite thing to do in counter-strike is to take a clever path through the map.

656
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:12,302
Speaker 1: like an Aztec I would always take the secret stairs, even though it's not so secret anymore.

657
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:18,150
Speaker 1: No, but and in Assault oil rig I would always go my secret back way.

658
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:24,978
Speaker 1: We're basically no one would be where I was until I made my mad dash for the helicopter you know.

659
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:28,561
Speaker 1: and Oh, there was also good one in Vegas.

660
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:30,030
Speaker 1: I would take the back way also.

661
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:32,529
Speaker 1: That was a good map one time.

662
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:34,430
Speaker 0: This isn't anything awesome.

663
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:42,102
Speaker 0: I did I was playing in I was office and I was the last counter-terrorist alive and the last terrorist was also alive.

664
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,108
Speaker 0: who's one versus one?

665
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:49,630
Speaker 0: and I know that everyone else in the map was watching us because our little fight was going on for a while.

666
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,015
Speaker 0: We were stalking each other around.

667
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:52,361
Speaker 0: It was unlimited time server.

668
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:54,730
Speaker 0: So I was stalking, you know, very carefully.

669
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:02,959
Speaker 0: I had my m4 silenced and I'm poking around and poking around and I Was walking silently and he was walking silently and for minutes and minutes.

670
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:03,802
Speaker 0: We couldn't find each other.

671
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:17,610
Speaker 0: So finally I'm walking very slowly and For a while and then I get this feeling and I I turn around and he's standing right there With a knife and he's been standing there and I didn't know what to do.

672
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:18,417
Speaker 0: I would I almost.

673
00:44:18,437 --> 00:44:21,484
Speaker 0: I jumped out of my chair like yeah and then he stabbed me to death.

674
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:31,403
Speaker 0: and Then the voice chat turned on for me for all the dead people and all I heard was them laughing their asses off as they Explained to me that he'd been following me like that for over a minute.

675
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:36,829
Speaker 0: Yeah And the fact that I was so dumbstruck I couldn't even shoot him.

676
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:46,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good yeah, like I literally I was like, yeah and I stood up a little bit and it was too late.

677
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,706
Speaker 1: Yeah encounters like you always want to look all over the place real quick all the time.

678
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:54,925
Speaker 1: Yep You never most of the time when you and you need dying counter-strike.

679
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:55,909
Speaker 1: It's you shot in the back.

680
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:07,148
Speaker 1: Usually when you you know, you're facing someone the odds of a firefight is pretty much just random But when you just get killed right out, it's in the back of the head.

681
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,629
Speaker 0: Yep I mean playing against people who were a good as we were good.

682
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,967
Speaker 0: it was really just a tactical game of strategy and teamwork.

683
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:20,050
Speaker 0: and What kind of plan the counter-terrorists would put together to do blah or what route we would take or how we would do it?

684
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,038
Speaker 0: Or what kind of like wave we would move in?

685
00:45:22,198 --> 00:45:22,459
Speaker 1: Yep.

686
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:32,017
Speaker 1: Strategies would be things like, you know all right, one guy has the para and let's loose and everyone else runs down the tunnel or Everyone go everyone rush left.

687
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,862
Speaker 1: every absolutely everyone on the team go left because if you're on the defensive team usually want to have some guys at all.

688
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:55,350
Speaker 1: the different ways that the way the maps are constructed is that you know, the Terrorists start in one area and the counter-terrorists start in another area and there are multiple paths To get from one area to the other and one team is gonna be pushing and one team is gonna be blocking.

689
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,210
Speaker 1: Based on if it's DE the terrorists push and on CS the counter-terrorists push.

690
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:12,890
Speaker 1: So the defenders usually want to cover all the different entrances because if they leave one Unguarded then there's a chance that all the offensive to the team will just go through that door.

691
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:15,368
Speaker 1: No one will be there to stop them and they'll win a game over.

692
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:19,906
Speaker 1: The offensive team wants to have all of their team go to one entrance.

693
00:46:20,307 --> 00:46:27,764
Speaker 1: that way Even there even if there's a few guards at that entrance They'll be able to kill him and still have a whole team.

694
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:28,508
Speaker 1: They're ready to go.

695
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:33,070
Speaker 1: So, you know this strategy would be like rush left brush middle rush, right?

696
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,092
Speaker 1: You know stuff.

697
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:35,638
Speaker 0: but even then I mean good teams.

698
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,370
Speaker 0: you had the the actual mechanics of all right.

699
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,611
Speaker 0: Like.

700
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:43,754
Speaker 0: well, they'll run in and this guy will sweep to the left and this other guy runs straight forward Not looking at anyone.

701
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:46,466
Speaker 0: the next two people walk in and throw flashes in this direction.

702
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:51,445
Speaker 1: plans like that Yep, and then would also be you know defensive strategies that you know.

703
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:51,626
Speaker 1: you.

704
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:54,089
Speaker 1: way I described it You think the offense would always win?

705
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,730
Speaker 1: But the defense could do things like throw flash grenades as soon as they saw anyone walk through the entrance.

706
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:06,230
Speaker 1: Then that would be a signal to all the other defenders to get over there as well as completely screwing up the offense.

707
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:12,050
Speaker 1: Then that you know, they could throw some smoke in there, you know kill the guys at a choke point.

708
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,410
Speaker 1: So even though they're in a big group, they have to walk through the door one at a time.

709
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,749
Speaker 1: They all get killed as they walk through the door.

710
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:26,442
Speaker 0: of course a lot of times we play it on servers with people who weren't so good and At that point it became I am rim aka Rambo.

711
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:28,970
Speaker 0: I walk around with an mp5 killing everyone.

712
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,049
Speaker 1: I see no one can stop me except for the one guy who just stopped you.

713
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:35,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, you killed a whole bunch of guys.

714
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:41,123
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz no matter how good you were One guy could not often take on the entire enemy team.

715
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:46,850
Speaker 0: you could take out most of them But then it really depends on the on the skill of the other team.

716
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:56,510
Speaker 1: they had to be pretty bad to completely lose to you, but in terms of I Could hardly ever kill many guys on the other team if I killed more than four guys in a round.

717
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,273
Speaker 1: That was crazy.

718
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,604
Speaker 1: And in fact three guys is a damn good round.

719
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:06,230
Speaker 1: help two guys is a good round You know, but often I would win on my own by completing the objective.

720
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:14,650
Speaker 1: I would go in alone with the bomb I would go around the back way all alone with the terrorists and the hostages and rescue them.

721
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:16,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, rescue the terrorists.

722
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:23,328
Speaker 1: I'd rescue the hostages all alone, but trying to fight the other team alone was What do you how do you say?

723
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,082
Speaker 0: I don't know how you say what are you trying to?

724
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:28,209
Speaker 1: fruitless?

725
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,509
Speaker 1: Silly, what's the other word for silly?

726
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,227

728
00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:40,995
Speaker 1: it was futile That's the word.

729
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:43,829
Speaker 0: that's the one futile rare.

730
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:50,316
Speaker 1: Yes, trying to fight the other team on your own was futile But I think that's enough rambling.

731
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:56,561
Speaker 0: we killed enough time and now I can finish playing with my brand new shiny Mac mini and then Go to bed and next Monday rim.
