1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,806
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, April 29th.

2
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:12,568
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:13,189
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,994
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Night.

5
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,260
Speaker 0: Tonight, the board game Risk.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,118
Speaker 1: So way back, someone lent me, you know, before I had played any Fire Emblem's, someone lent me the GBA Fire Emblem's 1 & 2, right?

8
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:40,512
Speaker 1: I played the first one.

9
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:54,080
Speaker 1: It was okay, but and then I played the second one, you know, since I had them both at the same time, and the second one was far as I didn't bother with the first one, and I got way into the second one, but then I forget why, it was when I was working in the middle of nowhere, you know.

10
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,840
Speaker 1: I kind of put it down, and then even though I really liked it, like I couldn't pick it back up.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,840
Speaker 1: It was sort of one of those things where it's like, if you don't stay on the track, it's like if you get off, you have to get back on at the beginning, or else you're kind of in.

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,780
Speaker 0: Kind of like way back in the day, I never actually beat Final Fantasy Legend 1.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,144
Speaker 1: Legend 1?

14
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:13,740
Speaker 1: Good deal, who cares?

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,619
Speaker 0: That was a good game!

16
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:20,040
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, was Legend 1 the one with the tower that goes- Oh, that's a good one, nevermind!

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is!

18
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,360
Speaker 0: But Legend 2 was good, because that had that ultimate moment with the bad guys.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,180
Speaker 1: Legend 2 is the one I didn't play, but Legend 3 is my favorite one.

20
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,300
Speaker 1: Actually, I think Legend 2- Even though most people hate Legend 3.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,560
Speaker 0: Legend 2 is probably the best one in terms of gameplay.

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,039
Speaker 1: Man, I don't know, I'm not gonna bother about talking about that.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,136
Speaker 0: Scott, if I explain to you how the robot works, I think you'll convert to Legend 2, but anyway- No, Legend 3, your dad is a B2.

24
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:50,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but- The reason I stopped playing and never beat Legend 1 was that I was playing, and then I didn't for a while.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,799
Speaker 0: I was playing other Game Boy games and Game Gear games, and like a year later, I was like, "Oh yeah, I should finish this

26
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,060
Speaker 0: game.".

27
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:01,440
Speaker 0: And I didn't know which way was up and which way was down.

28
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:06,739
Speaker 0: And I walked a bit in one direction, and then like 20 minutes later, I was like, "Am I going the wrong

29
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:06,980
Speaker 0: way?".

30
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:15,260
Speaker 0: So I walked in the other direction, got back 20 minutes, walked another 10 minutes, wasn't sure if that was the right way, said, "Fuck it," and never played the game again.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,007
Speaker 1: I started the same thing with Golden Sun.

32
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,213
Speaker 1: I love Golden Sun, right?

33
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:20,140
Speaker 1: And I beat Golden Sun 1.

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,799
Speaker 1: But Golden Sun 2 is so much bigger.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Speaker 1: And you reach a point in Golden Sun 2, this is a little bit of a spoiler, you basically have four characters in Golden Sun 1, and you have four different characters in Golden Sun 2.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:46,180
Speaker 1: But you reach a point in Golden Sun 2 where the four characters from Golden Sun 1 join the party, so now you have eight people, but you have to, you know- You sort of have to arrange a party of four, so four people sit on the back burner while you actually play with the other four.

37
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,552
Speaker 0: Hey, what about Final Fantasy 6?

38
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,638
Speaker 0: You have like 12 people.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,682
Speaker 1: I know, I know.

40
00:02:50,883 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 1: But the thing is, right, is that you bring over, you use a code, or you use a link cable to bring over the characters you played with in Golden Sun 1 to Golden Sun 2.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Speaker 1: So it's not just, I mean, if you didn't play Golden Sun 1, they just give you four characters.

42
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:10,500
Speaker 1: But if you did, they load your shit in as your stuff, exactly as it was when you beat Golden Sun 1.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,289
Speaker 0: Hey, even better, Destiny of an Emperor.

44
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:13,294
Speaker 0: You had like 400 characters.

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:29,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is, is you get to this point, and now you have to manage, right, the items and the gins and the magic of eight people, which is pretty- And it's like at that point- Putting stuff in, taking stuff out.

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,983
Speaker 1: Right, it's like.

47
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,431
Speaker 1: at that point in the game, I'm like,

48
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:31,954
Speaker 0: ugh,

49
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:47,040
Speaker 1: and I started, and Golden Sun 2 is a lot longer and bigger than Golden Sun 1, so at that point in the game, I'm just kind of like, ugh, and I put it down, and then I really have a hard time picking it back up because I got to manage all that shit, so I got to restart Golden Sun 2 again, but then I forget the story, so I got to restart Golden Sun 1.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,540
Speaker 0: Did you ever actually play through like Final Fantasy 3 or 5?

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,664
Speaker 1: What, the real 3?

52
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:51,749
Speaker 1: Yeah.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,123
Speaker 0: No.

54
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,520
Speaker 1: Okay, because 3 has a similar- 5 was the job one, right?

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,700
Speaker 0: Oh, so was 3.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,080
Speaker 1: Oh, those were both the job ones?

57
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,339
Speaker 1: I thought 2 was the job one.

58
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,880
Speaker 0: 2 was different.

59
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,399
Speaker 1: Okay, but 3 and 5 were the jobbers.

60
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:08,340
Speaker 0: 3 and 5 are the kind of modern style hardcore jobbers.

61
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:09,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't play them.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,899
Speaker 0: Both games had the syndrome of, alright, we're in the world, in the world, oh shit, that was a tiny part of the world, here's the real world.

63
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that part, that's a cool part.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course 4 was even better, where it had 3 completely independent worlds.

65
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,779
Speaker 1: Huh, they should make Chrono Trigger DS, I'd play that.

66
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:40,700
Speaker 0: You know, I probably would too, because Chrono Trigger is not the best game ever, from a game mechanic perspective, but in terms of one of those RPG style games, that game was badass.

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,297
Speaker 1: I think the reason that Chrono Trigger is so great is that it's a turn-based, you know, RPG, just like the Final Fantasies, but it's still playable today, whereas the others are not so much.

68
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,259
Speaker 0: 6 is, but only because of the story.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,459
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, pretty much.

70
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,920
Speaker 0: The story kind of pulls me along.

71
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:59,199
Speaker 1: And because it's easy, if it was a little bit harder, I wouldn't play it.

72
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,438
Speaker 1: And also if the Ultros wasn't there, I wouldn't play it.

73
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,359
Speaker 0: Ultros, I remember the best thing in the whole game.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,960
Speaker 0: Forget all the tragedy.

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,700
Speaker 1: When you go up to that painting.

76
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:23,540
Speaker 0: When you go up to that painting, you're like, wow, you see a painting of Ultros, and you walk up to it, and you wonder what the character's going to say, hit A, and it says, wow, that looks familiar.

77
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,579
Speaker 0: And then Ultros fucking pops out of the painting and attacks you.

78
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:27,339
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

79
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,299
Speaker 1: Anyway, so back to my original point was that, you know, I picked up Fire Emblem, and I liked them, but I didn't finish them.

80
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,743
Speaker 1: So I've been waiting for Fire Emblem DS, and they have said there's going to be Fire Emblem DS.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,640
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of the console GameCube Wii Fire Emblem.

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,539
Speaker 1: I want the DS game going well, right?

83
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,160
Speaker 1: But it's not, they don't even have a release date.

84
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 1: There's barely any screenshots.

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,620
Speaker 1: There's almost no information.

86
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:52,260
Speaker 1: It's like coming later, maybe in the holiday season, maybe even later than that, right?

87
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,619
Speaker 1: It could be a year away for all I know.

88
00:05:54,301 --> 00:06:01,338
Speaker 1: So I said, you know, I'm going to, there are plenty of, you go to the DS shelf and you see a lot of those no name RPG ish.

89
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,715
Speaker 1: They look like JRPG games, but they're not quite really, you know, and you see plenty of them.

90
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:07,840
Speaker 0: And it's hard to say.

91
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,280
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember way, way back we were in a store and we saw a thousand arms and someone was like, I don't recognize, what's that game?

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,539
Speaker 0: And then we realized it was kind of a JRPG, but also a dating game.

93
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:17,956
Speaker 1: Yeah.

94
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:21,500
Speaker 1: So Atlas are the people who made golden son.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,380
Speaker 1: I kind of trust them to be quality, right?

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Speaker 1: They had this game rondo of swords coming out and I looked at it and I'm like, oh, it looks sort of like fire emblem, but you can attack more than one guy at a time.

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,919
Speaker 1: So like if there's three guys lined up, you can just go stab, stab, stab, and stab all three of them in a row.

98
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,418
Speaker 1: Just like move your guy right through him.

99
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,060
Speaker 1: And I said, oh, that could be interesting.

100
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:40,356
Speaker 1: Right?

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,400
Speaker 1: So I said, you know what?

102
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,760
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

103
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,240
Speaker 1: I'll pre-order this shit and then I'll screen it for everybody.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,720
Speaker 1: Well, actually I got it and it's like, it's okay, but I haven't played it that much.

105
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 1: And I don't feel this urge to play it some more, but I think I'm gonna, but it's not bad, but it's sort of weird.

106
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,780
Speaker 1: It's not what I expected.

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,520
Speaker 1: I expected sort of a fire emblem type of game, right?

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,719
Speaker 1: A little, you know, tactics, final fantasy tactics, kind of move around a grid, cast magic spells, stab with swords, right?

109
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:21,300
Speaker 1: But it's actually the fact that you could just walk right through the other guys and they can walk right through you and stab multiple guys in a turn basically means that it's not a tactics game.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,678
Speaker 1: It's a puzzle game.

111
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:29,422
Speaker 1: They give you a map of bad guys and you have your guys and you have to sort of, you know, figure out.

112
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:39,780
Speaker 1: how do I move my guys along what path, you know, considering how far they can move to where I can kill all the guys that are near enough to me to do some serious hurt,

113
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,682
Speaker 0: but,

114
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,240
Speaker 1: you know, be out of range of getting seriously hurt on the next round.

115
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,040
Speaker 1: And if you like a puzzle game like that, it's, it's kind of a good puzzle game.

116
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 1: There's, you know, some RPG stuff thrown in there, like leveling up and, you know, magic and items or whatever, but that stuff's just all BS because it's not like you really have much of a choice.

117
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Speaker 1: You're just sort of going through the game, solving the policy.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
Speaker 1: You can't grind or anything.

119
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:12,040
Speaker 1: You just kill all the bad guys on the screen, you know, but there's multiple endings and there's different, like I'm pretty like on the first map, right?

120
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,740
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you start as a shit ton of bad guys, like way more than you can handle.

121
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,019
Speaker 1: And you've only got like three guys.

122
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:18,439
Speaker 1: Right.

123
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,500
Speaker 1: And like a, there's like a giant army coming from the South.

124
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,819
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that if you found some way to kill that giant army from the South, then you get like the immediate awesome ending.

125
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:34,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you, if that little puzzle game sounds okay, Rondo of swords, but it's not a fire emblem.

126
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,940
Speaker 1: It is not, don't, don't think it's the wrong thing.

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,456
Speaker 1: Like I did.

128
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:45,640
Speaker 0: See, it's tough because on one end I want to play a different game, but on the other hand, I'm working on turning all my A's into S's in advanced wars.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

130
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,820
Speaker 1: I mostly picked this up because, uh, I kind of stopped with the advanced wars.

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,176
Speaker 1: Yeah.

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,980
Speaker 0: But instead of playing mediocre games, maybe you could watch some anime.

133
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

134
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,359
Speaker 0: Got to watch that Bocorano.

135
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,899
Speaker 0: I kind of want to review it full on.

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,429
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,779
Speaker 0: So, uh, in the news, instead of talking about gaming news in particular, I want to talk about something that we missed talking about last week, partly because, uh, we totally copped out on half our shows.

138
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:12,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,820
Speaker 0: But at the New York comic con, we were walking around being pressed and I got some good little interviews that I'll pop in here and there whenever they come up.

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Speaker 0: And someday we'll do a show on like French comics and that interview I did with the French people will be relevant.

141
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:38,600
Speaker 0: I do want to say the French comics are kind of awesome looking, but we, uh, we wanted over to the upper deck area, upper deck, as you know, it's making the world of Warcraft CCG or T C G as people like to say.

142
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,180
Speaker 1: Basically I would have nothing to care about that game whatsoever.

143
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:42,672
Speaker 1: Right.

144
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,780
Speaker 1: But Gabe and Tyco of penny arcade who have opinions I often respect, uh, they were like, Oh man, this game is so great.

145
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,020
Speaker 1: And also it wasn't the fact that they were saying the game was great.

146
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,260
Speaker 1: It was the fact that Tyco was alluding to in the comics and in his post role playing aspects to the game.

147
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,040
Speaker 0: And I was kind of like, Oh, which made us realize something awesome.

148
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,900
Speaker 0: So this is an aside, but you'll hear about it soon.

149
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,640
Speaker 0: You might all be familiar with the game of diplomacy.

150
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,619
Speaker 0: If you're not, it is known.

151
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:21,800
Speaker 0: Like if you don't know, if you're not a gamer, like a tabletop board gamer, or you've never heard of this, find one of your neck bearded gamer friends and be like, Hey, you want to play diplomacy?

152
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,380
Speaker 0: Because he will explain to you that diplomacy is otherwise known as our breaker of friendships.

153
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:28,057
Speaker 1: Yeah.

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:39,580
Speaker 0: But, uh, we realized we take a game like diplomacy and add a role playing elements, even if it's a diplomacy sort of has a role playing element, but you can play it in a completely game theory.

155
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,380
Speaker 0: Like, all right, Scott, let's gang up on Alex because of blah, but magic.

156
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,156
Speaker 1: The gathering does not have a role playing element, but it did.

157
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,939
Speaker 1: One could be added.

158
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:57,117
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, remember there was that official way of playing the five pointed star where there were five decks of five different colors and you had to beat the two people across from you.

159
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,299
Speaker 1: But it didn't have a role playing element in the rules.

160
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,339
Speaker 0: Oh no, no, I guess like diplomacy does.

161
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,485
Speaker 0: And diplomacy barely does.

162
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:08,669
Speaker 1: it did barely, but it has some and it does have some, but, um, yeah.

163
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,220
Speaker 1: So I was intrigued by that.

164
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,960
Speaker 1: And actually a lot of people were saying, you know, Oh, D and D, you know, which we basically forsaken, right.

165
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,420
Speaker 1: It's going to become more like a card game.

166
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,320
Speaker 1: Oh, it's going to be like a video game on back in the nineties.

167
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,320
Speaker 0: That was like the biggest fear of everyone in the world.

168
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,380
Speaker 0: People like dragon magazine would have articles from DMS who were like, my game was ruined.

169
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,152
Speaker 0: Everyone comes over and this want to play.

170
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,180
Speaker 0: goddamn magic.

171
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,435
Speaker 0: Damn you, Watsy.

172
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,477
Speaker 0: Damn you.

173
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,758
Speaker 1: And then they bought D and D.

174
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,200
Speaker 0: But, and then everyone went on, like, but I don't think you understand the level of bitching that we had to go through.

175
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:55,199
Speaker 1: But after reading Tyco's posts about how they were introducing war role playing elements into the world of Warcraft card game, you know, despite not liking the MMO, you know, just because they put the same theme on a card game doesn't mean it's got the same problems the MMO has.

176
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,350
Speaker 1: Right.

177
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,100
Speaker 1: I can't immediately just associate the hate based on the, you know, uh, light license of the property.

178
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,270
Speaker 1: Right.

179
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,747
Speaker 1: Um, you know, I said, Hey, that, that could actually be good academically thinking about it.

180
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,480
Speaker 1: Like, huh, a card game with some role-playing.

181
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:12,820
Speaker 0: And we, we even have some ideas, sort of a new thing.

182
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:16,520
Speaker 0: I imagine you could make a kind of simple role playing game with cards.

183
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,180
Speaker 0: That would be awesome.

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:29,869
Speaker 0: But I also imagine if you took some mechanics from say birding wheel, but you had this kind of drafting card based character creation for one off scenarios, especially if it's interactive and a shared space kind of deal,

185
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:30,693
Speaker 1: or even

186
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:33,724
Speaker 0: like collectively making all the characters with the cards,

187
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:46,819
Speaker 1: or even like if somehow, you know, like not your whole campaign or whatever, but like encounters could be set with cards, you know, it can have some of the fun elements that like the star fairs of Catan had with like the, you know, the little yes, no pads.

188
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,980
Speaker 0: Or even say you, you, all the players in the game, there's this meta element where you have cards that cause external events, not from your character.

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,775
Speaker 0: It's kind of like every player has a hand of like hand of God.

190
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:01,437
Speaker 0: dungeon master does something things.

191
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,240
Speaker 0: So we're playing and then say, I'm like, I want to spice this up.

192
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:09,717
Speaker 0: And I just toss out ogre attacks in the night and see what happens, even though I'm in the party.

193
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:10,091
Speaker 1: Yep.

194
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,220
Speaker 1: So that that element of role playing in the card game interested me.

195
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,560
Speaker 1: So I said, Hey, we got nothing to do here, right?

196
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:18,340
Speaker 1: Let's go over and we have press badges.

197
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,500
Speaker 1: They will totally like lick our kiss our feet and let and run us a demo of the card game.

198
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:24,859
Speaker 1: And we won't have to pay any money.

199
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,157
Speaker 0: Now.

200
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,000
Speaker 0: It was funny.

201
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Speaker 0: We walked over there and we're like, Hey, we kind of walk in front of this line.

202
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,099
Speaker 0: We're like, Hey, we want to demo the card game and we'd like to film it and record it.

203
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:39,840
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, uh, uh, uh, then he looks, he's the press badge.

204
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,678
Speaker 0: He's like, Oh, right this way, sir.

205
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,140
Speaker 1: And then, but first they were trying to push us on their world of Warcraft miniatures game.

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,418
Speaker 0: I want to talk about that first.

207
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:47,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

208
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,680
Speaker 0: And they're not, they haven't announced all the details yet by packs.

209
00:13:51,821 --> 00:14:04,915
Speaker 0: They're going to have all the details out actually somewhat before then, but there is going to be a world of Warcraft collectible miniatures game and warning bells were going off because one, they had to kind of like force us to go.

210
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 0: look at this thing too.

211
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:11,420
Speaker 0: They put two incredibly attractive women in charge of making us like this game.

212
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,620
Speaker 0: The rest of it was all just like kind of shlubby, normal gamer dudes teaching you how to play.

213
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,960
Speaker 0: But they had these two women who obviously were kind of, they were booth babes.

214
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,739
Speaker 1: I don't think they were booth babes.

215
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,759
Speaker 1: I think one of them was actually the PR person.

216
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,375
Speaker 0: But they were, they were so like, it was so transparent.

217
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,480
Speaker 0: what they were trying to do to us.

218
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:28,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,599
Speaker 1: It was pretty odd.

220
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:37,539
Speaker 1: I think that's the reason they set up the booth though is, you know, it's like, we want to push our new stuff, you know, more heavily than they want to push their existing stuff.

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Speaker 0: But then warning bell number two goes off when the first thing they say is, before we go any further, look at these figures.

222
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,740
Speaker 0: Look how high quality these collectible figures are.

223
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:50,500
Speaker 0: Look at that craftsmanship.

224
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,940
Speaker 0: Look at that paint, the drop rates.

225
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,339
Speaker 0: And she actually said the drop rates for rares in boosters are such and such.

226
00:14:59,027 --> 00:14:59,379
Speaker 1: Wow.

227
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,678
Speaker 0: Drop rates.

228
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:01,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:02,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:05,160
Speaker 0: So we continue and I'm like, so how's the game go?

231
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,739
Speaker 0: She's like, oh, we can't talk about game mechanics.

232
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

233
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,817
Speaker 0: And I was like, at all.

234
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,738
Speaker 0: They're like, not at all.

235
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,419
Speaker 0: And I was like, okay.

236
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,640
Speaker 0: And we kind of stood there staring at them.

237
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,679
Speaker 0: Like, well, what the fuck do you expect us to ask now?

238
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,028
Speaker 1: Yeah.

239
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,340
Speaker 1: It's like, we don't give a shit about anything except the game.

240
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:21,459
Speaker 1: We don't care how high quality your miniatures are.

241
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Speaker 1: If I want high quality figures, I'll go over to the origin booth where they're selling the, the revolt tech, uh, you know, yotsubox.

242
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:31,080
Speaker 0: Oh man, that yotsubox.

243
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,860
Speaker 1: And the Tezuka Moderna line.

244
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,979
Speaker 0: Also, I got to say there was this, uh, Makoto Kusanagi figure.

245
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,260
Speaker 1: I pretty much decided that that is the only toy company that, that should be allowed to remain in existence.

246
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:55,174
Speaker 0: There seems to be this push that's getting bigger and bigger now, at least in the kind of anime and comic fandom area where they're pushing these very, very high quality kind of like, you know, there's the tchotchkes like the $4 PVC.

247
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
Speaker 0: There's like this cheap ass Lupin or this.

248
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 1: It's like a gachapon from like a, you know, a bubble.

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,738
Speaker 1: It's, it's cheap.

250
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,260
Speaker 0: But now they're pushing these like super high quality, high class.

251
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,820
Speaker 0: Like I live in Manhattan.

252
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:18,698
Speaker 0: I got a fancy apartment with like ultra modern furniture and I have this figure of Mario and this Mario figure is so high class that it fits right in next to the paintings by real artists.

253
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,840
Speaker 1: And on the one hand, I kind of like it.

254
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,939
Speaker 1: And the other hand, eh, I could do without it.

255
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,560
Speaker 0: What I was surprised by though, they had this figure of the major from ghost in the shell and the butt was somewhat reasonably sized.

256
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was a, it was, I'd say it was actually somewhat flat, which lighter than it should be.

257
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,339
Speaker 0: I think that's just because of the, you're, you expected so much, like I expected to look around at it and poke my eye out.

258
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,379
Speaker 0: And when it wasn't there, I didn't know what to do.

259
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:44,618
Speaker 1: I guess that's true.

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,279
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, so the miniature game somewhere Dave Riley's crying, the miniature game, very sad for us.

261
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,799
Speaker 1: They didn't tell us the rules so we couldn't, we couldn't make fun of it.

262
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:54,960
Speaker 0: Pushed him and pushed him.

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,699
Speaker 0: And I kept asking like more and more complexly worded questions that basically were, what are the game mechanics?

264
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:06,400
Speaker 0: And they started kind of slipping and we learned that it's like two on two or three on three.

265
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:07,919
Speaker 0: It's not like these big battles.

266
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:08,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

267
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,380
Speaker 0: So it's like, I have my three guys and you have your three guys and it's broken up by faction.

268
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,319
Speaker 0: So if I go Alliance, I can only have Alliance figures.

269
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,240
Speaker 0: And they admitted that yes, some figures are just better in every way, but don't worry.

270
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,917
Speaker 0: The drop rates are real low.

271
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,500
Speaker 0: So Scott asked, wait a minute.

272
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,519
Speaker 0: So if I have more money, I can just make the best thing.

273
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:45,599
Speaker 1: And they were like, uh, uh, uh, uh, the kind of questions that people actually care about game mechanics as are not questions that any PR person from an American game company is prepared to answer.

274
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:46,136
Speaker 0: Yeah.

275
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,939
Speaker 0: But they also admitted that there's going to be a mat.

276
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:50,320
Speaker 1: Yep.

277
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,519
Speaker 1: Well, they said there's going to be multiple maps.

278
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:53,214
Speaker 0: Yes.

279
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,940
Speaker 0: And the drop rates for those don't get me started.

280
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,879
Speaker 0: They're special.

281
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,700
Speaker 0: Actually, we learned something kind of weird on the aside.

282
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,613
Speaker 0: You know, you go to like, Scott asked about.

283
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:02,380
Speaker 0: this was a good question.

284
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,640
Speaker 0: You know, you go to like a magic tournament or whatever.

285
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,740
Speaker 0: And a lot of people have these like big official looking mouse pads.

286
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,940
Speaker 1: Like they'll play, you know, Pokemon, right?

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:21,639
Speaker 1: And you can just play Pokemon on a table, but some people have like those mats that have like little squares, like put your deck here, put your Pokemons here, you know, put your discard pile here.

288
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Speaker 1: And it's, you know, and then it says like Pokemon is a big exploding Pokeball.

289
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,600
Speaker 0: So Scott asks, uh, Hey dude, where do you get those things?

290
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,480
Speaker 0: I see them everywhere.

291
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,760
Speaker 1: It's like, whenever I see, whenever I see a tournament or something that people have these mass that they, that are designed for the collectible card game to be played on.

292
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:38,179
Speaker 1: Right.

293
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,766
Speaker 1: Sort of like the board in St.

294
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,339
Speaker 1: Petersburg is just a, it's just a mat designed to play St.

295
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,208
Speaker 0: Petersburg card game.

296
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,499
Speaker 0: Actually just a card game.

297
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:45,647
Speaker 0: Yeah.

298
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,520
Speaker 1: They just comes with a board to play it on.

299
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,000
Speaker 1: And I'm like, you know, I see these mats around all the time, but I'd never seen them for sale in a store.

300
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,739
Speaker 1: Where do you get them?

301
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,199
Speaker 0: He's like the guy looks at us.

302
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,740
Speaker 0: This is the other guy from later, but he basically looks at us like the guy who was actually demoing the card game, not selling the managers game.

303
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
Speaker 0: He looks at us for a second, like we're stupid.

304
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,840
Speaker 0: And then he says, you get him if you win regional tournaments.

305
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,954
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Oh yeah.

306
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:12,980
Speaker 0: And we, and we were like, so you can't just buy them.

307
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,980
Speaker 0: He was like, well, you can usually get them on eBay.

308
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,820
Speaker 1: I mean, you get anything on eBay.

310
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Speaker 0: But the look was like, it was that moment.

311
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,220
Speaker 0: Cause that was near the end of our little interview where he was like, Oh, wait a minute.

312
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,859
Speaker 0: I don't think these guys are hip to my whole card game and world.

313
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,980
Speaker 1: Well, I found one Pokemon card game play mat on eBay, but searching for Pokemon card game mat it's $6.

314
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,059
Speaker 1: And it's not that Japan limited number three.

315
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:37,869
Speaker 0: Only $6.

316
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:38,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

317
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,439
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a, uh, I think that's Japan where you might be able to just buy them on the shelf.

318
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,338
Speaker 0: But it's a limited number three.

319
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,013
Speaker 1: I know.

320
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,392
Speaker 1: Right.

321
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,100
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the world of core craft card game, right?

322
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,878
Speaker 1: We start playing it.

323
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:55,819
Speaker 1: And it's funny because I didn't want to compare it or associate it to world of Warcraft in any way.

324
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,520
Speaker 1: I wanted to sort of separate it in my mind from my opinion of world of Warcraft and examine the card game on its own as a card game.

325
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Speaker 0: We were really trying to be objective.

326
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,779
Speaker 1: If anything, I was going to compare it to magic.

327
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,859
Speaker 0: And furthermore, we were trying to kind of get a feel for it.

328
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 0: Not necessarily from the, is it a good straight up game, but also the, could you have fun with it if you're role played or didn't take it seriously.

329
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:25,540
Speaker 1: And I still get the feeling even after playing it, that while I don't think it's, it's that great, which we'll talk about a second.

330
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:32,160
Speaker 1: I do think that if you had a bunch of friends and you played those raids that you could get some role-playing on, I don't know.

331
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,865
Speaker 1: And I wouldn't be, it was.

332
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:46,054
Speaker 0: the thing is really leery because of something the guy said near the end where we basically, by the end of this interview, we're sitting there and we're like, so this game is basically 80% debt construction and like 15% luck and 5% tactics.

333
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:52,040
Speaker 0: And the guy was like, yeah, it's all debt construction to which we say.

334
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,840
Speaker 0: So then playing doesn't matter at all, does it?

335
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,800
Speaker 0: It's just debt construction.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,497
Speaker 0: That's the game.

337
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:57,600
Speaker 0: Why bother playing?

338
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,540
Speaker 1: Just make a deck, then show your deck to the other person.

339
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:01,618
Speaker 1: They show their deck to you.

340
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,559
Speaker 0: And his response was no, no, no, no, no.

341
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:05,557
Speaker 0: That's not true.

342
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,499
Speaker 0: And we were like, all right, dude.

343
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:08,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,320
Speaker 0: But then we were like, well, what about the rage?

345
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,939
Speaker 0: The rage is where the game shines.

346
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,380
Speaker 0: And he talked a bit, but the sentence he said was, I forget what raid about which he was talking, but he said, yeah, it's all about just the memorization.

347
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:24,780
Speaker 0: Right?

348
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,566
Speaker 0: So I played, what's it?

349
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:30,080
Speaker 0: raid like 40 times before I finally figured out how to beat it.

350
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,080
Speaker 0: And then I just made a deck that beat it like that.

351
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:32,798
Speaker 0: And it was awesome.

352
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:42,180
Speaker 1: I'm like, okay, so I can just buy the raid deck, look at all the cards in it, then look at all the cards I have, figure out exactly which cards I need to beat the raid deck.

353
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:43,640
Speaker 1: Then what's the point of playing?

354
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,118
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like just buying a jigsaw puzzle almost, and then solving it.

355
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,114
Speaker 1: only I need to buy.

356
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,180
Speaker 1: I can't just, I don't get all the pieces.

357
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,840
Speaker 1: I have to keep buying more pieces until I have all the pieces I need to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

358
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Speaker 0: Now, at the same time, we went into this and I was trying not to compare it to magic.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,559
Speaker 0: I mean, I've played a bunch of card games over the years, a little bit, mostly by borrowing decks.

360
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,380
Speaker 0: So I played the Harry Potter game, which was garbage.

361
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Speaker 0: I played Yu-Gi-Oh, which is garbage.

362
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played, I played, I played magic for a while.

363
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,860
Speaker 0: Pokemon was slightly less garbage.

364
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,360
Speaker 1: Pokemon I definitely say is slightly less garbage.

365
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,800
Speaker 1: At least I played the original one and I still have maybe a couple hundred cards.

366
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,376
Speaker 1: That's about it.

367
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,698
Speaker 1: Maybe not even that.

368
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:34,280
Speaker 1: And that was definitely, it still has all the fundamental problems of a CCG, but in all honesty, it is the best one that I've played.

369
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,719
Speaker 1: I'm sure there might be others out there.

370
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Speaker 0: But I'm trying not to compare it to magic, especially old, old, old magic.

371
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:47,740
Speaker 0: Because remember, I remember when magic almost died and when like buying of magic cards dropped off and all the game stores stopped carrying it for a while.

372
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 0: And that was when I said, wow, magic is dead.

373
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,600
Speaker 0: And it wasn't just me like a lot of players at the time agreed.

374
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,918
Speaker 0: Magic is dead.

375
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:58,079
Speaker 0: And the Fallen Empires expansion is what killed it.

376
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:02,340
Speaker 1: I started playing magic when the Fallen Empires was just like, just about to come out.

377
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,600
Speaker 0: Yeah.

378
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,880
Speaker 0: There was like this decay.

379
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,200
Speaker 1: Like I bought like a revised and then a Fallen Empires booster.

380
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,700
Speaker 0: And then the game kind of faltered.

381
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Speaker 0: Then it was like Ice Age and new players started coming in and the game changed.

382
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,520
Speaker 0: And then the last game of magic I ever played was actually at a regional tournament.

383
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,220
Speaker 0: And it was like three days after alliances.

384
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,179
Speaker 1: That's when I stopped playing as I played a tournament in like Jersey at some hotel and alliances was brand new.

385
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:28,798
Speaker 0: I remember I walked in and I forgot that alliances had come out.

386
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,460
Speaker 0: So I walk in and a kid walks up to me.

387
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,920
Speaker 0: He's like, you want to buy an alliance booster?

388
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,020
Speaker 0: And I was like, no fucking way.

389
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,220
Speaker 0: No, God damn it.

390
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,559
Speaker 0: How much?

391
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:37,439
Speaker 0: He's like 20 bucks.

392
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,454
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't 20 bucks.

393
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:42,700
Speaker 0: No, he said 20 bucks because it was a regional tournament, right?

394
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,559
Speaker 0: Where else are you going to get them?

395
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,320
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I was at the tournament and alliances just came out.

396
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,620
Speaker 1: I went into the dealer's room and they had plenty and they were $2.

397
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,016
Speaker 1: They didn't.

398
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,598
Speaker 0: So this kid was trying to scalp them.

399
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:58,040
Speaker 0: So I was like, man, I can't win the tournament now because people are going to buy all the good alliance cards and win.

400
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,400
Speaker 0: And then I walk into the tournament room and there's the biggest hand drawn poster I've ever seen.

401
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,860
Speaker 0: It was like a big piece of poster with electrical tape forming the letters.

402
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:09,820
Speaker 0: And it said, no alliances allowed.

403
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,839
Speaker 0: Type one a only.

404
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,320
Speaker 0: And I remember that was like the best.

405
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,860
Speaker 0: I still fucking lost the tournament.

406
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,519
Speaker 0: Like you wouldn't believe.

407
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,840
Speaker 1: Oh, I got completely hosed because I'd only ever played against my loser friends.

408
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,060
Speaker 1: And you know, we didn't know the strategies or anything.

409
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:24,880
Speaker 1: Despite buying books and magazines.

410
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,519
Speaker 0: I knew the perfect deck and I probably could have won.

411
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,738
Speaker 0: I couldn't afford it.

412
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,120
Speaker 0: So I made some poison deck that relied heavily on getting certain cards early on.

413
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,411
Speaker 1: Yep.

414
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the World of Warcraft card game, right?

415
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,800
Speaker 1: We didn't want to compare it to magic, but it's a game where you put down resource cards and then you summon monsters and then you attack.

416
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,739
Speaker 0: It's every round.

417
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,460
Speaker 0: You drop your resource cards.

418
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,718
Speaker 0: You can put one down per turn.

419
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:54,600
Speaker 0: You tap, I'm sorry, exhaust by rotating 90 degrees to the right.

420
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,720
Speaker 0: And you then it's just colorless mana.

421
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:00,600
Speaker 0: And creatures.

422
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
Speaker 0: And the best part is the guy's like, it's not magic.

423
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,596
Speaker 0: It's not magic.

424
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,300
Speaker 0: But I'm like, all right, so I tapped this.

425
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,459
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, no, no, no.

426
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,199
Speaker 0: You exhausted.

427
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,580
Speaker 0: He catch himself.

428
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,920
Speaker 0: And then finally I decided, all right, I'm going to get him.

429
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,059
Speaker 0: I was like, all right.

430
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,960
Speaker 0: So I played a creature and I was like, so I can't attack on the first round, right?

431
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:19,259
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, summoning sickness.

432
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:21,980
Speaker 0: And I was like, what's it called in this game?

433
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,440
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, so I forget what he said.

434
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,014
Speaker 1: Yeah.

435
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:26,938
Speaker 0: He was like, yeah, it's just magic.

436
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,399
Speaker 1: But basically, all right.

437
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:42,260
Speaker 1: The thing is, despite the game largely being the same as magic, like the World of Warcraft MMO, World of Warcraft is fundamentally the same as the muds that preceded it.

438
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,960
Speaker 1: Yet it was polished heavily.

439
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:52,320
Speaker 1: All the annoyances that were on top of the fundamental flaws were washed away in the World of Warcraft.

440
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:01,580
Speaker 1: Now, the World of Warcraft card card game has all the fundamental flaws of Magic the Gathering and other similar collectible card games.

441
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:06,340
Speaker 1: But all of the annoyances on top of those have been washed away.

442
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:11,220
Speaker 0: Now, I don't want to get into the long discussion of exactly why.

443
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:14,979
Speaker 0: But, you know, people would argue like, oh, but magic is this magic is this.

444
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,080
Speaker 0: And I guess we can take that to the forums.

445
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,020
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into it, especially since this is our news bit.

446
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:27,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but playing the game, it was just magic, but they removed like some of the more annoying mechanics of magic.

447
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,360
Speaker 0: Like the best example is resources.

448
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,319
Speaker 0: Any round you can play a land.

449
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,380
Speaker 0: Well, I guess they're quests and they have an extra little carrot dangle.

450
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:38,100
Speaker 1: I was thinking, why don't you just make a deck with no quest?

451
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,580
Speaker 1: The quests are not as good as cards as non quest cards.

452
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:41,940
Speaker 1: Right.

453
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,120
Speaker 1: So just make a deck of all non quests and you can use any card as a land in quotes.

454
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,919
Speaker 0: Well, the quest do get you things they do.

455
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,420
Speaker 1: But I think the quests were not nearly as useful as actual cards.

456
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,584
Speaker 0: Yeah.

457
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,420
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I guess we'd have to see more of the guy.

458
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,659
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about all the cards available.

459
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,760
Speaker 0: The game is pretty much one hundred percent deck building.

460
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:04,659
Speaker 0: And the guy was like, no, it isn't.

461
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,140
Speaker 0: And he showed us a strategy.

462
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,700
Speaker 0: He's like, no, what if you want to any.

463
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,219
Speaker 1: What if you bluffed?

464
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,007
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, that would.

465
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:19,939
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, he was like, I can attack him now for five damage or I could wait until I have a whole bunch of attacks and then attack him all at once for the one round kill.

466
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,360
Speaker 0: And it's totally awesome.

467
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,119
Speaker 1: And I was like, but wait, I can attack every turn and then the guy can defend even if he just attacked.

468
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:26,598
Speaker 1: Why?

469
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,760
Speaker 1: Why would I ever not attack unless I was going to die from attacking?

470
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,040
Speaker 0: And it just basically playing the game.

471
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,180
Speaker 0: It was just this kind of simplified magic game.

472
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,960
Speaker 0: It comes down to one hundred percent.

473
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:46,700
Speaker 0: Well, I guess maybe 90 percent deck building and knowing what cards and knowing what cards the other person is going to play and kind of like a magic tournaments.

474
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,800
Speaker 0: It was all about sideboard management and pregame tactics.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,980
Speaker 0: Well, pregame strategy.

476
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:55,280
Speaker 0: Once you played, there were no tactical decisions at all.

477
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,980
Speaker 0: There were only strategic decisions.

478
00:27:57,402 --> 00:28:00,360
Speaker 0: But you just made all those decisions before you played.

479
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,351
Speaker 1: It's basically right.

480
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:03,820
Speaker 1: instead of rock, paper, scissors.

481
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,180
Speaker 1: Imagine rock, paper, scissors.

482
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:05,560
Speaker 1: Right.

483
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:10,758
Speaker 1: But instead of just rock, paper and scissor, you have like a thousand different things you can choose from.

484
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,480
Speaker 1: Nuclear missile, nuclear missile defender.

485
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,420
Speaker 0: So what you do, though, is you pick, you and your friend each pick a hundred of these secretly.

486
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,740
Speaker 0: And then you pick another ten that you can swap in and out with.

487
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,260
Speaker 0: Yep.

488
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,500
Speaker 0: And then you play a game and then you're both allowed to swap in and out.

489
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,580
Speaker 0: And then you play another game and then you're both allowed to swap in and out.

490
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,280
Speaker 0: Then you play a third game and whoever wins two out of three wins.

491
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,899
Speaker 1: It's just complicated rock, paper, scissor.

492
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,120
Speaker 1: There was nothing to it.

493
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,420
Speaker 0: We said we didn't want to compare this game to WOW either.

494
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,980
Speaker 0: And same with the collectible game.

495
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:48,899
Speaker 0: But in both instances, the people who are demoing these games for us would basically every other sentence say it's exactly like WOW.

496
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,040
Speaker 0: We have tried to recreate the WOW experience a hundred percent.

497
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:52,966
Speaker 0: It is just.

498
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,440
Speaker 0: it is WOW in cards.

499
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:55,599
Speaker 0: It is WOW.

500
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,259
Speaker 0: We are targeting WOW players.

501
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,257
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

502
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Speaker 1: I mean, WOW has a lot of people and they're targeting collectors like specifically with the collectible game.

503
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,740
Speaker 0: They were giving us straight up percentages of drop rates.

504
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,040
Speaker 0: And they were like, yes, we really want it.

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,620
Speaker 0: We expect people to collect every version and everything and collect, collect, collect.

506
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,860
Speaker 0: And the primary focus is collecting.

507
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:17,660
Speaker 1: Yep.

508
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,458
Speaker 1: So screw that shit.

509
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,020
Speaker 0: And they pretty much even said that they're going after the sunk cost.

510
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:31,060
Speaker 0: I eventually got the miniatures people to say something to the effect of, well, yeah, the more they have, the more likely they are to keep buying more.

511
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Speaker 0: You're not going to just give up if you already own all these figures, right?

512
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:37,799
Speaker 0: And I was like, wow, I couldn't have said it better myself.

513
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,105
Speaker 1: Wow.

514
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,971
Speaker 1: Yeah.

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,384
Speaker 1: Wow.

516
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,143
Speaker 1: Wow.

517
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:52,450
Speaker 0: So speaking of WOW, I have talked about this before.

518
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,730
Speaker 0: I'm going to make it my thing of the day only because I'm possibly going to do something epic.

519
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,469
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I'm kind of afraid of doing this.

520
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:07,430
Speaker 0: But you see, the first MMO was Sierra's The Realm Online.

521
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:10,289
Speaker 0: And I've talked about it a few times.

522
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,046
Speaker 0: How I played this game for longer than WOW it existed, though that is no longer true because WOW has been around a while now.

523
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:19,210
Speaker 0: But let me put it, I'll put it to you straight.

524
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:31,780
Speaker 0: Not only is The Realm still online, not only is the website still up, not only are the forums still active, not only are people still playing, but it's $70 a year and there's still a free trial.

525
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:36,918
Speaker 1: That's $70 a year.

526
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,068
Speaker 1: isn't too bad compared to some other MMOs.

527
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,646
Speaker 0: But what I'm thinking I want to do is remember this game had like 30,000 people in it.

528
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,148
Speaker 1: See if your account is still in there.

529
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:52,090
Speaker 0: Well, theoretically, I was given an account in perpetuity, but I'm sure it's not there anymore.

530
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,230
Speaker 0: But what I could be, I think I don't even remember my password.

531
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:58,030
Speaker 1: Fuck, if I saw the old email addresses.

532
00:30:58,575 --> 00:30:58,808
Speaker 0: Yes.

533
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,243
Speaker 0: Yes.

534
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,270
Speaker 0: Elsendar@geocities.com.

535
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:02,899
Speaker 0: Yeah.

536
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:03,669
Speaker 0: Yeah.

537
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:05,990
Speaker 1: It could have been merged with the yahoo account.

538
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,850
Speaker 0: A yahoo account that I don't have the password for anymore.

539
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,870
Speaker 1: You get it recovered.

540
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:12,895
Speaker 0: How?

541
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,729
Speaker 0: It doesn't, I don't have an alternate email address in there.

542
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:18,066
Speaker 0: My alternate email address was the geos80s one.

543
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:20,390
Speaker 1: Because I didn't want, I hate yahoo.

544
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,450
Speaker 1: There has to be a way.

545
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:22,830
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a way.

546
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:23,610
Speaker 1: Well, anyway.

547
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:32,506
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think I'm going to make a free account and go in and see just what the fuck it's like in there.

548
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:38,428
Speaker 1: Are you sure it's actually like, you know, still going or is it just like a website to the port just now?

549
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,468
Speaker 0: And it was there.

550
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:41,550
Speaker 0: All right.

551
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,010
Speaker 0: It gave the same response that it gave when I was a kid.

552
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:45,808
Speaker 0: All right.

553
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:47,607
Speaker 0: So I'm going to find out.

554
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,130
Speaker 0: I'm kind of afraid.

555
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:49,950
Speaker 1: Okay.

556
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,130
Speaker 0: I'm just going to link to the realm.

557
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:55,270
Speaker 0: You can look at some pictures.

558
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,210
Speaker 1: Remember, this was the first MMO and didn't meridian 59 come a little earlier?

559
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,530
Speaker 0: No, this game's a little bit later.

560
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,127
Speaker 0: A little bit later.

561
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,142
Speaker 1: They were similar in time because meridian 59, I didn't even hear know about the realm until you talked about it too.

562
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,670
Speaker 0: It was garbage.

563
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,550
Speaker 1: It was total trash garbage, like times a thousand.

564
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:21,389
Speaker 1: Like when those games are coming out, basically all those games did was popularize muds because people are like, oh man, I'd like to play that kind of game.

565
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,349
Speaker 1: Oh wait, they're charging a lot of money.

566
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,650
Speaker 1: Oh, but wait, there's these text-based ones that are the same game, but they're free.

567
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,248
Speaker 1: I'll do those.

568
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,949
Speaker 0: See, but I remember at the same time there was one other game.

569
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:42,810
Speaker 0: I actually, I think for Katie of all things was based on the same engine, but it was basically a text mud, but they kind of skinned it kind of like how there's that skin for dwarf or some people made like text muds, right?

570
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:53,268
Speaker 1: But then they would clear a client application that would, you know, basically it was just a telnet, you know, program, but instead of showing you the actual text in the terminal, it would read the text.

571
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,690
Speaker 1: The client would read the text and then render graphics based upon it.

572
00:32:57,012 --> 00:33:00,069
Speaker 1: And then you would click buttons in the interface and it would send the text.

573
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:04,290
Speaker 1: So it was just like a GUI on top of, you know, the existing telnet muds.

574
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,910
Speaker 1: You can play the mud with the GUI or play the mud with the typing.

575
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,190
Speaker 0: So the realm exists.

576
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:17,229
Speaker 0: And I really, apparently according to Wikipedia, which I just looked up now, there's still like 200 people in there.

577
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,608
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

578
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,127
Speaker 0: What are those people like?

579
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,489
Speaker 1: I watch one of those people is someone who remembers you.

580
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,130
Speaker 0: That would be kind of frightening.

581
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:34,288
Speaker 0: I mean, if elemental flame or Lorianna or L minister are in there, because Elminster was taken by some other guy.

582
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,537
Speaker 0: I still remember the night.

583
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:48,029
Speaker 0: it was sad, but when princess Diana died and I had a friend in the game whose name was princess die and he'd had that name for forever long before princess Diana died.

584
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:54,348
Speaker 0: And I remember him saying in the public channel, man, I'm going to get so much undeserved shit for this.

585
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,894
Speaker 1: That's like the guy who's playing Counter-Strike and his name was Osama bin Laden on September 10th.

586
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:03,647
Speaker 0: And then, you know, having the name Osama bin Laden wasn't making any friends before that.

587
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,310
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.

588
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,914
Speaker 1: But it was still.

589
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,110
Speaker 0: besides you can change your name in Counter-Strike.

590
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:07,626
Speaker 1: You can.

591
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:14,685
Speaker 0: I used to play Counter-Strike with the troll in his names sometimes, but depends on the server.

592
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:15,909
Speaker 0: It's not.

593
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,648
Speaker 0: I mean, the realm, if I had my millions, it wasn't that easy to transfer my millions to someone else.

594
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:27,070
Speaker 0: I basically have to go to like another account's house and dump it in the front yard and then change and hope that no one goes to the house and grabs it.

595
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:27,630
Speaker 0: But anyway.

596
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

597
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:28,670
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:34,449
Speaker 1: Now that we have new computers, you want to, you know, I remember a long time ago we said we're going to do the the wow free trial.

599
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,289
Speaker 1: It's moving up in the queue, I guess.

600
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:37,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it is.

601
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,989
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I don't imagine it taking more than like four hours.

602
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,149
Speaker 0: I think we should play every modern deathmatch because there aren't many deathmatches left in the world.

603
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:45,809
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely.

604
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:52,810
Speaker 0: Even though I contend now I'm not going to back this up because I haven't played any deathmatch since Quake three.

605
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,010
Speaker 0: And when I say deathmatch, I mean hardcore old school frags and Gibbs.

606
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,565
Speaker 0: And that's it.

607
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:02,090
Speaker 1: I played a quick for deathmatch once for a little bit.

608
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:02,609
Speaker 1: It was all right.

609
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,070
Speaker 0: I'm also talking PC only.

610
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,450
Speaker 0: None of that.

611
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:05,227
Speaker 1: Halo is PC.

612
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:12,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like Halo ones on the PC only on the PC because it's kind of a different game.

613
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,470
Speaker 0: otherwise for a lot of reasons.

614
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,910
Speaker 0: But I contend I think I postulate.

615
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:30,370
Speaker 0: I guess that lithium to deathmatch for the quick for Quake two was probably the most skill based and best overall FPS deathmatch ever made.

616
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,490
Speaker 1: I think that's mostly your sentimental values.

617
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:33,070
Speaker 0: I don't know.

618
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,789
Speaker 0: I think in terms of the cap on the skill, I think it had the highest cap, as in I don't think any human ever achieved the cap.

619
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:43,369
Speaker 0: Maybe I know people achieve the the cap in Quake three.

620
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:46,210
Speaker 1: And so my thing of the day here, right?

621
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,649
Speaker 1: This is something everyone on the air has priority seen.

622
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,049
Speaker 1: It's not really that new.

623
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,610
Speaker 1: There's just a new YouTube video of it that got the links got passed around.

624
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,250
Speaker 1: But this is like I hadn't seen it before, despite knowing it was old.

625
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,890
Speaker 1: And this is like right up my alley of things that I think are awesome.

626
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,170
Speaker 1: It's a robot.

627
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:06,128
Speaker 1: The robot is inside the box.

628
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,410
Speaker 1: The box is actually, you could say, is part of the robot.

629
00:36:10,052 --> 00:36:11,869
Speaker 1: There's a switch on the outside of the box.

630
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,088
Speaker 1: You flick the switch.

631
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,170
Speaker 1: The box opens and the robot will.

632
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,330
Speaker 1: Well, the robot is the box, but the robot will flick the switch in the other direction and then it will close itself.

633
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:34,548
Speaker 0: I will point out, I remember very clearly that in it not gotten not in the realm in Quest for Glory, you go into this bad place at one point with dangerous wizard stuff all around.

634
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:41,970
Speaker 0: And there's a box with a big lever and you pull the lever and this hairy ass arm comes out and pulls the lever to make the door close.

635
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,988
Speaker 0: It's exactly like your little box.

636
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:44,670
Speaker 1: Awesome.

637
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:46,028
Speaker 1: I like this box.

638
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,419
Speaker 0: So this won't take long tonight.

639
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:50,430
Speaker 0: talking about Risk.

640
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,030
Speaker 1: Yes, it is a game that is very famous.

641
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,350
Speaker 1: It's like a war game.

642
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,829
Speaker 1: I guess it is a war game, even though I sort of don't want to dignify it in any way.

643
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:10,930
Speaker 0: Risk is a almost completely random game that for some reason Americans have this fixation on kind of like monopoly or sorry or like headache.

644
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has like this place, problematic trouble.

645
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:14,766
Speaker 1: Yeah.

646
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,290
Speaker 1: It has like this place in people's mind.

647
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,828
Speaker 1: Like people know what Risk is.

648
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:21,050
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people have played it.

649
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,670
Speaker 1: It's popular.

650
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:27,278
Speaker 1: It's on the shelves in anywhere that board games are sold, unlike, say, Settlers of Catan, which is not on the shelves.

651
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,810
Speaker 1: anywhere board games are sold.

652
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,910
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's taken.

653
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,970
Speaker 1: Uh, it is a place in pop culture.

654
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,110
Speaker 1: Had the Seinfeld episode where the Ukraine is weak, very famous, very funny.

655
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:38,050
Speaker 1: All right.

656
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,470
Speaker 1: But Risk as a game is really not good at all.

657
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,570
Speaker 1: It's a complete waste of time.

658
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,050
Speaker 0: I mean, it can be fun if you have like a Risk party or everyone's really into it.

659
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,126
Speaker 1: Even when we had a Risk party, that's sort of like when I finally realized that wasn't fun.

660
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,789
Speaker 0: See, the Risk party was fun.

661
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,970
Speaker 0: The main reason it was fun is there was like the full on extended front row crew.

662
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:14,728
Speaker 0: And we had three simultaneous games of Risk going in the same room, and it was pretty much just a giant, crazy loud socializing party that happened to have a Risk in the center of it.

663
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,150
Speaker 1: Yeah.

664
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:15,706
Speaker 1: The Risk.

665
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,230
Speaker 1: And it's a funny thing.

666
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:18,710
Speaker 1: It's like when I was a kid, right?

667
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:21,330
Speaker 1: Like I didn't know about the real quality game.

668
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:22,269
Speaker 1: So I was like, Risk.

669
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,623
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

670
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,369
Speaker 1: Real game.

671
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:23,889
Speaker 0: All right.

672
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,890
Speaker 0: See, I guess as a kid, I knew better because even I'd play Risk with my family and I, the whole time it'd be like, this is random bullshit.

673
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:31,030
Speaker 0: That was bullshit.

674
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:32,850
Speaker 0: This game's just random bullshit.

675
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,309
Speaker 0: We might as well just flip a coin.

676
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,709
Speaker 1: So my family wouldn't play with me.

677
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:39,526
Speaker 1: I had to play, I could play with my brother and sometimes I could play with friends coming over.

678
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:47,210
Speaker 1: But, you know, basically it's like the game, like I liked it as a kid because I liked moving things around.

679
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,710
Speaker 1: I like playing with little soldiers and moving around a map.

680
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,370
Speaker 1: And, you know, I liked rolling dice, you know?

681
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:56,489
Speaker 1: But the game itself like didn't bother me at that young age.

682
00:38:57,111 --> 00:39:06,029
Speaker 1: And later on, you know, it's like every time we would play, like someone would just give up and quit or someone would like flip the board over, you know, it was getting really stupid and annoying.

683
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:13,015
Speaker 1: And I felt like it was sort of weird because I didn't get, I didn't, I like, I blamed the people I was playing with.

684
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:18,850
Speaker 1: instead of blaming the game, you know, because like I was sort of having fun moving the pieces around.

685
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:24,950
Speaker 1: It's like when the game was sort of crumble apart before actually finishing, I'd be like, ah, it's you.

686
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,710
Speaker 1: Why didn't you go through on the game?

687
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,168
Speaker 1: You suck.

688
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:27,435
Speaker 1: Blah.

689
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:32,750
Speaker 1: And it was, you know, but it took a while to realize, oh, the game sucks.

690
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:33,847
Speaker 1: That's why.

691
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:42,630
Speaker 0: So if you like Risk and you don't play German board games, play German board games, at least play Axes and Allies, which is marginally better.

692
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,450
Speaker 0: At least play.

693
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:49,610
Speaker 1: I mean, you're even better off playing an actual miniatures game like Warhammer or Battle Tech or one of those.

694
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,950
Speaker 0: Or even Castle Risk.

695
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:52,550
Speaker 1: Castle Risk is bad.

696
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,449
Speaker 0: Wasn't that bad.

697
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,143
Speaker 0: It's better than Risk.

698
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,030
Speaker 1: It is better than Risk, but that's not saying much.

699
00:39:57,391 --> 00:40:02,690
Speaker 0: It's like saying it smells better than poop, but God risk is just, I can say one thing.

700
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,009
Speaker 0: Australia guarantees you the solid second place.

701
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,845
Speaker 1: I guess it does.

702
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:09,690
Speaker 0: Yes, it does.

703
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:11,367
Speaker 1: I don't know.

704
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,310
Speaker 0: Just playing Risk is just not fun.

705
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,530
Speaker 0: And I'll tell you all one thing.

706
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:25,130
Speaker 0: And I think I said this before and some people in the forums, one guy emailed me and he was like, rim, I did what you said and I went at risk a lot now and pretty much always be on the offensive.

707
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:32,749
Speaker 0: If you're on the offensive and you outnumber your opponent about three to two, you will always win in aggregates.

708
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:33,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:38,370
Speaker 1: And you might lose a battle here and there, but you're going to win most of the time.

710
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:48,007
Speaker 1: And if you just keep battling everywhere, you know, if you start 10 battles a turn and you win six of them, you know, you're going to pretty much be equally powerful as the other guy.

711
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:51,629
Speaker 1: And you're going to gain six territories and, you know, lose three.

712
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:56,507
Speaker 1: You're going to be up and you do it again the next turn to be up again and you'll get more than him.

713
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,169
Speaker 1: And then momentum sets in and you win.

714
00:40:58,855 --> 00:40:59,770
Speaker 1: And that's the game.

715
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,072
Speaker 1: It just.

716
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:02,190
Speaker 1: I think the problems with risk are this.

717
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:09,429
Speaker 0: Number one, there's a lot of randomness going on, but that seems to be a trend in almost every American style board game ever made.

718
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:09,723
Speaker 0: Yep.

719
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:13,990
Speaker 1: Number two, the cards really kind of dumb, really.

720
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:19,950
Speaker 0: I remember playing a problematic trouble, which was I don't know how popular it is among families nowadays.

721
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,069
Speaker 0: But when I was a kid, I saw some people playing travel trouble at the laundromat.

722
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:26,498
Speaker 0: Uh, that game was like the.

723
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:36,769
Speaker 0: I mean, I played a lot of board games as a kid with my family and I'd always get into arguments because I would always contend that every game we owned was completely random and there was no point in playing them.

724
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:37,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

725
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:38,530
Speaker 1: I mean, trouble.

726
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,430
Speaker 0: And they'd always say, no, you're just a sore loser.

727
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,810
Speaker 1: Trouble was fun because of the problematic part.

728
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:45,970
Speaker 1: Other than that, it was just roll, move, roll, move, roll, move.

729
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,290
Speaker 0: It was just Candyland, basically, basically.

730
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,010
Speaker 1: It's saying Uncle Wiggly even.

731
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,610
Speaker 0: Oh God, Uncle Wiggly.

732
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,970
Speaker 1: Even worse than Candyland.

733
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,110
Speaker 0: We have like an old 1930 something version of Uncle Wiggly.

734
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:56,969
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

735
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:58,390
Speaker 1: I like Uncle Wiggly.

736
00:41:58,651 --> 00:41:59,250
Speaker 1: I like Candyland.

737
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,108
Speaker 1: I just don't like the games.

738
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,048
Speaker 1: I like the theme.

739
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:02,210
Speaker 0: Chutes and Ladders.

740
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,470
Speaker 1: Chutes and Ladders, same game.

741
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,530
Speaker 0: Actually, there was one good game.

742
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,370
Speaker 0: It was called Payday and it was kind of manager money.

743
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:08,690
Speaker 1: Other people had that game.

744
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,990
Speaker 1: I didn't, but I seen it around.

745
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,569
Speaker 0: It was better than most of those games.

746
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,170
Speaker 1: Careers was a better version.

747
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:13,439
Speaker 1: Yeah.

748
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,609
Speaker 0: The worst game was Life.

749
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,407
Speaker 1: Life, yeah.

750
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,829
Speaker 1: Careers is basically life, but sucks less.

751
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:20,510
Speaker 1: I have careers in the closet.

752
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,090
Speaker 1: We could play it.

753
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:31,090
Speaker 0: I would recommend that if you ever have the urge to play Risk ever again, just hit yourself on the arm with a newspaper and say nope, and then go buy like Illuminati or something and play that.

754
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,809
Speaker 0: It's just as tedious, but at least it's more fun.

755
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:39,110
Speaker 1: The thing that I think is the biggest problem with Risk is that it takes too long for what you get.

756
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,790
Speaker 1: I mean, look at a game like Shogun, say, or Samurai Sword.

757
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,010
Speaker 1: That game is awesome.

758
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,950
Speaker 0: And no, if you want to play Risk, play Shogun instead.

759
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:47,369
Speaker 1: Yes.

760
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,990
Speaker 1: Well, Samurai Sword is formerly known as Shogun, right?

761
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,410
Speaker 1: Because there's other games named Shogun that are not Samurai Sword.

762
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,609
Speaker 0: In fact, there's two other games named Shogun that I know of.

763
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,989
Speaker 1: We're talking Milton Bradley's Game Master series, Shogun/Samurai Sword.

764
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,983
Speaker 0: The one for your old D12.

765
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,109
Speaker 1: It comes in a box that looks a lot like the Axis and Allies boxes in the same set.

766
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:07,170
Speaker 1: All right.

767
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:11,250
Speaker 1: So in that game, there's a lot of different stuff going on.

768
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,850
Speaker 1: You got the, you got the, the Goku management.

769
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:14,870
Speaker 1: You got the Ninja.

770
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:16,263
Speaker 1: You got the Ronin.

771
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,750
Speaker 1: You got the castles, right?

772
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,729
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of different things that spice the game up.

773
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,050
Speaker 1: In Risk, it's just how many units do you have?

774
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:26,308
Speaker 1: Where are they?

775
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:27,730
Speaker 1: That's it.

776
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,010
Speaker 1: It's a number and a spot.

777
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:35,190
Speaker 1: It couldn't be more bland with just nothing to think about, nothing to do.

778
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,790
Speaker 1: It's just my number is bigger than yours and it's next to yours.

779
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:39,541
Speaker 1: Attack.

780
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,570
Speaker 1: And like, you can just move all your guys through your own territory infinitely, right?

781
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:45,548
Speaker 1: If I remember.

782
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:47,610
Speaker 0: Not fully.

783
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:48,688
Speaker 1: I pretty much.

784
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:57,089
Speaker 1: And basically I remember I would just have you basically move all your guys to the border territories and all your inner territories would be pretty much empty.

785
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:05,050
Speaker 1: That was just like, so all it was was just, okay, I put all most my guys next to most of your guys.

786
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,629
Speaker 1: Then we roll the dice a whole bunch and see who wins.

787
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:11,610
Speaker 1: And maybe once in a blue moon, the guy with less guys would hold out.

788
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:14,689
Speaker 1: One unit would somehow destroy like Dan and it would be crazy.

789
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:24,190
Speaker 0: When a player has finished attacking, he or she has the option to move any number of armies from one and only one of their territories in adjacent territory that occupy.

790
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,129
Speaker 0: And then there's the whole fortifying after the fact stuff too.

791
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:28,530
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

792
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,370
Speaker 0: Risk is not worth playing ever again.

793
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,910
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

794
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,767
Speaker 0: Don't bother with it.

795
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,870
Speaker 1: And it's famous.

796
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,350
Speaker 1: I don't know why it's famous.

797
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,108
Speaker 1: It just is.

798
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:59,030
Speaker 1: I get the feeling it's weird because in other mediums of, you know, art creation, right, things which have become famous, you know, it might not always be the most, you know, artistically wonderful and perfect things that get the most famous, you know, but the things that do get famous have some sort of merit, you know, like really famous movies.

799
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:02,230
Speaker 1: You don't see really terrible movies becoming really popular.

800
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:14,666
Speaker 1: I mean, you might see like a summer blockbuster getting really popular, but it's not going to be like some horrendously bad one that like people are like barfing when they watch or like it's so painful, you know, they just, you know, they might be average.

801
00:45:14,726 --> 00:45:20,190
Speaker 1: or, you know, the really popular video games, you know, the halos, the maddens, the GTAs, right?

802
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:21,710
Speaker 1: They're not that bad.

803
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,822
Speaker 1: I mean, they're no, they're no

804
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:24,405
Speaker 1: E.T.,

805
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:24,908
Speaker 1: right?

806
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,297
Speaker 1: But in board games, at least in the

807
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:28,858
Speaker 1: U.S.,

808
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:32,639
Speaker 1: the really popular ones are the really terrible ones.

809
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,549
Speaker 1: They're just so bad.

810
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:41,410
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is, but what is the mac and the ridiculous obsession with bad games?

811
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,150
Speaker 1: Monopoly, so bad.

812
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,210
Speaker 1: Risk, so bad.

813
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,989
Speaker 0: I guess, you know, here's this might be the illuminating point.

814
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,550
Speaker 1: Scrabble is not so bad.

815
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:49,429
Speaker 0: Scrabble is pretty bad.

816
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,610
Speaker 1: No, it's not that bad.

817
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:51,110
Speaker 1: It's not.

818
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:52,050
Speaker 0: Their worst game.

819
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,330
Speaker 1: Stratego is not so bad either.

820
00:45:53,711 --> 00:46:00,710
Speaker 0: But I want to, I point out that if you play Monopoly according to the rules, it's not nearly as bad of a game.

821
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,070
Speaker 0: It's just incredibly unfun.

822
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,450
Speaker 0: It's not that unfun.

823
00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:04,082
Speaker 0: It's pretty unfun.

824
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,050
Speaker 0: What I'm saying, though, you're missing the point.

825
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:12,600
Speaker 0: The default game, Monopoly, as it is in the rule book originally is not that bad of a game.

826
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,790
Speaker 1: It's not that bad.

827
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:15,170
Speaker 0: Let me finish.

828
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:15,565
Speaker 0: Good guy.

829
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:27,990
Speaker 0: But every American I've ever met who plays Monopoly, they all play with the same set of house rules to the point that everyone in America thinks these are the rules, even though they're not written in any rule book ever.

830
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:34,090
Speaker 0: And all these rules serve to do is make the game like four times more random.

831
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:37,829
Speaker 0: It's like they try to remove skill from games and make it more fair.

832
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:39,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

833
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:50,029
Speaker 1: I think the reason, though, people do that in Monopoly is because if you play Monopoly by the rules, the real way it's supposed to be played, it's very painful and unfun.

834
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,670
Speaker 0: because really, it's not any less painful.

835
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,270
Speaker 0: It does.

836
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:58,009
Speaker 1: If you suck because you basically have not so much money, you can't just buy everything you land on.

837
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:03,326
Speaker 1: You know, you have to actually think about things and do things like what are the original rules?

838
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,370
Speaker 1: Well, it's different.

839
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,009
Speaker 1: Someone lands on a property like you auction it off.

840
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:08,510
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

841
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,689
Speaker 0: If you land on a property, you have the right to buy it.

842
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:13,288
Speaker 0: If you don't buy it, then it is auctioned.

843
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,169
Speaker 0: You have the right to buy it, though.

845
00:47:17,432 --> 00:47:18,870
Speaker 0: It doesn't just automatically go to auction.

846
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:20,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you like.

847
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:27,429
Speaker 1: I remember I played a DOS version that sort of had the auctioning, but you could actually opt not to auction, which is not an option in the real rules.

848
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,669
Speaker 1: You have to auction it if you don't buy it anyway.

849
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,987
Speaker 1: The point is, if you play Monopoly by the real rules, it's it's not.

850
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:39,810
Speaker 1: you know, people like to have lots of money and they like to just buy everything they land on.

851
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,190
Speaker 1: I'd like to collect the little properties and move the guy around the board.

852
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:51,849
Speaker 1: And by modifying the rules, by putting lots of money in the middle and getting it when you land on free parking and stuff like that, it makes the game like you're getting more stuff and you go.

853
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:53,189
Speaker 0: Well, that's just it.

854
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:58,989
Speaker 0: Seems like a lot of people really don't like games of skill and they want to play games that are effectively just pretty colors.

855
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,789
Speaker 1: They just want to collect lots of thingies and feel good about collecting lots of thingies.

856
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,550
Speaker 0: Oh, well, we might get some hate from the fact that we're hating on risk.

857
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:06,990
Speaker 0: You know what?

858
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,330
Speaker 0: Risk is a terrible game.

859
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:09,268
Speaker 1: And you know what?

860
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,635
Speaker 1: I feel like this whole show.

861
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:11,097
Speaker 1: really.

862
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:17,650
Speaker 1: I mean, it could it's it's it's technically the risk show, but really it's just the bitch about bad games.

863
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:22,029
Speaker 1: I mean, they bitched about the world card game sucking some more.

864
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,329
Speaker 1: They bitched about, you know, the sucky risk.

865
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:27,990
Speaker 1: I sort of Rondo of Swords wasn't that bad.

866
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:28,968
Speaker 1: It's a good it's OK.

867
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,649
Speaker 1: Puzzle game.

868
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,110
Speaker 0: I mentioned Advanced Wars and I like it a lot.

869
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:32,608
Speaker 0: I guess.

870
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:32,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

871
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:35,289
Speaker 0: Man, want to play Advanced Wars right now?

872
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:37,349
Speaker 1: No, we got to play other games.

873
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,127
Speaker 0: Now we don't.

874
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,529
Speaker 1: We got Mario Kart and such.

875
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played.

876
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:42,090
Speaker 0: we played a few races in Mario Kart.

877
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,784
Speaker 0: All I have to say, it's really fun, except when the A.I.

878
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:50,109
Speaker 0: is around because there's so many items that it's just it's not worth playing to figure out how to turn the A.I.

879
00:48:50,481 --> 00:48:50,609
Speaker 1: off.

880
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,600
Speaker 1: And if that's not possible, it's gonna be very annoying.

881
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:56,050
Speaker 0: if I'm sure there's a way we played the game for like 10 minutes.

882
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,710
Speaker 0: But if there is no way to turn off all those extra A.I.

883
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,870
Speaker 0: players, I'm done with Mario Kart already.

884
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,470
Speaker 1: I know that's not the case, but yeah, we'll probably play it when people come over.

885
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,147
Speaker 1: But it's, you know, yeah.

886
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:08,949
Speaker 0: Yeah.

887
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,870
Speaker 0: Plus, people said, oh, they took out snaking completely.

888
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:19,010
Speaker 0: But I discovered already that if I pick a car with the worst handling I can, I can totally gold spark on straight away.

889
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,930
Speaker 1: You can, but it's not snaking because you're not like having to hurt your hand by wiggling back and forth.

890
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's the same kind of gaming.

891
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,602
Speaker 0: It's just not quite as bad.

892
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,856
Speaker 1: But you can tell the problem I had with the snaking was not the boosting on the straight away, but the fact that you had to.

893
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:36,009
Speaker 1: basically the way to win the game was by shaking your hand furiously back and forth.

894
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,970
Speaker 0: Well, all you had to do really was don't shake your hand.

895
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,269
Speaker 1: Shake the D.S Well, so a game that you win, that's basically the shaking game, not fun.

896
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:49,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's if it's, you know, sort of a slow, actual doable control, then it's that is acceptable.

897
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:50,690
Speaker 0: You know, it's funny.

898
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,450
Speaker 0: I thought, oh, I have a bunch of risk anecdotes.

899
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:57,928
Speaker 0: But when I think back, I have a couple of castle risk anecdotes, but I don't want to talk about castle risk.

900
00:49:58,131 --> 00:49:58,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, that game.

901
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,150
Speaker 1: You probably I barely remember castle.

902
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:01,806
Speaker 0: I owned it.

903
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:02,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did.

904
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,290
Speaker 0: The only anecdotes I have are either.

905
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:13,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had this risk party one time and every other one ends with, yeah, everyone got pissed at each other and quit playing after about an hour.

906
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much all my risk things where you cheated or the game is bullshit.

907
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,127
Speaker 1: I give up.

908
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,138
Speaker 1: There's nothing I can do.

909
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,390
Speaker 1: or this isn't fun anymore.

910
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,590
Speaker 1: It's been going on too long or, you know, no one.

911
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,770
Speaker 1: You know, it's like no one ever finishes that game or finishes Monopoly either.

912
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,582
Speaker 1: What does that tell you?

913
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:31,688
Speaker 1: What does that tell you?

914
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:36,610
Speaker 0: You know, I'm liking more and more because we bought a couple of games over the weekend and well, last weekend.

915
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll talk.

916
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,150
Speaker 1: We bought diplomacy and I bought through the ages.

917
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:43,030
Speaker 0: Both of these games have something that other games don't have.

918
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:50,450
Speaker 0: They have a way for a player to quit that doesn't just end the game and break everything, Like, because, you know, let's say you're playing Monopoly and you say, I quit.

919
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,790
Speaker 1: Well, there's no rules in the game for quitting and it sort of ruins the game if someone quits.

920
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:56,530
Speaker 1: because now what do you do with their money?

921
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,530
Speaker 1: What do you do with their property?

922
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,268
Speaker 0: It doesn't so much in Monopoly, but there are other games where it totally ruined like settlers.

923
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,248
Speaker 0: What now?

924
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

925
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,710
Speaker 1: If someone quits in the middle of the game, it just ruins the game.

926
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:14,309
Speaker 1: But these games actually have built in rules diplomacy and through the ages and say, if someone wants to quit, this is what you do.

927
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,090
Speaker 1: And it's actually, oh, now, you know, that's that's really good.

928
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:18,606
Speaker 1: I like that.

929
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:24,509
Speaker 1: I like especially for long games, you know, a way for someone to quit that doesn't break the game for the remaining players.

930
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:25,469
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

931
