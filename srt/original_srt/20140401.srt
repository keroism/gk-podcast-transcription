1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,132
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 1st 2014.

2
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:15,281
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nice tonight.

3
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,166
Speaker 0: Why no one will game with you?

4
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,590
Speaker 0: and no we're not joking.

5
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:22,576
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,204
Speaker 0: Happy the internet is nothing but lies for 24 hours day.

7
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,842
Speaker 1: Unhappy the internet is nothing but lies to 24 hours day, and you know what.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,889
Speaker 1: so this year was better and worse.

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, there weren't like slashdot had some real stuff going on right now.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,940
Speaker 0: Park was actually really clever, and they they almost got me.

11
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:48,176
Speaker 1: it was better and that there was actually some fools and Less just bullshit.

12
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,390
Speaker 1: it was better and that there was less bullshit.

13
00:00:52,092 --> 00:01:00,100
Speaker 1: But it was worse and that a lot of people were starting early perhaps using time zones as an excuse Forgetting that New York is the only place in the world.

14
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,632
Speaker 0: You know it's funny because in the financial world That's like.

15
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:03,718
Speaker 0: that's kind of how it goes.

16
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,830
Speaker 0: people in the other time zones of the u.s.

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,870
Speaker 0: Basically have to keep New York hours anyway, that's exactly right.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,545
Speaker 1: You know when you see on TV like some office They always have those clocks on the wall that are like London, New York whatever.

19
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,790
Speaker 1: in New York We have one clock on the wall, New York.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,534
Speaker 0: Well now you'll have to.

21
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:21,430
Speaker 0: you'll have London because you want to know when you can call people in London.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,809
Speaker 1: But you know you want to know they're gonna call you so you can leave work.

23
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:34,270
Speaker 0: But I gotta say FARC almost got me because I you know far like I love FARC.

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,210
Speaker 0: I've been reading FARC for a long fucking time.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:53,405
Speaker 0: I kind of realized that today because what far I go to FARC and I see the headline That's like Ronald Reagan finally died 10 years after his brain went into Alzheimer's and I remember and all I thought was That already happened, but then there's that slight moment of right right.

26
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,790
Speaker 0: There's no way he was still alive.

27
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,663
Speaker 1: Why would you even have to question that?

28
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:58,930
Speaker 0: because the news thing appears?

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,695
Speaker 1: I'm like oh Ronald Reagan says like yeah, you know what I would think How the headline was written.

30
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:09,110
Speaker 1: I might not think that the news was he died today, but oh something about his death.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,885
Speaker 1: So what I thought was like, you know, someone's writing a news article about the past.

32
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,377
Speaker 0: So what I thought was Well, okay.

33
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,470
Speaker 0: There's obviously something else going on here because FARC.

34
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,794
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the point of FARC.

35
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:23,430
Speaker 0: the headline is something funny or intriguing and the article might be something very different.

36
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:38,960
Speaker 0: So I click on it and the article is like Ronald Reagan died today on legitimate news and before I thought anything I noticed dateline today's date Mmm, so then I go to the comments and I see.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,670
Speaker 0: so I see a few people who were gotten by it and a few other people who were like wait a minute that article is way old and Then I realized what was going on.

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,720
Speaker 0: Every link on FARC today was just from 2004.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,830
Speaker 0: Okay, that's all they did ten years ago.

40
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:01,542
Speaker 0: So you go to every thread and there's a few people who either some people are like, oh my god This is a duplicate from 2004.

41
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,286
Speaker 0: The fuck FARC.

42
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:09,750
Speaker 0: Come on I think that was the second best thing I saw today related to the April of fools.

43
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:17,269
Speaker 1: But it reminds you if you really just need some sort of you know Serotonin fix in your brain and there's no new news coming in fast enough.

44
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:21,204
Speaker 1: Just go to news 20 years ago or 10 years ago.

45
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,870
Speaker 0: There's Wikipedia pages that do that.

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,466
Speaker 0: They're like what happened in this year, right?

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,387
Speaker 1: You know go to go to reddit and go like page a thousand and see what's there.

48
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:30,950
Speaker 1: right there'll be something there.

49
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, just start reading FARC archives, I guess.

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,237
Speaker 0: Yeah But Dorkly pretty much had it best.

51
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,202
Speaker 1: They had the perfectness.

52
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:42,170
Speaker 0: that video is what all your April Fools jokes look like.

53
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,143
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

54
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:49,265
Speaker 1: Homestar runner updated which it wasn't really a fool or a thing.

55
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:50,490
Speaker 1: It was just it updated.

56
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:57,341
Speaker 0: They just updated it on April Fool's Day to be like what should have happened is like when Google announced gmail for real on April Fool's Day.

57
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,802
Speaker 0: Valve should have announced half-life 3 today like for real.

58
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,669
Speaker 0: exactly that would have been it.

59
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:08,686
Speaker 0: But no instead they launched a half-life 4 and halo 5.

60
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:18,490
Speaker 0: So In personal life stuff, you know We talked about that flying episode and part of the reason I thought of doing that Is that it's really hard to book flights to and from places that aren't New York or London.

61
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,767
Speaker 0: Like you want to fly direct to Boston from anywhere.

62
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:22,269
Speaker 0: good luck.

63
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,970
Speaker 0: And yeah, I just last-minute booked all these flights to Paris and everything.

64
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:33,438
Speaker 0: Oh, so if anyone's gonna be in Paris I'm late to from us at trade tech Paris.

65
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,066
Speaker 0: I don't do buddy and you want to hang out.

66
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:37,570
Speaker 0: I might be kind of bored there.

67
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,627
Speaker 1: You're gonna go to France in Paris and be bored.

68
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:43,390
Speaker 0: How is that?

69
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:49,950
Speaker 0: Two of those days Scott, you know how sometimes we go to Conventions run by people where we owe them a favor.

70
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,560
Speaker 0: This is my excited about going to those convention.

71
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,930
Speaker 1: My company sends me to a place like that.

72
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,175
Speaker 0: You're just not gonna go to the convention.

73
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,319
Speaker 1: I did exactly right.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,147
Speaker 1: I will go to the Louvre or two.

75
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,837
Speaker 0: Ah, so if it's a way because we booked at the last second, there weren't any good flights or liberty I'm actually flying out Saturday.

76
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,628
Speaker 0: So I'll get to Paris at like 11 a.m.

77
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:10,130
Speaker 0: On Sunday.

78
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:16,137
Speaker 0: so I got the whole day to just fuck around in Paris and Monday And I'll be by myself.

79
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:21,740
Speaker 0: So I'll probably get some business meetings, but other than those meetings Wandering around fuck around just like London.

80
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:27,841
Speaker 0: and then Tuesday Wednesday is the conference My CEOs flying with me, but he's leaving early on Wednesday.

81
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:34,116
Speaker 0: So there's no one to supervise me and I'm flying home Thursday at like 2 p.m.

82
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,367
Speaker 0: Which will get me to packs Thursday night at like 6 p.m.

83
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:41,650
Speaker 0: Because the time zones Okay, so I'll have a bunch of days to fuck around in Paris.

84
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,670
Speaker 0: So a bunch of you tried to meet up with me in London.

85
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:46,337
Speaker 0: Sorry, that didn't happen.

86
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,328
Speaker 0: But I actually had a lot less time than I thought I'd have.

87
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:54,030
Speaker 1: Why don't you just tell them to meet you at the Eiffel Tower at like 6 or something?

88
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,330
Speaker 0: Maybe but I don't want to be beholden to that schedule.

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,013
Speaker 0: That's my trouble.

90
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,290
Speaker 0: part of the reason I didn't meet up with anyone in London is you're not beholden to a schedule.

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,353
Speaker 1: You can't meet anyone.

92
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,337
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

93
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:05,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could be like, yeah, I'm meeting people works.

94
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:06,430
Speaker 1: There needs to be a time.

95
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,099
Speaker 0: I'm at this place right now.

96
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,089
Speaker 0: I'll be here for the next two hours go.

97
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:13,104
Speaker 1: How is anyone gonna make it there within the two hours in New York?

98
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,128
Speaker 0: I think someone would make it.

99
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a subway.

100
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:17,488
Speaker 0: Paris has a subway.

101
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's way better than London subway.

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,190
Speaker 1: Sure, but it is not up to par with the New York subway.

103
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,163
Speaker 0: No subway in the world is up to par.

104
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,049
Speaker 0: Ding ding ding ding ding.

105
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,717
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah, that's that's what I got.

106
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:31,841
Speaker 0: that's what's going on in my life.

107
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,189
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'm flying home through Reykjavik.

108
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,160
Speaker 0: Okay, but I can't.

109
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,090
Speaker 0: I don't have enough time.

110
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:42,795
Speaker 0: Basically what I wanted to do was stop in Reykjavik for like a day and then just go play in a volcano Yeah and come back.

111
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

112
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I didn't have enough time.

113
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,309
Speaker 0: So I'm only gonna be there for like an hour.

114
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,929
Speaker 1: No, that doesn't count if you don't leave the airport.

115
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,256
Speaker 0: Actually, no, it doesn't.

116
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,282
Speaker 0: so yeah.

117
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:53,872
Speaker 0: All right That's that.

118
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,350
Speaker 0: I don't have anything else exciting waiting for you to jump in with some news or something.

119
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,481
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to be jumping out got a news, but it's just a baby tiny news.

120
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,046
Speaker 1: Not a very exciting news.

121
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,920
Speaker 1: So Capcom I guess is doing something.

122
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,290
Speaker 1: I guess maybe something.

123
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know they've been pretty fail for a while now.

124
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:20,599
Speaker 1: So and since they're not making any new Megaman's at least not as far as anyone knows They're gonna do something else.

125
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,870
Speaker 1: They're just gonna re-release some old Megaman's For the for the 3ds in the digital download store.

126
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:37,210
Speaker 1: So the games they're gonna put out are Megaman 2 3 4 5 and Megaman Xtreme and Xtreme 2. and you're probably sitting you wanna what the fuck is Megaman Xtreme and Xtreme?

127
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,388
Speaker 1: Wait, what are these see in?

128
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,788
Speaker 1: Japan where the games are real.

129
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:53,568
Speaker 1: When they put out Megaman while Rockman on the Gameboy, they put out Rockman world Which is basically the Gameboy version of Megaman, right and in the US they didn't put that out.

130
00:07:53,748 --> 00:08:10,850
Speaker 1: They put out Megaman 2 Gameboy which was Basically Rockman world, you know poured it over now But they renamed it to basically be the same name as Megaman 2. so it's like oh You get confused if I say Megaman 2 you had to be like are you you know?

131
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,754
Speaker 1: You know, which game I'm talking about, but I could be talking about the Gameboy one Which is bullshit.

132
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:20,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, just called it Megaman world - it wouldn't have been a problem guys.

133
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,530
Speaker 0: It worked for Mario sure.

134
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:36,863
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Basically Rockman world 2 3 4 5 and then the 2 Gameboy Color Megamans are gonna come out on the 3ds in the download store But they're letting you vote on their website, which one comes first.

135
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:39,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever who gives a shit?

136
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,756
Speaker 1: I mean I say it's a baby news.

137
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,124
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, it's who cares?

138
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:51,697
Speaker 1: you're gonna put them all out eventually anyway And no one's buying any digital downloads of crappy Sub-rate Megaman games.

139
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,148
Speaker 1: and I can just get real Megaman 2 on my 3ds.

140
00:08:54,911 --> 00:09:01,609
Speaker 0: Why would I buy Megaman 2 on my emulator on my phone if I really want exactly exactly.

141
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:10,462
Speaker 1: so There is an attachment to this news that is sort of like a PS Which is that Nintendo also struggling Japanese game companies struggling.

142
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,507
Speaker 1: That's a surprise, huh are putting some?

143
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,790
Speaker 0: oh, I see what you're about to say.

144
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:24,230
Speaker 1: They're putting some GBA titles on the Wii U. Right, so it used to be that the virtual console on the Wii and Wii U only had console games.

145
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:27,150
Speaker 1: So you get NES SNES, right?

146
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:36,789
Speaker 1: GameCube n64 Games will not GameCube n64 games in your virtual console on your Wii and your Wii U and that on your virtual console on your 3ds.

147
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:42,670
Speaker 1: Right, you would get portable games Gameboy games Gameboy Color Gameboy Advance games, right?

148
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:52,070
Speaker 1: So for the first time here, they are going to release portable games Gameboy Advance games on the Wii U virtual console.

149
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:59,918
Speaker 1: I wish they would also do NES and SNES games on the 3ds virtual console, but you know what you're gonna do Eventually.

150
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,684
Speaker 0: go out of business.

151
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:01,290
Speaker 1: Sure.

152
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:08,248
Speaker 1: Anyway, the first eight games have been announced and all that matters is that one of them is Advance Wars.

153
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,350
Speaker 0: Yeah Except I already own Advance Wars obviously.

154
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:17,552
Speaker 1: But if you don't have GBA Advance Wars and you don't have a piracy card and you don't know how to make it work Etc.

155
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:18,053
Speaker 1: Etc.

156
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:23,870
Speaker 1: You can now legally get Advance Wars for your 3ds at least starting pretty soon.

157
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:31,929
Speaker 0: So part of the trouble is that a game like Advance Wars also Golden Sun Probably not the most fun game to play on your Wii U?

158
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:33,654
Speaker 1: No, not really.

159
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:38,970
Speaker 0: I played a lot of my Advance Wars like on buses and on trains.

160
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, also Advance Wars 1 is not like the other Advance Wars.

161
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:54,653
Speaker 0: I don't think most people who even profess to like more recent Advance Wars will actually like the GBA Advance Wars 1.

162
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

163
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,330
Speaker 1: so Nintendo continuing to go.

164
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:03,483
Speaker 0: Yep, so Nintendo allowed at least one relatively cool thing to happen.

165
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:08,198
Speaker 0: So yeah before April Fool's Day yesterday I had to go take care of some business.

166
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,210
Speaker 0: So I take the subway out of work and I go downtown like further downtown.

167
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:16,187
Speaker 0: There's not much downtown left and I'm looking at a map to figure out like oh, where's this place?

168
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,273
Speaker 0: I'm going What's this address?

169
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:27,155
Speaker 0: and I see this dot like this weird thing on my Google Maps and I zoom in on it And it's a Lucario from Pokemon just hanging out Like what.

170
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,106
Speaker 1: and this wasn't April Fool's Day yet.

171
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,810
Speaker 1: This is the timing.

172
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,405
Speaker 0: Hit back to look and make sure it wasn't April Fool's Day.

173
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:34,887
Speaker 0: That's right.

174
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,252
Speaker 0: I was like, nope It's not.

175
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:44,364
Speaker 0: so I went back in I click on him and I saw an option to catch him Saw an option for a pokedex and for a split second.

176
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:49,438
Speaker 0: I thought that maybe Nintendo decided to not be a fuck-up.

177
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:57,881
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that maybe the stars are going to align and this was the first Salvo of the world-ending MMO of Pokemon.

178
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:58,402
Speaker 0: That's right.

179
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:01,250
Speaker 0: But no basically it's just a scavenger hunt.

180
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,089
Speaker 0: You know, it's kind of dumb.

181
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,790
Speaker 0: Effectively what happens is on your phone and only on your phone.

182
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,136
Speaker 0: It doesn't work on like a computer.

183
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:14,281
Speaker 0: if you zoom in far enough onto Google Maps You might see a Pokemon and if you click on him you catch him.

184
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,007
Speaker 0: It's literally it.

185
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,030
Speaker 0: Good luck.

186
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,579
Speaker 0: Have a whole bunch of fun.

187
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:22,497
Speaker 0: scrolling through Google Maps Very much zoomed in.

188
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:26,390
Speaker 0: also most of the Pokemon are in real cities.

189
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:27,974
Speaker 1: Well, I think they put them in.

190
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:34,010
Speaker 1: if you notice right all the Pokemon regions in the real Pokemon games are based on certain cities.

191
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:45,630
Speaker 1: So like the newest one is based on Paris, you know with the Eiffel Tower in the right and the Pokemon black is based on New York, it's got you know, the Manhattan Island in the middle with I found like a Snorlax and an Eevee, right?

192
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,970
Speaker 1: So all most of the Pokemon I've been told are in those actual Pokemon regions Right that you know on the real world.

193
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,527
Speaker 1: So if you want to you know, if you come to New York, it's like there was a Pokemon region.

194
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:58,070
Speaker 1: That's New York.

195
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,730
Speaker 1: So there's Pokemon there Paris this Pokemon there, right?

196
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:09,386
Speaker 0: You know Tokyo this Pokemon, yeah So yeah, it's cool in theory, but it's basically just completely dumb.

197
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,330
Speaker 0: It's a marketing thing.

198
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,026
Speaker 0: It's it's one of those obsessive boring things to do when you're sitting with your smartphone at work.

199
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:15,910
Speaker 0: Not actually doing work.

200
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:19,060
Speaker 0: It's not actually a game in any sense.

201
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,164
Speaker 0: That is meaningful.

202
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,920
Speaker 0: I Wish this was actually a game.

203
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:30,099
Speaker 0: Imagine if I don't know because I've reviewed Ingress that Augmented reality game that's on Android.

204
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:31,224
Speaker 0: That's not super fun.

205
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:34,575
Speaker 0: Basically just a candy box But it has a pretty good UX.

206
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:46,979
Speaker 0: if they took that basic UX of there's Pokemon and other trainers and Places in the real world and just made that Pokemon That would literally be the greatest game ever.

207
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,110
Speaker 0: Like I can actually see exactly how you should do it.

208
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:54,945
Speaker 0: It's that UX coupled with the Google Maps integration and just Pokemon straight up.

209
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,126
Speaker 0: if I'm near you and I see you We can just have a Pokemon battle right there.

210
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,642
Speaker 0: live No take backs.

211
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,651
Speaker 0: No saving No nothing.

212
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:11,154
Speaker 0: and just candy boxes up then because as much as I think candy boxes are stupid if the candy boxes were a Canonical Pokemon.

213
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:16,010
Speaker 0: I might have to open up the box get some candy bars touch that guy's hat.

214
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,964
Speaker 1: Hey, you know where any other Pokemon are besides.

215
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:18,709
Speaker 1: ooh, what's that?

216
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,402
Speaker 0: Are you looking for Pokemon right now elements?

217
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,427
Speaker 1: What the fuck is that?

218
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,070
Speaker 0: Really?

219
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,062
Speaker 1: Really, you know what the fuck that is, you don't know new Pokemon.

220
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:28,403
Speaker 0: Do ya?

221
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,150
Speaker 1: I've never seen that Pokemon in my life.

222
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:31,710
Speaker 1: Are you sure it's not a Digimon?

223
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:34,552
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

224
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,706
Speaker 0: they probably just offended a whole bunch of our Pokemon fan fans.

225
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:40,090
Speaker 1: That's got to be a Digimon.

226
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,801
Speaker 0: So as another much smaller aside, there's an article on polygon.

227
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,315
Speaker 0: That's actually about our good friend Conrad craling Who's been on this show before.

228
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:52,310
Speaker 0: he has been on geek nights multiple times usually really mad about phones.

229
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:56,283
Speaker 0: He worked at Muse games for many years with Emily and Alex our other friends.

230
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,250
Speaker 0: we went to RIT with him.

231
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:04,976
Speaker 0: he was this young spry with us, yes who dressed up as safety cone.

232
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:06,949
Speaker 0: that itself was dressed up as Naruto.

233
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:10,239
Speaker 0: and Yeah, there's an article about him.

Speaker 0: So yeah, it's a cool article about a cool company and a cool person and other cool people.

244
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,837
Speaker 0: But this is the one that we know directly.

00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:59,484
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that if you live in New York and you do cool things you Literally know every other person who does similar things in the city.

252
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,150
Speaker 1: nerds no other.

253
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:05,146
Speaker 0: There's when an anime movie happens like some anime movie.

254
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:05,890
Speaker 0: It's just being screened.

255
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:14,564
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone who shows up is someone that I know Either because of things like this or because they go to every other anime screening.

256
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it works.

257
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:18,776
Speaker 1: I see any Pokemon in Astoria.

258
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,002
Speaker 0: I didn't find any in Queens.

259
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,386
Speaker 0: I don't think it's.

260
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,690
Speaker 1: maybe this is one of the baseball stadium.

261
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,039
Speaker 0: Ah, I'll bet.

262
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,790
Speaker 0: not I'll bet Manhattan only.

263
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,516
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

264
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,997
Speaker 1: Oh, come on are not Mets fans.

265
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,378
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, that's right.

266
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:41,176
Speaker 1: They're Mariners fans, which Nintendo owns of course.

267
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:48,300
Speaker 0: So I try not to do this often, but this is marching band video, but it's pretty impressive.

268
00:16:48,461 --> 00:17:01,191
Speaker 0: Oh, you and your marching band, so when I was in high school, I actually and middle school I actually kind of seriously wanted to make my career Around marching bands and music.

269
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:02,679
Speaker 1: who has that career?

270
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,148
Speaker 0: Some people have that career almost nobody.

271
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:06,530
Speaker 1: You know what?

272
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,861
Speaker 1: You know what the most common career you can get is for that Teacher.

273
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,499
Speaker 1: high school band teacher, you know what high school band teachers job is like.

274
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,300
Speaker 1: How do you how would you like being a high school band teacher right now?

275
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,040
Speaker 0: Mostly what I wanted to do was my primary career.

276
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:29,254
Speaker 0: I was thinking about going into the conservatory being a professional horn player and then on the side I wanted to be involved in marching stuff because I'm just really into that.

277
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,580
Speaker 0: I've always been super into that.

278
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:48,906
Speaker 0: So what I have for you is a video of the group that I saw marching that inspired me to be really into that and to get really into like the choreography and just How you actually put these things together like the technical side of Marching band performances and shows.

279
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:52,760
Speaker 0: this is the Phantom Regiment performing Elsa's procession to the cathedral.

280
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,742
Speaker 0: Okay, it's pretty great.

281
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,607
Speaker 0: You got a thing of the day.

282
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,150
Speaker 1: Oh, I do have a thing today.

283
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,310
Speaker 1: So here's this really cute little flash game called lamp and vamp, right?

284
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,300
Speaker 1: And basically it's a little turn-based strategy kind of game.

285
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,250
Speaker 1: And once you figure out how it works, you really just keep playing it.

286
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:18,630
Speaker 1: You're a little cute vampire guy right and it's a hex map and every turn you move one space But you can't really move through the houses or any or through the trees.

287
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:30,268
Speaker 1: you just move a move a space and you're in the darkness because you're a vampire and you're trying to get into your coffin because that's where vampires belong and there's people walking around town with torches trying to burn your ass cuz and stake you and shit cuz.

288
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:34,406
Speaker 1: They don't like vampires eating their kids and their wives and themselves.

289
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:44,289
Speaker 1: So You have to make it there without getting seen, you know, they all have the little flashlights that they're you know Lighting up the street with so you want to hide so you don't get seen.

290
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:46,460
Speaker 1: They keep moving though.

291
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:47,549
Speaker 1: So it's very hard.

292
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:52,870
Speaker 1: You got to predict where they're gonna be where they're gonna shine their light, right and there isn't always an option.

293
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,182
Speaker 1: It's like they'll just trap you and it's not simple to just avoid them.

294
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,190
Speaker 0: I totally hate that guy, right?

295
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,854
Speaker 1: It's not simple to do.

296
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:04,449
Speaker 1: you think this would be just like those Zelda games or you avoid the candidates that are you know?

297
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:09,306
Speaker 1: You Know the parts like the candidates in the bush in the hedge maze.

298
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:16,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's not that simple, but you get some special vampire powers, but using your special vampire powers cost you life your hearts.

299
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,300
Speaker 1: Drinking blood and doing other things can get you hearts back.

300
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,110
Speaker 1: getting shot and holy watered makes you lose hearts.

301
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:29,559
Speaker 1: so basically you just keep going level after level after level and The game isn't over till you lose your hundred hearts completely.

302
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,763
Speaker 1: So it's all about.

303
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:36,650
Speaker 1: you know, it's like it's like I can beat this level With only spending ten hearts, that's a pretty good deal, right?

304
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,920
Speaker 1: But you know another level.

305
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,370
Speaker 1: you need to gain ten hearts.

306
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,328
Speaker 1: Otherwise in the long run if you keep doing that you're eventually on your way to losing.

307
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:50,570
Speaker 1: so Pretty interesting game that has both the short term puzzle solving and also the long term resource management.

308
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:54,604
Speaker 1: It's good when you're at work on your board much better than finding Pokemon at Google Maps.

309
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:55,748
Speaker 0: I'm playing it right now.

310
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:56,270
Speaker 0: It's super fun.

311
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,477
Speaker 0: I totally just bit that guy again.

312
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,429
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I'm killing him.

313
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,153
Speaker 0: Yeah He's dead.

314
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,685
Speaker 0: kill that other guy too cuz he just walked up and didn't notice.

315
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:08,668
Speaker 0: Yeah Killing all these guys up that fucker saw me fuck fuck.

316
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,337
Speaker 1: Okay Going down in the moment.

317
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,702
Speaker 0: The book club book is wool.

318
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:13,504
Speaker 0: We both finished it.

319
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,150
Speaker 0: do a show on it on Thursday.

320
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,964
Speaker 0: It's alright, it's worth reading tight.

321
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I liked it.

322
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,510
Speaker 0: I liked it way more than I liked captain fedora's penis adventure through the sex goddess lands of the kung fu sex masters.

323
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,760
Speaker 1: I liked it more than ready player one.

324
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,770
Speaker 0: I still gotta read ready player one.

325
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,940
Speaker 0: Why do you have to up so I can shit all over it apparently?

326
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,766
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's not.

327
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:41,426
Speaker 1: it's better than Captain penis nice guy, but it's basically captain woo game 80s nerdery.

328
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,657
Speaker 0: Uh Yeah, I don't know if I can deal with that.

329
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,138
Speaker 0: I I Enjoy apt references.

330
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,198
Speaker 0: I'm increasingly tired of Very crass cash grab.

331
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,344
Speaker 0: Hey, you remember Mario?

332
00:20:56,866 --> 00:21:02,589
Speaker 1: I to remember Mario This is more like do you remember tomb of horrors and pac-man?

333
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,547
Speaker 0: With their powers combined you can be really insufferable to the people around you.

334
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:17,267
Speaker 0: Yeah We're going to be at the penny arcade expo east not this weekend, but next weekend.

335
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,615
Speaker 0: Whoa It's in Boston.

336
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,522
Speaker 1: packs packs is just all the time.

337
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:23,308
Speaker 1: now, it's like I was just out of packs and look at this.

338
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,963
Speaker 0: another packs Yeah, and then I got another packs in October and then I got a packs right after.

339
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:29,994
Speaker 0: well right before that in September Packs is everywhere.

340
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, lots of packs.

341
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,269
Speaker 0: Look at all these packs is we just keep going to them?

342
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:46,827
Speaker 0: Not much else to say there had you were doing a panel called why no one will game with you And if you're not already attending bags, it's way too late to arrange attending packs.

343
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:47,830
Speaker 1: No, right?

344
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:55,990
Speaker 0: Unlike packs prime where you could have a pretty fun time being at packs prime without a badge and not doing any pack stuff.

345
00:21:56,672 --> 00:22:02,310
Speaker 0: Not the same case for paxies if you don't have a badge stay don't go anywhere near Boston to stay home.

346
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, unlike packs East which you can't get into unless you're already in right?

347
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,770
Speaker 1: There is something you can do next weekend the weekend before packs the moga festivals happen in New York City.

348
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:19,910
Speaker 1: It seems to have been gone ever so slightly downhill There after year, but it's you know.

349
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:26,936
Speaker 1: If you're that close to it as we are why not hop on the subway and go look at an independent comic show For an hour a few.

350
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll totally be there.

351
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:30,050
Speaker 0: probably Saturday in the morning.

352
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably Saturday morning when it opens.

353
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,346
Speaker 1: get there when it opens outside the netrunner tournament on Sunday.

354
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,190
Speaker 1: So definitely Saturday.

355
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:44,812
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm also definitely I used to spend a lot more time at mocha But nowadays I kind of want to be in look at everything once buy everything I wanted to buy and then get the fuck out That's what

356
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:47,946
Speaker 1: my plan is and then eat an awesome lunch nearby and then go home.

357
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:48,850
Speaker 0: Are your parents coming?

358
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,621
Speaker 0: No, so we can eat some more good.

359
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:55,946
Speaker 0: Yeah We don't have to cater to the the whims of mom who's picky.

360
00:22:55,967 --> 00:23:02,685
Speaker 1: No We can eat at the most exotic country restaurant the I don't know.

361
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:03,146
Speaker 1: I don't know.

362
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:13,538
Speaker 0: I'll be kind of feeling a burger An ostrich burger, we're also going to be at a convention called Zank icon, it's April 25th 26 27th.

363
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,404
Speaker 1: It's an anime con.

364
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:20,641
Speaker 0: We'll be doing mostly three Lectures there, I believe on Saturday and Sunday only.

365
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,889
Speaker 0: I don't think the schedules public.

366
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:26,060
Speaker 0: So show up and look for us on the schedule.

367
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,890
Speaker 0: I think we're doing anime openers around the world.

368
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,258
Speaker 1: You can just find the three panels that aren't Homestuck panels.

369
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, or Hetalia panels, and you'll be all set.

370
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:40,276
Speaker 0: I do have the schedule but I would think I think I would get in trouble with scojo if I just public because it's probably Not a hundred percent true.

371
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:45,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably been much much changed Since the one the copy that you have.

372
00:23:46,044 --> 00:24:02,450
Speaker 0: Yeah So we've talked about aspects of this multiple times on geek nights over the years But usually as an aside or focusing really really tightly on one Tiny aspect of the greater picture of why it's so fucking hard to find people to play games.

373
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:07,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you know We decided to do a PAX panel on this and then we couldn't come with an idea for today's show.

374
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,490
Speaker 1: and it's like hey Let's kill like a hundred birds with one stone.

375
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,790
Speaker 1: We'll sort of work through this panel that we've developing.

376
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:20,970
Speaker 1: Literally, no one who is listening to this is going to not go to the panel at the actual packs because we made this episode.

377
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,301
Speaker 1: 99.9% of the people listening this aren't even going to packs

378
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:36,609
Speaker 0: plus the kinds of things I'll say on geek nights Might be slightly different from the kinds of things I'll say at a Convention at which I'm a guest where there's a lot of video recorders and a lot of people physically in the room with me.

379
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:40,142
Speaker 0: I mean, well that guy is gonna be in the audience.

380
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:40,904
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

381
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:50,661
Speaker 1: also, you know people who might go and see us at the convention discover us might come and listen to this episode because they you know, People always look for videos of panels.

382
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:52,290
Speaker 1: We did even though they saw the panel.

383
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:56,550
Speaker 1: So hey, there's a podcast already on the website before the panel even happened.

384
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:00,729
Speaker 1: Maybe someone will come back and be like, you know Listen to it to remember what we said.

385
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:08,279
Speaker 0: the other interesting thing is you guys will kind of get this insight if you see the panel and listen to this into Kind of after we've put a panel together.

386
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,684
Speaker 0: I guess I hate saying panel.

387
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:22,064
Speaker 0: I have to put a lecture like this together The way we talk to each other about like the finer points of what we're actually gonna say and how we'll like discard some ideas Or we decide that oh we were actually wrong about this thing.

388
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,370
Speaker 0: We thought was part of our point.

389
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:27,030
Speaker 0: Let's remove it now that we've talked about it at length, right?

390
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,240
Speaker 1: Okay, so the panels call the lecture is called.

391
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,165
Speaker 1: why no one will game with you?

392
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,270
Speaker 1: because that's really provocative.

393
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:47,781
Speaker 1: but really what it's about is How even though there's a bajillion billions of gamers on earth spending billions of hours on games Very very few of those actual people are people that any Individual person can game with right?

394
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,049
Speaker 1: So I looked up some numbers, right?

395
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,730
Speaker 1: Population of earth is like seven eight billion people right number of those people who play games.

396
00:25:55,851 --> 00:26:02,379
Speaker 1: It's like pretty much almost anyone in a you know Country that has any sort of technology is playing some kind of game.

397
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,670
Speaker 1: even people, you know, everyone's playing soccer somewhere pretty much, right?

398
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:14,731
Speaker 1: Settlers of Catan has sold 15 million copies in the u.s That's a lot of copies It doesn't.

399
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,479
Speaker 1: I don't think that counts the European copies.

400
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,869
Speaker 1: No, that's a lot of settlers is out there.

401
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,053
Speaker 0: That definitely is.

402
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,296
Speaker 1: that's a ton right?

403
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:25,727
Speaker 1: So with 15 million settlers is copies in the u.s.

404
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:32,830
Speaker 1: In 50 states Assuming they're distributed like evenly per capita and you don't live in the complete sticks.

405
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:42,230
Speaker 1: There's someone near you who has a copy of settlers besides you that you can play settlers with at least Right, and that's I mean, that's also a pretty niche number.

406
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,290
Speaker 0: I mean settlers already assumes you've somehow gotten down the road of German slash euro game, right?

407
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like it's even more dense than that, right and that doesn't count.

408
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:57,121
Speaker 1: people who you know, maybe played You know, I mean munchkin might be more than settlers right.

409
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:58,124
Speaker 1: there might be no magic.

410
00:26:58,144 --> 00:26:59,469
Speaker 1: the gathering might be more than that.

411
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,968
Speaker 1: So Anyway, so with all those games out there with games being so popular How come?

412
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,254
Speaker 1: There is still so much LFG right, you know?

413
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:14,044
Speaker 1: you go and you go to PAX a huge gaming convention.

414
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,813
Speaker 1: people who are at PAX are LFG.

415
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:17,817
Speaker 1: you go on the internet.

416
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,570
Speaker 1: you think the internet would have solved all our LFG problems.

417
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:24,506
Speaker 1: You go on the internet you find people who are LFG looking for game.

418
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:36,281
Speaker 0: now on one hand of course the LFG is just a service because part of the whole reason you go to a convention is to meet strangers who you wouldn't otherwise Meet who have similar interests find someone to play a game with.

419
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:47,990
Speaker 0: but yet despite the LFG space I see a lot of people walking around solo with the game Trying to muster up someone to play it trying to get someone to play with them trying to get someone to join the group.

420
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:54,530
Speaker 1: So why is it that at conventions and also not at conventions video games and non video games?

421
00:27:54,971 --> 00:28:04,036
Speaker 1: Right with so many gamers and games of all kinds being so popular are people still struggling to find Someone else to game with?

422
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,630
Speaker 0: why does every forum have the looking for a gaming group thread?

423
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,507
Speaker 0: That's always forever and super long right usually filled with drama.

424
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:13,456
Speaker 1: Yep So it's like you go.

425
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:21,123
Speaker 1: I mean you go to the forums on board game geek for like netrunner Which has got a very active community online, and you see threads constantly.

426
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:29,010
Speaker 1: any players in my area Cricket cricket anyone, but nope role-playing games are probably the biggest offender here.

427
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:33,950
Speaker 0: Yes, not only is everyone desperate to find a gaming group, but they need to form a group.

428
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,298
Speaker 0: they need to form like a regular group of people who are.

429
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:39,369
Speaker 0: they're going to share a lot of time with playing these games.

430
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:49,860
Speaker 0: and You think if so many people are into D&D Here they're not doing it this time anyway last year.

431
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, so long.

432
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:59,730
Speaker 1: yeah anyway, so Reason number one take that huge group right that big old circle and can you know the big old pie that consists of all gamers?

433
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,211
Speaker 1: on Earth.

434
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:05,530
Speaker 1: and the number one thing that is going to remove that pie from the ability for you to eat.

435
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,818
Speaker 1: It is just geography right.

436
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,929
Speaker 1: most of those people do not live anywhere near you.

437
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,037
Speaker 1: It's like you you play.

438
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,683
Speaker 1: I don't know Monopoly.

439
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:15,004
Speaker 1: Okay.

440
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:16,550
Speaker 1: You'll find someone near you to play Monopoly.

441
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,683
Speaker 0: me I mean parents your kids sure the neighbor kids.

442
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,350
Speaker 1: you're into race for the galaxy.

443
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:25,724
Speaker 1: How many people physically near you wherever you live play race of the galaxy?

444
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,630
Speaker 1: if you live in a city like New York, okay?

445
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,676
Speaker 1: You'll find someone right.

446
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:35,610
Speaker 1: you live in even my hometown Trumble in the suburbs of Connecticut right an hour away by car.

447
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,990
Speaker 1: Good luck fine.

448
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,295
Speaker 0: Well remember we lived in beacon.

449
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:38,436
Speaker 0: you're

450
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:48,849
Speaker 1: gonna have to take a car if you live if I lived it with my parents and I wanted to find people to game with I would have to get in a car and drive at least a half hour to an hour to Get to a place where people might be playing games.

451
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,345
Speaker 0: We used to live in Beacon, New York, and there was the city of Beacon.

452
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,290
Speaker 0: website is down.

453
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:54,656
Speaker 0: Okay, I went to it.

454
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:55,801
Speaker 0: look how many pipe people are there?

455
00:29:56,303 --> 00:30:00,560
Speaker 0: so it's got a population of like 15,000. it's in the orbit of New York City.

456
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,892
Speaker 0: a lot of people like us used to live there or do live there and commute Down.

457
00:30:04,456 --> 00:30:05,201
Speaker 0: Scott and I were looking for

458
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,457
Speaker 1: definitely nerds there Yeah of different kinds for

459
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:25,692
Speaker 0: the nearest gaming store was like a half-hour drive north in Poughkeepsie And at that gaming store there was a one gaming club that consisted of a very small number of kind of sad older gamers That was not expanding or growing in any way most of whom did not want to play the kinds of games We wanted to play.

460
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:30,409
Speaker 1: and there were a few gamers at a near at that College nearby, and that was pretty much it.

461
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:40,143
Speaker 1: Yep, and the college was also up near that gets that same gaming store, so Geography is the big problem for tabletop games, but what about video games?

462
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:42,450
Speaker 1: you think internet should solve all these geography problems?

463
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,697
Speaker 1: I can just play with anyone in the whole world.

464
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:45,560
Speaker 1: You know games.

465
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,422
Speaker 1: It'll be no problem.

466
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:46,663
Speaker 1: Well.

467
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:54,310
Speaker 1: That's true for some Video games mostly the a simp the asynchronous ones right like play by mail situations.

468
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:59,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, some play boss at five right, but that's not the kind of thing that can really you know.

469
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,830
Speaker 1: It's like those games are great, but that's not the kind of thing you can sit down and play for hours, right?

470
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,509
Speaker 1: That's only the kind of thing that you can you know sort of occupy random moments throughout your day.

471
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:17,202
Speaker 1: You're not gonna You know my friend in Finland isn't gonna sit down for three hours at the same time as me To play the game turn by turn.

472
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:27,872
Speaker 1: why time zones Time zones, I'm only limited to people in my longitude Right or pretty close to my longitude in terms of that kind of gaming Right.

473
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:39,830
Speaker 1: something that can actually occupy a good chunk of time has to be people nearby even just from you at from New York to California Causes a significant problems in the time difference and not just latency, but latency is the most obvious example of it.

474
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,455
Speaker 0: But just reliability do you know?

475
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:45,770
Speaker 0: many times I've tried to play a game of Civ 5 with someone who's overseas where latency?

476
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,572
Speaker 0: We don't care.

477
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:48,598
Speaker 0: We've sorted out the timezone thing.

478
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:52,790
Speaker 0: the game just fucking stops working occasionally because of bad network connections, right?

479
00:31:52,910 --> 00:32:01,130
Speaker 0: It's you know the internet while or because Scott Johnson Yeah, it's hosting the game as a computer like locks up the internet right for an asynchronous game.

480
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,159
Speaker 1: Technologically isn't gonna give you a problem.

481
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:16,117
Speaker 1: the timezone gives you a problem but for Technology wise the latency prevents you from playing any kind of real-time game any kind of counter-strike any kind of fighting game any kind of anything that's real-time and even things that aren't real-time.

482
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:19,649
Speaker 1: you still need the connection to be very reliable so it doesn't disconnect.

483
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:26,095
Speaker 1: and When you're farther away from someone and their internet is garbage in the US internet is garbage And it's just.

484
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,000
Speaker 1: you know you can't.

485
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:28,530
Speaker 1: so you're still looking for game.

486
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,190
Speaker 1: You can't find the game because all the you know you have to basically subtract from the pie.

487
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,236
Speaker 1: All the people were far away from you.

488
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:38,650
Speaker 1: Oh and by the way, maybe you do find someone who is in your longitude.

489
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:40,937
Speaker 1: They don't speak the same language as you.

490
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:49,030
Speaker 1: not as much of a concern for us in the North am no But you know this can be a serious problem for other people like what if you live in Arizona?

491
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,177
Speaker 1: And it's just these tons of Mexican gamers.

492
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:52,181
Speaker 1: You just can't play with them.

493
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,425
Speaker 0: actually what's funny.

494
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:54,549
Speaker 0: It depends on the game.

495
00:32:55,474 --> 00:33:01,910
Speaker 0: One of the things board game being does and a lot of Euro gamers Do is one of the statistics about a board game is how language dependent?

496
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:07,747
Speaker 0: It is either because you might play with people who don't speak the same language or the rules themselves.

497
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:13,669
Speaker 0: like the game itself You may or may not need to know the language the game was published in to be able to play it.

498
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, like settlers.

499
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:15,919
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of words.

500
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,703
Speaker 0: You can play that.

501
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:18,189
Speaker 1: what if you had to bargain with someone?

502
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,530
Speaker 0: Ah, but you could still you've got the icons alone could be sufficient to get your point across.

503
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,255
Speaker 0: Or like counter-strike.

504
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,688
Speaker 0: I would regularly in beacon play counter-strike with all these quebecois people.

505
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,254
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So they'd all speak French.

506
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:32,319
Speaker 0: We didn't really.

507
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:42,765
Speaker 0: we weren't able to communicate with each other Effectively except via the radio commands because if I said something they didn't really understand me and vice versa or if they did understand me They pretended they didn't.

508
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:54,310
Speaker 0: So some games like a game that doesn't require a heavy amount of team coordination That is otherwise versus or lone wolf in some way you can play just fine.

509
00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:06,375
Speaker 0: But games like that like counter-strike unless you're playing for the purposes of that group that Community that thing that people are always saying they want in these forum threads Then that doesn't work.

510
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:12,382
Speaker 0: those you're those people you're playing against might as well be advanced a eyes and Europeans can have a lot of trouble with this as well.

511
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:16,962
Speaker 1: also Australians might have a lot of other Pacific countries to play with right.

512
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,650
Speaker 1: but it's like if you don't speak Chinese or who knows what?

513
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,175
Speaker 1: You know language right.

514
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,730
Speaker 1: or maybe if you live in like Southeast Asia, right you live in Thailand you speak Thai.

515
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:30,150
Speaker 1: You can play with Thai people right, but you're gonna have all these, you know people who speak.

516
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,230
Speaker 1: You know some kind of Chinese that are near you, but you can't game with them if you don't speak that language.

517
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,353
Speaker 0: So that's already.

518
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:45,750
Speaker 0: we come down to the idea the sort of side point that I hadn't really thought about with these slides before That it really depends on the kind of game and what you're looking for.

519
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:53,650
Speaker 0: If you're just looking for bodies to play a game like I'm playing counter-strike I want humans to be playing with me, but we're all reasonably good at the game.

520
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,150
Speaker 0: Bots like good bots would probably be fine as would pretty much any humans who are good at the game.

521
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,738
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna form lasting friendships.

522
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,885
Speaker 0: I'll play with whoever's online at the time.

523
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,410
Speaker 0: I'll click on the matchmaking.

524
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:14,610
Speaker 0: Constantly clicking on matchmaking will very rarely net you a group with which to have a long term or meaningful gaming group.

525
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,850
Speaker 1: The point is is that whatever kind of game you're playing it doesn't matter.

526
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:27,462
Speaker 1: Geography is going to limit the number of people that you can play with in some dramatic way more dramatic than any other factor Right, so that's reason number one.

527
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,270
Speaker 1: There's billions of people on earth playing games.

528
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:34,330
Speaker 1: Over 90% of them are eliminated just because they don't live near you, right?

529
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,980
Speaker 1: Okay, so what other kind of problems right besides?

530
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,970
Speaker 1: geography will sort of reduce the number of people that you can game with?

531
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:47,169
Speaker 1: Right, well the people themselves obviously, right?

532
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,303
Speaker 1: I found someone near me who also self-identifies as gamer.

533
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,090
Speaker 1: that is incredibly broad.

534
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:56,310
Speaker 1: I play tabletop euro games and they play Starcraft.

535
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:57,738
Speaker 0: This is where you.

536
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,428
Speaker 0: this isn't gonna worry that sort of.

537
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,121
Speaker 0: you know The idea of the fake gamer a lot of it.

538
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:03,266
Speaker 0: Oh that person just a fake.

539
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:04,150
Speaker 0: same thing in comic books.

540
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,614
Speaker 0: Oh, they're a fake geek.

541
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:06,738
Speaker 0: They're not a real geek.

542
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,082
Speaker 0: They're not a real gamer.

543
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:20,221
Speaker 1: They don't play counter-strike 1-6 only If someone doesn't play the same game as you or doesn't want to play the same game you want to play then you're not gonna Be able to play games together unless someone changes their mind which.

544
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:24,880
Speaker 0: so you have the shared culture of gamer But you don't have a shared culture of game.

545
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,503
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

546
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:26,948
Speaker 0: That's the tagline for that bit.

547
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:28,213
Speaker 0: right there I mean culture.

548
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,237
Speaker 0: I'm adding that to the slide.

549
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you have to be playing not only the same.

550
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,386
Speaker 1: I mean what if it's even the same genre?

551
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:37,982
Speaker 1: I'm a Starcraft I'm a street fighter guy and who do you meet on the street?

552
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,126
Speaker 1: You met a Marvel vs.

553
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:39,909
Speaker 1: Capcom guy.

554
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:44,230
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you're not playing any fighting games together cuz right.

555
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,796
Speaker 1: I mean sure fighting game.

556
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:47,944
Speaker 1: people tend to play more than one fighting game, right?

557
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:48,988
Speaker 1: So meet you might.

558
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:50,958
Speaker 0: they're not forget They're not gonna play settlers with me.

559
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,088
Speaker 1: That's maybe not or maybe they will.

560
00:36:54,151 --> 00:37:00,270
Speaker 1: But you know people the number, you know people like us have a like a broad variety of games we play, right?

561
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,790
Speaker 1: But you know, they're only gonna get heavily involved in a few games.

562
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,770
Speaker 1: And if you're gonna you're looking for game like just a single game.

563
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,530
Speaker 1: You're looking for game long-lasting game, like, you know some sort of regular gaming deal.

564
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:20,530
Speaker 1: You're gonna need to find people who are very very compatible in terms of what games they play Not down just to the genre of game.

565
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:26,370
Speaker 1: I'm an RTS player looking for RTS players not just be I'm a. I play dota and they play League of Legends.

566
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,381
Speaker 1: Nope, we got to get all in the same page.

567
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:30,110
Speaker 1: here has to be the same game, right?

568
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,761
Speaker 1: But they had to be the same kind of gamer.

569
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:37,909
Speaker 1: So I play League of Legends you play League of Legends All right, this is gonna work out, isn't it?

570
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:43,990
Speaker 1: No, cuz I play it hardcore to win Like I'm trying to be pro and you're just playing it like la la la la la.

571
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,327
Speaker 0: Remember when heroes of new earth came out and it.

572
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:52,662
Speaker 0: you know We did a show on this about how that was literally the most toxic gaming community I had ever encountered in my life.

573
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:53,890
Speaker 0: up to that point to this.

574
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,470
Speaker 0: I'm someone who's played a lot of fucking counter-strike, right?

575
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:05,942
Speaker 0: And the reason for that was simple half the people playing were new to the genre not good at the genre Wanting to play this game wanting to enjoy it.

576
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:09,483
Speaker 0: they were playing mostly for fun They were trying to win but they weren't super serious about it.

577
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:13,097
Speaker 0: The other half of the people Literally wanted to win at all costs.

578
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:15,184
Speaker 0: That was the only reason they're even clicking.

579
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:16,047
Speaker 0: Is that ranking?

580
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:16,389
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

581
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:21,150
Speaker 0: So those two kinds of people cannot coexist on the same server.

582
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,177
Speaker 0: They cannot coexist in the same game.

583
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:28,517
Speaker 0: if I'm playing El Grande to win and you're playing because you like the color yellow And you want to have the most yellow cubes on the board.

584
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,687
Speaker 0: We're not gonna have a good time.

585
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:36,810
Speaker 1: No Another problem is that a lot of times the game you want to play is a dead game, right?

586
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,936
Speaker 0: I'm - I think here we tell the Story of tribes - right.

587
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,705
Speaker 0: Oh did I'll tell the full anecdote of knit hog.

588
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:44,347
Speaker 0: Sure.

589
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:45,390
Speaker 0: That's recent, right?

590
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:48,901
Speaker 1: The point is though It's like you might differ on what genre you want to play.

591
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,870
Speaker 1: you might differ on what game you want to play.

592
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,858
Speaker 1: You also might want to play a game.

593
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,586
Speaker 1: That is a dead game, right?

594
00:38:55,249 --> 00:39:00,730
Speaker 1: So Really now we're really limited in who's left to play games with right?

595
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:10,244
Speaker 0: Literally chased every single human being out of the matchmaking system on knit hog on multiple occasions And now there's never anyone there, right?

596
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,756
Speaker 1: Well, that's the air hockey problem We've talked about many times right?

597
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:13,398
Speaker 1: is you're?

598
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:19,321
Speaker 1: let's say you get really good at Street Fighter and you have friends who do also want To play Street Fighter and you all want to play to win you.

599
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,866
Speaker 1: all the same attitude about the game.

600
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:21,790
Speaker 1: It's looking good.

601
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:29,140
Speaker 1: It's looking good here But you're just way better than them because you've played it more and they just lose to you And now they don't like to play against you.

602
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,292
Speaker 0: just saw this so quickly with knit hog Scott.

603
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:32,458
Speaker 0: I both got the game at the same time.

604
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:34,450
Speaker 0: We're like, oh, let's stream us playing it together.

605
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:40,310
Speaker 0: I played it for like six hours the night before we actually played against each other.

606
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,257
Speaker 0: I did not played at all as a result.

607
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:43,763
Speaker 0: I was literally invincible.

608
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:44,345
Speaker 1: Yep.

609
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:44,827
Speaker 0: It was just.

610
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,006
Speaker 0: I win I win I win I win I win.

611
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:56,710
Speaker 1: It's like I might really like playing basketball and be kind of good at it but playing against Michael Jordan be boring as fuck because he just be like Don't go over your head and don't go over yet and steal the ball and dunk over your head.

612
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,593
Speaker 0: Don't get us wrong.

613
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,664
Speaker 0: Some people can really enjoy the teaching game.

614
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:04,596
Speaker 0: Like I'm super good at settler You're not gonna learn anything.

615
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,023
Speaker 1: If you don't even get to handle the ball.

616
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:07,310
Speaker 1: You just constantly steals and dunks.

617
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,455
Speaker 1: What can I learn for that?

618
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,930
Speaker 1: Nothing, but I would never be able to in the time that we were there playing.

619
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:13,316
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying me.

620
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:23,230
Speaker 0: I don't enjoy playing settlers of Catan as a game No But I do enjoy playing it as a tool to teach other people how to be good at games.

621
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,067
Speaker 0: I will play any game of settlers and I won't be playing.

622
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,037
Speaker 0: I'll be playing to win Like I'll win in the end just cuz I don't.

623
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:30,987
Speaker 0: I don't like losing pride.

624
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,892
Speaker 0: I won't Try.

625
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,902
Speaker 0: I won't play hardcore to win.

626
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,470
Speaker 0: I'll give people a lot of advice.

627
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:40,004
Speaker 0: I'll make a mistake and then say so notice how I traded that wood there.

628
00:40:40,044 --> 00:40:41,189
Speaker 0: I really shouldn't have done that.

629
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:42,315
Speaker 0: now He's ahead by a point.

630
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,199
Speaker 0: You wouldn't ahead before.

631
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,566
Speaker 0: I didn't really need that wood.

632
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:45,209
Speaker 0: What did it get me?

633
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,321
Speaker 0: I'll do things like that and I enjoyed that experience.

634
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,550
Speaker 0: but already, you know, we always talk about game theory.

635
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:51,679
Speaker 0: I have a different utility.

636
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,029
Speaker 0: I'm not playing to win the game.

637
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:58,090
Speaker 0: I'm the teacher playing with a bunch of students here, but that's not a long-term game.

638
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:15,814
Speaker 1: But if your skill level of games is generally higher, right, you know You you need to find people if you want long-term gaming if you find people at the same skill level right or at least relatively the same skill level as you or Building their skills from the low level quickly up to the high level so that it's enjoyable for you to play with them and them To play with you.

639
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,222
Speaker 0: This is something that does.

640
00:41:17,263 --> 00:41:17,967
Speaker 0: it's not just that.

641
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:18,490
Speaker 0: it prevents you.

642
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:22,278
Speaker 0: Like if I'm super good at air hockey I'll never even get to play air hockey with anyone.

643
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:27,070
Speaker 0: or maybe I'll get one game with every individual human once Yeah, and then they'll never play with me again.

644
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,897
Speaker 0: But this is the thing that say.

645
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:30,744
Speaker 0: you finally formed a gaming group.

646
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,350
Speaker 0: You got your eight friends together.

647
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:36,390
Speaker 0: You all got really into Super Street Fighter 2, whatever.

648
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,057
Speaker 0: So you're all playing.

649
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,770
Speaker 0: you have this sort of semi like some of you are better some of you than worse.

650
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:49,570
Speaker 0: but as soon as one person Practices a little bit and gets the air hockey up just a little bit the gaming group gets destroyed overnight.

651
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:57,383
Speaker 0: You destroy the the rare functional gaming group you have just by getting better than your friends Mm-hmm.

652
00:41:57,871 --> 00:42:04,558
Speaker 1: And then what ends up happening is you have to move into the competitive community and find those other high-level peoples But they're probably better than you.

653
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:06,005
Speaker 1: So now what do you do?

654
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:07,010
Speaker 0: Yep now you either.

655
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:15,058
Speaker 1: You either go by yourself into your bedroom and level yourself the fuck up so you can be a competitive champion Or you stop playing that game.

656
00:42:15,098 --> 00:42:17,809
Speaker 0: like look Scott and I crazy fucking good at air hockey.

657
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:21,210
Speaker 0: anyone We know most people in New York will just beat him hands down.

658
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,690
Speaker 0: But if we go to an air hockey tournament like the national championships, let's just get smoked.

659
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,617
Speaker 0: We would literally would.

660
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:28,410
Speaker 1: they would not even score a goal.

661
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:39,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, the puck would fly and break our hand, but there's no one in between those two levels for us to play except each other Unless someone else wants to be that kind of gamer with us.

662
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:43,110
Speaker 0: We've had a lot of luck in getting people to be that kind of gamer with us in air hockey.

663
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:44,963
Speaker 1: So none at all.

664
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:45,990
Speaker 1: zero right.

665
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,164
Speaker 1: Another thing that is that is sad but true.

666
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,827
Speaker 1: Is that a difference of money?

667
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:51,648
Speaker 1: right?

668
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:56,763
Speaker 1: an economic well-being Financial well-being does separate gamers, right?

669
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:58,850
Speaker 1: It's it's just the reality of the world.

670
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,557
Speaker 1: It sucks, but it's there.

671
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,283
Speaker 1: I found someone near me.

672
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,990
Speaker 1: We're gonna play PC games.

673
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,200
Speaker 1: They can't afford a PC gaming rig that's good enough to play the game.

674
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,985
Speaker 1: They just can't right.

675
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:10,690
Speaker 1: I've met a lot of people online.

676
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,530
Speaker 1: They're just like my computer sucks.

677
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:15,941
Speaker 1: I can't play that game with you because my video card is no good.

678
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:19,332
Speaker 0: or even what about the people who just like we're all It packs?

679
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:22,023
Speaker 0: a lot of people can't afford to come to packs.

680
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:23,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, people don't live near packs.

681
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,614
Speaker 1: We are gonna pegs.

682
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:30,578
Speaker 1: anyone who's at who's can afford to go to a convention is either lucky the convention is near their home right.

683
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:39,547
Speaker 1: lucky to even get a badge if they have the money or Lucky that they are well off money wise they can afford the hotel and travel and etc.

684
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,009
Speaker 1: Etc.

685
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:40,390
Speaker 1: Right?

686
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,378
Speaker 1: So there's we said there's bajillions of gamers.

687
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:56,890
Speaker 1: only a lucky very small percentage can go to any kind of gaming convention Especially a big one like packs yep and I'll say from my Many years ago into packs prime and packs East and a lot of other conventions or even a Gen Con or anything else.

688
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:08,386
Speaker 0: It is obvious that the the average demographic of the people who go to packs prime in Seattle is Way more affluent than the people who attend most other gaming type conventions or other fan conventions.

689
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:09,710
Speaker 0: That's just how it is.

690
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,441
Speaker 1: So it's not that packs is like discriminating.

691
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:13,486
Speaker 1: We don't like poor people.

692
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,370
Speaker 1: poor people get out.

693
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,126
Speaker 0: In fact, they actually do everything they can to give everyone a fair shot.

694
00:44:17,146 --> 00:44:18,211
Speaker 1: They try to you know They keep.

695
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:20,700
Speaker 1: they don't sell VIP badges like other cons.

696
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,470
Speaker 1: They don't charge for individual events like other cons, right?

697
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,378
Speaker 1: They try to do everything to be as you know You know equal as possible.

698
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:35,510
Speaker 1: money cannot get you privileges once you're at packs But you still need to be privileged with enough money to get over the bar to get into packs.

699
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:51,277
Speaker 0: And this I think is why this problem of looking for games seems so apparent primarily in small towns and on internet communities Because the people who aren't complaining are the people who go to a million conventions and they get their gaming fix Here at packs.

700
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:52,102
Speaker 0: I keep saying here.

701
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:53,108
Speaker 0: We're sitting in Queens, right?

702
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:55,654
Speaker 0: I Can I have my pick.

703
00:44:55,875 --> 00:45:01,130
Speaker 0: I can play a lot of games with strangers that I cannot play in my daily life even in New York.

704
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,556
Speaker 0: Right and I go to.

705
00:45:02,676 --> 00:45:06,515
Speaker 0: you know, four or so packs is a year never mind all the other gaming cons I go to.

706
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:12,009
Speaker 0: so every month or two I'm at a convention for an entire weekend playing as many fucking games as I can.

707
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:15,949
Speaker 0: It clips at 3 in the morning and then start another game as soon as we finish the first one.

708
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:18,542
Speaker 1: Few gamers are as lucky as that.

709
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,330
Speaker 0: so everyone in this room already.

710
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,541
Speaker 0: You have a huge advantage over almost every other gamer.

711
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,230
Speaker 1: and it's not just you know, PC games and conventions.

712
00:45:26,652 --> 00:45:28,322
Speaker 1: What if you want to play Magic the Gathering?

713
00:45:28,483 --> 00:45:29,670
Speaker 1: that shit is expensive.

714
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,777
Speaker 1: What are you gonna play Warhammer?

715
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:32,970
Speaker 1: that shit is double expensive, right?

716
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,187
Speaker 1: It's like some games no matter how bad that you want to play.

717
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:41,610
Speaker 1: them are Expensive as games and you can't play them unless you have mad moneys, right?

718
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,283
Speaker 1: They're all you know, even a cheaper game right like Puerto Rico.

719
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:48,589
Speaker 1: It's 40 bucks for a copy of Puerto Rico.

720
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:49,937
Speaker 0: It's not a 40 bucks.

721
00:45:49,977 --> 00:45:51,225
Speaker 0: If you're lucky I paid.

722
00:45:51,245 --> 00:45:55,001
Speaker 0: I paid $90 for a copy of la cheetah.

723
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:56,125
Speaker 0: I got it on sale.

724
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:57,168
Speaker 0: It's way more expensive now.

725
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,613
Speaker 1: Well, that was a Print game.

726
00:45:58,633 --> 00:45:58,834
Speaker 0: Yes.

727
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:03,770
Speaker 1: I played that fucking game once right and it's like, okay, you're into board games.

728
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:05,399
Speaker 1: I mean 40 bucks.

729
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,049
Speaker 1: That's like you buy one game.

730
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:11,350
Speaker 1: Usually you need a board game library If you want to play board games regularly.

731
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,270
Speaker 1: You'll get bored playing settlers over and over and over and over again, right board game library.

732
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:18,090
Speaker 1: Suddenly we're into the area of hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

733
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,685
Speaker 1: It's like you can't game if you don't have this.

734
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:28,029
Speaker 0: also I think is you know I don't want to stress it a lot because we're talking about the reality of like these sort of objective hard reasons Why this is so hard.

735
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:34,610
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of drama in the communities around people trying to form gaming groups a lot of like.

736
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,798
Speaker 0: I don't want to play with that guy.

737
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,570
Speaker 0: Oh, I gotta go to so-and-so's house.

738
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:41,481
Speaker 0: I don't want to really play race for the galaxy, but that's all.

739
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:44,550
Speaker 0: Joey Jojo will play and he's the one who owns all the games.

740
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:57,738
Speaker 0: Well yet what I see in a lot of gaming communities is that there's a few linchpin people Who for whatever reason either because they're rich or because like board games or video games are their thing that they buy everything To the extent to the exclusion of other things.

741
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,790
Speaker 0: There's the few people who have all the games.

742
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:10,530
Speaker 0: So the gaming groups that do form in those areas form around those people Which is great if you're friends with those people or you can be friends with those people.

743
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:15,610
Speaker 0: But it causes drama when you don't like the people who own the games.

744
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,910
Speaker 0: You'd like to play the games with the other people, but the other people also don't own the games, right?

745
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,037
Speaker 1: Well, it has this weird power dynamic.

746
00:47:22,098 --> 00:47:23,001
Speaker 1: Well, it also.

747
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:23,964
Speaker 1: it depends right?

748
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,490
Speaker 1: it shows people's priorities, right?

749
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,889
Speaker 1: Like you might know some people who play games.

750
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:35,490
Speaker 1: Games aren't their number one thing in life But they play some games and they will go and game with that guy who owns all the crazy games.

751
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,450
Speaker 1: They'll go to his house or her house once in a while play some games, but it's not their major thing.

752
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,877
Speaker 1: They're not so hooked on games.

753
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:44,730
Speaker 1: It's sort of like, you know a nice aside for them, right?

754
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,690
Speaker 1: I mean you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't play a game once in a while, right?

755
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:56,490
Speaker 1: But since it's not their primary thing, they're not LFG They're not going on the internet looking for that thread saying who's playing this game in this area.

756
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,444
Speaker 0: They'll show their not invention and binge for three days on games.

757
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:00,750
Speaker 1: Well, they even go to a convention.

758
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,367
Speaker 1: It's like such a low priority for them.

759
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:02,893
Speaker 1: gaming They're.

760
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:03,198
Speaker 1: so.

761
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:08,870
Speaker 1: you know It's such a look at a lot of it's so less important than their family their job and their other hobbies.

762
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:12,210
Speaker 1: But they do it once in a while, but you cannot find this person.

763
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,330
Speaker 1: You cannot get them to regularly commit to spending a lot of time playing games with you.

764
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,609
Speaker 1: That's just not a thing that they're interested in, you know, so even though they're a gamer, right?

765
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,136
Speaker 1: They're part of the pie of Potential people to game with.

766
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:28,010
Speaker 1: they're just not into it as much right as much as you are who wants to game.

767
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,561
Speaker 1: You know weekly or twice monthly or whatever.

768
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,570
Speaker 0: now there is already and we'll talk more at the end.

769
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,782
Speaker 0: I think about ways ways to mitigate these issues.

770
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:37,929
Speaker 0: the way around that problem Is that if you're committed to it?

771
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:46,450
Speaker 0: You have to be that person who has a lot of the games and you have to be the one who does all this work To organize game nights to where you need like a 10 to 1 ratio.

772
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,003
Speaker 0: You need 10 people who like games.

773
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:53,869
Speaker 0: for every one Average person you'll get to attend your game night to play a game.

774
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:54,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:48:54,532 --> 00:49:00,386
Speaker 0: So if you know 40 people who kind of like games Then you can reliably get four of them to show up once a week and play settlers with you.

776
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:06,548
Speaker 1: another thing That's kind of small small but significant right is the age of the gamers.

777
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:07,732
Speaker 1: right now You shouldn't.

778
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:15,930
Speaker 1: I mean nobody's discriminating at least no one that I know is discriminating in terms of you know Race creed gender whatever in terms of who they're gaming with.

779
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,650
Speaker 1: They just want someone who's gonna play the game and they don't give a shit what color height or whatever they are.

780
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:22,696
Speaker 1: But age can matter a lot.

781
00:49:22,736 --> 00:49:27,858
Speaker 1: if you are into the Pokemon trading card game and you show up at some elementary school Tournament right.

782
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,445
Speaker 1: if you're you into yugioh Which is perfectly okay for anyone to be into you.

783
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:36,041
Speaker 1: if you want to be Right, you can show up at a tournament at a game store and play against.

784
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:43,845
Speaker 1: you know, ten-year-olds and I guess that's okay a Little bit, okay, but you can't be hanging out with them at like a meetup.

785
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:47,945
Speaker 1: You can't be having them over your house You can't really be befriending them when you're 30 40 year old person.

786
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:52,590
Speaker 1: That is just kind of not cool and has a lot of issues.

787
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:59,510
Speaker 0: Well, even if it is a hundred percent cool It doesn't matter because guys we live in a society where appearances matter or at least appearances affect you.

788
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:00,634
Speaker 1: Right if you're that?

789
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:06,115
Speaker 0: if you show up at an elementary school Pokemon meetup and you're 40 It's not gonna work.

790
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:07,522
Speaker 1: It goes the other way too.

791
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:08,970
Speaker 1: You're a nerdy kid in high school.

792
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,470
Speaker 1: There's two other nerdy kids in your high school that you do stuff with but you need more.

793
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:16,850
Speaker 1: The only other nerds in town are like these old dudes who game at the game shop.

794
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:19,075
Speaker 1: You can't really get mixed up with them.

795
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:29,620
Speaker 0: It's not gonna work out right because it's just it just isn't even though that sort of like mentored novice Relationship seems to have been a very common way.

796
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,290
Speaker 0: people got into role-playing games for many many years.

797
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:46,534
Speaker 0: I mean I would go to conventions like Michigan when I was in late middle school Even mid middle school and I'd show up and I joined a D&D game and most other people in that game were 30 40 50 And it worked totally fine.

798
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:49,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, but again at a convention right?

799
00:50:49,863 --> 00:51:02,021
Speaker 1: not like going to their house if you have a significant Difference of age with the people that you can find there are only certain situations where it'll be socially appropriate To game with them and most of the time it won't be.

800
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:09,430
Speaker 0: and even if you ignore the social thing or the social thing Is fine, I mean a lot of times it can be fine like parents meet and then the parents and kids have multiple families.

801
00:51:09,551 --> 00:51:11,117
Speaker 1: Or maybe it's your friend's dad.

802
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:15,936
Speaker 1: You're in high school and you have a friend in high school and his dad is The crazy gamer guy.

803
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:18,710
Speaker 1: it's like oh well that you know, that's a relationship that can work out.

804
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,616
Speaker 0: You know the modern era.

805
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:24,910
Speaker 0: if you're into magic and your dad comes down to play He's probably got all these old like mocks emeralds and black lotuses, right?

806
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,750
Speaker 1: You know, that's that's an appropriate situation.

807
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:29,500
Speaker 0: But there's also the problem of the kid brain.

808
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:34,429
Speaker 0: the science shows below certain ages Like there's milestones of development in kids.

809
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:39,426
Speaker 0: We played a really good game of Hanabi with two pretty young kids at anime Boston.

810
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that long ago It was a fun game, but you know what and they were smart.

811
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,510
Speaker 0: They did really well.

812
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,541
Speaker 1: They were you know smart kids compared to other kids.

813
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:50,073
Speaker 1: They were above average and smartness for kids their age They were still kids.

814
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:55,470
Speaker 0: some kids just aren't at the level yet where they understand what a role-playing game even is.

815
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,714
Speaker 0: Like they just don't get it.

816
00:51:56,734 --> 00:52:01,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the age difference will limit the amount of complexity you grab.

817
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:02,030
Speaker 1: grab a board game.

818
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,330
Speaker 1: What does it say on the side ages X and up ages X to X, right?

819
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:16,929
Speaker 1: if you are in a different age range different games might just be skill level far away from you or Because of your age you just can't have a skill level any higher, right?

820
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:17,671
Speaker 1: It's it.

821
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:21,850
Speaker 1: you'll see some prodigies, of course, right, but you know you go to a netrunner tournament.

822
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:23,114
Speaker 1: No one.

823
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,320
Speaker 1: there is under 20 something.

824
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,266
Speaker 0: everyone's between the ages of 25 and 35, right?

825
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:33,370
Speaker 1: The World Championships those like one kid in like Tiago and he was a legend, right?

826
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:42,102
Speaker 1: It's it's a complicated game that like a kid even a high school kid that have a hard time You know playing netrunner and seriously now, it's not an easy game.

827
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:46,110
Speaker 1: age is a factor and chess tournaments They have age groups, right?

828
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,423
Speaker 1: You know, you know the eight-year-old doesn't get to play against the grandmasters and whatever.

829
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:57,030
Speaker 0: now age is a factor but Similar to or at least related to age is the social set of the person.

830
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:09,790
Speaker 0: I mean when I play games with my adult friends we say fuck a lot Mmm, but a lot, you know, the game itself is one thing But you have to get along with the people you're playing games with even though most of you out there.

831
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,830
Speaker 0: So easy for us to fall into our like the way we do panels when we get into this format.

832
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:16,990
Speaker 0: But I'm even like pointing at the monitor.

833
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:18,649
Speaker 1: You're the only one doing it.

834
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're you're speaking the same way.

835
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,390
Speaker 0: you speak on a panel instead of let what we do on the show.

836
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,832
Speaker 0: It's fun.

837
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:23,496
Speaker 1: slides.

838
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have slides.

839
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:25,066
Speaker 0: So I'm looking at them.

840
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:25,609
Speaker 0: They're all blank.

841
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:27,356
Speaker 1: Get some pictures.

842
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:28,585
Speaker 1: these aren't easy to get pictures for.

843
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:29,410
Speaker 0: I got some good pictures.

844
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,379
Speaker 0: Actually, I want to add a slide about obligation.

845
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:40,749
Speaker 0: Okay, but anyway, so I can't say fuck all the time if I'm playing a game with like a bunch of eight-year-olds from the neighbor family.

846
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:44,402
Speaker 1: or maybe You found some people near you and you have the same interesting games.

847
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,490
Speaker 0: It's gonna work out, but they're really Republican.

848
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:51,890
Speaker 0: Oh, they're really religious and they're a different religion from you and it's an issue for all of you, right?

849
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:59,128
Speaker 0: Or they're just really prudish right and you're really loose and it's like like you You're a grande and you make a joke about how the king looks like a penis.

850
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:04,026
Speaker 1: They're like At your game night, you're all drinking and smoking weed and at their game night.

851
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:07,870
Speaker 1: They're all like Whoa, that's that's or vice versa.

852
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,919
Speaker 1: You're all and you go to a game night somewhere.

853
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:14,590
Speaker 1: you walk in and you smell the weed smoke and there's brownies and whatnot.

854
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,076
Speaker 1: And it's like oh you're getting out of there.

855
00:54:16,397 --> 00:54:19,330
Speaker 0: But the trouble is that a lot of gamers are desperate.

856
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:21,159
Speaker 0: We know they're desperate.

857
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,104
Speaker 0: read any forum.

858
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,170
Speaker 0: go around this convention.

859
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,415
Speaker 0: You'll see the desperate people.

860
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:26,143
Speaker 0: but some of you might be the desperate people.

861
00:54:26,585 --> 00:54:27,750
Speaker 0: I've been desperate at many points.

862
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,090
Speaker 1: I'm often desperate.

863
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,804
Speaker 0: You'll play games with people that outside of the context of that specific game.

864
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:40,459
Speaker 0: You probably find abhorrence Either socially politically culturally.

865
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,839
Speaker 0: you might have literally nothing to say to someone but yet gamers the world over We'll play games with those people if they're really desperate.

866
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:58,630
Speaker 1: if they're desperate which a lot of people are right, okay, so Regardless of those factors, right Those people near you they fit all those requirements.

867
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,276
Speaker 1: They might just be hiding.

868
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,625
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people out there who are just hiding.

869
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:06,450
Speaker 1: they they're not looking for you.

870
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,015
Speaker 1: They're not looking to be found.

871
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:08,858
Speaker 1: They're playing games.

872
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:09,581
Speaker 1: They're into them.

873
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:10,263
Speaker 1: You're into them.

874
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:13,655
Speaker 0: They're really into a maybe yeah They're just not looking for anyone.

875
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:13,936
Speaker 1: why?

876
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:15,060
Speaker 1: because they got theirs.

877
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,324
Speaker 0: and here's how you find out.

878
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,551
Speaker 0: go look at a list of counter-strike Servers.

879
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:24,228
Speaker 0: notice all those servers that are locked that you need a password to get into notice how a lot of them are full.

880
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:27,816
Speaker 0: Yep How many D&D groups are open?

881
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:30,745
Speaker 0: invite how many open invite D&D groups go?

882
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:32,430
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, they've got a D&D group.

883
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:34,800
Speaker 1: They've already got the GM and four players.

884
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,210
Speaker 1: They're not advertising looking for more players.

885
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,137
Speaker 1: They're not you know doing it.

886
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:40,860
Speaker 1: they're just hiding.

887
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,890
Speaker 1: they're meeting regularly in their house, you don't know them.

888
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,614
Speaker 1: They don't know you.

889
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,990
Speaker 1: they could be your next-door fucking neighbors, right?

890
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,805
Speaker 1: You could be into D&D as much as they would but you don't know them.

891
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:52,633
Speaker 1: They don't know you and That's the end of that.

892
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:56,147
Speaker 1: They're not looking and when you post looking they're not respond.

893
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:56,890
Speaker 1: They're not responding.

894
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,071
Speaker 0: Now.

895
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:58,180
Speaker 0: there's a lot of reasons for this.

896
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,760
Speaker 0: I mean for example, we I've run a game night like every other week in our apartment.

897
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:03,121
Speaker 0: Actually.

898
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:10,430
Speaker 0: We have two alternating sets of game nights Never going to publicly post that because I don't want a bunch of strangers showing up.

899
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,952
Speaker 0: I personally invite individual people and we hang out and that's what we do Most.

900
00:56:15,153 --> 00:56:21,119
Speaker 0: I think most of you are not super comfortable putting an ad on Craigslist saying hey You want to come play board games at my house?

901
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,650
Speaker 0: Here's the address right door will be open.

902
00:56:24,154 --> 00:56:29,470
Speaker 1: You're super comfortable saying hey Is there anyone out there who wants to play games or has a D&D or whatever?

903
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,730
Speaker 1: But no one's gonna respond to that if they've already got one.

904
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,360
Speaker 1: So none of those people even though they're there.

905
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,110
Speaker 1: it is ridiculously difficult to find them.

906
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:55,328
Speaker 1: The only way to find them would be to happenstance meet them and befriend them in another social context and then Discover that their game exists and then befriend them enough to which they would invite you or you could invite them into a gaming situation that would grow over time.

907
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:59,083
Speaker 1: and it's not easy that you have all seen this happen.

908
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:03,158
Speaker 0: you go to some gaming meetup and Everyone's there kind of playing their games.

909
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,369
Speaker 0: games are going well or badly or whatever.

910
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:19,616
Speaker 0: but then you see a new person shows up and everyone kind of talks to them and gets them to play games to kind of get a sense of if they're Creepy or not if they're good at games or not if they like the same kind of games and if some people really hit it Off you won't see.

911
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:26,029
Speaker 0: you'll see people sort of try to invite them to their private gaming group Like hey, you should come to my apartment sometime we play games.

912
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:33,420
Speaker 0: Those invitations are often said very quietly Far away from the main group of gamers.

913
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:33,922
Speaker 1: Yep.

914
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,950
Speaker 0: Nobody is super public about that.

915
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:47,546
Speaker 0: In fact, a lot of people will pointedly Talk to someone after the event saying hey, you should come to my game group Because they didn't want that guy to overhear right now.

916
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,470
Speaker 1: We're not gonna discuss.

917
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:51,264
Speaker 1: I mean everything that needs to be said about that guy.

918
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,329
Speaker 1: you all know that guy.

919
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:54,041
Speaker 1: That's all that needs to be said.

920
00:57:54,102 --> 00:58:02,670
Speaker 1: right has been said already But it's not so much the concerns directly of you being that guy or how to deal with that guy when he's around.

921
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:08,530
Speaker 1: It's more the fact that the guy exists in the first place, even if he doesn't physically exist.

922
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:11,389
Speaker 1: Maybe you're lucky and you live in a town with know that guys in it.

923
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:12,173
Speaker 0: It's possible.

924
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:15,930
Speaker 1: the simple fact is that that guy exists somewhere on earth.

925
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:26,946
Speaker 1: people know that guy and are afraid of that guy or at least the phantom of that guy and Thus they will behave in a certain way to avoid any possibility of that guy.

926
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:28,230
Speaker 0: It's like in Martin.

927
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,876
Speaker 0: I think of a funny example.

928
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:32,036
Speaker 0: No,

929
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:38,127
Speaker 1: just merely the fear of This thing this person possibly existing

930
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,653
Speaker 0: Mario Party I know the stars

931
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:53,082
Speaker 1: of this right affects all the behavior of all the normal people and their behavior will not change Until not only are all those guys gone But no one has any fear of that guy possibly being there

932
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:54,165
Speaker 0: now that guy.

933
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:55,990
Speaker 1: that day will not come in my lifetime.

934
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:56,934
Speaker 0: I mean there you.

935
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:02,558
Speaker 0: you could treat this like it's a game and that guy is a Event that's moving around on the board.

936
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,850
Speaker 0: You've seen the scenario you're at a con you want to play, Puerto Rico.

937
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:07,598
Speaker 0: It takes up to five players.

938
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,427
Speaker 0: You've got three people are really into it.

939
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:12,062
Speaker 0: you yell out Hey anyone want to play Puerto Rico?

940
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,389
Speaker 0: two people walk up.

941
00:59:13,993 --> 00:59:21,039
Speaker 0: You all give each other the look because you know that one of those people Seems okay And one of them is so obviously that guy.

942
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,907
Speaker 0: you really don't want them to join their game because you're just.

943
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:34,147
Speaker 0: you're sure Either they're gonna be that guy in the creepy possibly misogynistic You know all the bad odor bad something or it might be the relative.

944
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:37,196
Speaker 0: that guy as in He's that guy to your group.

945
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:45,496
Speaker 0: if you're the super serious gamers and it's obvious that it's a guy who isn't super He's not gonna take the game seriously He's not gonna get the game.

946
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:51,302
Speaker 1: someone who's gonna be even it could be something as simple as someone who's gonna be slow on their Turn or it'll be hard to explain the rules to.

947
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:54,014
Speaker 1: or you know It is just not someone.

948
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:59,773
Speaker 1: that's someone who on their own it only takes one bad egg to spoil the whole omelet Right up.

949
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:05,222
Speaker 0: because if you get stuck in a game, you know, Puerto Rico Especially at a convention where you're teaching some rules.

950
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:06,770
Speaker 0: That's a two-hour commitment.

951
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:13,250
Speaker 0: If that's a two-hour commitment and someone ruins the game it is really bad culture.

952
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:16,402
Speaker 0: It's not part of the etiquette of gaming to walk away from a game.

953
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:17,064
Speaker 0: You're fucked.

954
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,180
Speaker 1: I Might just start walking away from a game.

955
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,488
Speaker 0: I've thought about making that.

956
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:34,609
Speaker 0: I'm think that maybe part of the reason that guy is enabled is that gaming culture especially tabletop and convention culture Makes it very difficult to politely turn that guy down.

957
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:38,362
Speaker 0: Hmm like if that guy wants to join your game, it's it's not.

958
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:43,276
Speaker 0: it's sort of seen as very not cool to be like, sorry We're gonna take this game super seriously.

959
01:00:43,336 --> 01:00:45,524
Speaker 0: I know you're not really into these like really hardcore games.

960
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:58,030
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but If you said that the minor hurt feelings at least be mitigated by the honesty And then everyone has a better time because that guy is not having any fun in your super hardcore game either.

961
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:00,036
Speaker 1: Maybe or maybe he's just so desperate.

962
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:00,658
Speaker 1: He is right.

963
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:07,503
Speaker 0: Who knows anyway, but as a result, it's people Try to like trick that guy and they're not joining the game.

964
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:11,460
Speaker 0: like oh, sorry the game is full But it says clearly on the box that the game takes up to five.

965
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:13,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, our friend Steve is coming in a minute.

966
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:18,730
Speaker 0: We're just waiting for him and then you see the guy like hovering around like waiting for Steve to show up.

967
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,176
Speaker 1: These are things that literally happen.

968
01:01:20,216 --> 01:01:22,447
Speaker 0: Yes, every one of these things has actually happened to us.

969
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,492
Speaker 1: Yes All right.

970
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:29,948
Speaker 1: So one more thing that can get in the way of finding gamers to play games with is simply life.

971
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:33,650
Speaker 1: I'm running a torchbearer game, right?

972
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:38,746
Speaker 1: We just I found people that I know that I can trust that are awesome a torchbearer.

973
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:41,134
Speaker 1: They're all 100% Not that guy there.

974
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:42,098
Speaker 1: Everyone's awesome.

975
01:01:42,178 --> 01:01:43,664
Speaker 1: Everyone's really into it.

976
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:45,010
Speaker 1: Everyone really wants to play.

977
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,803
Speaker 1: They at least said that they really liked the game when I ran it.

978
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:48,667
Speaker 1: They could be lying.

979
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:49,230
Speaker 1: Who knows?

980
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,648
Speaker 1: I wish they wouldn't lie because if I'm doing something wrong, I want to know.

981
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,740
Speaker 1: You know and we're playing on Google Hangouts.

982
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,970
Speaker 1: that solves a lot of our problems, right?

983
01:01:59,071 --> 01:01:59,633
Speaker 1: What happened?

984
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:02,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, look you've solved geography, you've solved time zones, you've solved language.

985
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,267
Speaker 0: You're already friends, right?

986
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:05,070
Speaker 1: What happened?

987
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,841
Speaker 1: Well, we played a couple sessions and now people's lives are getting in the way.

988
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:13,680
Speaker 1: Someone's got jobs changing schedules Someone's you know here.

989
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,286
Speaker 0: look at this week.

990
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:18,825
Speaker 0: Monday I had an impromptu meeting to consult with someone about an article they're writing.

991
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:20,089
Speaker 0: So me and Emily had dinner with them.

992
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:21,675
Speaker 0: So that killed Monday.

993
01:02:22,136 --> 01:02:23,561
Speaker 0: Tuesday, we're doing geek nights.

994
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:27,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we're finishing work for the panel Wednesday.

995
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:33,897
Speaker 0: tomorrow normally is our weekly game night, but now because suddenly I have to fly to Paris on Saturday I can do some shit together.

996
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got to cancel that game night Thursday.

997
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,700
Speaker 0: We're doing geek nights again, right?

998
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:44,190
Speaker 1: People have lives and their lives Anyone, it doesn't matter who you are how highly you prioritize gaming in general.

999
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:48,306
Speaker 1: I mean Maybe you are a guy who plays Starcraft and that is your most.

1000
01:02:48,346 --> 01:02:49,070
Speaker 1: that is your thing.

1001
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:52,630
Speaker 1: You are a start your pro at Starcraft like that's your thing, right?

1002
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:59,510
Speaker 1: You are going to prioritize something such as I don't know your brother's wedding as more important than a star?

1003
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,798
Speaker 1: Well, well, I would hope so.

1004
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:03,425
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're that guy right?

1005
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:09,869
Speaker 0: Well, well, it depends God Say someone we knew scheduled their wedding at the same time as PAX Prime.

1006
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:12,999
Speaker 1: They're getting married at PAX Prime, right?

1007
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, surprisingly they're not.

1008
01:03:15,065 --> 01:03:15,406
Speaker 1: Okay.

1009
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:16,490
Speaker 1: Why not?

1010
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:25,578
Speaker 0: I really don't understand why but somehow they decided to get married in like I don't know Chicago At the same time as PAX Prime.

1011
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:31,283
Speaker 1: Well, this packs prime move into Chicago Maybe but not this year.

1012
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:32,048
Speaker 1: Why not?

1013
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:42,121
Speaker 0: Say your brother say your actual brother got married he announced the wedding It's all set up and it was literally the weekend of PAX Prime Next year, it's tough.

1014
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:45,058
Speaker 1: Yeah It's tough.

1015
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:57,012
Speaker 1: it is tough, right But The point is these conflicts happen and when you have a gaming group right every person you have you're multiplying those difficulties Right.

1016
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,030
Speaker 1: So how often does some shit come up in your life?

1017
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,236
Speaker 1: And you have a gaming group of five people.

1018
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:07,010
Speaker 1: five times as much shit comes up and anytime one of those shits Happens the game is canceled.

1019
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,753
Speaker 1: So is the moral?

1020
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:13,709
Speaker 0: not only one person in a gaming group is allowed to have a life because then everyone else is always gonna Show up whenever that person's available.

1021
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,430
Speaker 0: Sure, that's the way to do it make friends with losers.

1022
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:24,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is actually a time and place where schedules and lives and priority are literally not a concern.

1023
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:26,134
Speaker 0: Mmm that happened to us.

1024
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:27,638
Speaker 0: That's the only reason we college.

1025
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:33,272
Speaker 0: Yes college if one you you prioritize gaming above Classes.

1026
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,503
Speaker 0: Yes, like I'm not even joking not saying you should do this.

1027
01:04:36,663 --> 01:04:37,105
Speaker 0: We did it.

1028
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:38,750
Speaker 1: Yes, but I'll take 2 a.m.

1029
01:04:39,051 --> 01:04:43,030
Speaker 0: Oh my god, we would skip class to play counter-strike with our friends.

1030
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:49,790
Speaker 0: We would skip class skip labs Drop classes to show up at the gaming clubs and play games.

1031
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:52,525
Speaker 1: We played German board game you in a class.

1032
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:53,530
Speaker 1: You can go to anime club.

1033
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:56,290
Speaker 0: I literally dropped out of a class so I could go to the anime club.

1034
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:01,449
Speaker 0: I dropped another class so I wouldn't miss an l5 our game that I joined after the class started.

1035
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:10,738
Speaker 0: We played games every goddamn day video games board games everything every day every weekend At a nerd school.

1036
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:19,673
Speaker 1: if we were not at a nerd school which again Incredibly privileged to be able to afford to go to the nerd school and to be well educated enough to get accepted to the nerd School and

1037
01:05:19,693 --> 01:05:22,969
Speaker 0: to be smart enough to somehow graduate without ever fucking going to class,

1038
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:23,270
Speaker 1: right?

1039
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:28,470
Speaker 1: And even then in that group you go to like State School how many nerds are gonna be there?

1040
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,216
Speaker 1: How often is the gaming club gonna meet?

1041
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:31,140
Speaker 1: how many people will be there?

1042
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:41,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, alrighty, there were like 150 to 200 people From a pool of a pool that would show up to the gaming club and of them like a hundred would show up every fuck.

1043
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,679
Speaker 1: Is that a school that's consisted of thousands of nerds?

1044
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,769
Speaker 1: you get you know tens of people at the gaming club.

1045
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:53,270
Speaker 0: granted There were other not technically official gaming clubs that I just spawned up a hidden gamer.

1046
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,850
Speaker 1: We were hiding from that guy right so anyway?

1047
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:57,658
Speaker 1: So what do you do about this?

1048
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,170
Speaker 0: right it go to college never leave?

1049
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:04,870
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we you know we've talked about all these reasons that you can't find another gamer.

1050
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:07,099
Speaker 1: They're just not out there right there.

1051
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,325
Speaker 1: all the things we've discussed.

1052
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:09,813
Speaker 0: so what I think there's two sides There's.

1053
01:06:09,854 --> 01:06:10,928
Speaker 0: what can you do about it?

1054
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:14,543
Speaker 0: And what can the what can gaming and the community do about it?

1055
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:15,949
Speaker 1: right so what can you do about it?

1056
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:21,009
Speaker 1: all I can tell you is either go to college or Move to a city a real city.

1057
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,074
Speaker 0: Well not a joke city.

1058
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:24,684
Speaker 0: you have to move to a real city or a college town.

1059
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:28,503
Speaker 0: that has to be a big enough college To attract enough people and a nerdy college.

1060
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:31,120
Speaker 0: Yes, right I mean I went to.

1061
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:40,983
Speaker 0: I won't name the name of the college But when I was living in Poughkeepsie I was bored wanted to find a gaming group and I found a gaming club at a local college That was open invite so I thought I'd go to it.

1062
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:41,648
Speaker 0: I went to it.

1063
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:50,129
Speaker 0: That's where I learned that this club was also the anime club and the witchcraft Wicca club and the science fiction club.

1064
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,796
Speaker 0: I had like five members.

1065
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:54,870
Speaker 1: there are so few nerds there, and I never went back right.

1066
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:00,063
Speaker 1: I looked in the door And I was like nope if you live in a city a major city so consider this.

1067
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:05,859
Speaker 1: I live in New York City the majorist Of cities in the world new room capital of Earth.

1068
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:12,700
Speaker 1: okay, and when we play netrunner on Tuesday nights This is maybe 20 people tops.

1069
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,210
Speaker 1: we go to the other tournament 20-something people.

1070
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:21,610
Speaker 1: But apparently we just discovered that there's another secret hiding group of netrunners in Brooklyn at some NYU thing.

1071
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:23,888
Speaker 1: So there's probably more like 40 something people.

1072
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:32,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like maybe 50 to 60 total serious netrunner people that are in the community in all of New York City.

1073
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:34,982
Speaker 1: Millions upon millions and millions of people.

1074
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:35,807
Speaker 1: we'll go to one game.

1075
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:37,850
Speaker 1: You're not in New York City.

1076
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,717
Speaker 1: How many less people are there than that?

1077
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:44,658
Speaker 1: some guy went out told me he went out to Long Island to play and he won A tournament where they're only like six people.

1078
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,729
Speaker 1: that's so close to where we are.

1079
01:07:47,171 --> 01:07:50,425
Speaker 0: Hopefully it's not also a combination for you of dead or dying game.

1080
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:53,435
Speaker 1: No, it's not Right static game.

1081
01:07:53,455 --> 01:07:55,704
Speaker 0: all the people who started playing are the only ones who's still playing.

1082
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:57,170
Speaker 1: No we get new people not.

1083
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:02,356
Speaker 1: But I say it's like, you know, so if you're into magic, right It's like you can find people.

1084
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,307
Speaker 1: that game is a worldwide game, right?

1085
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:08,270
Speaker 0: Oh my god It packs Australia's a bunch of having the tabletop was just people play magic.

1086
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,070
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of gaming meetups in New York City, right?

1087
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,350
Speaker 1: But okay, New York City is four times the size of pretty much any other city.

1088
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:23,683
Speaker 1: So you got to say Boston is 25% of the gaming that's in New York is in Boston I think is way smaller than four times, but they had no but they have.

1089
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:25,250
Speaker 1: they have nerds there at MIT and such.

1090
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:27,536
Speaker 1: That gives them a boost Nerd town, right?

1091
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,599
Speaker 1: San Francisco, Seattle get boost cuz of nerd town.

1092
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,130
Speaker 1: Okay, go to I don't know Kansas City.

1093
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:37,176
Speaker 1: There's some nerds there in Kansas City.

1094
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,720
Speaker 1: It's somewhat of a real city.

1095
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:45,569
Speaker 1: They even have a professional, you know sporting teams You know, they have Google Internet which brought some nerds into town.

1096
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:53,947
Speaker 1: but there's probably like Less than a quarter of the gaming going on there as there isn't in New York, right?

1097
01:08:53,987 --> 01:08:54,930
Speaker 1: Just because of population.

1098
01:08:55,691 --> 01:09:01,510
Speaker 0: Now there's also the weird side of it's like New York City actually has some problems that make some aspects of gaming way harder.

1099
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:03,518
Speaker 0: So it even gets hard on the upper end.

1100
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:04,642
Speaker 0: you would like Toronto.

1101
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:06,750
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of board game cafes.

1102
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,634
Speaker 1: There's one in New York now.

1103
01:09:07,694 --> 01:09:09,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's one in New York.

1104
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,390
Speaker 1: I thought there's only one in Toronto snakes and lattes.

1105
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:13,384
Speaker 0: I I heard that there's two more.

1106
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:14,170
Speaker 1: I haven't heard that.

1107
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,475
Speaker 0: That's what I was told when I was there.

1108
01:09:15,537 --> 01:09:15,959
Speaker 0: people told me.

1109
01:09:16,099 --> 01:09:17,345
Speaker 0: Oh, you should visit this other place.

1110
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:17,848
Speaker 1: Okay?

1111
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,192
Speaker 1: Whatever.

1112
01:09:19,212 --> 01:09:23,410
Speaker 1: Okay, so something else that we can all do have more conventions.

1113
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:37,785
Speaker 1: Why is there just you know a few paxes right and I guess crappy Gen Con and a couple other tiny aspects of dragon con right Aspects of kinetic on aspect a lot of cons board game gaming.

1114
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:44,430
Speaker 1: on this There's a significant number of cons, but there's way more anime cons than gaming cons.

1115
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:47,319
Speaker 1: There are tiny anime cons friggin all over the plane.

1116
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,990
Speaker 0: those tiny anime cons grow huge really quick.

1117
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:53,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's thousands of people at those things that got caught, you know, we laugh like it's a small con.

1118
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,099
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty fucking big now thousands of people.

1119
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and it's in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1120
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,299
Speaker 0: It's like I'd never heard of Lancaster before.

1121
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:02,965
Speaker 1: I've heard of it, but it's like that is.

1122
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:04,450
Speaker 1: that's even less than Kansas City.

1123
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:08,070
Speaker 1: That's a small place but thousands of little nerds show up for that anime con.

1124
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:11,470
Speaker 1: So why can't there be as many gaming cons as there are anime cons?

1125
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,503
Speaker 1: There should be one near any wherever you live.

1126
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,894
Speaker 1: There should be one a month Driving distance.

1127
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:18,922
Speaker 0: in a sense there should are.

1128
01:10:19,203 --> 01:10:23,275
Speaker 0: there are tons of gaming cons But this is con culture.

1129
01:10:23,656 --> 01:10:31,350
Speaker 0: the gaming cons that are like packs and mag fest have a almost completely separate culture from What traditionally was considered a gaming con?

1130
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,033
Speaker 0: I mean as a kid.

1131
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:35,993
Speaker 0: there were like nine conventions within a short drive of my house in Michigan Hmm.

1132
01:10:36,134 --> 01:10:37,120
Speaker 0: and I went to a bunch of them.

1133
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:37,744
Speaker 0: You know what?

1134
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:44,287
Speaker 0: they were all Under a thousand people and they were all the old-school pay for tickets to individual.

1135
01:10:44,308 --> 01:10:44,990
Speaker 1: They're over con.

1136
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were like uber cons right or the.

1137
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,028
Speaker 0: all those other little gaming cons are in New York City like they're

1138
01:10:50,068 --> 01:10:50,289
Speaker 1: there

1139
01:10:50,771 --> 01:11:03,602
Speaker 0: But they have such a different culture that for whatever reason they can't really grow and the few that do grow tend to run into a lot of problems and Have a lot of internal drama just like gaming groups do huh?

1140
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:08,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know if you want more gaming I think more conventions would just help a lot.

1141
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:13,095
Speaker 1: and then finally just at least for us in the u.s Here in Canada, right?

1142
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,801
Speaker 1: We need better internets, right?

1143
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:19,519
Speaker 1: It's like we already have probably know that someone far away There's gonna be latency no matter what.

1144
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,057
Speaker 1: but if our internet was just better There's dude still be.

1145
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:25,670
Speaker 1: there's a lot of games that I should be able to play with someone.

1146
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,503
Speaker 1: But our and we both have money.

1147
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:32,629
Speaker 1: we both have good computers But the internet just sucks and we can't buy better internet or the internet just can't do things.

1148
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:40,630
Speaker 0: yet like we don't have Augmented reality is where we both have a physical esque copy of a board game in front of us and are playing remotely with holograms.

1149
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:43,590
Speaker 1: Nope, someday that'll happen, but we need to get you know.

1150
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,677
Speaker 1: We just need to fix internet in the u.s.

1151
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:56,210
Speaker 1: To where you know, we can get google fiber everywhere or you know Isp, stop screwing everyone over and little things like automatic translation generic places for games lots of stuff that could happen there.

1152
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:07,570
Speaker 1: Sure, I guess the last thing that you can do to find gamers in this desperate situation is Simply to change who you are or at least something about yourself, right?

1153
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:11,070
Speaker 1: Maybe you really want to play an rpg and you're a dnd person.

1154
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:18,255
Speaker 1: That's what you're into and the people near you are into pathfinder and it's like well Just become a pathfinder person.

1155
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:20,822
Speaker 1: It's not it's not that different right?

1156
01:12:21,143 --> 01:12:23,610
Speaker 1: just you know, you're outvoted, right?

1157
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:28,829
Speaker 1: Would you rather play pathfinder which is really similar to what you already want to do, right?

1158
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,770
Speaker 1: Even though it's not exactly what you'd like to do or would you rather stay home and play nothing?

1159
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:40,050
Speaker 0: And if you don't play pathfinder then it'll be really hard to convince those people to switch to dnd, right?

1160
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:48,395
Speaker 0: But if you play with them, I mean i've seen there's a lot of commentary with indie rpg Someone will join a dnd group and then over the years be like hey Why don't we try this indie rpg?

1161
01:12:48,676 --> 01:12:52,590
Speaker 0: you can actually groom other people to be into the games you're into.

1162
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:53,436
Speaker 0: You play.

1163
01:12:53,476 --> 01:12:54,443
Speaker 1: you play league of legends.

1164
01:12:54,463 --> 01:12:55,430
Speaker 1: Your friend is into dota.

1165
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,537
Speaker 1: Just play dota right?

1166
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:57,758
Speaker 1: It's.

1167
01:12:57,939 --> 01:12:59,225
Speaker 1: it's just go, you know, it's.

1168
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:00,270
Speaker 1: it's not that different.

1169
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:04,410
Speaker 1: Would you rather play dota with your friend or would you rather play league of legends alone and him play dota alone?

1170
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:08,646
Speaker 0: Right just just play team fortress 2. is not that different from others?

1171
01:13:08,868 --> 01:13:09,270
Speaker 1: one, right?

1172
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,950
Speaker 1: You can't change anyone else you can only change yourself.

1173
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:16,310
Speaker 1: So don't you know, you're not gonna be if the other person's stubborn just give up on that.

1174
01:13:16,571 --> 01:13:20,530
Speaker 1: Just be the unstubborn person and more gaming will happen, right?

1175
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,265
Speaker 1: You know if you're if you play call of duty your phone plays counter-strike.

1176
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:24,009
Speaker 1: just play counter-strike.

1177
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:28,793
Speaker 0: But if you try to bludgeon other people over the head like you've got to play this other game instead It's not gonna work.

1178
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:37,203
Speaker 1: you become that guy to them if you're if you're super serious like, you know about playing to win Right and and the other people are just sort of like la la la and they don't care.

1179
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:39,070
Speaker 1: and that's all you've got to play with.

1180
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:46,469
Speaker 0: Just change your attitude right or be super fun and sociable and do all the social stuff, but still just fucking win.

1181
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:51,407
Speaker 0: Just be the guy who always fucking wins but doesn't make a big deal about it's like I won again.

1182
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,170
Speaker 0: I won again.

1183
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,201
Speaker 0: Oh rim always wins.

1184
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:58,943
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, just change yourself so that you can make the situation whatever situation you've got.

1185
01:13:59,204 --> 01:13:59,705
Speaker 1: work right.

1186
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:02,133
Speaker 1: you don't have a lot to work with Right.

1187
01:14:02,414 --> 01:14:13,079
Speaker 0: So whatever you've got make the most of it, but at the same time Don't misinterpret someone not wanting to play a game with you for hating you Because they probably hate you.

1188
01:14:13,099 --> 01:14:17,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, they probably do but I don't think we want that more.

1189
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:18,304
Speaker 0: It'll be in the actual tax panel.

1190
01:14:18,465 --> 01:14:22,082
Speaker 0: No Mm-hmm, but think of it this way.

1191
01:14:22,142 --> 01:14:23,969
Speaker 0: Would you invite this person into your house?

1192
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,057
Speaker 1: Barely knowing them would you?

1193
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:29,690
Speaker 1: are you a person that people want to invite into their home?

1194
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, be a person that you would want to invite dude.

1195
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,450
Speaker 0: Does every group evaporate the moment you try to join it?

1196
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,166
Speaker 0: That's more back to the that guy you shouldn't.

1197
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:42,577
Speaker 0: yeah All right, that's all.

1198
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:45,091
Speaker 0: Did anyone want to ask a question?

1199
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:46,137
Speaker 0: I guess they can't.

1200
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:49,012
Speaker 0: no I don't know if you have any comments on this.

1201
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:50,740
Speaker 0: Uh, we didn't mind that did we do met?

1202
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,868
Speaker 1: We barely did met a moment.

1203
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:52,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do a little bit.

1204
01:14:53,197 --> 01:15:04,252
Speaker 0: basically If you ask us questions about what we talked about or have anything interesting to add anecdotes, whatever uh We we got some time before packs we can edit this panel.

1205
01:15:04,452 --> 01:15:13,780
Speaker 0: guys the secret to our panels that we have a list of slides Because those are just the main points We uh make it up every time we do a panel is different because we just know what we're gonna talk about.

1206
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:14,503
Speaker 0: That's it?

1207
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,836
Speaker 0: so if you tell us something cool we might incorporate it into the panel.

1208
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:25,944
Speaker 0: maybe hopefully I just imagine this people will tell us their stuff and everything they tell us becomes the anecdotes of what not to do The anecdote of that guy.

1209
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:26,908
Speaker 1: we're not doing that panel.

1210
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,394
Speaker 0: No, we're not that panel.

01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:30,060
Speaker 0: There's a topic for an anime con.
