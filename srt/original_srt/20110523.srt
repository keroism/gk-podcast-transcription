00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,880

Speaker 1: You know what?

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,350
Speaker 1: I didn't bike this morning because it was still wet.

25
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,089
Speaker 0: also the truth for me as well But I got new hiking boots.

26
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,159
Speaker 1: cuz this weekend I'm gonna climb another mile-high mountain.

27
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, good for you.

28
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,960
Speaker 1: Uh, I had to wear him in so I just ran home from work in my jeans.

29
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,679
Speaker 1: Okay, and it didn't take that long.

30
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,965
Speaker 0: Number two on the subway platform this morning on the way to work There was a crazy guy.

31
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:38,928
Speaker 0: but you know how crazy like yelling crazy there's crazy guys all the time But this guy was particularly crazy.

32
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,735
Speaker 0: That's why I'm that's why I'm mentioning him.

33
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,024
Speaker 0: if he was just regular crazy He wouldn't have been noteworthy.

34
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:44,649
Speaker 1: So what manner of crazy?

35
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,800
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the agitated crazy guy who's like bothered about something.

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,679
Speaker 1: There's just the screaming yelling like crazy woodley-woo guy.

37
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,229
Speaker 1: There's the like quiet rocking themselves.

38
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:59,460
Speaker 1: cuz someone should call the police and you know, take care of him crazy Check on the first two, but not the third one, right?

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,623
Speaker 1: So yelling and crazy.

40
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:16,014
Speaker 0: so I get there and there's a guy and I he's a guy sitting on the bench and there's a guy basically bent over saying something at him a whole lot and I can't really make it out cuz I got my headphones in and also When I took the headphones out, you couldn't really make out what the guy was saying.

41
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,019
Speaker 0: Anyway, cuz he was a crazy guy.

42
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,688
Speaker 1: Have it a jibbity-jubilee?

43
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:20,170
Speaker 0: pretty much.

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he was.

45
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:24,911
Speaker 0: he was yelling jibbity-jubilee Alright, so I put my headphones in and I ignore him.

46
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,680
Speaker 0: Alright, cuz you can't get involved with that shit.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:38,635
Speaker 0: Nope, eventually the guy sort of stops bending over and getting in the other guy's face and but the crazy guy You know once he gets out of the guy's face He's basically jumping up and down a little bit yelling his jibbity-jubilee.

48
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,000
Speaker 1: Was he waving his arms?

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,840
Speaker 0: No, but he had a cane and he was basically jumping and stomping and shaking.

50
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,223
Speaker 0: It's like he was.

51
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:51,140
Speaker 0: it's like he had punches in him and he was releasing the punches without punching anything, right?

52
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:58,945
Speaker 0: but then he got like he got a little more crazy like he's pointing his cane at people and getting kind of weird.

53
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:10,095
Speaker 0: and then when the train showed up like he like when there's this girl standing next to me and he basically goes behind her and Pushes the air but like but like he was gonna push her onto the tracks.

54
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,646
Speaker 1: Whoa Which there was.

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,760
Speaker 1: there was a big rat.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Speaker 1: Well, not a big rash, but there was a time when that was a danger.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,960
Speaker 1: There was a small rash of crazy people just pushing people onto the tracks.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like the train was already there, but he like he pushes the air.

59
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:28,124
Speaker 1: That's not good that that guy's practicing and the girl like goes like That guy's training.

60
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:28,505
Speaker 1: Hmm.

61
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like it was a crazy guy.

62
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,058
Speaker 0: watch out crazy guy.

63
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:41,193
Speaker 0: and the third thing there's a place that eat lunch sometimes called fresh & Co and they got Salad and sandwiches and the sandwiches they have a pretty good like.

64
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:41,534
Speaker 0: they're not.

65
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,147
Speaker 0: they won't fill you up that much But they're pretty cheap like six seven bucks.

66
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:51,737
Speaker 0: and they put him in this incredibly hot convection oven and they taste they have like the most Flavor of any sandwich that you can get in the area.

67
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:55,385
Speaker 0: Nah So they were tweeting.

68
00:03:55,606 --> 00:04:00,300
Speaker 0: they were like trivia win lunch and I won lunch by direct messaging a tweet.

69
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:01,184
Speaker 0: So I got.

70
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,550
Speaker 0: I got a sandwich in the water.

71
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,690
Speaker 1: Well, that's how I got those tickets to Scott Pilgrim Wasn't because of fancy industry connections or anything.

72
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:15,000
Speaker 1: I just won the Midtown Comics contest by tweeting Yeah, because apparently everyone's really slow but actually tweeting if something happens.

73
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it knows.

74
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,519
Speaker 0: so I actually you know.

75
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,719
Speaker 0: So I was just asked my co-worker what the answer the trivia was and I just got it.

76
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:28,260
Speaker 1: I got a minor geek bite considered a review of an app because you see until recently I had The palm free which had no apps to review.

77
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:38,539
Speaker 1: Yeah now well there was one app because what I really needed one of the killer apps for a smartphone for me was Using GPS data to gather statistics like heat maps of where I go.

78
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:45,469
Speaker 1: You know if I go hiking or running seeing a map of like how far I went how long I went if I'm like Exploring and I find a weird thing.

79
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,427
Speaker 1: I can look back on the map and see where I was And I couldn't use latitude or anything.

80
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,720
Speaker 1: So I end up using this thing called smart runner and it kind of sucks.

81
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,239
Speaker 1: But it was the best one there was.

82
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,089
Speaker 1: People use it and it was free.

83
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,140
Speaker 1: I could pay the right price.

84
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,419
Speaker 1: I mean I could have paid for like more stuff.

85
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,940
Speaker 1: But the stuff that offered was kind of dumb and I had this website.

86
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,480
Speaker 1: It all worked pretty well, except the app just kind of sucked.

87
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,226
Speaker 1: So I get my new phone.

88
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:15,909
Speaker 1: I install smart run around it cuz I already got a ton of data in it And it still sucks.

89
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,097
Speaker 1: It wasn't that it sucked because it was on the pre.

90
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:22,532
Speaker 1: it just sucks No, but even the pay app isn't any better.

91
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,060
Speaker 1: you just get more features on the site.

92
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,706
Speaker 1: Okay, not in the app.

93
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,280
Speaker 1: All right, you gotta pay for like a membership to the site.

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,504
Speaker 0: What sucks about it?

95
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:37,307
Speaker 1: So you'll be running you turn it on right and first it just never seems to get a GPS sync Like it just doesn't use the API correctly.

96
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:37,989
Speaker 0: Okay.

97
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:44,892
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I turn on like latitude immediate sync maps immediate sync smart runner Red red red red.

98
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,460
Speaker 0: So it's just a poorly coded piece of shit.

99
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:50,640
Speaker 1: Or it would be like you're good to go rim and I'd be like, okay smart runner and I'd start running.

100
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:59,299
Speaker 1: And then I get home after like three hours of running and I look and it lost the sink like Ten feet out and not recorded anything else.

101
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 1: yeah, so I Was looking on the app sounds like not so smart runner.

102
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:09,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was looking on the App Store and I realized that Google does everything great.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,703
Speaker 1: So I just had Google into it and I just downloaded every Google app that would do anything I want.

104
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:15,670
Speaker 0: it was made by Google.

105
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,180
Speaker 1: Yes, actually made by Google.

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,445
Speaker 0: That's usually the best thing to get.

107
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:27,840
Speaker 0: you have a Google phone with the Google OS and a Google account Because none of that stuff could every every every app written by Google is probably gonna work pretty well.

108
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,540
Speaker 1: So, of course, you know Google Translate is just great.

109
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,713
Speaker 1: I said oh my why motion did it and got it immediately.

110
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,199
Speaker 0: works exactly the same on iPhone.

111
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:40,182
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, and then I got I didn't even know this existed Google tracks Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:47,283
Speaker 1: Google tracks is basically everything the smart runner pretended to be but actually works Really?

113
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,992
Speaker 0: Well, let me see if that is an available option.

114
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:52,460
Speaker 1: and basically it's Google latitude on crack.

115
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:55,416
Speaker 1: You can set it to like what interval you want it to do.

116
00:06:55,436 --> 00:07:01,535
Speaker 1: GPS updates It draws this like perfect line of where you are and altitude and grade and speed.

117
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,698
Speaker 1: and it's just.

118
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:03,200
Speaker 1: and it's all.

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,932
Speaker 1: you can Just export all the data for free to whatever format you want.

120
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:06,254
Speaker 1: It's just.

121
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:07,459
Speaker 1: it's fucking awesome.

122
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:15,402
Speaker 0: Google tracks does Not exist for oh so sad So sad, so yeah Google track.

123
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:22,575
Speaker 1: if you're looking for anything to track where you go in any kind of generalized sense Really just use Google latitude and Google track.

124
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,300
Speaker 1: everything else sucks.

125
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,651
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so that was my bite.

126
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:31,179
Speaker 1: there's it's a Tuesday Monday.

127
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 1: It's it is Monday.

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:42,959
Speaker 0: It's like the best inside joke of geek nights is that whenever we record a show on the wrong day later early We all we never keep it hidden, even though we act like we're gonna keep it hidden, but we don't.

129
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:43,970
Speaker 1: yeah We always like back.

130
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:44,619
Speaker 1: date it like it.

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,194
Speaker 0: This is the show for the 23rd of May 11 recorded on the 24th of May 11.

132
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,460
Speaker 1: Yep, because we did something fun anyway.

133
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:00,560
Speaker 0: So yeah There's this big deal going around about a patent troll that went after people making apps for the iPhone and the iPad.

134
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,131
Speaker 1: The sort of thing happens all the time all the time.

135
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:18,520
Speaker 0: so what happened here is that Apple added a feature to the the app API that you could make an app that had in-app purchases Which means you buy an app and the app might even be free But then in the app you might buy something else.

136
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,420
Speaker 0: So like you could have a farm ville and then in the farm ville buy a plow for five bucks, right?

137
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:25,798
Speaker 0: So they added that feature.

138
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:31,395
Speaker 0: So apparently that feature is patented by a company named LOD SIS, which is a patent troll.

139
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't actually make anything.

140
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:43,340
Speaker 1: Yeah you can pretty much always tell the patent trolls because they'll have a patent on something stupid that everyone already does and They don't actually have any products but lawsuits, right?

141
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:56,622
Speaker 0: So LOD SIS sent out a bunch of cease and desist letters to people not Apple, but to companies that made Apps using this, you know, but in-app purchase feature a common tactic The the.

142
00:08:56,843 --> 00:09:04,239
Speaker 1: the biggest thing a patent troll will do is usually go after a lot of small Who can't do anything because those people can't fight against it.

143
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:10,098
Speaker 1: They'll usually settle or they'll might they might fight it and they'll often lose because they don't have the resources to fight it.

144
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:13,600
Speaker 1: one guy Thus lending legitimacy to the patent lawsuit.

145
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,099
Speaker 1: So then they go to the final lawsuit.

146
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,796
Speaker 1: They point back to all the people who settled or all the people who lost.

147
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:23,876
Speaker 0: one guy Suggested right that when things like this happened that it's a risk.

148
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,000
Speaker 0: He said it's a risky move.

149
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:33,249
Speaker 0: He admitted it but one strategy might be to get all of the people who receive cease and desist letters To file on at the same exact time.

150
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,940
Speaker 0: and it would cost about two thousand per person to do this filing.

151
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:51,265
Speaker 0: but by filing all at the same time in unison, the troll would be forced to respond to all of those on the same day at Incredible expense and that that expense could actually outweigh any Possible, you know increase.

152
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:58,849
Speaker 0: so instead of settling with the patent troll and giving them, you know thousands multiplied by everyone they sent a letter to you could give that.

153
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:07,458
Speaker 0: you could give a few thousand to a bunch of lawyers all over the place and Basically, the patent troll would be crushed All right, and they wouldn't get anything but anyway.

154
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:13,982
Speaker 0: So lots of sent out these letters and then it was quiet for a while as all these app developers didn't know what the fuck to do.

155
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:25,762
Speaker 0: and then Apple finally came out today and they were like They sent a letter to Lozas and the letter was basically like look we licensed your fucking patent we gave you money already and Here is the.

156
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:30,135
Speaker 0: here in fact is the text of that patent license that we bought from you.

157
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:35,592
Speaker 0: and look it says that we can Transfer the license to this from this patent to our app developers.

158
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,237
Speaker 0: So fuck you, right?

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,959
Speaker 0: Stop harassing our developers or else.

160
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:49,369
Speaker 0: And I imagine Apple has enough money to fight Lozas, but again, I want to ask the question Why did Apple license it in the first place?

161
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,819
Speaker 0: Why didn't Apple just buy Lozas?

162
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,679
Speaker 1: Outright why probably was cheaper to settle with them?

163
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:00,577
Speaker 0: But it's like if you license the pen you're gonna have to keep licensing it until the patent is is done.

164
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,184
Speaker 0: for was it 14 Years something like that.

165
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,630
Speaker 1: Yeah still probably cheaper.

166
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:09,119
Speaker 1: Also, I think there's a more fundamental question Why do patents like this even exist?

167
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:10,665
Speaker 0: Why don't?

168
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:11,147
Speaker 0: and it's like.

169
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:16,013
Speaker 0: I know that all the tech companies basically have Armies of patents and that they all use.

170
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,520
Speaker 0: they're all defensive patents, right?

171
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,880
Speaker 0: It's like if I have enough patents against IBM and IBM has enough patents against me then we can't sue each other because then we'll both open up our you know.

172
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:25,976
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I filed.

173
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:35,380
Speaker 1: you know there was huge pressure when I worked at IBM to get patents and I actually filed a Stupid patent because I was kind of told to buy my bosses and it's a student the stupidest thing ever.

174
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:53,979
Speaker 1: But yet due to the way patents work and our messed up system of what is patentable It was eminently patentable to write a bash script that will look at the hardware of a system and come up with a unique Identifier to then be bait to be based on the MAC address to be used as a temporary DNS name for loading a box

175
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:54,822
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

176
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, what kind of BS is that?

177
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:57,531
Speaker 1: That's the patent.

178
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,715
Speaker 1: I find that's complete bullshit.

179
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:11,757
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah It's like even if the patents exist if these companies all all the tech companies really hate the patents and they're really, you know Being honest that they just want them for defensive purposes then IBM Microsoft Google Apple.

180
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,540
Speaker 0: That should be enough.

181
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Speaker 0: Maybe throw Oracle in there if those five get together and just say all right all our pet.

182
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:23,668
Speaker 0: let's you know, let's take all our patents and We'll all simultaneously put him in the shredder.

183
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,694
Speaker 0: right then know that.

184
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:30,180
Speaker 0: because then the patent trolls Then they use their money to buy the patent trolls.

185
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,797
Speaker 0: Oh put those in the shredder - no cuz buying the patent troll means they still win.

186
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:34,560
Speaker 1: they get their money.

187
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,764
Speaker 1: That's all they want is money.

188
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:37,992
Speaker 0: No, because here's the thing, right?

189
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:39,276
Speaker 0: So you are a pet.

190
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,440
Speaker 0: you own a patent troll company.

191
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,412
Speaker 0: Yes, I buy your company.

192
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:47,874
Speaker 1: Yep, I fire you You buy my company I cash out.

193
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:51,335
Speaker 0: No, the Money is part is the company's money.

194
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,060
Speaker 0: It's not your money.

195
00:12:52,321 --> 00:13:01,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I you know, maybe the board of directors on a patent troll company like that They probably don't even have shareholders or if they do it might be a small number.

196
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,320
Speaker 0: But it's like if you have rim Co and I buy rim Co.

197
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,679
Speaker 0: All right.

198
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,806
Speaker 1: So a million dollars.

199
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,500
Speaker 0: that million dollars is property of rim Co not property of rim.

200
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:09,905
Speaker 0: And then I fire rim.

201
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,610
Speaker 0: now rim is homeless bond Scott.

202
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,072
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

203
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,560
Speaker 1: You're not quite understanding how buying a company works.

204
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:23,379
Speaker 1: Okay, so if I buy a startup company for a million dollars and the money is the mid companies then by your logic I just get that money back and I got the company for free.

205
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:31,053
Speaker 0: Well, no good the money comes back in the company But it goes to the people who you know, who does it go?

206
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:31,314
Speaker 0: to?

207
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:32,560
Speaker 0: the shareholders of rim Co?

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:42,049
Speaker 1: Yeah so rim Co the patent troll is probably just me and I probably only have three employees like a lawyer an Engineer and another lawyer.

209
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,651
Speaker 0: Well, that's you know, I assume that there would be like all you know It would be a publicly traded one because it was private.

210
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:49,076
Speaker 1: So is this company publicly traded?

211
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:49,980
Speaker 1: You can I have right now?

212
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,189
Speaker 1: I have no fucking clue because Even if it is how many shares are there?

213
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,780
Speaker 1: and to what are the shareholders and the board of directors want?

214
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,070
Speaker 1: I mean you could pay out a dividend to all the shareholders and Simultaneously pay a huge bonus to yourself.

215
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't look like it's public.

216
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:03,760
Speaker 1: You know what?

217
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,003
Speaker 0: I can't find it on Google.

218
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,011
Speaker 1: I pay myself a huge bonus and then I quit.

219
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:11,180
Speaker 0: see but what what point can we you know?

220
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,023
Speaker 0: Not pay?

221
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,072
Speaker 0: at what point does the ownership come to me?

222
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:17,692
Speaker 0: so I can not pay you the huge bonus But you have to pay me the huge bonus.

223
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:21,471
Speaker 0: who says I'm the boss I own the company now and what exactly does that mean?

224
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,620
Speaker 1: What's the when's the date of that happening?

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,838
Speaker 1: What contract are you gonna agree to after after you before you get the money?

226
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:31,873
Speaker 1: I'm the boss Because I'm a patent holder my company.

227
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,479
Speaker 1: I have the right to just say you know what?

228
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:38,032
Speaker 1: I don't want to be bought and I'm not gonna license this to you.

229
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,858
Speaker 1: So stop selling your product.

230
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:47,731
Speaker 1: Mmm It's not quite as simple as you think and buying the patent trolls Just makes being a patent troll super awesome.

231
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there has to be a way to just get rid of all of them.

232
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,826
Speaker 0: Yes, there aren't that many there is.

233
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:52,769
Speaker 1: it's a very simple way.

234
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,395
Speaker 1: It's called patent law reform.

235
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:54,777
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:55,600
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's another.

237
00:14:56,162 --> 00:15:02,180
Speaker 0: Unless the thing is I'm basically assuming here right that the government is useless as it's been useless and counterproductive.

238
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:06,657
Speaker 0: So I'm trying to find ways to solve these problems without the government.

239
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:15,826
Speaker 1: wait Hear me out rather than getting all the big companies who are relatively benign and intelligent and large and techy together And shredding the patents.

240
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:31,891
Speaker 1: They should put all of those patents into a consortium Mm-hmm that are basically licensed for free to anyone and set up a system where they will only ever be enforced Against people who file lawsuits against people who join the consortium,

241
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:37,829
Speaker 0: but the thing is those people who are filing lawsuits The patent trolls don't have anything.

242
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,699
Speaker 0: They're not using any patents because they might.

243
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,256
Speaker 1: you know The consortiums are large enough to where there's a good chance.

244
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:51,198
Speaker 1: They are Also, you'd be very likely able to find a similar or almost identical patent in your own portfolio to hit back with.

245
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:56,900
Speaker 1: maybe You could sue them for like using email to serve a notice about a patent.

246
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:18,480
Speaker 1: So this article on slashdot and I don't want to get into all the details of what different states are doing But this is something that's been rumbling for a long long time There and there's a push and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is likely to announce soon Regulation requiring these devices in all cars and having penalties for disabling or removing them.

247
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:30,147
Speaker 1: The device is being black boxes that in the event of a crash or other, you know an Incident where law enforcement gets involved could use a warrant to get the data and analyze as long as they had to use a warrant To get it.

248
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:31,060
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

249
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:37,920
Speaker 1: Let's forget the separate problem that pretty much anything involving technology doesn't need a warrant because our courts and legal system are so fucked.

250
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:42,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, like how they was they ruled that like the FBI doesn't need a warrant to put a tracking device on your car.

251
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's ignore that problem because that's just an old people run Congress problem.

252
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:59,239
Speaker 1: Okay independent of that the idea is that every car has to have a black box not one that phones home one that just records the data and Only keeps data from the moment of an accident back a certain amount of time.

253
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,180
Speaker 1: You know telemetry data whether or not the gas pedal was hit or not?

254
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,459
Speaker 1: How far it was whether or not the brakes were engaged how hard and when?

255
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,724
Speaker 0: Whether or not people.

256
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:11,160
Speaker 0: you gotta put them in police cars, that's definitely a good no question idea.

257
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:22,032
Speaker 1: Yeah so the idea is to make it illegal to remove these devices and to put them in every single car and I am so Absolutely for this that I'm giddy.

258
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:23,138
Speaker 0: It's a great idea.

259
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:31,100
Speaker 1: point the first I Have never caused a traffic accident, but I have been involved in track win one traffic accident.

260
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:38,319
Speaker 1: Actually, I was rear-ended like five times in high school But that was all in the high school parking lot because people would run stop signs behind me while I was stopped at them.

261
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,600
Speaker 1: But I'm confident that if I'm ever driving in my entire life and there are black boxes in the cars I will be able to prove in court that the accident was not my fault.

262
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:52,743
Speaker 1: Yep, - if we can prove that Who is at fault?

263
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:58,940
Speaker 1: We can much better distribute the cost of recovering from traffic accidents, right?

264
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:06,356
Speaker 0: Like if the black, you know right now we already have even without these black boxes Really excellent science to determine who was at fault.

265
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:30,120
Speaker 0: accidents cops there are cops who specialize in this and they go there are detectives and they go down and they measure the skid marks on the Road and they look at the tires on the car Yeah and they look at how much damage is done to the car and nearby objects and they can pretty much 90% like exactly tell you what happened when how fast they were going when they hit the brake where the car what position it Was in when they hit the brake everything and that's without the black box.

266
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,055
Speaker 0: If they had the black box, it's just like boom set in stone.

267
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:34,577
Speaker 0: your fault.

268
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:35,160
Speaker 0: You did it.

269
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,776
Speaker 0: You were you know holding this gas pedal all the way down ignoring the red light.

270
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,689
Speaker 1: So point the third I can't find the article.

271
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,280
Speaker 1: So you'll have to take my word at this, but I'm sure you could find it.

272
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:55,420
Speaker 1: I read an article it was years ago talking about how the vast majority as in the vast majority It was like over 90% of traffic collisions in the US where driver error and nothing else.

273
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,700
Speaker 1: Of course driver error is pretty much the cause of almost every fatality on US highways.

274
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:11,839
Speaker 1: Of course, and if we could prove who was at fault, then we could really in the long run Redistribute the cost of car insurance to the people who are causing the accidents.

275
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,470
Speaker 0: Mmm, I guess yeah.

276
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:16,992
Speaker 0: Yeah.

277
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,960
Speaker 0: The thing is is that really gonna happen though?

278
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,782
Speaker 1: I think it would in the long run.

279
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:29,677
Speaker 1: because so right now let's say I'm involved in accident with you on the freeway and Your fault because there are no There's no like.

280
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:37,977
Speaker 1: like the police can't clearly say who was at fault So they spread the blame 50/50 or 60/40 or something the insurance companies know All right, 60/40 and they base their metrics on that.

281
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,622
Speaker 1: What if the metrics can prove?

282
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:48,370
Speaker 1: Absolutely was rims fault 100% Mmm, then the insurance companies can much more heavily punish me in terms of premiums and not punish you at all.

283
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:49,819
Speaker 0: That'd be fine.

284
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:58,710
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess there's a lot of outrage from techies about this because they're afraid of government tracking and whatever And I don't know.

285
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:06,530
Speaker 1: I'm just generally of the mind that certain kinds of surveillance and telemetry and tracking and things like this are very beneficial.

286
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:23,675
Speaker 1: Not not from the angle of if you got nothing to hide, you know that sort of thing just from the angle of Every envisioning of an altercation I ever see myself engaged in Almost always involved someone else breaking the law or being adversarial or being at fault and me wishing I had some way to prove That fact in the court of law.

287
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,301
Speaker 0: Well, isn't that exactly?

288
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:29,598
Speaker 0: if you had nothing to hide you're basically saying I'm rim I'm not breaking the law so I don't have anything to hide.

289
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,982
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is that because I have nothing to hide I Personally will make gather all this data and make it available.

290
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:42,785
Speaker 1: if I was arrested for some sort of crime I would do anything to make sure like all that Google latitude data was in court for people to see.

291
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure Unless I did it.

292
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:59,025
Speaker 1: But especially because the people who are so worried about this they seem to think that the police are gonna start pulling you over and then Like checking the data to see if you were speeding earlier in the day.

293
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:11,227
Speaker 1: Well, if you're black Or like a lot of people to this day claim that if you have an easy pass They will send you speeding tickets in the mail, which as far as I know has never happened.

294
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:11,990
Speaker 0: They've never done that.

295
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,781
Speaker 0: They'll send you drove through the toll booth without paying.

296
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,870
Speaker 1: they'll also send you sped through the toll booth.

297
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go through the toll booth at 80 miles an hour.

298
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,787
Speaker 1: They're gonna send you a ticket for endangering the toll booth personnel.

299
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:26,140
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, I'm for this.

300
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,050
Speaker 1: I see no reason not to do it.

301
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:37,630
Speaker 1: So long as one you need a warrant to get the data unless the driver gives it up willingly Yep, and two they're not accessible from the outside.

302
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,410
Speaker 1: They're a physical device that has to be accessed physically.

303
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But what?

304
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,315
Speaker 0: what keeps me from?

305
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:48,652
Speaker 0: it has to also be secure enough so that the owner of the car can't tamper with it and modify The data.

306
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:49,857
Speaker 1: Well, luckily that would be.

307
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:56,750
Speaker 1: it'd be pretty easy to make something like that and to Having the laws such that I don't understand how it could be easy to do.

308
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,000
Speaker 0: I mean, so it's how is it gonna check?

309
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,129
Speaker 0: for example, how would it check the speed of the car?

310
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:03,863
Speaker 1: How did cars currently check the speed?

311
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:04,769
Speaker 1: You know how any of that works?

312
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, it knows how.

313
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,043
Speaker 0: how the dam the circumference of the wheels.

314
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:11,813
Speaker 0: that's not how it does it and it knows how many times the Axis rotates.

315
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:26,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, so one if you modify your car most likely from these articles There'll be laws saying that modifications to cars that would affect the telemetry gathering Have to also make sure that they update the telemetry gathering system properly and legally, right?

316
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,670
Speaker 0: You're basically if the day there's no physical way to stop me from fucking with it.

317
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:39,810
Speaker 1: Well from the data itself the black box It's really easy to make a physical device that if you mess with it It just it somehow notes that I've been messed with and nothing more.

318
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,785
Speaker 0: No, but for example, right so it has some wires coming out of it.

319
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:43,830
Speaker 0: They connect to the speedometer.

320
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:48,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can just cut those wires and attach them to a phony spin a thing that simulates the speedometer.

321
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:50,430
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's always going to speed.

322
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:57,410
Speaker 1: So in the investigation, you know You're in an accident or the police subpoena the data they physically go to get it and they discover the evidence of this tamper.

323
00:22:57,571 --> 00:23:00,509
Speaker 0: I would obviously fix it before the cops got there.

324
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're in an accident and then you fix it right there.

325
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:08,067
Speaker 0: No more like, you know, it would obviously be some sort of clever system right.

326
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:14,068
Speaker 0: for example Something I could plug in really quickly push a button and it would record it.

327
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,990
Speaker 0: would you know Re-record a whole bunch of speedometer data and then I would unplug it and throw it in the woods.

328
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,689
Speaker 1: So you're I'm dubious that you'd actually be able to set up something like that.

329
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:25,410
Speaker 0: I don't see how you could stop me from doing something like that.

330
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,970
Speaker 1: I don't think you could set one up that wouldn't be pretty eminently detectable from the extant evidence on the scene of a crime for example.

331
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,572
Speaker 0: I don't know.

332
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:39,076
Speaker 1: also by making it a crime to modify the device and Basically like making that illegal.

333
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,490
Speaker 0: the thing is you basically even if even if it was detectable, right?

334
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:47,930
Speaker 0: I can make it pretty hidden Like I could hide it behind like the the numbers on the speedometer or something like that, right?

335
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,889
Speaker 0: So the cops would then be forced to like really take apart every piece of the car, you know to make sure.

336
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,926
Speaker 1: It only matters if you're involved in a case where it did matter.

337
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:02,270
Speaker 1: and now you've got intent You've got all this kind of premeditation.

338
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,030
Speaker 1: So if you're caught for example, that is a much more serious crime than simply having broken the black.

339
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:09,817
Speaker 0: But you're assuming if I'm caught this.

340
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:10,600
Speaker 0: I'm so clever.

341
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,945
Speaker 0: I'm actually I get off the hook.

342
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're a hundred percent.

343
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,536
Speaker 1: So so let's put it this way.

344
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:23,338
Speaker 1: then one if your readings don't match up with what is seen in the other cars readings That's already a red flag.

345
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,191
Speaker 1: the other car your car says I only drove 30.

346
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:26,915
Speaker 0: Reasonable doubt.

347
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:28,866
Speaker 0: the other car was the one that tampered with the data.

348
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:32,281
Speaker 1: actually no It's probably not because you can't because remember what.

349
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,570
Speaker 1: you remember those detectives you talked about who are so good.

350
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,167
Speaker 1: So they investigate the scene, huh?

351
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,370
Speaker 1: Scott's box says that he'd never exceeded 31 miles per hour and yet his tires were worn bald and melted slightly.

352
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:46,628
Speaker 1: And look at these skid marks.

353
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:51,670
Speaker 1: Oh and the other car matches perfectly with the extent data.

354
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,517
Speaker 0: I could fuck with both cars.

355
00:24:54,638 --> 00:25:00,330
Speaker 1: my easier argument that I was avoiding until now Is that if you're going to argue that we shouldn't do some sort of forensic technique?

356
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:08,237
Speaker 1: Because our really clever criminal might get out of it so much for our entire legal system I'm just saying is that they would.

357
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:11,972
Speaker 0: I would be I would sell some sort of Devices.

358
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:19,030
Speaker 1: we're gonna sell this online where the government can see it and then one no Buy your device and see how it works and know what to look for the same place.

359
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,296
Speaker 0: They sell radar detectors and shit.

360
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,220
Speaker 1: yeah radar detectors.

361
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,250
Speaker 1: the police know exactly how radar detectors work.

362
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,615
Speaker 1: I know and you know what.

363
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,246
Speaker 1: they don't that well because everyone uses lidar.

364
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:28,270
Speaker 0: radar detectors are shit.

365
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,170
Speaker 0: But the point is that people buy radar detectors anyway, so people would buy my black box tamper.

366
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:36,103
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't want to help the people you just want to make money.

367
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:39,676
Speaker 0: No the people causing accidents I don't actually want to help them unless they're me.

368
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:43,610
Speaker 0: I just wanted to take their money by selling them hacking devices.

369
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:54,266
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day.

370
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,170
Speaker 0: I do.

371
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,580
Speaker 0: I got this this it's a it's an advertisement.

372
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,765
Speaker 0: Well actually it's a movie trailer.

373
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:00,191
Speaker 0: Which is the same thing as an advertise.

374
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,460
Speaker 0: really yeah green really?

375
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:03,546
Speaker 0: So it's.

376
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:04,880
Speaker 0: it's a romantic comedy movie.

377
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,769
Speaker 0: But actually you know like there's probably not any romantic comedies that I could think of that I actually care about.

378
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:13,340
Speaker 1: can you even name a rom-com?

379
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,320
Speaker 1: This one name another one.

380
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:21,180
Speaker 1: Nah you can't even name a single movie that you would call a romantic comedy.

381
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,606
Speaker 0: Not one I mean you.

382
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,636
Speaker 0: maybe you could mention the movie and I could tell you whether it was or wasn't.

383
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,020
Speaker 1: would you consider say?

384
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,679
Speaker 1: Pretty woman a romantic comedy, or is that something else?

385
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,976
Speaker 0: Maybe have you ever seen pretty woman mm-hmm most of it.

386
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:35,920
Speaker 1: Do you know what it's about?

387
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,822
Speaker 0: horn Good.

388
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:41,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, technically yeah, all right all right.

389
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:48,564
Speaker 1: So Scott you're telling me that you think this movie a Romantic comedy.

390
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:53,140
Speaker 1: I see a poster of a guy and a girl like walking through a forest.

391
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:54,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's called.

392
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:59,080
Speaker 0: It's called dream with envy, but the trailer I guarantee you know it's like normally.

393
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:01,691
Speaker 0: You know you see trailers for these movies, and you're like whatever.

394
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,860
Speaker 0: the trailer for this movie is so great.

395
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:13,600
Speaker 0: It is so absolutely amazing that it will convince you to watch this movie Even if you are kind of like me and or like would never even consider watching it based on the poster.

396
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,149
Speaker 1: God forgets girls anniversary.

397
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,635
Speaker 1: That's the plot the trailer.

398
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:18,940
Speaker 1: I'm reading the synopsis right now.

399
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,339
Speaker 0: I guess girls anniversary.

400
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,517
Speaker 0: I guarantee you that the trailer to this movie will make you want to watch the movie.

401
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:29,579
Speaker 0: a hundred percent Guarantee if you trust me on ponies you have to trust me on this movie.

402
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:36,965
Speaker 1: I Have seen the trailer, and I kind of do want to see the movie, but well, we'll see.

403
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,293
Speaker 1: we'll see what you guys think This is.

404
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,399
Speaker 1: this is an experiment.

405
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:42,409
Speaker 1: We'll see what people have to say about that.

406
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:47,346
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is a man that Scott probably has never heard of.

407
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:48,169
Speaker 0: I know who it is.

408
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,999
Speaker 1: Do you know what is George Takei famous for Star Trek?

409
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,143
Speaker 1: Oh wow really?

410
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:52,625
Speaker 1: I don't.

411
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:54,090
Speaker 1: so who'd he play in Star Trek?

412
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,623
Speaker 0: The Asian guy with the blue uniform.

413
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:58,568
Speaker 1: Do you know the guy's name?

414
00:27:58,588 --> 00:27:58,629
Speaker 1: or?

415
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,874
Speaker 0: What is George Takei?

416
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:01,857
Speaker 1: or what is what?

417
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:04,726
Speaker 1: what his position was on the bridge token Asian guy?

418
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:05,829
Speaker 1: was he even on the bridge?

419
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:11,039
Speaker 0: Duh George Washington bridge which Star Trek is he from?

420
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,635
Speaker 1: the first one the first one the first first one the oldest Possible one you're sure.

421
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:17,738
Speaker 0: I'm guessing.

422
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:28,531
Speaker 1: yeah, okay anyway, so George Takei is Pretty famous for being a gay activist among other things you know actor and whatnot also being gay and for being Cuz.

423
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:32,630
Speaker 1: you could be a gay activist without being gay for being a generally funny, dude.

424
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,921
Speaker 1: And he is you know he's also got.

425
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,630
Speaker 0: he also has like the bestest voice.

426
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,013
Speaker 1: He has a really good radio voice And he it's.

427
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:39,516
Speaker 0: he's like.

428
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:42,250
Speaker 0: he's just like Peter Fernandez where he still has it even though he's old yep.

429
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,988
Speaker 1: And he has the radio voice even when he's not radio.

430
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:45,289
Speaker 1: miked.

431
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:49,343
Speaker 1: I mean Scott and I could have radio voices on geek nights, but in real life.

432
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:56,968
Speaker 1: We don't have radio voices and even in geek nights We don't really have radio voices cuz we don't really like work at doing the microphone technique Just because it's pain in the ass to do that.

433
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,844
Speaker 1: but he really in real life sounds like that.

434
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:15,370
Speaker 1: and Basically Tennessee if you couldn't you know guess wasn't a state that may be a little bit homophobic And they tried to pass a law that basically well They are passing a law that doesn't let you talk about gayness in schools, okay?

435
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,729
Speaker 0: What if you need to talk about history and there happens to be gayness in the history can't bring it up?

436
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,210
Speaker 0: What if it's part of the curriculum?

437
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,910
Speaker 0: Can't be part of the curriculum whether there's a national standardized test that asks about that history that involves gayness?

438
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:33,210
Speaker 1: Oh, are you implying that perhaps students in Tennessee are not getting the best education compared to people in other states?

439
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,215
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm implying.

440
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,883
Speaker 0: I'm straight-up saying so.

441
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:43,207
Speaker 1: George Takei is Basically campaigning against this and other things like it on the internet very funnily and I highly recommend you.

442
00:29:43,227 --> 00:29:45,113
Speaker 0: just it's hard to take It seriously.

443
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:49,130
Speaker 1: seek out YouTube videos and things related to George Takei because he's a pretty cool guy.

444
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,537
Speaker 1: To quote Wikipedia about him.

445
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:57,877
Speaker 1: in November 2010 George Takei released a PSA blasting former Arkansas school board member Clint McCants.

446
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:05,695
Speaker 1: in the video Takei repeatedly called mr.. McClants quotes a douchebag And it it's good stuff.

447
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,420
Speaker 1: George Takei is a pretty cool.

448
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:07,741
Speaker 1: Dude.

449
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:16,730
Speaker 1: Maybe not as cool as the four horsemen, but So in the meta moment frosted tips and visors aside the book club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

450
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:17,999
Speaker 1: We'll get to it when we get to it.

451
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:19,490
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX Prime.

452
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,359
Speaker 1: We might be a PAX dev doing a bunch of stuff.

453
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,430
Speaker 0: Kinetic on Kinetic on is upcoming.

454
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,050
Speaker 1: It's pretty much mostly too late for you to submit your panels.

455
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,037
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm in the midst of scheduling them.

456
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,686
Speaker 0: nerd NYC recesses on Saturday, June 18th.

457
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:37,027
Speaker 0: Yep Saturday June 25th and 26 is game hack day in New York City.

458
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:37,610
Speaker 0: How you like that?

459
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:38,972
Speaker 1: Oh, I was.

460
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:39,454
Speaker 1: you have any.

461
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,805
Speaker 0: if you have any game programming or hacking skills.

462
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:42,970
Speaker 0: You should be interested.

463
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:44,735
Speaker 1: So what do you do with this event?

464
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:48,286
Speaker 0: hex games and it's basically the way hack days tend to work.

465
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:48,848
Speaker 0: is you?

466
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:56,030
Speaker 0: you show up And maybe you have a team And you make a hack you make something and then the day two is usually presenting.

467
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,981
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and that's that's how the hack days tend to be structured.

468
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:15,736
Speaker 0: Usually they're things where You know VCS come like this weekend competing with bar camp There was like tech crunch disrupt hack day And you know it's basically the VCS want you to make something so they can see if someone makes the best stuff and then they can try to convince them to Start up crap.

469
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:23,070
Speaker 0: right, but it is game hack day So I imagine it will be less of that kind of bullshit and more making cool games that are quirky and awesome.

470
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:27,603
Speaker 1: And of course follow us on Twitter join the forum go to the website forums.

471
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:28,064
Speaker 1: Awesome.

472
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,187
Speaker 1: People are hanging out in there.

473
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:32,232
Speaker 0: Yep Not much of the other meta going on.

474
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:32,733
Speaker 0: Not really.

475
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:33,894
Speaker 0: It's slow meta times.

476
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,778
Speaker 1: So this week instead of doing work.

477
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,107
Speaker 1: I'm Taking a Python boot camp for the week.

478
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:43,715
Speaker 1: All right, it's actually pretty good.

479
00:31:44,397 --> 00:31:45,200
Speaker 0: Have you learned anything?

480
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,009
Speaker 1: I've learned a lot of Python.

481
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,934
Speaker 0: Do any skills?

482
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:49,000
Speaker 1: I'm getting there.

483
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,869
Speaker 1: I actually already in the course of the class.

484
00:31:50,909 --> 00:32:04,804
Speaker 1: just you know, because there's a lot of free time during classes I wrote a pretty simple rules engine this multi-threaded app That'll take SNMP traps in and send formatted emails out based on set of arbitrary rules And I'm working on a web interface for that thing now.

485
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:05,586
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

486
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:08,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really easy to program.

487
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:09,115
Speaker 0: Is it done?

488
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,819
Speaker 1: Well, it's done.

489
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,465
Speaker 1: Okay I'm not a great coder.

490
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:18,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is it's like if you really what if anyone out there actually wants to learn Python You can just take.

491
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:23,525
Speaker 0: I was telling some people this today and I've told other people in the past you can just take Classes online for free.

492
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:32,253
Speaker 0: Well, you can go to MIT open courseware and take CS 101 at MIT Which happens to involve Python and you'll learn a whole lot.

493
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:38,800
Speaker 0: if you take that class and you know all the material from that Class, you know more than most people who actually are hired as programmers.

494
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,413
Speaker 0: Only that's only CS 101 at MIT.

495
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,820
Speaker 0: So if you actually go to MIT you get three more years of that which is one two, three four five six seven more semesters.

496
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,420
Speaker 0: You know what else you can do 1/8 of the MIT education.

497
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,440
Speaker 1: You can buy an O'Reilly book and read it and do the stuff in it and learn Python.

498
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, then you just learn a language, right?

499
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:05,640
Speaker 1: It depends, for example the learning Python book which they sent me a copy of just in course the training so I have it.

500
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:11,167
Speaker 1: I was reading it Actually does teach concepts More than it teaches language.

501
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:13,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the CS 101 at MIT is gonna teach you, you know.

502
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:30,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I guess the O'Reilly book is more for someone really who already knows Programming concepts just needs to learn the language or isn't great at programming but already know like as long as you know Like what objects are and inheritance and like the basic concepts of programming?

503
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:47,389
Speaker 1: but the point is what bothers me is that Most training like for example this class I'm taking it and I'm you know I'm Fixing all my Python knowledge like I'm filling in all the holes that I had because I kind of just learned it ad hoc as I Had to write stuff out of necessity in the course of my life.

504
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,017
Speaker 1: The only language I knew really well was let's see Perl because I had to use it a lot of work.

505
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,189
Speaker 1: bash Yeah bash because I had more than anything said.

506
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,798
Speaker 1: an awk because I use those almost more than anything except bash.

507
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,872
Speaker 1: and Basic because that was the working language in the IT department.

508
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:07,917
Speaker 1: basic is so brain-dead anyone can do it I know and C sharp because I had to write a bunch of soap services.

509
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:12,797
Speaker 1: So Python was kind of on the back burner, even though it's actually my preferred language.

510
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,275
Speaker 1: Like I like it I enjoy using it more than every other language.

511
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:15,538
Speaker 1: I know.

512
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,714
Speaker 1: Yet I wasn't that good at it because I don't get a chance to use it that often.

513
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,159
Speaker 1: so I wanted to learn it better.

514
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:27,420
Speaker 1: I could have just spent a week Coding stuff and read through O'Reilly books and I would have learned the same stuff.

515
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,320
Speaker 0: You could have spent I don't know how many how many lectures there are in the MIT open course.

516
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:44,181
Speaker 0: we could have done to a day and then done the you know, the Done the lessons involved and taking the tests and then in cut in the time in between those lessons Just worked on a project using the knowledge You just learned.

517
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:50,184
Speaker 1: so the trouble is it is very difficult in the modern world Especially in the US.

518
00:34:50,364 --> 00:35:02,425
Speaker 1: if you work for a company and they want you to learn a skill for the company For them to agree to say all right take a week off and we'll pay you and learn it or Come into the office for a week.

519
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,653
Speaker 1: Don't do your normal work and learn this thing.

520
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,720
Speaker 1: very few companies let people do that.

521
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,400
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason is is that you know, we are self learners, right?

522
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,618
Speaker 0: I can just learn something, you know, and the other thing is right.

523
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:18,136
Speaker 0: Why do you even need to take time off the job to learn a thing?

524
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:18,397
Speaker 0: Right?

525
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:24,400
Speaker 1: So for example Here's the good example in my job For example, their production thing could happen and I'm the senior engineer.

526
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:27,600
Speaker 1: So if there's a serious problem, they would want to get me involved.

527
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:33,280
Speaker 1: So if I'm in the office very often, whatever I'm learning or working on will be interrupted several times per day.

528
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,324
Speaker 0: No, that's not what I'm asking.

529
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,748
Speaker 0: What I'm asking is right.

530
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:39,642
Speaker 0: so I needed I was doing a job once right and I need to do Some Ruby.

531
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:43,520
Speaker 0: so it's not like I stopped to learn Ruby or I went to Ruby training.

532
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,506
Speaker 0: I just was.

533
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,479
Speaker 0: I. I was needed to do this work.

534
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:52,085
Speaker 0: So I started doing the work and learn the Ruby simultaneous to doing the thing I needed to learn Ruby for.

535
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,530
Speaker 1: Ah, you want to know why?

536
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 0: If you need Python for something at work Just start working on that thing and learn the Python as you do the thing.

537
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,467
Speaker 1: No, because Scott you want to know why?

538
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:05,600
Speaker 1: Unless you're actually a developer in a large company Like you're actually like your job is developer.

539
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:13,480
Speaker 1: No one ever budgets time to even make stuff with any reasonable amount of time to make stuff let alone learn stuff.

540
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:23,620
Speaker 1: So say you have to be learning is simultaneous at the making now because say you have to make a thing they'll budget it Assuming that you'll make it immediately and quickly with tools you already have.

541
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,763
Speaker 1: So as a result like say I could like and say there's a huge thing I got to do.

542
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:28,770
Speaker 1: I got to parse a bunch of data.

543
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:36,371
Speaker 1: I could do it shoddily and bash really quickly But I could do it much better and make an extensible thing.

544
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,800
Speaker 1: that would then be very useful down the road in Python.

545
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:46,700
Speaker 1: But if I'm not super up on my Python it would take me maybe an extra day's worth of work to do it in Python Because I'd have to reference a lot of materials.

546
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,970
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't need to look anything up.

547
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,015
Speaker 1: if I'm writing a giant bash script I have to occasionally look things up when I'm working in Python.

548
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:52,980
Speaker 1: Like how's that module work?

549
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,008
Speaker 0: I have to look things up no matter what I'm using.

550
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I have to look things up more.

551
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:57,420
Speaker 1: I'm slower.

552
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:59,991
Speaker 1: I'll forget like all right the iter items.

553
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,939
Speaker 1: That's how you go through a dictionary and stuff like that.

554
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:17,222
Speaker 1: so as a result very rarely do you have the opportunity to do anything where you'll also learn because By nature learning and doing at the same time is slightly slower Than doing shiddily with something you already know, even if what you do ends up being a worse thing Mm-hmm.

555
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:24,334
Speaker 1: So unless you're a developer most companies will really never actually give you the opportunity To learn anything for real.

556
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:32,099
Speaker 1: also I will argue that if you learn only by doing like oh, you've got to do that Like, uh, there's an example from my job.

557
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:41,056
Speaker 1: there's a guy and we have to make a thing like a script basically and Say this guy does it in Perl or Python, which he doesn't know.

558
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:46,395
Speaker 1: and alright He'll learn Perl or Python as he's making the thing, you know, he'll make the thing.

559
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:47,820
Speaker 1: He'll learn the language at the same time.

560
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,523
Speaker 1: yep, as a result what comes out is Very poorly written.

561
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, and doesn't work that well and crashes.

562
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:57,393
Speaker 0: Does it get the job done?

563
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:58,215
Speaker 1: Barely.

564
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it satisfactory?

565
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
Speaker 0: Does it meet the requirement?

566
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:05,160
Speaker 1: Yes, except that no one else could ever interface with it when I looked at it.

567
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,980
Speaker 0: But is that is interfacing with a part of the requirement?

568
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,400
Speaker 1: I hope he doesn't listen to this show, but is interfacing with it part of the requirement?

569
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:16,871
Speaker 1: Well, no, they don't write requirement documents because people aren't Scott in the real world unless you're a developer.

570
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,499
Speaker 1: Nobody ever gives you a requirements.

571
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,865
Speaker 0: now I'm not saying does it meet?

572
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:21,351
Speaker 0: and that doesn't have to be a document.

573
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,154
Speaker 0: No, there's still.

574
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,967
Speaker 1: there's an unwritten requirement Yes, but the unwritten requirements are.

575
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,457
Speaker 1: it did the job and not things like without crashing or really?

576
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,966
Speaker 0: That's not part of the unwritten requirement.

577
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,073
Speaker 0: not crashing because I'm pretty in my in my eyes.

578
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,340
Speaker 0: not crashing as part of the unwritten requirement?

579
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because if it crashes you fail.

580
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:51,140
Speaker 1: That's what happens when a non developer who doesn't know object oriented principles and doesn't really know programming languages is writing something in Perl And basically, wow, you're iterating through like ten nested arrays.

581
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:53,807
Speaker 0: Okay, welcome here.

582
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,011
Speaker 1: Here's a data dictionary.

583
00:38:55,072 --> 00:39:19,992
Speaker 1: do it that way instead, but basically If people who learn by doing who don't already know all the fundamentals will often learn very bad habits by taking a class or by training as you know, like budgeting in a project like alright a week of like a Django boot camp and then beginning the requirements building for this Django website The company has to build it's probably gonna be more fruitful for a group of developers.

584
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,507
Speaker 1: then build this and learn it all at the same time.

585
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:24,824
Speaker 0: Now here's the other thing right.

586
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:31,957
Speaker 0: if you know training is all you really need to go from don't know what to do to be Able to do to the work right and how long is the training?

587
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:32,219
Speaker 0: a week?

588
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:41,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a boot camp that basically is aimed at alright You're already a programmer and then in the by the end of this week, you will be a pretty average Python developer.

589
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,899
Speaker 0: So why the fuck does anyone need to go to school for four years if they can go to boot camp for a week?

590
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:57,280
Speaker 1: You want to know why because in in these training things like this at least all the enterprise ones I've been to that are about programming languages They assume that you already know all the fundamentals of computer science.

591
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:04,380
Speaker 1: If you don't know about like iterations and flow control and data structures and all that stuff you're fucked.

592
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:08,260
Speaker 0: But couldn't they then teach you that in a one-week boot camp as well?

593
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,022
Speaker 0: I don't know.

594
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:12,253
Speaker 0: you could learn that in less than four years enough to take the thing.

595
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:12,835
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

596
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, you probably could.

597
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:16,740
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, what's the point?

598
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:24,020
Speaker 0: You know if people can just if training is enough for companies to be willing to let you do something then why do they?

599
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,027
Speaker 0: You know, what was the four years of college?

600
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:26,468
Speaker 1: It's got.

601
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,352
Speaker 1: why'd you go to our IT?

602
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,740
Speaker 0: for the reasons besides education?

603
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I went to our IT.

604
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's the real benefits of college.

605
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:35,871
Speaker 1: You have access to the stuff to the materials.

606
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,699
Speaker 1: You need to actually learn if you want to learn.

607
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:48,937
Speaker 1: You meet all the people who will eventually get you jobs and you get a piece of paper and you have your fun And you have and there's actually, you know, there are chances to become a professor.

608
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:49,981
Speaker 0: or you know Do?

609
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:54,520
Speaker 0: there are certain things that you can't do without the advanced learning of the college.

610
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,380
Speaker 0: But if you if you want to do those things, well, you know like be a doctor.

611
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:17,813
Speaker 1: let's narrow the discussion a little bit because basically When you think of corporate training like training like alright, I work here I'm going to technology training for a week or two to learn X or learn Y. or you know Very rarely are classes like that Fundamentals like learn object-oriented programming or learn conceptual design.

612
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,234
Speaker 1: They're always.

613
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:18,716
Speaker 1: they're always.

614
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:29,999
Speaker 1: learn this specific product Yep, or learn this specific Acronym learn this tool and I think the the understanding is that in the industry you should already know the fundamentals you.

615
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:34,220
Speaker 1: This is kind of training like alright, you need to learn this specific thing quickly.

616
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,853
Speaker 1: We're gonna teach you the best practices and then you'll be good to go.

617
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,979
Speaker 1: You won't learn bad practices You won't go off in the wrong direction.

618
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:59,040
Speaker 1: But really I'm starting to feel pretty strongly that the majority of corporate style IT training is Bullshit, no It's only there because companies aren't willing to budget the time or trust their employees to learn on their own to learn stuff.

619
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:02,833
Speaker 0: Well, I think this is training Me this.

620
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:13,818
Speaker 1: if they've just said if they just said Alright, you don't have to work on anything, but learning Python really well and writing some apps this week I would have gotten the same out of it as this multi-thousand-dollar course.

621
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:18,740
Speaker 0: We both know that either one of us can learn on our own if we want to right everyone.

622
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,312
Speaker 0: I know other people.

623
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:21,360
Speaker 0: can they do so?

624
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,858
Speaker 0: Would you trust some strange guy that you hired that you only know through work and you've only got one ago?

625
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:33,896
Speaker 1: I would not hire someone that I would not trust to learn on their own unless they were doing menial work in which case I Would never let them get training.

626
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:39,140
Speaker 1: Because the thing is it's funny if you actually go to these training things.

627
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,159
Speaker 1: Have you ever gone to like?

628
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,460
Speaker 1: Corporate like a week or two training like out and not a week or two.

629
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,380
Speaker 0: But I've gone to you know, like individual one-day classes things and they were always boring and useless.

630
00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:54,456
Speaker 1: so in those cases How many of the people who are in the class with you clearly didn't want to be there and weren't?

631
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:56,389
Speaker 1: they were just surfing the net The whole time and not paying attention.

632
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,357
Speaker 0: the vast majority.

633
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:07,019
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so if you give someone if you let someone come into the office and learn on their own It's a lot easier to kind of notice if they're actually learning or not.

634
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:16,652
Speaker 1: Then if you send them flying off to Vegas for a week to go to a class where you can't keep an eye on them And that cost thousands of dollars more and probably has the same effect nothing.

635
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:19,582
Speaker 1: I Just I'm.

636
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,198
Speaker 1: I'm kind of sick of corporate training as a thing.

637
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:27,360
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there are times when corporate training could be the real deal, right?

638
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:42,400
Speaker 0: I mean it depends on exactly what you're being trained in like let's say, you know Like you go work at a job and and there's a machine involved and it's a very, you know Specific machine like some sort of manufacturing robot or something like that and it's got all sorts of crazy controls.

639
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:44,467
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna pay fucking attention.

640
00:43:44,507 --> 00:43:48,120
Speaker 0: that training so the robot doesn't like rip your arm off true, right?

641
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
Speaker 1: You know at the same time that's operational training as opposed to development training.

642
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,780
Speaker 1: There are very different things you think is different.

643
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:55,783
Speaker 1: Yeah like for example.

644
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:56,867
Speaker 1: think here's the difference between.

645
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:03,269
Speaker 1: there's training like say that you want to teach someone how to Manage a clustered Linux environment.

646
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,000
Speaker 1: That's very different from teaching someone how to design a clustered Linux environment.

647
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:08,743
Speaker 1: I mean it.

648
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:10,168
Speaker 1: they're very different skill sets.

649
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:11,312
Speaker 0: That's true.

650
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,500
Speaker 1: So that's like or a factory.

651
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:23,675
Speaker 1: It's very different to teach someone how to operate the machine that pushes the widget in Versus troubleshoot the machine that pushes the widget in or build the machine that pushes the which.

652
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:29,096
Speaker 0: but usually there would be like You know a document that tells you how to troubleshoot the machine like you get a copy machine and it's like it.

653
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,645
Speaker 0: did this error Appear look at find it in this book.

654
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,932
Speaker 0: follow these instructions, you know, what happened?

655
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:34,895
Speaker 0: my turn to this page.

656
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:35,677
Speaker 0: follow these instructions.

657
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:48,820
Speaker 1: my experience In all my years of enterprise IT that instruction book for every printer in the world says the following Stand around looking at it poke at it a few times call the company and pay them to have someone come in and fix it.

658
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,807
Speaker 0: No, it's already already.

659
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:52,128
Speaker 0: Don't forget.

660
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:53,313
Speaker 1: Don't forget the very important step.

661
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:59,271
Speaker 1: roll it out and look at the back Ineffectually for like 10 minutes already paid for the service contract.

662
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:01,457
Speaker 0: So call them without even poking it at all.

663
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:04,206
Speaker 1: Yep That's a separate thing.

664
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,840
Speaker 1: nobody in the goddamn world knows how to use their fancy printers.

665
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,746
Speaker 0: But like if I was a company I would actually just buy those fancy printers straight up instead of getting there Easy to administer.

666
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,779
Speaker 0: Yeah and fix and plus I'd buy the high-quality ones.

667
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they're great, but no one knows how to use them.

668
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,457
Speaker 1: I mean I print stuff double-sided.

669
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,657
Speaker 0: It's like wizardry colors double-side folding binding.

670
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:26,985
Speaker 0: Oh Collating and sorting.

671
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:29,838
Speaker 1: actually ours doesn't collate or staple or any of that stuff.

672
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,695
Speaker 0: Yeah We don't really need any of that cuz I don't print.

673
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:31,816
Speaker 1: that.

674
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:37,683
Speaker 1: in fact The only time I print is stupid like metric reports for people that I don't really care about I don't have.

675
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:39,069
Speaker 1: my job became crystal reports.

676
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:39,812
Speaker 0: I don't print.

677
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:46,840
Speaker 0: I Wouldn't print if I didn't have to generate crystal reports for people and they need him print it out that you get his email them.

678
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get.

679
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:51,860
Speaker 0: why don't they get some crystal reports training and then they could do it themselves?

680
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, they want.

681
00:45:53,445 --> 00:45:56,035
Speaker 1: I wanted crystal reports training, but they didn't give it to me.

682
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:57,664
Speaker 1: So I just Did it.

683
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,379
Speaker 1: I just learned how to use it cuz it's not that hard.

684
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,074
Speaker 0: You just learned how to use it on your own.

685
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:05,067
Speaker 1: That's impossible Ah, but it took like four hours to make reports.

686
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:06,551
Speaker 0: cuz crystal report sucks.

687
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:09,359
Speaker 1: No, but I can't think of a better tool SQL.

688
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna make pretty fancy multi-dimensional graphs that actually do show data correlations just with SQL.

689
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,888
Speaker 0: well No, I do the SQL.

690
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:24,953
Speaker 0: then I would take the data that came from the query Yeah into the Excel and then use that to make the fancy charts.

691
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:26,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, Excel makes shit charts.

692
00:46:26,802 --> 00:46:28,878
Speaker 1: No, you think so and for that kind of stuff.

693
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,173
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll show you one of my charts.

694
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:31,940
Speaker 1: I'll show you what I did.

695
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,804
Speaker 1: They're actually pretty good.

696
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:34,190
Speaker 1: But that's that's a separate discussion.

697
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,340
Speaker 1: We should do a show on like data mining.

698
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,169
Speaker 0: I think I don't know enough about data.

699
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:47,195
Speaker 1: my really I do a lot of data mining Anyway, but I think you can actually split corporate training into you know, forget operational or whatever.

700
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:56,826
Speaker 1: the real classes of it I think are classes that teach someone who already knows basic IT skills or CS skills a Specific tool to do something like.

701
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:58,391
Speaker 1: you're already an IT guy.

702
00:46:58,631 --> 00:47:00,076
Speaker 1: Here's how to use red hat clustering.

703
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,422
Speaker 1: Here's how to use the RBD Mm-hmm.

704
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:04,212
Speaker 1: I think that kind of training is actually really useful.

705
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,720
Speaker 0: I could use that the RBD trading.

706
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:06,880
Speaker 1: I did a class on that.

707
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,319
Speaker 1: We had a guy come in and teach us postgres and the RBD together like how to do that.

708
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:16,220
Speaker 1: It was very focused and everyone knew what they were doing was like, alright, you want to do something like this?

709
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,147
Speaker 1: Here's exactly how to do it how it works how to troubleshoot it.

710
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:20,109
Speaker 1: We're done.

711
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:20,871
Speaker 1: got any questions.

712
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:27,819
Speaker 0: I Once that was like, you know, there's a new version of X coming out.

713
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:30,230
Speaker 0: Here are the things that have changed in this new version.

714
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,896
Speaker 0: right good what?

715
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:32,760
Speaker 0: and any questions?

716
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,840
Speaker 0: And by the way, I'm the guy who made this thing.

717
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:38,831
Speaker 1: But then there are the enterprise tool classes like.

718
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,440
Speaker 1: you bought this fancy enterprise monitoring system.

719
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,387
Speaker 1: Here is the training that you bought.

720
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:47,328
Speaker 1: that cost like ten thousand dollars to teach three of your employees how to use this piece of shit.

721
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,965
Speaker 1: Every kind of training like that.

722
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:54,140
Speaker 1: I've ever been to in all my years of IT has been absolutely worthless.

723
00:47:54,603 --> 00:48:00,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wish there was a way to like, you know Figure out before you get the training like if it's worthless or not.

724
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:02,540
Speaker 1: I think it's really easy case in point.

725
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,543
Speaker 1: Here's this how I do it.

726
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:04,947
Speaker 1: one is the training.

727
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:07,134
Speaker 0: it is a training review site or something like that.

728
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:10,868
Speaker 1: is the training for a Proprietary enterprise product?

729
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:12,498
Speaker 1: if yes training will be stupid.

730
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,130
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that is without exception.

731
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,020
Speaker 0: But the thing is a prize or enterprise product.

732
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,753
Speaker 0: How can you learn how to use it without the training?

733
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,262
Speaker 1: It's not like yeah And you know what the answer is.

734
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,746
Speaker 1: nobody knows how to use it not even the trainer.

735
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,150
Speaker 1: no no no I went to.

736
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,764
Speaker 1: So service desk Express put up by BMC.

737
00:48:30,804 --> 00:48:38,039
Speaker 1: I'll call out their stupid names because whatever I hate them so much is possibly one of the worst ticketing systems in the world.

738
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,870
Speaker 1: and The training basically the manuals useless.

739
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,960
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually tell you how to use the product like half the stuff.

740
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:50,440
Speaker 1: It tells you oh Here's how to do this won't actually work on any scale and it's inconsistent and things just don't work the way you expect.

741
00:48:50,902 --> 00:49:03,520
Speaker 1: So you have to take training to learn how to use the product because the training Almost all enterprise training is aimed at the lowest common denominator Like they expect people who aren't super techies to be showing up to this training.

742
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:09,979
Speaker 1: So the training starts on a level that is pointless baby talk and usually doesn't get much farther than okay.

743
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,982
Speaker 1: You started it.

744
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:14,093
Speaker 0: click the X button to close the window.

745
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:27,599
Speaker 1: Here's hot like and they always focus on very obtuse and Complicated parts of the software that no one cares about or will use and don't even talk about The very important things that aren't actually documented.

746
00:49:30,244 --> 00:49:46,370
Speaker 1: Those things yeah, and the instructors usually don't know or They do know and the answer they give you is usually prefaced by yeah Well, this isn't in the documentation But here's how you really do it and it's something complete like BS like yeah The ASP and insert your JavaScript or whatever.

747
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:58,505
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah go on the back end and do this database update And the classes always start late and early and just suck and cost Ludicrous amounts of money.

748
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:02,640
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know some come one company's stupid willing to pay for training.

749
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:04,149
Speaker 0: Another company is gonna be smart.

750
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:08,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, our jalopah training and you'll notice Many of the enterprise training I've been to.

751
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:16,540
Speaker 1: if you ever go to this stuff You'll see half the people there have been using the product for a long time and the product doesn't work anymore.

752
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:21,760
Speaker 1: Or they have problems and they were sent by their management to the training to learn what they were doing wrong.

753
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:23,083
Speaker 0: Why don't?

754
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:27,780
Speaker 0: but the thing is, you know, if something is broken you don't call you don't get training you get support.

755
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,619
Speaker 1: Oh enterprise support is useless.

756
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,460
Speaker 1: I've never gotten good support from any enterprise level product ever.

757
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:40,703
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's enterprise level but there have been times where I've gotten good support like you call Developers.

758
00:50:40,763 --> 00:50:43,012
Speaker 1: on the other end Microsoft has pretty great support.

759
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:45,000
Speaker 0: Microsoft does even Xbox support.

760
00:50:45,181 --> 00:50:48,173
Speaker 1: It's a great Twiki wiki of all things actually has pretty good support.

761
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:49,739
Speaker 0: Like I've got an open source thing.

762
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,619
Speaker 0: Nah, yeah, but sort of how do you get support for it?

763
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,542
Speaker 1: There's there's Peter Tony and this other guy who are kind of like the main developers for it and you can post a bug and they'll Usually respond.

764
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:02,353
Speaker 1: I emailed them and they responded once like they answered my questions.

765
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:08,654
Speaker 1: Okay, actually contracted one of them I forget which one for like 70 pounds to write a like replication plug-in for me.

766
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:09,316
Speaker 0: No work.

767
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:10,480
Speaker 1: It did really well.

768
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,880
Speaker 1: I eventually phased it out because there was a bug where one day our remote site wasn't available.

769
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:20,066
Speaker 1: So it replicated nothing to the local share Destroying the entire Twiki.

770
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:25,970
Speaker 1: and then when the remote site came back up it said oh there have been changes And it updated the whole thing again.

771
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,000
Speaker 1: and then no there were changes.

772
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,511
Speaker 1: So it replicated the empty Twiki to the remote site.

773
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:32,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had to restore the whole thing from tape.

774
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,663
Speaker 0: Tape whoa.

775
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:40,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have like the reason you don't use tape for like the week old or at least month old But you got to keep the more recent ones on discs.

776
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:43,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it's very rare for me to need a backup of anything, right?

777
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,633
Speaker 0: But the point is like you got to keep the recentest backups on something.

778
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:47,195
Speaker 0: that's fast.

779
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,160
Speaker 0: So you otherwise tape.

780
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:48,442
Speaker 0: It's.

781
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,740
Speaker 1: yeah, it depends on how your tapes are set up.

782
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:58,269
Speaker 1: What tape is fast, uh, depending on your automated cartridge systems I have had really fast access to tapes.

783
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:59,392
Speaker 1: In fact at IBM.

784
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:06,020
Speaker 1: We had a place where there was a robot a Gigantic robot that could fetch tapes with such speed that it was ludicrous.

785
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:07,986
Speaker 0: Yeah But the point is to read to.

786
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:09,956
Speaker 0: when you read a tape you have to read it straight through.

787
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:10,700
Speaker 0: you can't scan.

788
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:13,192
Speaker 0: You need to read the whole tape from beginning to end usually.

789
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:14,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that could be a pain.

790
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,028
Speaker 1: Well, I won't get into the details.

791
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:17,580
Speaker 1: You want like ice it to style.

792
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,815
Speaker 1: Enterprise training is mostly useless.

793
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:26,193
Speaker 1: Yep You're better off hiring a consultant to teach you Cheaper how to use the product for real.

794
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,480
Speaker 1: then you are getting official support.

795
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,079
Speaker 0: Thing is I kind of want to you know.

796
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,033
Speaker 0: Give training because I feel like I could give training on things.

797
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:33,700
Speaker 0: I know that's really good.

798
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:44,489
Speaker 1: I would be pretty qualified to give training on some of these bullshit enterprise products Yeah, and judging from the consulting and I would kind of like doing that if it paid enough Yeah, get to travel a lot.

799
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,373
Speaker 1: I think it could be fun.

800
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:53,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Just the third kind of corporate training is the soft training like leadership or project management.

801
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,386
Speaker 0: Bullshit, they're just so.

802
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:56,008
Speaker 0: space.

803
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:57,775
Speaker 0: leap to conclusions crap.

804
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,020
Speaker 1: The thing is they could be good.

805
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,472
Speaker 1: I could imagine a class that teaches like project management.

806
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,640
Speaker 1: That is like here's how to deal with sizing.

807
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,448
Speaker 1: Here's not actually size an IT project.

808
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,300
Speaker 1: Here's how budgeting really works and how to really do it.

809
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,634
Speaker 1: Here's what you know as my experience 20 years being a project manager.

810
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:14,020
Speaker 1: Here are the things that you'll always fuck up.

811
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,328
Speaker 1: Here's how you can avoid fucking.

812
00:53:15,348 --> 00:53:17,100
Speaker 0: the main problem I have with things like that, right?

813
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:23,400
Speaker 0: It's like somebody will teach you here's how to size a project right and they'll say take all these factors into account.

814
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:25,314
Speaker 0: Right, like you don't got to worry about this.

815
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:27,120
Speaker 0: You got to worry about this You got to worry about this, right?

816
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:35,128
Speaker 0: But they don't actually tell you like follow these this exact process to come up with the exact You know fit number that you're looking for.

817
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,220
Speaker 0: They'll never give you that because it doesn't exist, right?

818
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,104
Speaker 0: There's no such thing.

819
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:41,956
Speaker 1: So you want them to give you something that doesn't exist, right?

820
00:53:41,996 --> 00:53:42,980
Speaker 0: But that's that's the point.

821
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,000
Speaker 0: It's like they're basically telling you, you know, this sort of my criticism is much more general.

822
00:53:48,444 --> 00:53:50,420
Speaker 1: I think there's a fundamental flaw in that kind of training.

823
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:59,319
Speaker 1: I think the problem is and I noticed this first at RIT with the public speaking classes that I took Because I you know, I thought that'd be cool.

824
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:15,180
Speaker 1: so I took a long class on public speaking and like oratory and rhetoric and By and large I found people who are drawn to classes that teach things like leadership or public speaking Tend to be terrible at leadership and public speaking and think that they can get better at it by taking a class.

825
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:27,232
Speaker 1: so as a result classes like that tend to focus on things like Don't freak out if you're publicly speaking Don't stutter Don't like pee yourself on stage.

826
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,820
Speaker 1: You don't get the advanced topics You don't get the people who are like don't actually make eye contact.

827
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:41,016
Speaker 1: But look at everyone's eyebrows and you know You know look at the audience like 45% of the time between back and forth or you know All the tricks that I actually know as a pretty expert public speaker.

828
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:52,660
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean there was this guy at bar camp this weekend and he was talking about how he's doing this sort of Collaborative training right where like his idea is that instead of having a trainer, right?

829
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,480
Speaker 0: They still do have trainers and students.

830
00:54:54,821 --> 00:55:02,500
Speaker 0: But basically his idea is get the students to teach each other right as opposed to having a teacher teach the class, right?

831
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:11,480
Speaker 0: so people will show up and you'll give them a Real project to do and they have to team up and do the projects, you know and in doing so we'll learn.

832
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:14,655
Speaker 1: I had a class like that actually during the Democratic primaries.

833
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:15,037
Speaker 1: while we're

834
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:37,219
Speaker 0: like, yeah So if you wanted to teach someone Python, for example with this method, it would be like, alright Everyone shows up and you'd be like, alright, here's what you guys have to make in Python team up together and Do it and in doing so and all working together on it You will all you know by the end of taking many classes over the course of many weeks Learn the Python because you just used it to do a thing.

835
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,448
Speaker 1: So in the lead-up to the Democratic primaries.

836
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:48,117
Speaker 1: for while we were at RIT way back, you know, John Kerry and all that I took a seminar a seminar on political theory and there are only like eight people in the class.

837
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:49,060
Speaker 1: Gah, gah.

838
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:55,700
Speaker 1: So the professor was like, alright, we'll do this as a straight-up seminar and he broke the quarter up.

839
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,315
Speaker 1: You know ten weeks into eight units and at each student teach a unit.

840
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:02,020
Speaker 0: so easy for that teacher.

841
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:03,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

842
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:07,260
Speaker 1: He sat in the audience and asked tough-ass motherfucking questions.

843
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:12,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was possibly the most fun I had in all my time at our.

844
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:12,478
Speaker 0: now.

845
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:18,200
Speaker 0: see on paper That sounds like a good idea and I don't only works if everyone involved is motivated and intelligent.

846
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,380
Speaker 0: Well, he did mention that a lot of people dropped out but the people who stayed were incredibly motivated actually would stay extra hours.

847
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:35,018
Speaker 0: Right, and you know, I definitely believe that people do it in taking this sort of class will learn a lot You know and will make you know, we'll definitely make some significant progress.

848
00:56:35,078 --> 00:56:37,865
Speaker 0: The thing is Like just what you were saying.

849
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:44,379
Speaker 0: the people who are in this thing are people who are way down low and at best it's gonna Bring them up to the middle level.

850
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,050
Speaker 1: Mediating factor and instructor who guides.

851
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:50,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even with the instructor who guides right?

852
00:56:50,540 --> 00:57:01,819
Speaker 0: It's like it's like you get people who are way down low mostly learning together with people who are way down low so they can Help each other, you know get to the finish line, but they're not gonna learn the ink.

853
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:14,399
Speaker 0: You know, especially when it comes to technology there is this incredibly high-level Esoteric stuff no matter what you're doing that you're not gonna learn Scott The only way to learn that stuff in my opinion is to run into it doing real work.

854
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:17,669
Speaker 1: Two things one by having a classical education.

855
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:28,919
Speaker 1: So you have just a wide variety of knowledge and experience from school Yeah, or just from life, you know, you can get a classical education without going to school Yeah, and two just by being around long enough to see enough shit

856
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:31,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's the thing is like, you know.

857
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,383
Speaker 1: so that's the thing.

858
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:41,360
Speaker 1: people you people have misplaced expectations of training and I think the the reason they're misplaced is because they will see people who go to training and succeed.

859
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:46,760
Speaker 1: I think the people who succeed as a result of training in most cases didn't need the training to begin with.

860
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're self motivated enough to where they would have learned it on their own if given the time.

861
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:58,686
Speaker 1: Yeah So the people who see that they have this mystical idea and you see this in colleges too that I don't know computers if I go To a computer school.

862
00:57:58,786 --> 00:58:05,639
Speaker 1: I'll graduate being a computer expert Kind of like the tourists who think if I go to New York City, New York City will entertain me.

863
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's exactly what happens.

864
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:19,840
Speaker 1: They think that training is magical that if I go to training I will come out knowing everything not realizing that it takes Almost the exact same amount of effort to learn in a training class as it does to learn on your own.

865
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:23,599
Speaker 1: And if you don't have the motivation to you're not learn on your own You're not gonna do that.

866
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,687
Speaker 1: Well in a class in most cases pretty

867
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:42,499
Speaker 0: much the only thing the only value that I see in getting training Right as opposed to learn it on my own by doing or reading a book or both or internet or whatever Is that at the training you if the if the person giving the training is really an expert person Which is not always true.

868
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:56,420
Speaker 0: But if they are really an expert person then you can ask them the questions that you know and get instant full answers You know with all the details fleshed out that you might not be able to get from say Stack Overflow or something like that.

869
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:13,395
Speaker 1: Yep, like I had a question about because we're you know Python 3 versus 2 There are some differences and I had a question about one of the differences and the instructor who actually lectures if I can I can often was like oh and he basically had as Much depth as I wanted and there was probably a lot more there.

870
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:27,448
Speaker 0: if I wanted to go deeper I've also heard stories right of people going to things like Apple Developer conference or Microsoft equivalent of the same thing, you know, whatever they call it these days right or you know, Google's What do they call it?

871
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:31,062
Speaker 0: They just had it recently the Google I/o.

872
00:59:31,283 --> 00:59:53,360
Speaker 0: right and you go if you go to those things and you have something that's really really niche like you go to Microsoft and you're writing some Windows app and You've got a problem with this really deep down Like Windows something API Call somewhere and the MSDN documentation isn't enough and no one on Stack Overflow is helping you.

873
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,189
Speaker 1: So the guy who wrote that is right.

874
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:56,314
Speaker 0: It's not a training.

875
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:57,560
Speaker 0: It's a developer conference.

876
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:08,060
Speaker 0: But if you go there, you're going to Microsoft you're going to Google or to Apple You can find the guy whose job it is for that thing and you can get the magical answer that you've been looking for.

877
01:00:08,545 --> 01:00:22,440
Speaker 0: You know, it's not training But it's that it's in the same way that I think the value has the same value as training which is Direct access in person to the one or two people on earth who have the expert knowledge in the thing that you're looking for.

878
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:23,980
Speaker 0: That is so specific, right?

879
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:35,660
Speaker 0: So if it's a good trainer It almost doesn't matter if the training is worthless because if you have a problem You're basically paying those thousands whatever to get the answer to that question that you so desperately need.

880
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:39,260
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know You can build up a whole list of questions if you get them all answered.

881
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,328
Speaker 0: Look at the price and figure out if it was worth it.

882
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:43,437
Speaker 0: Like would you have paid to get those hands?

883
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:45,695
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I guess my thesis.

884
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:51,740
Speaker 0: but then again You could just do the same thing by hiring that trainer as a consultant for a day to ask him the questions.

885
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:53,547
Speaker 1: There's a blurred line between.

886
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:58,918
Speaker 1: when you go to training vert like a lot of training places offer Hey, we'll just send the instructor to your company.

887
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:04,079
Speaker 1: However, many people you want to sit in the room can sit in the room and we'll do whatever you want me to do.

888
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:06,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's actually usually I think a great idea.

889
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,880
Speaker 0: it's the same thing as a consultant.

890
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,092
Speaker 1: Oh, it is a concern.

891
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:09,940
Speaker 0: you're hiring consultant.

892
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,594
Speaker 0: You can tell that consultant to do work or you can tell them to.

893
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:14,589
Speaker 0: you can just ask them questions Or you could have them trained.

894
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,599
Speaker 0: you could have them do whatever you want.

895
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:22,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess my thesis on all this because you know, I'm in training right now And it's actually pretty good, but I could have done without the training.

896
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:23,758
Speaker 1: I am looking forward to.

897
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:34,828
Speaker 1: in July I'm going to a C++ boot camp, which is basically it's actually Probably slightly above my level of coding C++, which is slowly fading Yes, but very slowly.

898
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:37,803
Speaker 0: It's a slowest fade in the possible yeah universe.

899
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:38,044
Speaker 0: it'll

900
01:01:38,064 --> 01:02:15,920
Speaker 1: be useful to me because in the enterprise world a lot of things are written in C++ and being an engineer in the manner that I am I often need to interface between guy who wrote a complex multi-threaded C++ or C or objective C demon and Someone who is not that technical and I have to be able to mediate between the two like say an operations guy Finds what he thinks is a bug, but he can't describe like he knows what's not going right But he doesn't know why it's not going right and the engineer who wrote the demon doesn't know enough about the business process To figure out what went wrong.

901
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:23,392
Speaker 1: You need someone who knows the IT side and the business side and can actually look at the code and understand what the demon Was trying to do to explain to the developer.

902
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:24,640
Speaker 1: Here's what really happened.

903
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,665
Speaker 1: There's a thread condition.

904
01:02:25,685 --> 01:02:33,634
Speaker 1: that happening is I don't understand why you need Python training and C++ training Because I wanted C sharp training cuz that'll actually really useful to me and they said it.

905
01:02:33,654 --> 01:02:35,320
Speaker 1: then they decided that C sharp.

906
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:37,639
Speaker 1: There wasn't a good business case for me learning it in the company.

907
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:38,885
Speaker 0: But the thing is right.

908
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,576
Speaker 0: why do you need training for more than one language period?

909
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:42,620
Speaker 0: it's like if you can you know?

910
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:51,051
Speaker 1: You just look up the syntax and you feel to read any language mostly because the boot camp for C++ I think would have really forced me to learn more better coding practices.

911
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:51,834
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

912
01:02:52,075 --> 01:02:54,759
Speaker 0: C++ isn't gonna teach you good It's gonna teach you bad coding.

913
01:02:56,363 --> 01:02:58,033
Speaker 0: You see C++ is basically.

914
01:02:58,053 --> 01:03:02,052
Speaker 0: it's an object-oriented language But you can also write in C kinda and it's also.

915
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:03,840
Speaker 0: the syntax is a complete mess.

916
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,513
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of crazy symbols everywhere.

917
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:08,925
Speaker 1: Yeah No, I like Python and this is the training I wanted.

918
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:11,560
Speaker 1: C++ was kind of my silver medal because I couldn't get what I really wanted.

919
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:16,665
Speaker 0: But you know if you can read, you know, if you can read any program language You can probably read the C++.

920
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,614
Speaker 0: and if you see a weird symbol just look it up.

921
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:21,894
Speaker 0: You don't need training for it Yeah, but that you know training happens is?

922
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:22,800
Speaker 1: I work in enterprise?

923
01:03:25,237 --> 01:03:28,850
Speaker 1: But Anyway, I guess my thesis in all this is that training.

924
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:42,959
Speaker 1: a lot of companies will send people on training when really They would be much better off giving the people the time to learn it either at home with like, okay Take a week off and learn this thing or hey, don't do any work, but learning this thing.

925
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:52,331
Speaker 1: Because the people who are motivated will learn the thing regardless of whether they go to training or you give them time and the people Motivated aren't gonna learn any more at the training.

926
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:53,917
Speaker 1: then they're gonna learn if you give them the time off.

927
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:54,580
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

928
01:03:54,781 --> 01:04:05,398
Speaker 1: so really you should just figure out who you think is not motivated and never let them learn anything and If possible get rid of them and hire someone who is motivated.

929
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:14,780
Speaker 0: But I mean what you know, there might be someone who you know, they might not be motivated to learn new things But they are good at a thing already and you need that thing that they're right.

930
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:19,120
Speaker 1: But what if they need to learn something else and they're not motivated?

931
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,655
Speaker 1: Don't send them to training if you know, they're not gonna learn.

932
01:04:21,977 --> 01:04:22,520
Speaker 0: that's obvious.

933
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:29,220
Speaker 1: Yeah Definitely, but I think a lot of companies send people to training Thinking that that will somehow make them learn a lot of times.

934
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:37,431
Speaker 0: She's better off hiring someone else who knows the thing that you need to know rather than training someone you already have Yep, or hiring a consultant or outsourcing or all those things.

935
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:39,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like hi.

936
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,280
Speaker 0: I've got these guys.

937
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:41,068
Speaker 0: They all know.

938
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:42,179
Speaker 0: X I need.

939
01:04:42,684 --> 01:04:43,692
Speaker 0: Suddenly we got product.

940
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:46,209
Speaker 0: why coming in here Do I train these guys in product?

941
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:46,430
Speaker 0: why?

942
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:48,100
Speaker 0: or just hire someone who already knows product?

943
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,045
Speaker 1: Why that's so much easier time?

944
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:55,420
Speaker 1: too many job postings require very specific knowledge of specific things that almost no one's actually gonna know.

945
01:04:55,964 --> 01:05:03,996
Speaker 1: Well, that's you know separate problem Yeah, but companies put way too much stock in training and don't trust their workers nearly enough.

946
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:12,516
Speaker 1: if you're paying someone a lot of money because you Nominally Understand that they're intelligent you're paying them for the fact that they're an intelligent person who can make decisions.

947
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:21,549
Speaker 1: if you then Like don't trust them to be motivated enough to learn something that's important to their job on their own Then why are you paying the smart person?

948
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:23,800
Speaker 1: You could get someone less skilled to do the same job.

949
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

950
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:29,892
Speaker 0: if you don't if you're not gonna let someone make a decision Why do you need to hire someone who's smart enough to make a decision?

951
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:32,100
Speaker 0: hire someone who is incapable of making decision?

952
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:35,780
Speaker 0: And you'll pay them a lot less and you'll make all the decisions that you're already making.

953
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:44,465
Speaker 1: And if your company ever buys really big and bloated enterprise software and you get to go to training Think of it as a week-long vacation somewhere boring.

954
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,090
Speaker 0: It could be in Vegas.

955
01:05:47,871 --> 01:05:51,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually the training ends up being in North Carolina or down by DC.

956
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:54,283
Speaker 1: Actually a lot of it's in the financial district.

957
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:55,129
Speaker 1: So you get to go to New York.

958
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:04,430
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

959
