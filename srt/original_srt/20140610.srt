1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,433
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 10th 2014.

2
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:15,664
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:17,510
Speaker 0: level editing and games.

4
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:19,896
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,374
Speaker 0: Oh My god, it's e3.

6
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:34,689
Speaker 0: I've never cared about you know in my entire life as big of a gamer as I am And as much as I deeply cared about video games, I never cared about e3.

7
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:40,530
Speaker 0: I vaguely wanted to go back in like the you know, the that era when we would read like mega Tokyo.

8
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:45,426
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I only cared about e3 like I can't because I couldn't get into it.

9
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,510
Speaker 0: I wanted to be at it.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like when I was in high school, you'd get like video game magazines.

11
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,222
Speaker 1: They'd be like check out all this stuff from e3.

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,048
Speaker 1: You'd be like, what's e3?

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,850
Speaker 1: I guess it's a place where they have all these great games and you can play like crazy.

14
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,656
Speaker 0: I forget e3 any conference like that.

15
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:09,870
Speaker 0: until the internet and until I went to like a lot of conventions I pretty much assumed that every time I heard about a video game conference of any type It was exactly like the Nintendo tournament at the end of the wizard.

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,421
Speaker 0: But I was really disappointed when it turned out.

17
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,570
Speaker 0: that can conventions are not like that at all.

18
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:20,350
Speaker 1: I'm still surprised e3 even exists because was there was a time it died completely.

19
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:26,389
Speaker 0: Well, it died as the show that was aimed originally, you know It had the problem where it was for the press.

20
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:30,744
Speaker 0: But fans wanted to go to and their paths were.

21
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:32,390
Speaker 0: they only had two possible pads.

22
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:41,026
Speaker 0: they could either go a hundred percent press only like for real and not just let like the guy who has a blog with one subscriber that's himself show up.

23
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:45,086
Speaker 1: or Well, it used to be the GameStop employee would show up because they're in the industry.

24
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:51,050
Speaker 0: Yeah Or they could go the other route and just try to become a shitty version of what became PAX.

25
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:55,169
Speaker 0: There's really no middle ground for a convention like that.

26
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:56,610
Speaker 0: Mmm, I don't know.

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:09,190
Speaker 0: I've just I've never been interested in e3 and actually I've never even been interested in the news or the announcements even as a journalist Because the announcements can be summarized by a list of bullet points of these games were announced.

28
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,300
Speaker 0: There was usually no reason to actually watch the press conferences.

29
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,130
Speaker 0: They usually show almost no actual gameplay.

30
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:24,155
Speaker 0: Sony actually is the only company that gets props in recent memory because they announced a game and Said it's already available for sale.

31
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:24,757
Speaker 0: Good job.

32
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,544
Speaker 0: That is that my head is off to you golf clap.

33
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:37,030
Speaker 0: However, the game Entwined looks beautiful looks like an amazing visual auditory sensory experience.

34
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:40,810
Speaker 0: It looks like the height of interactive amusement.

35
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,790
Speaker 0: Okay, I wouldn't necessarily say it meets any of the other definitions of game.

36
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,870
Speaker 1: I mean I might play it but I wouldn't pay money for it.

37
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,674
Speaker 1: And even if I got a free PlayStation and the game for free I might spend 20 minutes on it.

38
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:57,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:04,712
Speaker 0: Well, you know what it is watching it and oh my god I just looked at a trailer for it and the first comment was the same thing I was about to say.

40
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:05,294
Speaker 0: effectively.

41
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:15,470
Speaker 0: so they made journey to now withdraw fish and bird Except you can basically it's journey if you control both entities.

42
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,798
Speaker 0: It's just Viv ribbon it's just a rhythm game.

43
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:27,200
Speaker 0: I don't get why so many rhythm games have come out recently that Basically, how is it anything with the skin?

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,308
Speaker 1: It's like, uh, I played this game.

45
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:32,830
Speaker 1: now I will play this exact same game again only looks different now.

46
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,510
Speaker 0: I'm not saying there is not a place for aesthetics or style.

47
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:43,110
Speaker 0: I mean the game seriously is beautiful Other than the fact that apparently it also has dragon mode where the fish and the bird merge to become a dragon.

48
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:45,319
Speaker 1: Of course a dragon is just a fish bird.

49
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,109
Speaker 0: if your body knows that if your game has dragon mode Why the fuck is there a not dragon mode?

50
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,290
Speaker 1: But that makes the dragon mode that much more exciting.

51
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:59,890
Speaker 1: If it was just dragon mode from the start you'd be like, okay dragon mode, but it's like oh shit dragon mode time.

52
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,180
Speaker 0: I'll never forget my year with dragon mode.

53
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,548
Speaker 1: You had a whole year with dragon mode.

54
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:09,510
Speaker 1: It would get a little Who anyway.

55
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,175
Speaker 0: But there is.

56
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:15,498
Speaker 0: there is definitely a place for games that are these visual Experiences that are.

57
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,510
Speaker 0: you know rhythm games like this can be engrossing.

58
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:29,033
Speaker 1: They're an important part of gaming, but I see no reason to be excited about this game For this one, there's people out there who are just like so into video games and it's like, you know They actually like.

59
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 1: these games are their thing like as much as we care about whatever we care about.

60
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:37,325
Speaker 1: They care about these games that were announced that much like they're so into it.

61
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:42,421
Speaker 1: but for me at this point I Really don't give a shit about any of these games at all.

62
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,450
Speaker 0: I give a few shits about some games.

63
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,009
Speaker 0: However, they're kind of out of my reach.

64
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:59,450
Speaker 0: I mean Nintendo is continuing to release its series of b-plus versions of its first-party games But not gonna buy a Wii U just to play the new Zelda game, especially because I didn't finish the last couple of Zelda games.

65
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:08,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's the main thing is like all these games that I had Twilight Princess like was really fun And then I really got tired of it way before I was done with it Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,044
Speaker 1: I mean look at the games that I have now.

67
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:14,223
Speaker 1: so on my 3ds Pokemon whatever unbeaten poke the pre Pokemon.

68
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,372
Speaker 0: really you haven't beaten Pokemon yet I haven't even.

69
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:17,797
Speaker 1: I guess I just stopped playing it.

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,399
Speaker 0: You didn't foil.

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,302
Speaker 0: I Sanders plot.

72
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,266
Speaker 0: It takes like 20 minutes.

73
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:31,687
Speaker 1: No Basically what happens to me lately right is I'll play a game and I'll be kind of into it and then I'll get to a Point in the game where it's just like it's just too much fucking work to continue.

74
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:32,450
Speaker 1: Fuck it, right?

75
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,459
Speaker 1: It's like I was playing Fez.

76
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,470
Speaker 1: Fez is really good.

77
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,199
Speaker 1: I had these really interesting sort of puzzles.

78
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:41,027
Speaker 1: we'd flip the map around and you know It's really good puzzle platforming right and it was.

79
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:41,929
Speaker 1: it was fun Yeah.

80
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:50,595
Speaker 1: And then I got to a point in the game where in order to really make a lot of progress You had to learn to read the stupid fucking language or read a fact and I was just like, you know What fuck it.

81
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:51,238
Speaker 1: and I stopped playing.

82
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,083
Speaker 1: everybody picked it up again.

83
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,370
Speaker 0: Well, you know where it comes down Pokemon.

84
00:05:53,713 --> 00:06:01,614
Speaker 1: I got to the town in the middle Right and the gym inside the Eiffel Tower was open and there was just so much stuff in that town Right.

85
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:02,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

86
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,447
Speaker 0: I didn't even go and look at any of that shit.

87
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:04,950
Speaker 0: You know what it is.

88
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,688
Speaker 0: It's a million cafes where three people tell you two sentences of dialogue, right?

89
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:09,090
Speaker 1: Of course.

90
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,361
Speaker 1: But it's like I feel like wow, you just gave me way too much shit to do at once.

91
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,408
Speaker 1: Fuck this right Dragon Age.

92
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,982
Speaker 1: I got Dragon Age for like way cheaper.

93
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:36,802
Speaker 1: someone gifted it to me or something right a long time ago like months and months ago, maybe in a year ago and I'm playing it and I'm like, okay, this isn't really much of a game but you know there's something happening here and following the dwarfie story whatever just clicking through and eventually I get to a town and It's like oh you're in a town and inventory management.

94
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,670
Speaker 1: You have a zillion items and I'm like, fuck it never played it again.

95
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,850
Speaker 1: Well, there's two guy rim my same shit.

96
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,799
Speaker 0: I think there's a couple of different types of things.

97
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,869
Speaker 0: that'll cause people like us to Peter out on a game.

98
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:51,170
Speaker 0: A lot of the reason I'll play a new game is either because it's something truly novel.

99
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,298
Speaker 0: I'll play for the novelty like wow.

100
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a mechanic that I have not.

101
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,614
Speaker 1: if there's something really new I gotta see what it is.

102
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:59,479
Speaker 0: Like for example, uh, a cron.

103
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,324
Speaker 0: Yeah time-traveling RTS.

104
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,166
Speaker 0: Holy fuck.

105
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,430
Speaker 0: Is that a novel idea?

106
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sorry, dr.

107
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:04,574
Speaker 1: Hazard.

108
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:05,798
Speaker 1: I couldn't get through the tutorial.

109
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:06,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,553
Speaker 0: Well, that's because we're bad at RTS is it was just I couldn't Do it.

111
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:10,202
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're.

112
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:15,305
Speaker 0: uh We're crippled when it comes to playing RTS, but you know what?

113
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:18,679
Speaker 1: Starcraft 2 on Easy slash normal mode.

114
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,267
Speaker 1: I beat the whole the single players.

115
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,494
Speaker 1: Yeah Even the expansion bit.

116
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:23,698
Speaker 0: but I get to a point.

117
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:40,117
Speaker 0: in games like that like any sort of single-player nominally an ortho game competitive game like that where I'm not going to engage heavily with the multiplayer community where the Single-player version of the game like the campaign or whatever it is Just kind of get samey.

118
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,305
Speaker 0: and I think that really happened.

119
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,670
Speaker 0: even look at castle crashers.

120
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,145
Speaker 0: The first couple of levels of castle crashers were really novel.

121
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,455
Speaker 0: The music was great They were really fun.

122
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,809
Speaker 0: Then the whole rest of the game was just the same fucking thing over and over again.

123
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:56,102
Speaker 0: No Slowly leveling up and unlocking a bunch of stuff.

124
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:59,517
Speaker 0: as soon as I have to unlock stuff I no longer care.

125
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,043
Speaker 1: as soon as I have to redo a part.

126
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:01,847
Speaker 1: I already did done.

127
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,437
Speaker 1: It's like it was.

128
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,389
Speaker 1: if your game is only fun once fuck it, right?

129
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,329
Speaker 0: But I said there is a place for games that are only fun once.

130
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:11,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's that's.

131
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:15,310
Speaker 1: the point is if I have to ever redo a part I'll just give up on the whole game, right?

132
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,240
Speaker 0: You only if you've played Super Meat Boy you die and you're like fuck it.

133
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,376
Speaker 1: Super Meat Boy is actually good.

134
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,023
Speaker 1: But Super Meat Boy is another good example.

135
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,641
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, I beat Super Meat Boy I didn't do any hell levels.

136
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:26,567
Speaker 1: I didn't do anything.

137
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,130
Speaker 0: That's different.

138
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:35,450
Speaker 0: That's fine because I do like games that have a an ending point But then they have more for people for whom that game is their thing.

139
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:44,724
Speaker 0: I mean, I love the shit out of the challenge areas and bionic commando rearmed But I understand that most people want nothing to do with that.

140
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:50,090
Speaker 1: the game I'm playing most these days It's like my 3ds actually is where I'm playing the most video games.

141
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:54,670
Speaker 1: It's like I got games on there like the new Phoenix Wright or the relatively new Phoenix, right?

142
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,464
Speaker 0: I stopped caring about Phoenix Wright's a long time ago.

143
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,153
Speaker 0: They're all the same They're just you.

144
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:01,242
Speaker 0: you see a what would be an okay episode of an anime.

145
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:03,810
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, you solve trivial logic puzzles.

146
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,642

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,533
Speaker 1: I still haven't beaten.

155
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:24,290
Speaker 1: I have games for the DS that I have bought and did not beat right.

156
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:26,473
Speaker 1: I bought.

157
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:33,567
Speaker 1: I have a bunch of 3ds games on cartridges some that I bought when I got the 3ds Some of which I have not even put into the 3ds.

158
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:39,405

Speaker 1: I beat that.

166
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:50,750
Speaker 0: I'm going to play it but I'm powered through some fun parts towards the end of Pokemon.

167
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,000
Speaker 0: I gotta go victory road it up.

168
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:56,189
Speaker 1: if anyone wants that cartridge I will sell it to you because I will never put it in my 3ds ever again.

169
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:06,502
Speaker 0: But if I so because I have such a wide Panoply of games I can play Just every type of game.

170
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,473
Speaker 0: look at my Steam library But I could have.

171
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,877
Speaker 0: these games have never been installed.

172
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,700
Speaker 0: I can play anything.

173
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:26,429
Speaker 0: So a game either has to have a thriving current multiplayer multiverse for in which I can compete in which I wish to compete or It has to provide a novel experience or an enduring experience.

174
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,930
Speaker 0: Store interwoven FPS story games have not gotten too far past half-life 2 in terms of construction.

175
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,955
Speaker 0: All the like.

176
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,744
Speaker 0: you are military fighting military battle.

177
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,770
Speaker 0: I feel like I've played that game before.

178
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, no need.

179
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could do novel stuff.

180
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,076
Speaker 0: But until I see something really interesting and more novel than the other ones I've played I mean the new.

181
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:50,682
Speaker 0: you are military man.

182
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:53,974
Speaker 0: doing military thing is not that much different from the new Or the new man.

183
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,302
Speaker 1: you were even talking about how you're loving that day of sex.

184
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,770
Speaker 0: whatever human revolution was a fucking amazing game.

185
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,846
Speaker 1: I played that for like five minutes, and it's like oh fuck it.

186
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,218
Speaker 0: I don't care I don't understand why you didn't like that game.

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,830
Speaker 1: just walk around and shoot things game, and then there's not.

188
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,285
Speaker 1: I don't care about anything that's happening.

189
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,621
Speaker 0: It's walk around and not shoot things.

190
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:12,070
Speaker 0: the fuck were you doing anytime?

191
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,194
Speaker 1: I try to actually stealth.

192
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:18,433
Speaker 1: in any game that claims to be stealth I get seen immediately and get killed except bad at that Except for thief.

193
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:21,646
Speaker 1: thief is the only game where the stealth actually works seriously Scott metal.

194
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,450
Speaker 1: here stealth doesn't work.

195
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,656
Speaker 0: How in Deus Ex you just fucking.

Speaker 0: he turns his back you sneak up behind him and either knock him out Or crawl into the vent next to him.

198
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:32,789
Speaker 0: He'll never see you.

199
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:33,636
Speaker 0: I don't know how you.

200
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,624
Speaker 0: and then we get seen.

201
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:43,060
Speaker 1: you're on a map And it's like okay get from here to here and the only thing between you and there is a giant room with lights on everywhere And a million bad guys, that's never.

202
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:44,487
Speaker 0: there's no point in the game.

203
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:45,130
Speaker 0: That's like that.

204
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,185
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just didn't care.

205
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:50,318
Speaker 0: You just don't play games anymore.

206
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,881
Speaker 0: I just don't.

207
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:54,920
Speaker 1: I really I just don't give a shit about Not almost any video game that comes out.

208
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:57,350
Speaker 1: I'm playing pie cross more than playing any other video game.

209
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,358
Speaker 0: So you're turning into one of those casual gamers.

210
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,743
Speaker 1: share pie cross.

211
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:02,330
Speaker 0: really pie cross isn't even a game.

212
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:03,554
Speaker 1: It's a puzzle.

213
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:04,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a puzzle.

214
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,606
Speaker 0: I noticed that you did not disagree.

215
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,148
Speaker 0: I didn't.

216
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:07,790
Speaker 1: I don't disagree.

217
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's what you're just playing time wasters.

218
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,890
Speaker 1: It's an entertainment software puzzle.

219
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:17,042
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm actually still the games I play the most right now our FTL.

220
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:20,516
Speaker 1: now that there's the expansion that game FTL I beat it and then I was done.

221
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,944
Speaker 0: you beat it on easy on baby mode.

222
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:26,116
Speaker 1: Yep, easy and baby mode You have no desire to play anymore.

223
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:26,999
Speaker 1: FTL ever.

224
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,304
Speaker 0: You didn't even play that game.

225
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:30,010
Speaker 0: That's like playing counter-strike once.

226
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:31,956
Speaker 1: I have no desire to play it ever again.

227
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why you just don't like games anymore.

228
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:35,368
Speaker 0: I just don't.

229
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:35,789
Speaker 1: yeah.

230
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,500
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I'm playing a bunch of games.

231
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,083
Speaker 1: the point right.

232
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:39,687
Speaker 1: the point is e3 e3.

233
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,890
Speaker 1: However, everything they announced I don't care about even from the start.

234
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:49,288
Speaker 0: I would care about some of these things like for example, the new Zelda game looks pretty good.

235
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,390
Speaker 1: Okay, sure I would play the new Zelda game, but I'm not buying a Wii U for it.

236
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,300
Speaker 0: The new Mario Party looks pretty good.

237
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,410
Speaker 1: They actually I'll just play my old Mario Party.

238
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,378
Speaker 0: They added a mode that would be.

239
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:01,590
Speaker 1: I have that Mario game for the Wii new Super Mario Brothers.

240
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,775
Speaker 1: If four people can play it once.

241
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:04,160
Speaker 1: we never even played that.

242
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,590
Speaker 1: So why would I buy some Wii U Mario Party?

243
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why you bought that game because I knew we wouldn't play it.

244
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:12,536
Speaker 1: I'll play it at some point.

245
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,844
Speaker 0: No, you won't I'm gonna you're never gonna play it.

246
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:15,607
Speaker 1: I'm gonna retire.

247
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:16,470
Speaker 0: probably lost it.

248
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,112
Speaker 1: I have it.

249
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:21,250
Speaker 0: I'm tired, but the new Mario Party actually does have an amazing mode.

250
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:26,130
Speaker 0: It has two ways to play the game normal Mario Party and Bowser Party.

251
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,093
Speaker 1: How does Bowser Party?

252
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,406
Speaker 0: Bowser Party is three people are playing Mario Party and one person.

253
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:31,550
Speaker 0: the entire game?

254
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,984
Speaker 0: Controls Bowser and the enemies in all the minigames.

255
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:40,089
Speaker 1: Let's just play Bomberman and then everyone have asshole revenge mode.

256
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,721
Speaker 0: Are you seriously saying that those are the same basic experience?

257
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get the same feeling from fucking.

258
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:54,970
Speaker 0: so Yeah, you know because Bomberman for one is a directly competitive ortho game Where the Mario Party so it's a party has a lot more random.

259
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:11,788
Speaker 0: no, because - it is basically take one type of game one minigame effectively the Bomberman game and Foster extreme mastery of that Mario Party is Foster competent mastery of a large number of disparate types of games.

260
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,326
Speaker 0: sure I mean, they're they're very different games.

261
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 0: fundamentally I wouldn't really just brush them off the way you're brushing them off.

262
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:21,290
Speaker 0: But my problem with Mario Party 10 is this one?

263
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:28,256
Speaker 0: I don't trust Nintendo to make Bowser mode actually fun for Bowser Even win.

264
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:29,483
Speaker 0: I don't know.

265
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,710
Speaker 0: they haven't announced enough details.

266
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,397
Speaker 0: They just I don't trust Nintendo to use the.

267
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:38,391
Speaker 0: we use capabilities at all and there is no way this mode is actually going to Be good.

268
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,014
Speaker 0: It's the.

269
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 0: you know what this mode is gonna turn into.

270
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,509
Speaker 0: it's gonna be the mode where your friend Who doesn't like to play the competitive game?

271
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:53,349
Speaker 0: Well you get to be Bowser and they sit there and deal with it for like 20 minutes And then they get bored and now your game's fucked because you need Bowser for the whole rest of the game.

272
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,259
Speaker 0: That's what's gonna happen.

273
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,715
Speaker 0: That's what this mode is Mmm.

274
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,124
Speaker 1: It's like that Zelda game.

275
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:02,889
Speaker 1: It's like okay I'd want to play that but I'm not gonna pay for it and I gonna buy a Wii U for it.

276
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:04,275
Speaker 0: I buy it and play it.

277
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:08,460
Speaker 0: if I didn't also have to buy a Wii U and there still are not enough games on the Wii U for me to buy it.

278
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:14,770
Speaker 1: one day They're gonna come out right like not the next thing after the Wii U like the Wii U plus or something right?

279
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:26,309
Speaker 1: They're gonna come out with like the Nintendo Revolution my foe from and like 20 years from now and on that the Nintendo console two generations from now.

280
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:33,570
Speaker 1: They're gonna have an e-shop where you can download digital games or I don't know absorb them into your consciousness, right?

281
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,787
Speaker 1: However, it works and they're gonna re-release.

282
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:41,390
Speaker 1: this old Zelda game will get re-released just like Wind Waker got re-released and Ocarina of Time got re-released.

283
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:57,201
Speaker 0: Ah, but when you care about it, I feel like with all the Zelda games that have come out in the last many years Many of them effectively replace others of them and that there is no reason for Anyone even people are into Zelda games to play all of them.

284
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:59,650
Speaker 0: There's a place you should probably skip.

285
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,480
Speaker 1: I've played every Zelda game pretty much.

286
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,264
Speaker 1: I think I had.

287
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:03,450
Speaker 1: I think I played every Zelda game.

288
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,729
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I didn't beat the train one on the DS.

289
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:09,850
Speaker 1: I played it a bunch and then stopped because it was awful, but every other zone.

290
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,208
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I didn't beat Majora's Mask either because it's a pain in the ass.

291
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,907
Speaker 1: But every other Zelda game I've beaten right?

292
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:18,799
Speaker 1: Yeah So I would play this why not?

293
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,890
Speaker 1: but I realized they keep coming up with like remakes.

294
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,481
Speaker 1: They came out like Wind Waker HD.

295
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:24,910
Speaker 1: So it's like I already played Wind Waker.

296
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,469
Speaker 1: I have no need for Wind Waker HD.

297
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:33,330
Speaker 1: But if I just wait two generations and don't play anything and they re-release everything I'll get a lot of value out of that new console.

298
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:40,369
Speaker 1: Right, like someone who never played Wind Waker Would get a lot of value out of a Wii U right now because Wind Waker HD is on it.

299
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:42,778
Speaker 1: So there's actually two games they want to play on it.

300
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,188
Speaker 1: That's old Zelda game remake and this new one.

301
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,781
Speaker 1: for me There's only one game on it.

302
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:47,469
Speaker 1: So it's not worth it.

303
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,627
Speaker 0: But also they announced the new Madden and I'm just what's the difference?

304
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,270
Speaker 0: do you even need to?

305
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:53,893
Speaker 0: well They make.

306
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:54,918
Speaker 0: they change things every year.

307
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,291
Speaker 0: They make players better fields the graphics I don't know.

308
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:04,179
Speaker 0: actually they made a lot of differences and there's a pretty long article about like the pretty specific Changes they made to how the game works.

309
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,150
Speaker 1: If I didn't buy the old Madden, why would I buy this Madden?

310
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,113
Speaker 1: I'll just play Tecmo Bowl.

311
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,682
Speaker 0: that they're very different experiences.

312
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:11,810
Speaker 0: There is a place in everyone's heart.

313
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:12,414
Speaker 0: So why?

314
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,650
Speaker 1: why is Madden an experience I would ever want to have?

315
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:19,367
Speaker 0: What's the last like football game you played?

316
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,957
Speaker 1: I Bought Madden for the first.

317
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:22,944
Speaker 1: we didn't played it once.

318
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,665
Speaker 0: Yeah Well that that Madden was like at a. that was an atrocity.

319
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:28,670
Speaker 0: against Madden games.

320
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,199
Speaker 1: I played Tecmo Bowl like the other day.

321
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,890
Speaker 1: I played ten yard fight like yesterday.

322
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:34,379
Speaker 1: Nah I was testing out an emulator and that's the first game.

323
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:37,172
Speaker 0: cuz it's not like blitz on the 64 begins with 10.

324
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:40,902
Speaker 1: So it's the first game Because it begins with one zero,

325
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:52,309
Speaker 0: but I guess this is where e3 just lacks my interest because I knew a new Madden game was going to come out and I knew that all the details about that Madden game were going to be released at some point.

326
00:17:52,933 --> 00:18:02,637
Speaker 0: So the huge press conference and stuff about it Especially because they pretty much don't actually show gameplay in most of these e3 things Was completely useless except as a hype machine.

327
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:19,038
Speaker 0: and I noticed and this is just my personal opinion that a lot of the gaming journalists I know who I was following on Twitter their tweet streams reeked of forced enthusiasm and Attempting to say anything about the announcement.

328
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:23,050
Speaker 1: or they're actually legitimately enthusiastic because that's their only thing is video game?

329
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:32,386
Speaker 0: No Cuz I know these people and watching the tweet streams like you'd see the occasional tweet where it's obvious Like they're really into the new Civ game, which I'm pretty into the new Civ game.

330
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:36,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have Civ 5 I haven't played it and but then you see yeah, I don't know why Civ 5 is amazing.

331
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:37,638
Speaker 1: What am I supposed?

332
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,709
Speaker 1: I don't have time for this shit.

333
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:43,607
Speaker 0: I don't know what you do with your days that you don't have time to play video games at all.

334
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,340
Speaker 0: live Like I don't know what you do did.

335
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,870
Speaker 0: how long does it take you to do laundry?

336
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,497
Speaker 1: Actually been paying for someone else.

337
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:53,290
Speaker 0: do my laundry lately, then you should have plenty of time to live video games.

338
00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:00,270
Speaker 1: I'm watching stuff and playing cooking food and biking and yeah, is that that bicycle show?

339
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,439
Speaker 0: You're just watching all this anime Sailor Moon.

340
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,589
Speaker 1: Oh shit this new Sailor Moon, isn't there?

341
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,208
Speaker 1: It is sort of anime season right now, yeah it is.

342
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:13,329
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, we'll continue on our March to mastering out since you tonic and leave you behind.

343
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:20,959
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day.

344
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:30,980
Speaker 0: So since we're talking about level editors as you may or may not know I was big into Editing levels and creating levels and modding shit in the doom days.

345
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:36,041
Speaker 0: You know back when no 3d knowledge was really required and the games were Just.

346
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:57,358
Speaker 0: they were simple to the point that I could know a great deal about the intricacies of the engine without having to spend months researching and reading books and learning this stuff, but It had their own editors to make it levels and to do stuff with the game, you know they use something to make the levels and There were a lot of other tools like win do.

347
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:09,800
Speaker 0: The tool that I used when I made these levels in doom primarily was something called wadded Like wadded as in wad editor because those files were called wad files.

348
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:13,053
Speaker 0: There's a whole history of wad files and why they were called that.

349
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:13,736
Speaker 0: it's kind of amazing.

350
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:14,499
Speaker 0: We'll skip all that.

351
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:25,303
Speaker 0: this is a YouTube thing that's got like 20 views and it's just a playlist of a bunch of video of the interface To wadded.

352
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:35,959
Speaker 0: this is the world I lived in and it's really interesting to look back at this interface and remember that I used to spend hours designing levels in this That are probably now gone.

353
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,588
Speaker 1: I've got them then no one will ever play.

354
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,555
Speaker 0: I could put if I put them on the forum.

355
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,639
Speaker 0: I'll bet people would play them.

356
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,925
Speaker 0: No, I don't have them.

357
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,309
Speaker 0: They're on that hard drive.

358
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:45,831
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

359
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,460
Speaker 0: I could pay someone to fix that hard drive.

360
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:50,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, the controller died.

361
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,836
Speaker 0: The platters are fine.

362
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:58,440
Speaker 1: Sure Yeah, so you ever seen you know that that foam that's shaped like egg crate, right?

363
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,320
Speaker 1: They call it egg crate I guess because you I guess if you put a bunch of eggs in it in the little cuppy parts, they would sort of right.

364
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:11,970
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm looking right now at a similar foam that's used to shield audio Surfaces and prevent echoes in a studio.

365
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,271
Speaker 0: Sure.

366
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,180
Speaker 1: Well, have you ever thought about how that foam was made?

367
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:25,359
Speaker 1: I mean we love videos showing me cool machines and factories that make stuff and work in a really interesting way and I thought just if you would have asked me how it was made, right?

368
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,533
Speaker 1: I would have said oh, they probably just squirt foam into a mold.

369
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,020
Speaker 1: That's the shape of an egg or something.

370
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would have thought something similar.

371
00:21:32,948 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 1: but well you did think something similar when I asked you that exactly we were both wrong.

372
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:40,380
Speaker 1: It's actually made in a much more clever way with this machine in this video.

373
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:41,983
Speaker 1: is the thing about this?

374
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:53,732
Speaker 1: is I had to watch this video and like actually look closely and think about it for a few seconds before I Really realized how it was working and then I was like, ah Genius clever girl.

375
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:54,699
Speaker 1: How about that?

376
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,083
Speaker 0: Hahaha Met a moment.

377
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:58,751
Speaker 0: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

378
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:00,460
Speaker 0: Scott has not updated the website yet.

379
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,925
Speaker 0: So let's send me.

380
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:02,889
Speaker 1: I got a. I don't do.

381
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,399
Speaker 1: I pretty much don't do anything unless I put a reminder in my.

382
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,454
Speaker 0: yeah Thingy, maybe that's what.

383
00:22:07,474 --> 00:22:08,442
Speaker 0: so you get home You just don't.

384
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:12,080
Speaker 0: you just sit there doing nothing until like a timer goes off time to make dinner.

385
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,550
Speaker 1: No But like anything like that That's not something that I would think to do or naturally want to do.

386
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,300
Speaker 1: I won't remember to do unless I put a reminder.

387
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:27,800
Speaker 0: Yes I'm so glad meanwhile that you've remind me repeatedly and publicly on Twitter if I forget to do something like that Because you just don't do things even if you're reminded.

388
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:35,064
Speaker 1: If I have a reminder I get the reminder and then I do Don't do the thing ever.

389
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,811
Speaker 0: I guess the book club book is still wool.

390
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:38,137
Speaker 0: So I got already read that.

391
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:38,960
Speaker 1: no, it's not.

392
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,821
Speaker 0: We're gonna be a kinetic on in July 13th.

393
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:47,120
Speaker 0: it's a fucking amazing con and you should be there.

394
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,365
Speaker 0: We're also doing some of our own panels.

395
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:50,093
Speaker 0: They're gonna be a pecs prime.

396
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,800
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be a pecs dev.

397
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,594
Speaker 0: I don't think Scott's gonna be a pecs dev.

398
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,464
Speaker 0: come say hi And go to pecs dev.

399
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:57,528
Speaker 1: probably not.

400
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,679
Speaker 1: No, you don't go to pecs dev unless someone else pays for it.

401
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,495
Speaker 0: Nah kickstart yourself going.

402
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:05,468
Speaker 0: no The Kickstarter will be.

403
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:06,193
Speaker 0: you'll make a game.

404
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:16,700
Speaker 1: No, I won't Listen, the only Kickstarter that I will ever do right that's gonna work is You give me enough money that I don't have to go to work and then I'll have time to fucking do something.

405
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:22,472
Speaker 1: If you guys want to pay my salary for like a whole year Then I will do something else that you want me to do.

406
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:24,120
Speaker 1: Otherwise, nothing's happening.

407
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:30,127
Speaker 0: So, yeah There was some news about level editors.

408
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:37,934
Speaker 0: that made us think to do this episode because I've actually been thinking a lot about level editors Independently of Scott saying hey, let's do a show on level editors.

409
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:38,859
Speaker 1: Well, I saw the e3.

410
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,039
Speaker 1: They announced this Mario level editor and I was like, oh, where was that?

411
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,927
Speaker 1: 25 years ago.

412
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:52,225
Speaker 0: Yeah 30 years ago at least 30 years ago while they could have had a level editor There was no way to monetize or community a fi that It didn't matter.

413
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:54,274
Speaker 1: a friggin excite bike had an editor.

414
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,440
Speaker 1: So why didn't Mario have one?

415
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that there probably wasn't enough space on the cartridge.

416
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:06,472
Speaker 1: Maybe no more copies of Mario 1 would have been sold but for like they could have on a Super Nintendo Right like a Mario all-stars.

417
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:09,910
Speaker 1: They could have had a level editor But again the cold calculus.

418
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,859
Speaker 0: would more of that have been sold?

419
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,454
Speaker 1: Listen had Mario paint even had the mouse.

420
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:15,440
Speaker 1: It would have been so easy.

421
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,323
Speaker 0: Yes, the mouse.

422
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:17,568
Speaker 0: who fucking owned that?

423
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,495
Speaker 0: a mouse other than you and me this other kid.

424
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:20,820
Speaker 1: I knew who is also named Scott.

425
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

426
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:22,659
Speaker 0: I dead mouse.

427
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,920
Speaker 0: I didn't amazing until I realized that games that needed Mouse did not support Mouse like Sim City.

428
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,485
Speaker 1: Only Mario Paint supported.

429
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:33,772
Speaker 0: no, no that King Arthur games supported it.

430
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,016
Speaker 1: I don't know what game you're talking about.

431
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:36,080
Speaker 0: Wow, really?

432
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:44,720
Speaker 1: My god, I'm gonna find only King Arthur game I know for Super Nintendo is like kid King Arthur or something or is it Merlin's son or something?

433
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,843
Speaker 0: What that game sucks.

434
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,149
Speaker 1: It was it was a garbage game.

435
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,759
Speaker 0: So you never played King Arthur's World never heard of it.

436
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,243
Speaker 0: Imagine lemmings.

437
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:58,260
Speaker 0: Okay, but you all the guys instead of being lemmings are troops that have different attack.

438
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:58,942
Speaker 1: So is this?

439
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:04,520
Speaker 1: how is this different from King Arthur's gold, which is that new game that we bought but didn't play vaguely similar?

440
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,182
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah How about that?

441
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,816
Speaker 0: I should live stream some fucking King Arthur's World because I can use the mouse.

442
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:11,960
Speaker 0: It's gonna be awesome.

443
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:13,011
Speaker 0: I'm so down with this.

444
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:13,416
Speaker 0: I'm doing it.

445
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,535
Speaker 1: Anyway, so level editors right in tender should have released this level editor a long time ago.

446
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:19,539
Speaker 1: So it took them 30 years.

447
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,853
Speaker 1: So I guess the Pokemon MMO should have been released 10 years ago.

448
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,518
Speaker 1: So 20 years to go till the Pokemon.

449
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:28,224
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Can't count down.

450
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:35,329
Speaker 1: in 2034 when the Rangers are back in this and they got finals again because that happens every 20 years You'll also get the Pokemon MMO.

451
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,219
Speaker 1: finally put it in your calendar.

452
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:46,080
Speaker 1: Yeah level editors It used to be a lot of games came with a level editor that I'd usually just ignore and only occasionally use.

453
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean now it seems very few.

454
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:49,680
Speaker 1: if no games come with it.

455
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,080
Speaker 1: It's like you can still mod some modern games But you sort of have to code and use your own tools and it's a pain in the ass.

456
00:25:56,261 --> 00:25:57,345
Speaker 0: It's a launch game.

457
00:25:57,486 --> 00:26:00,700
Speaker 1: They don't give you like the user user friendly level editors.

458
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:17,809
Speaker 0: So when I got my Super Nintendo for Christmas There was a game that I had on it because there weren't that many games out in 1992 91 RPM racing Radical psycho machine racing.

459
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,563
Speaker 0: Yep that game had a track editor Mm-hmm.

460
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:25,394
Speaker 0: Actually, it was a surprisingly full featured track editor.

461
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:29,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see what it's a civilization - Right, yeah and Matt right.

462
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,200
Speaker 1: Sim City 2000.

463
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,297
Speaker 0: Well Sim City 2000 because the game is about editing a map.

464
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:39,909
Speaker 1: in a sense No, but they had the pre before you started playing the.

465
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,654
Speaker 0: yes, you could articulate your splines.

466
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 1: I flattened the whole man.

467
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we pancake because what a nice coastline and a nice river.

468
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,420
Speaker 1: to make it as easy as humanly possible.

469
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:55,660
Speaker 0: Yeah You're the same person who would play Civ to put all the other civilizations on one square islands in the middle of nowhere.

470
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,800
Speaker 1: Not one square islands because then they could have boats.

471
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:04,105
Speaker 1: I made islands exactly the radius of a city and I put their city right in the middle So they couldn't possibly ever boat.

472
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:11,619
Speaker 1: and then I would make myself a nice beautiful large island fill it up with cities Boat over and shoot them one at a time with cruise missiles.

473
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:13,778
Speaker 0: Why would you do that?

474
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:24,100
Speaker 1: It was easy Because if I played the game normally, you know what happened I would get to the point where like I had way too many troops and I could win the game.

475
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:26,998
Speaker 1: But it's like oh, it's too much effort to sit here for another two hours.

476
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:27,320
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

477
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,068
Speaker 0: And yeah, I remember when I play the game with Ken.

478
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,620
Speaker 0: He was a really big fan of doing the fanatic stuff.

479
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:32,938
Speaker 1: So I did that too.

480
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:40,718
Speaker 1: Yeah when you've got Every single hex would have a fortress with full irrigation and a railroad and a fortified fanatic.

481
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:43,652
Speaker 1: Yep They didn't have any maintenance.

482
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:44,680
Speaker 1: so I could just make a million.

483
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,200
Speaker 1: I would just be pumping fanatics across the Trans-siberian railroad that I think someone would come over with like some real military units.

484
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,620
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't care what unit you have.

485
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,913
Speaker 1: I have like a hundred fanatics stacked up in my city.

486
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,120
Speaker 1: It won't matter.

487
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:07,031
Speaker 0: But in RPM racing what I would do with the level editor is we would my brother and I would always make large open world maps by using the pluses because the game didn't.

488
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:11,623
Speaker 0: it only checked that the integrity of the map met these like Minimal requirements.

489
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:17,520
Speaker 0: so we'd make these giant like multi-directional maps and we never raised because the racing was not that fun.

490
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:21,978
Speaker 0: We play tag effectively or king of the hill or something like that.

491
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,150
Speaker 0: instead We'd always like hack together our own game on top of it man.

492
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,400
Speaker 0: Even stunts 4d racing had a level editor.

493
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,777
Speaker 0: Wow, a really advanced level editor, too.

494
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,028
Speaker 0: What if people still play that game?

495
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,339
Speaker 0: What if there's a speedrun community around that?

496
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,760
Speaker 0: But there when it comes to these level editors the embed there's three different types of level editors when you really think about it.

497
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,326
Speaker 0: There's the internal tool.

498
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:55,800
Speaker 0: like if I made a game engine or like I made a new Mario game What tool do I give to my designers who are making levels in that game?

499
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,323
Speaker 0: Like what do we use?

500
00:28:57,343 --> 00:29:01,180
Speaker 0: We're not just gonna write raw code every time we make a level.

501
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,379
Speaker 0: There's more efficient ways to do that in most cases.

502
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:05,265
Speaker 0: But then there's the level of.

503
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:10,100
Speaker 0: do you make an editor like that for the users like Scott brought up those kinds of editors?

504
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,280
Speaker 0: Like hey make new levels in Mario.

505
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:21,700
Speaker 0: those need Radically different interfaces and affordances because you have to assume that the people making the games know a lot less about your engine.

506
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:40,576
Speaker 0: I mean, no one's going to be attaching scripts to objects in like a Mario editor that they release on the Wii U. Nope, nope, and then the third level are the fan Editors meaning there's a game that does not have an editor and fans make their own editors.

507
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:44,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the Super Mario Super Mario World things.

508
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,128
Speaker 1: you see we're like some.

509
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,376
Speaker 1: they create some ridiculous combo right.

510
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:48,760
Speaker 1: that like does something crazy.

511
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:50,457
Speaker 1: We've done those this thing of the days before.

512
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,086
Speaker 1: yeah We have the results of using those level editors or like the Mario paint that you can just download Yep, or like.

513
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:57,779
Speaker 0: there was id software's editor for doom.

514
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:08,119
Speaker 0: but I would use all these fan created things that actually worked in fundamentally different ways and Some of them were kind of broken and some were kind of better than id's editor itself.

515
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:12,171
Speaker 0: but Each of these is like a totally different topic.

516
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:13,739
Speaker 0: you'd almost do a separate show on all of them.

517
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,673
Speaker 1: I mean, all right, so let's just let's just talk about some right.

518
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:18,080
Speaker 1: So what do you think is the best?

519
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,028
Speaker 1: Official editor that came with a game that you've ever seen.

520
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:26,319
Speaker 0: I can't get past stunts 40 racing right now.

521
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:30,574
Speaker 0: Actually, the advanced wars level editor was super good.

522
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:31,700
Speaker 1: Oh, that is a good one.

523
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,059
Speaker 0: It let you make really really crazily arbitrarily put together maps.

524
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:38,628
Speaker 1: You make any map you wanted pretty much pretty much.

525
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:44,615
Speaker 0: the only constraints really was just the sheer size of the maps Yep, but you can even put like weird units.

526
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:45,721
Speaker 0: you could do anything I would.

527
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:50,257
Speaker 0: I made some really I think amazing advanced wars maps that no one will ever play with me.

528
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:52,343
Speaker 0: So it won't matter My think.

529
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,978
Speaker 1: the one is the one that most people don't even know about which is on the n64.

530
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:07,960
Speaker 1: There was an f-zero game f-zero X which is pretty much just f-zero GX of shitty graphics And there was a level editor for you can make f-zero tracks the 3d kind with the loops and everything.

531
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:11,959
Speaker 1: Oh, that's you know, and it's like there's pretty much nothing like that.

532
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:19,313
Speaker 1: Right, and then you get to play basically real f-zero on it not some, you know gimpy racing game But f-zero for reals, you know.

533
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:25,279
Speaker 0: when I was in you know A young boy and I was playing stunts 40 racing because that editor was so complex.

534
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:35,100
Speaker 0: 40 racing was like the thing in my high school So people would pass around discs with their high scores and their maps and compete on each other's maps.

535
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:47,259
Speaker 0: I was really obsessed with making maps that had multiple ways to go and I was Particularly obsessed with making them such that they all took about the same amount of time no matter how good you were.

536
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:53,479
Speaker 0: And I was triply obsessed with designing those maps to where there was actually one way to go.

537
00:31:53,861 --> 00:32:00,746
Speaker 0: That was a clever shortcut that catered to my skills so that I could make ridiculous times and beat all my friends Mm-hmm.

538
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:01,755
Speaker 0: It's kind of a dick.

539
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:07,100
Speaker 1: when it came to that How is that any different from me making the sieve map with an island for each bad guy?

540
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,320
Speaker 0: Because I was at least doing this to cause other people to feel bad.

541
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:14,950
Speaker 0: You were making a rudimentary AI field nothing.

542
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,354
Speaker 1: if I played it multiplayer.

543
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:18,440
Speaker 1: Someone would have felt really bad starting on that.

544
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:22,214
Speaker 1: No boat possibilities plus mine revolve.

545
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:28,933
Speaker 0: one at least a level of subtlety And two it still required skill to pull it off and get that time.

546
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:37,126
Speaker 1: Listen, it required skill Skill of patience to sit there and so you can get boats and blow everyone up All right.

547
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:40,760
Speaker 1: So what game do you wish had an editor but does not?

548
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:46,134
Speaker 0: Well, I could almost cheat there because what about games where there is an editor?

549
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:57,733
Speaker 0: but it is beyond my ability to Use effectively or to where I could do something amazing with it But for the lack of time and energy willing to be.

550
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:59,520
Speaker 1: that's true for every editor.

551
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:03,700
Speaker 1: Even something that doesn't take too long to make like say Starcraft comes to the level editor.

552
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,413
Speaker 1: Right a Starcraft map doesn't take that long to make.

553
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,855
Speaker 1: it takes a long time to perfect it But not a long time to make it.

554
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:09,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,679
Speaker 1: But it's like you still had to put in a lot of time to make a good Starcraft map that anyone wants to play on.

556
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's more than games that had level editors.

557
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:25,920
Speaker 0: I wish they had used their level editors to more effectively let people compete with said levels.

558
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:30,053
Speaker 0: I want games to integrate level editors into the core game.

559
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:31,076
Speaker 0: Here's an example.

560
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:35,070
Speaker 0: Imagine a Mario game Where it has a multiplayer mode, here's the way the mode works.

561
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:45,640
Speaker 0: I design a level you design a level We then play our own level and the other person's level and then whoever has the highest score wins.

562
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,966
Speaker 1: See, it's play both maps.

563
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:47,509
Speaker 1: Yes.

564
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

565
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,885
Speaker 0: Castlevania on the DS.

566
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,153
Speaker 0: the the first one actually had a thing like that in it.

567
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:56,000
Speaker 1: Have you played Jason roars?

568
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:57,419
Speaker 1: castle doctrine?

569
00:33:58,502 --> 00:33:59,144
Speaker 0: No, I have not.

570
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:09,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's a game where basically you make a house According to certain rules and then you put your stuffs in it and people try to break into your house and you try to break into other people's houses.

571
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:14,958
Speaker 1: So it's basically level editing the game and also navigating other people's levels the game.

572
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,284
Speaker 0: Yep You know what?

573
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,072
Speaker 0: It's you know what these all come down to.

574
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:18,353
Speaker 0: you know what.

575
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:23,992
Speaker 0: there's one type of game That is actually perfected that except that they usually don't do it with multiplayer.

576
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:26,339
Speaker 0: That is the tower defense game.

577
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:32,540
Speaker 0: You put the games are basically edit a map and make it as cheap and opportunistic as possible.

578
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:36,320
Speaker 1: There is a tower wars game, but it wasn't that good.

579
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:43,411
Speaker 1: I played it on Steam a few times and it's you basically simultaneously make a map and Send bad guys to attack the other guy.

580
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:47,696
Speaker 1: You're basically doing both at once Right, and he's and they're doing both at once to you, right?

581
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,880
Speaker 1: But you're like their bad guys interact with your map and your bad guys interact with their map, but that's about it.

582
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,219
Speaker 1: There's no other interaction going on.

583
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,337
Speaker 1: So it's really like you're just playing two games at once and who can play both games better?

584
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,727
Speaker 0: true I think they're.

585
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:04,180
Speaker 0: you know, we're kind of going down a road.

586
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,459
Speaker 0: I think there's a big distinction here because of an editor that's within the context of a competition or a game is Part of the game.

587
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:19,235
Speaker 0: But yet when we talk about editors We're usually talking about an external meta of a way to create levels within a game.

588
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,419
Speaker 0: I think they are actually fundamentally distinct.

589
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:34,260
Speaker 0: the most interesting thing that I'm surprised people haven't taken advantage of more yet is Straight up monetizing that and having community sharing map things which you see.

590
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,960
Speaker 0: Yes That's not widespread in other areas.

591
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:44,420
Speaker 0: A lot of games don't give you those capabilities or they don't use the community factors effectively.

592
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:46,187
Speaker 1: Well, these team workshop you can.

593
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:49,680
Speaker 1: there's the portal map editing right and some of those are really good.

594
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,878
Speaker 1: I've played a whole bunch of them the especially the co-op ones with some people, right?

595
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:04,198
Speaker 1: So like if you have a friend and you've played a whole bunch of portal and you just wish you're waiting for portal 3 to Come out like portals the kind of game where I'll actually beat it because it's that good But then I won't play it again.

596
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:08,927
Speaker 1: But hey, it's like if there was new portal I would play that right away.

597
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,272
Speaker 1: and there is new portals.

598
00:36:10,412 --> 00:36:12,420
Speaker 1: people made it and a lot of it's not bad.

599
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's even portal racing maps.

600
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:17,293
Speaker 1: Those are pretty fun, too If you have a friend to play them with.

601
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,600
Speaker 1: yep The way they work is basically you race around in a circle on a racetrack using portals.

602
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:33,265
Speaker 1: But you can also like with your portal skills, you know Like trigger obstacles that will you know harm the other players set them back and such, you know You know what those are like.

603
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:35,191
Speaker 0: gorge race pretty much.

604
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,194
Speaker 1: Yeah scored race.

605
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,939
Speaker 0: I kind of want to play old gorge race.

606
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:41,244
Speaker 1: now I'll play portal to co-op Race.

607
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:47,303
Speaker 0: man gorge race was only fun though because of how fucking broken it was Pretty much.

608
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it wasn't broken.

609
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:49,453
Speaker 1: it would've been too easy.

610
00:36:49,473 --> 00:37:04,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, but At least ignoring the monetary aspects their Nintendo should have made things like this and made them available a long time ago Because that would have added a lot of long-term street cred Replayability to some of their games.

611
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:14,480
Speaker 0: they could have with the with the DS even Made ways for people to get maps and share maps and that could have been a whole like Nintendo community store thing.

612
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,065
Speaker 0: But we know they're afraid of communities.

613
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:17,891
Speaker 0: They're afraid of people talking to each other.

614
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,479
Speaker 0: They're basically afraid of anything innovative at this point.

615
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,309
Speaker 1: Well, they're gonna be forced into it, right?

616
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,960
Speaker 1: I think someone said desperate Nintendo is best Nintendo.

617
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:28,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they'll start doing things they don't want to do.

618
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:30,676
Speaker 1: That we need them to do.

619
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll see.

620
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:35,593
Speaker 0: because when was I mean when tenor was desperate before?

621
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,980
Speaker 0: were they even that desperate in the GameCube era?

622
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,951
Speaker 0: I mean GameCube was just the next iteration of Nintendo.

623
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:41,714
Speaker 1: the GameCube.

624
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:45,230
Speaker 1: I don't think was really Necessarily super amazing.

625
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,520
Speaker 1: It was just good.

626
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,420
Speaker 0: It was like solid Nintendo, right?

627
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:48,942
Speaker 1: But it was.

628
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:53,585
Speaker 1: it happened to be at the time when we had a bunch of people in the same place to play all those Four-player games.

629
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:56,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then if GameCube came out now, we'd be like whatevs.

630
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,132
Speaker 0: I would have played a lot of those single-player games especially like.

631
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:00,680
Speaker 0: I mean that f-zero was amazing.

632
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:05,968
Speaker 0: If you want to just make yourself feel miserable Yeah, I don't know.

633
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,131
Speaker 1: yeah, how can?

634
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,020
Speaker 1: there wasn't one on the Wii yeah, but this level editor?

635
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:21,559
Speaker 0: Yes, because at least from the screens we see it looks like it's ultra ultra Intuitive which is what a consumer fan facing editor needs to be.

636
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,380
Speaker 0: I mean I could make an editor for a game.

637
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:35,181
Speaker 0: Like if I made a game I could have an editor that a developer could use and that would be perfect for our internal use And it would also be perfect for like high-level fans Like.

638
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:39,225
Speaker 0: that's a way to engage the people who are really into your game Like the.

639
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:54,180
Speaker 0: the community of people who make maps for Counter-Strike Valve has a vested interest in keeping those people happy and giving those people the tools they need To make more levels to give their own game more replayability over time.

640
00:38:55,102 --> 00:39:03,328
Speaker 0: But at the same time that tool the tools you use to make Counter-Strike maps are literally beyond the reach of 99.9% of humans like.

641
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,400
Speaker 1: I could learn it if I wanted to but I don't care.

642
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:11,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would take so much effort to learn that it would only be worth it if it was my job.

643
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:12,740
Speaker 0: They're expert tools.

644
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:19,200
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I don't enjoy doing it to the point where I would do it on my own on purpose And they're from a different perspective.

645
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:30,192
Speaker 0: those things are from the perspective of someone who knows how the engine works from from the inside and the outside and Knows how the game works like gameplay level design all those things.

646
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:35,100
Speaker 0: but because the game's so multifaceted There's so many aspects so many features.

647
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,060
Speaker 1: I think it's also because you know Counter-Strike is just like a full-on 3d game for reals.

648
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:43,200
Speaker 1: So just by the nature of technology, it's very complicated to make a map for it.

649
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,432
Speaker 1: It's very easy to make say a Starcraft map.

650
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:46,880
Speaker 1: It's just a grid, right?

651
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:53,420
Speaker 0: It's difficult to make a space an air and interesting Starcraft zero map isn't really any different than an excite bike map.

652
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,479
Speaker 1: There's a set number of components and you put them in a you know in a straight row together And then you eventually have to end where you started.

653
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:11,212
Speaker 0: yep, so but those games from a from a like interface perspective can still be really intuitive and Graspable by a normal person who was simply played the game super meat boy levels.

654
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:15,869
Speaker 0: really easy to make but it's really hard to make Those games that are well-designed?

655
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:16,311
Speaker 1: sure.

656
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:16,913
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

657
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,519
Speaker 1: I mean that's true for any game, right?

658
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, but technologically speaking right.

659
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:28,639
Speaker 1: the software to edit with a good user interface You know and the ability of a person to at least make a legal legitimate map made.

660
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:33,880
Speaker 1: Well, even if it's crappy it's possible with a you know, a two-dimensional grid based game.

661
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:42,539
Speaker 0: but meanwhile I remember like doom like I know the inside and out of doom and all the line deaths and side deaths and pegging textures to things and all that crap.

662
00:40:43,182 --> 00:40:46,411
Speaker 0: But when quake one came out, I was like man.

663
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:49,340
Speaker 0: I'm really into this level making modding community for doom.

664
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:53,437
Speaker 0: I should get on board with quake and That lasted about an hour.

665
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,185
Speaker 1: I've had the half-life.

666
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:56,907
Speaker 1: What was it?

667
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,335
Speaker 1: I forget with the thing hammer tool, whatever.

668
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:13,269
Speaker 1: Yeah war hammer I don't know what remember they had some tool and the icon was a hammer and I basically I succeeded in making a map That was a big box room and for natural selection - same thing I made a map that was a room.

669
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:15,220
Speaker 1: that was a big box like a hallway sticking out of it.

670
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:29,995
Speaker 0: But a game like Mario is so perfect because the only people are gonna mess around with that level editor are people who already know how Mario works and Mario has a very simple set of User interfaces and things like mushrooms pop out.

671
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,040
Speaker 0: We know how mushrooms work.

672
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,150
Speaker 0: We know pipes working out piranha plants work.

673
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,040
Speaker 0: None of those things need to be configurable.

674
00:41:35,502 --> 00:41:36,024
Speaker 0: You just are.

675
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:42,790
Speaker 0: it's almost like making a diorama and then playing around in the diorama And I can do stuff that other Mario games never dared to do.

676
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,776
Speaker 1: for example a hole so big.

677
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:51,640
Speaker 1: you can't jump over it But there are hidden blocks above the hole, but you can't step on them because they haven't been hit yet.

678
00:41:51,741 --> 00:42:00,292
Speaker 1: So the only way to get across is to get the turtle shell Kick it over cross the hole so that it hits one of those blocks Making the coin come out making the block appear.

679
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,980
Speaker 1: then the shell bounces back at you.

680
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,127
Speaker 1: You better dodge that shit.

681
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:06,746
Speaker 1: and now you have created us a foothold By which to get over now.

682
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:13,578
Speaker 1: granted a lot of people have made things like that sure But that you know, it's just like an example of something that Nintendo would know like.

683
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,100
Speaker 0: look at this video.

684
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,439
Speaker 0: Look at this stack of piranha plants just hanging out here.

685
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,852
Speaker 1: Yeah It's a nice map.

686
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,595
Speaker 1: See that's Nintendo's basically saying.

687
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:26,994
Speaker 1: look Here's things that you could do with this editor that we have never dared to do.

688
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:33,117
Speaker 0: all it took for Nintendo to do This was have many years of history of fans doing it on their own.

689
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:40,600
Speaker 0: Yep But anyone can make a Mario map and they the level editor actually looks super good like it.

690
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,693
Speaker 1: Is this a Wii U thing or 3ds thing?

691
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:43,719
Speaker 0: Wii U looks like.

692
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,206
Speaker 1: Why can't it be a 3ds thing?

693
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:46,868
Speaker 1: There's no reason.

694
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:49,719
Speaker 0: There's no reason except they need you to buy Wii U.

695
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:50,325
Speaker 1: I don't.

696
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,437
Speaker 1: we're gonna buy like.

697
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:51,740
Speaker 0: look at this.

698
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:51,901
Speaker 0: They.

699
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:54,800
Speaker 0: they show you right up that you can edit the levels while you're playing them.

700
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:08,560
Speaker 0: So poke around in the level like test something change something while you're in the level and then keep playing it and the interface Not only looks exactly like Mario Paint, but it has the same icons as Mario Paint.

701
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:11,508
Speaker 0: It's got a Mario Paint theme going on.

702
00:43:11,528 --> 00:43:14,560
Speaker 1: Can I put can I put a swan out in the map it though?

703
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:23,079
Speaker 0: Oh my god If only if only If only it had the Mario Paint music editor in it and you can put the music you made in the Mario Paint music editor in the Mario level.

704
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:32,513
Speaker 0: That's the kind of stuff that Nintendo never does but I would like them to do Even though again, no additional sales though.

705
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,239
Speaker 0: I might buy a Wii U if they did all that.

706
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:39,547
Speaker 0: I'm worried about how they're gonna Handle this on the community side.

707
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:42,159
Speaker 0: How easy will it actually be for me to share levels with people?

708
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:45,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, like can I just put a level on the internet?

709
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,564
Speaker 0: I think not.

710
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:50,902
Speaker 1: but here's the thing even if this is perfect in every way, right and I bought a Wii U And I got it.

711
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:54,252
Speaker 1: how much of my life would I devote to this really?

712
00:43:54,272 --> 00:43:56,459
Speaker 0: Ah, well, that's the thing making a man.

713
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,323
Speaker 1: We already I know.

714
00:43:57,363 --> 00:44:02,964
Speaker 1: that's the reason I talked about like, you know, yeah, I doesn't have time for this shit anymore Even if it's really good It's like.

715
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:05,039
Speaker 1: am I gonna give up some other?

716
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,380
Speaker 1: Hobby that I have to become to get into the Mario map editing community and make that my thing?

717
00:44:10,562 --> 00:44:11,717
Speaker 0: Well, there are two.

718
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,627
Speaker 1: Then it's not worth it.

719
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:16,459
Speaker 0: two ways to be involved in a thing like that.

720
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:24,498
Speaker 0: The first way is if you're going to make levels for other people like and you had to have a twitch stream where I'm streaming Myself making the levels.

721
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:26,585
Speaker 0: but what like?

722
00:44:26,806 --> 00:44:34,295
Speaker 0: I could have fun making levels for games like this and Making them because I know that my friends will play them like hey everybody.

723
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:36,002
Speaker 0: I made a new level play it I don't have.

724
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:37,187
Speaker 1: who do we?

725
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:40,420
Speaker 1: how many people do we know are gonna play and stick with the Mario level making?

726
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:49,319
Speaker 1: You know, we have a core of about ten people I think tops who would do and all of them are gonna do it and go all in on Mario Matt making and we're gonna Talk about Mario making all the time.

727
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Mario couldn't get to the castle.

728
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a wall beyond the flag.

729
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:08,359
Speaker 0: Yep, so making it for your friends like having a local community where you and your friends occasionally make maps and fuck around with them Like you whip out the crazy map you made when people sure if we already had we use I'll be.

730
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,459
Speaker 1: you know I'd be perfectly willing to buy this game and do that, but it's not something to buy away you from.

731
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,239
Speaker 0: non It's definitely not something to buy away you for.

732
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,555
Speaker 0: But the other way 3ds's.

733
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:17,998
Speaker 1: it was on 3ds.

734
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:19,320
Speaker 1: I could see it happening.

735
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:28,327
Speaker 0: The other way to get into it is like you were saying if you're gonna double down on trying to make these for a wider audience like you're making them to flex your Fundamental game design skills.

736
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:29,731
Speaker 0: You're in the game industry.

737
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:32,300
Speaker 0: You're practicing like basic game design.

738
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:40,307
Speaker 0: those are the two reasons to have and use this and Only one of those warrants buying a Wii U.

739
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:41,129
Speaker 1: Yep.

740
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:54,580
Speaker 1: I also think the editing tools are really the most useful For games that have some sort of competitive community right like I talked about the Starcraft map editor They make like the maps of Starcraft comes with are not good for Starcraft tournaments.

741
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:55,483
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

742
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:58,716
Speaker 1: they make the maps that are for the Starcraft tournaments.

743
00:45:58,736 --> 00:45:59,860
Speaker 1: They didn't have that map editor.

744
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:08,927
Speaker 1: They wouldn't really be able to have you know fairly competitive maps that are also interesting and it would be kind of lame And they probably wouldn't competitive.

745
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:11,900
Speaker 1: Starcraft wouldn't be where it is today without that map editor.

746
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:21,125
Speaker 1: So, you know pretty much any competitive game wouldn't be where any video game really wouldn't make it without some sort of editing capabilities Right to sort of.

747
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,432
Speaker 1: you know craft the game, you know to fix problems with the rules that are unfair You know.

748
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:33,887
Speaker 1: yet Even every game always has that tournament mod of some kind that does the things that the base game does not do to make it Tournament viable right?

749
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:34,490
Speaker 0: Yep.

750
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,720
Speaker 1: So it's like you don't really see Mario tournaments.

751
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,620
Speaker 1: You see Mario speedruns, but maybe with the Mario map editor that could open the door to real competitive Mario.

752
00:46:44,010 --> 00:47:00,071
Speaker 0: in fact imagine this imagine at a place like magfest get some of those speedrun people and have a tournament where a Bunch of people at magfest ahead of time made maps that no one has ever seen before and they have a one-time Race on those maps.

753
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:11,035
Speaker 1: live with no prep Yeah, but all the people who basically had to be blindfolded and you unblindfold them one at a time as they play Yep, or you know, what I would do is just make it simultaneous.

754
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,968
Speaker 0: Oh One two three go.

755
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:19,130
Speaker 0: there's ten people with ten projectors Simultaneously running the same special map.

756
00:47:19,612 --> 00:47:19,773
Speaker 1: go.

757
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:21,260
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah ten projectors you do that.

758
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,996
Speaker 0: You could make that happen at a con like Paxer magfest.

759
00:47:24,037 --> 00:47:25,725
Speaker 0: trivially Not trivially.

760
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:29,140
Speaker 1: ten projectors a lot to have in one place at one time where everyone can see them all.

761
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:30,799
Speaker 0: There's spaces for it.

762
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:38,972
Speaker 0: I sort of have to have everyone playing on a TV and then four projectors because you're not how many of those people in that Community who are good enough to even compete on that level.

763
00:47:39,012 --> 00:47:40,740
Speaker 0: You're gonna get at the same time at any convention.

764
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:49,817
Speaker 0: I mean imagine if it was like you and me and a bunch of people we know in a tournament like that Like one of us would beat it like minutes before everybody else.

765
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:52,238
Speaker 0: probably It would be the worst.

766
00:47:53,441 --> 00:48:01,880
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's it's weird though that like you think a lot of the games that had editors Alright or have them now are some of like the top games of all time.

767
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:12,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because let editors let a competitive game be interesting from multiple perspectives Effectively indefinitely unless the game is so simple that game literally explored every interesting thing You could do.

768
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:22,959
Speaker 1: games that have no capability to be edited or modded in any way are Much more likely to disappear or you know and are not remembered and are not as.

769
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:23,160
Speaker 1: yeah.

770
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,980
Speaker 0: I mean, no one remembers games like the Legend of Zelda.

771
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,620
Speaker 1: They're less likely to be remembered especially their multiplayer of some kind.

772
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, right like and you know, what games do you know that have an editor just sort of disappeared?

773
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:39,300
Speaker 1: No one cares.

774
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:49,831
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of single-player games have editors within themselves for like these kind of ghetto one-off half-assed Multiplayer competitive modes, but those don't really count.

775
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,900
Speaker 1: you're talking about something that really, you know, something significant.

776
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:54,950
Speaker 1: Right, like you can make a completely custom map.

777
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:56,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean don't.

778
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:59,243
Speaker 0: who plays sieve - these days People play sieve though.

779
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:00,224
Speaker 0: Did you play sieve?

780
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:09,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
