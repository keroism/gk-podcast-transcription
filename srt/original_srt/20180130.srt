1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,630
Speaker 1: I need something that's risk-free.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,119
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, January 30th, 2018.

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:13,340
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:16,327
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,190
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

6
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:21,349
Speaker 0: We're talking about the adorable Ratineer.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,153
Speaker 1: Yar.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:22,434
Speaker 0: Yar.

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:22,877
Speaker 0: Yar.

10
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:23,139
Speaker 0: Yar.

11
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:23,804
Speaker 0: Yar.

12
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:26,909
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

13
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,479
Speaker 0: It's been a while since we've done a Tuesday show, because we've been out of town and busy.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,979
Speaker 1: It's been a while since we did any show.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Tuesdays are the easiest shows to do, because we actually do play a lot of games.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,019
Speaker 0: Almost every convention we go to is a gaming con.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,039
Speaker 1: Well, because you only do two shows a month of gaming, assuming we don't bail.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,739
Speaker 1: And when you go to one convention, you're playing like ten board games.

19
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:55,060
Speaker 1: So that's getting you five months, which definitely carries you to the next convention.

20
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,199
Speaker 1: And that's just board games, not any other games.

21
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:02,319
Speaker 0: All the non-Geek Nights stuff we do, it's like 80% gaming right now.

22
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,440
Speaker 1: It's also really easy to find gaming news.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,859
Speaker 0: And it's also really easy to make gaming news by just reviewing something briefly.

25
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:10,791
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're back.

26
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:11,739
Speaker 0: It's a Tuesday show.

27
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:18,800
Speaker 0: If you saw us at MAGFest or PAX Unplugged, and you wondered why we were talking about anime or neckbeards or whatever, tonight's your night.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,120
Speaker 0: We're actually talking about games.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,779
Speaker 0: It's every other Tuesday we do this.

30
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,083
Speaker 1: Yeah.

31
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,740
Speaker 0: So right off the bat, we got some news.

32
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:31,920
Speaker 0: If you might know, in fact, one of our more popular YouTube videos is us teaching a bunch of people how to play Tigris.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,858
Speaker 1: Hey, you're stealing my news.

34
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,959
Speaker 0: And Euphrates, I'm introducing your news, like the MC.

35
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:36,559
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,460
Speaker 0: Tigris and Euphrates is literally our favorite board game.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,160
Speaker 0: And I don't say that lightly.

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Speaker 1: At Panguicon 2.0, in ancient times, there were many legendary things that occurred there.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,240
Speaker 0: We met Steve Jackson.

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:02:03,079
Speaker 1: One of the legendary things that happened was we went into a room of board games, which we discovered too late into the convention, and there were some employees from then-thriving Mayfair games, and they had this game, T&E, which I had vaguely heard of.

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,532
Speaker 0: That they had just published in the U.S No, it had just published.

42
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:11,436
Speaker 0: Remember, the tiles we were playing with were mixed in German and U.S.

43
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,499
Speaker 0: tiles because they didn't have enough pieces.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,231
Speaker 1: The game had been in the U.S.

45
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:15,940
Speaker 1: for a while.

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,940
Speaker 0: But they had just done a printing of it, and it was a different-sized tile.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,040
Speaker 0: The

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,409
Speaker 1: point was that I

49
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:21,818
Speaker 0: had heard of this

50
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:26,272
Speaker 1: game, and they taught us how to play, and we played, and we were like,

51
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:26,656
Speaker 1: "Whoa."

52
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:36,619
Speaker 1: And then we bought it, and then we proceeded to play it many, many, many, many times, and to this day, there are games that we play at a PAX, and before the PAX is over, we're done with it.

53
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:47,291
Speaker 1: T&E, a game that we have played perhaps as long as most games that we played, tabletop-wise, and still play it, and we are not done with it.

54
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,879
Speaker 0: Even three-player Puerto Rico ran out of plays, but T&E did not.

55
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,419
Speaker 0: So, what's your news, Scott?

56
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,960
Speaker 0: Why am I talking about Tigris and Euphrates?

57
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,348
Speaker 0: Well, Dr.

58
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:02,037
Speaker 1: K, Rainer Canizia, the creator of, not Puerto Rico, T&E.

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,755
Speaker 0: I've never heard anyone call him Dr.

60
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,200
Speaker 0: K before.

61
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,352
Speaker 1: I've been calling him Dr.

62
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:05,940
Speaker 1: K all the time.

63
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,940
Speaker 0: I've never heard you do that, but I'm gonna also start doing that, 'cause I like that.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,519
Speaker 1: I decided to do it on my own.

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,140
Speaker 1: I never heard anyone else do it, and I just kept doing it.

66
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 1: I don't know if that'll make him mad, but if it does, oh, well.

67
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:18,520
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be your first follow.

68
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

69
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,195
Speaker 1: But anyway, so Rainer Canizia, also known as Dr.

70
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:27,580
Speaker 1: K, and not the one who helps you kill yourself.

71
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:29,057
Speaker 1: Not that Dr.

72
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:29,118
Speaker 1: K.

73
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,372
Speaker 0: Not Dr.

74
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:30,599
Speaker 0: Dre.

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:48,760
Speaker 1: No, he is a man who has prolifically made a bunch of amazing board games, including T&E, and he has announced and put out the pictures and press release and the rule book for a as-yet unpublished game called Yellow and Yangtze.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,700
Speaker 0: You might recognize those as being the names of rivers.

77
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:59,560
Speaker 1: In a different part of the world than the Tigris and the Afraidys, and basically this game is T&E with hexes instead of squares.

78
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,053
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

79
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:06,560
Speaker 1: And also rules modifications to accommodate the hexes instead of squares.

80
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:17,139
Speaker 0: I cannot stress to you how much the news that this is T&E with hexes matters to people like me, Scott, and our friend Pete, and our friend Alex.

81
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:27,560
Speaker 1: Like, the fact that this would come out so many years after T&E, that would be like if Nintendo put out like, you know, well, I guess Nintendo does do that, the F-Zero, and then wait 20 years and then another F-Zero.

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,986
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

83
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:28,535
Speaker 1: -That's what this is.

84
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,440
Speaker 0: But that doesn't happen with the things we care about usually.

85
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,740
Speaker 1: No, but, yeah, well, we care about F-Zeros.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,342
Speaker 1: -Eh.

87
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:39,179
Speaker 1: -Anyway, so, yeah, this is gonna get, like, insta-bought and played a zillion times.

88
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:45,998
Speaker 0: So, what we're thinking about doing is T&E is a game that we, you know, we love it, we know it inside out, we're kind of obsessed with it.

89
00:04:46,861 --> 00:05:05,920
Speaker 0: I'm really curious what it'll be like with hexes, because if you've played any game, it doesn't matter what kind of game it is, doesn't matter what the rules are in almost any capacity, changing between hexes, triangle grids, which you don't really use anymore, or squares, has profound impacts in ways that you might not realize.

90
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:11,139
Speaker 0: I'm really curious what the game of T&E is like with hexes.

91
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:17,910
Speaker 0: And I imagine that it is okay at minimum, because otherwise Dr.

92
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,379
Speaker 0: K would not have done this to us.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,046
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

94
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,020
Speaker 0: I wonder if it would work with triangles.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,731
Speaker 1: -You and your stupid triangles.

96
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:25,560
Speaker 0: -I like the triangle grid.

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,280
Speaker 1: For anyone who's not nerdy enough to realize, the hex map, it's like, why doesn't everyone use a square map?

98
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:40,260
Speaker 1: Well, the reason the hex map is the best map for all gaming is because each space is equally distant from any other space.

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Speaker 1: You move to any adjacent space, and you are moving the same distance, right?

100
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,920
Speaker 1: On a square map, if you move to say, you can only move four directions.

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,538
Speaker 1: If you try to move diagonally, you're actually moving a different distance because of the Pythagorean theorem, right?

102
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:57,700
Speaker 1: If you have a triangle map also, moving one space is not always the same unit of distance.

103
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:06,560
Speaker 1: On a hex map, moving one adjacent space always moves you the same distance in space, and so all movements are equal.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,979
Speaker 1: On a hex map, a hex map is the perfect and best map for all games, which require movement of dudes around on the map.

105
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,576
Speaker 0: However, hex maps have some-- Well, one, there's no movement in T&E.

106
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:22,220
Speaker 1: That's what I didn't say, but just saying, for games that require movement, say Battletech--.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Speaker 0: Also, you, by saying that it is the best way to deal with movement, you are really discounting the triangle grid.

108
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am discounting your stupid triangle grid.

109
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,199
Speaker 0: Triangle grids have a time and a place.

110
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:33,880
Speaker 1: No, they don't.

111
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,139
Speaker 1: You're just obsessed with triangle grids lately because you've realized that orthogonal and diagonal are part of them.

112
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,240
Speaker 1: And that's how you do, is you get obsessed with a thing, and then that's a thing for you, regardless of merit.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:07:00,379
Speaker 0: The problem with hexes is that the definition of diagonal is crazy, but more importantly, hexes mean that there are six things directly adjacent to any other thing, as opposed to squares, where if you're doing orthogonal adjacency, there's only four things.

114
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,940
Speaker 0: That is a big deal for many things.

115
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,900
Speaker 0: That is a big deal for Tiggers and Euphrates.

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,760
Speaker 1: You know what we should do?

117
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,240
Speaker 0: That changes everything.

118
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,139
Speaker 1: You know what we should do, Rym?

119
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:09,739
Speaker 0: What should we do?

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,999
Speaker 1: We should just make hex carcass sound.

121
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:12,879
Speaker 0: I don't think it would be good.

122
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:13,858
Speaker 1: I want to play.

123
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,439
Speaker 0: I don't think hex carcass sound would be good.

124
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,655
Speaker 1: Surround that fucking, what's it called?

125
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,459
Speaker 1: It's going to be way easier.

126
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:22,600
Speaker 0: The cathedral?

127
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:23,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whatever.

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,519
Speaker 1: No, not the cathedral, the other one.

129
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:27,818
Speaker 0: What other one?

130
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,579
Speaker 1: The one where when it surrounds you take your guy off.

131
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:31,560
Speaker 0: Anything?

132
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,920
Speaker 1: No, the, you know.

133
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:34,640
Speaker 0: The cloister?

134
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,699
Speaker 0: We just did a panel where we taught people this game.

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Speaker 0: The thing where you surround the thing.

137
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:44,700
Speaker 0: Remember though, factory fun squares was great and hexes is apparently awful.

138
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,680
Speaker 1: That's true.

139
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,340
Speaker 0: Everyone said, I haven't played it, but everyone I know who has played the new factory fun with hexes has said that it is not fun.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:52,916
Speaker 1: I agree.

141
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:57,940
Speaker 0: So I think what we might do is, this is an idea I had and people seem into it.

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 0: I feel like we should try to do a, we just did our judge anime by its cover again.

143
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,340
Speaker 0: I kind of want to try to read the rules to this T and E version too.

144
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:05,840
Speaker 1: They're up there.

145
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,097
Speaker 1: Read them.

146
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,039
Speaker 1: Their PDF is right there.

147
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:14,220
Speaker 0: And then do a show where we try to review it before we play it and then review it after we play it and see how right we were.

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Speaker 0: I really want to see if we are able to figure out how the game really is based on the rules alone and our deep knowledge of T and E.

149
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:32,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not an objective thing because in your preview where you just read the rules, you could cement judgments in your mind and then hold firm in those beliefs regardless of what actually occurs during the game.

150
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:36,820
Speaker 0: Is that one not an argument we could make for our judge anime by its cover?

151
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,157
Speaker 1: I mean it happens to scientists doing real legit research too, so it's unavoidable.

152
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Speaker 0: But two, other people may play the game and then listen to both of our reviews and both notice the differences and be able to have an opinion on which of the reviews is more accurate to their experience.

153
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,060
Speaker 1: Whatever.

154
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,610
Speaker 0: We're the test subjects.

155
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,640
Speaker 0: We're not the test doors.

156
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,480
Speaker 1: The point is this game becoming is a big deal for us.

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,460
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a big deal for you, but I mean you're listening to Geek Nights.

158
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:11,020
Speaker 0: I feel like the first comment in the board game Geek Thread you linked me to is, "I really wonder how the T and E diehards will feel about this

159
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,100
Speaker 0: one.".

160
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 1: Is that a Geek Nights listener?

161
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,317
Speaker 0: I assume so.

162
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:14,989
Speaker 0: It's Dr.

163
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,738
Speaker 0: J over here.

164
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,226
Speaker 1: One before Dr.

165
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,838
Speaker 1: K. You got one up on him.

166
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,716
Speaker 0: So in the other news...

167
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,077
Speaker 1: He knows how to slam dunk Dr.

168
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,117
Speaker 1: J.

169
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:30,280
Speaker 0: I got a brief Geek Bite for you because I did finally just... The only reason I didn't own any VR up until now is that I didn't have time.

170
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,956
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't own any VR up until now is because it's a ginormous thing.

171
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:35,840
Speaker 1: you got to slap to your head.

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,155
Speaker 0: See, I don't know why it's not that enormous.

173
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,120
Speaker 0: It actually works great.

174
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,760
Speaker 1: I'm not down with the VR until it's like cool sunglasses or a jacket that goes into my neck or something like that.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 0: I don't think you'll ever experience VR in your life then.

176
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,807
Speaker 1: I think we're good.

177
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,019
Speaker 1: I think we will definitely make it.

178
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:51,367
Speaker 0: We'll see.

179
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,680
Speaker 0: Material science is a limitation.

180
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,139
Speaker 0: But anyway, I would say having an Oculus and having fucked around with it a bunch now that I finally have time...

181
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,725
Speaker 1: Material science is a limitation.

182
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,580
Speaker 1: Let me show you telephones from earlier in my life compared to telephones now.

183
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, telephones are still a physical thing I got to carry around.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Speaker 1: They're way small.

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,631
Speaker 0: They're not just in me.

186
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:10,700
Speaker 0: Also, they're getting bigger.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,760
Speaker 1: They're not that small anymore.

188
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,660
Speaker 0: They could be smaller.

189
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,519
Speaker 1: They're getting worse.

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,180
Speaker 1: We have the power to make them small.

191
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,438
Speaker 0: But we choose not to.

192
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:19,859
Speaker 1: They're still way smaller than a VR headset.

193
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:30,500
Speaker 0: So I would say if you do not have a modern hot shit gaming PC, it is not worth it to get one just to get VR.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
Speaker 0: But if you already have a gaming PC that is capable...

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,698
Speaker 1: And a bunch of extra money to burn and nothing better to do...

196
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,620
Speaker 0: Then the extra money it takes to have full motion tracking VR, pretty minuscule compared to what you paid for that PC.

197
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:50,960
Speaker 0: The whole Oculus thing costs less than a third of what a 1080 will cost you today thanks to the coin miners.

198
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:59,178
Speaker 0: But what I want to geek by here is a game... Because a lot of people talk about what the must play games are if you get VR.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,600
Speaker 1: There's not too many of them, at least not yet.

200
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,400
Speaker 0: There's probably 10 or fewer must play VR games right now.

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,700
Speaker 0: The bomb defusing one.

202
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

203
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,179
Speaker 1: The job simulating one.

204
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Rick and Morty one is actually like...

205
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:14,760
Speaker 1: I've heard good things about that one.

206
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,360
Speaker 0: The Rick and Morty one is fantastic.

207
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,519
Speaker 0: It might be the second best VR game there is.

208
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,740
Speaker 1: The robot shooty one.

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,240
Speaker 0: Robo Recall startled me to the point that I ran into the wall.

210
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,219
Speaker 0: But I would say that the top of those is Superhot VR.

211
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,459
Speaker 1: The bad guys only move when you move.

212
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,025
Speaker 0: So Superhot is an FPS.

213
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 0: where the shtick is, nothing moves except when you're moving.

214
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,080
Speaker 1: So if you stop moving, the game is paused.

215
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,280
Speaker 1: Right.

216
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,480
Speaker 1: So if you play this game, basically you just take your mouse, hands off the keyboard and mouse and you look around and you think, all right, I got to kill that guy next.

217
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:53,120
Speaker 1: How am I going to move?

218
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,359
Speaker 1: And you move real carefully and then headshot him.

219
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:59,658
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, as you're doing that, all the other bad guys are coming or perhaps even shooting.

220
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 1: And he's like, well, I see a bullet coming at me.

221
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,700
Speaker 1: I got to move this way.

222
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,800
Speaker 1: And it's almost like a real time, a turn based game.

223
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:11,760
Speaker 1: But you sort of control the clock, but it only goes forward.

224
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,320
Speaker 1: And it's a really, really good concept.

225
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,039
Speaker 0: It's a really good concept and it's really fun.

226
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,688
Speaker 0: But Superhot VR is not just.

227
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:24,540
Speaker 0: we made a VR version of Superhot because the reality is very few games can just be turned into a VR version of the game.

228
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,179
Speaker 0: And games that try, people who try to do this tend to make really bad experiences.

229
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,900
Speaker 1: Well, any FPS is much easier to do because it's FP because pretty much VR has to be FP.

230
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd think that.

231
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,500
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of surprising problems that make that not feasible.

232
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,680
Speaker 1: I'm saying you want to make games in VR first person.

233
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,140
Speaker 1: We really would have a third person view.

234
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,200
Speaker 0: Actually, some of the must play games are these third person games.

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,719
Speaker 0: They work great.

236
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,499
Speaker 1: What, like Mario?

237
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,820
Speaker 0: Like Lucky's Tale or whatever.

238
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:52,636
Speaker 0: How does that work?

239
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,719
Speaker 0: Just third person.

240
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,080
Speaker 0: You just got to see it, like play it.

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,219
Speaker 0: And you're like, oh, I get it.

242
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,680
Speaker 0: And it's hard to explain the experience.

243
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,119
Speaker 1: But anyway, are you poking Lucky in the ass to make a move?

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,340
Speaker 1: You're actually not lucky.

245
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,780
Speaker 0: Poking him in the ass is probably a yet another game.

246
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,980
Speaker 0: Because one thing I will say, poking around the indie VR experiences.

247
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,598
Speaker 1: Lots of porn?

248
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:13,780
Speaker 0: Not really.

249
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,658
Speaker 0: They're not porn.

250
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,159
Speaker 1: Porn adjacent?

251
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:17,680
Speaker 0: They are porn adjacent.

252
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,940
Speaker 0: They are porn for certain people and not porn for other people.

253
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,099
Speaker 0: They are like a wife who comes and like stands next to you the game.

254
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,520
Speaker 0: But Super Odd VR is its own experience.

255
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,980
Speaker 0: And to geek bite it, having played it, it is a peak gaming experience.

256
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,635
Speaker 0: Everything everyone has said about it is 100% accurate.

257
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,699
Speaker 0: This game, it's really short.

258
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,539
Speaker 0: It's a very curated experience.

259
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,479
Speaker 0: You can beat the whole thing in under an hour.

260
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:47,052
Speaker 0: It is the best experience I have had in VR.

261
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:49,120
Speaker 0: hands down, bar none, no exceptions.

262
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,999
Speaker 0: And it is an amazing game.

263
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:55,920
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that if you don't want VR, that you should buy VR to play this game.

264
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Speaker 0: But if you have a VR headset, you're doing yourself a grave disservice not playing this game.

265
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:02,260
Speaker 0: It is intense.

266
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,399
Speaker 0: And the deal is, it's just like the concept we talked about.

267
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,120
Speaker 0: Everything is frozen and as you move, the game moves.

268
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,780
Speaker 0: Turning your head counts as movement.

269
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,817
Speaker 0: So you're basically Neo in the Matrix like you shoot a guy in the face with a shotgun.

270
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:28,120
Speaker 0: You drop it and you slowly raise your hand up and catch the gun that he dropped out of the air and turn around in bullet time dodging bullets and shoot another guy in the face.

271
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:39,839
Speaker 0: It's also a very high concept because it starts you in a room and in the game you put on a VR helmet and play super hot and then you take the VR helmet off and do other stuff.

272
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:47,839
Speaker 0: It's just abstract and beautiful and crazy and it is the example of what to strive for in making a VR game.

273
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,459
Speaker 0: I cannot stress enough how fantastic this game is.

274
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 0: My only warning to you is that it is quite intense and the scariest thing that will ever happen is just someone knocking on a door.

275
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:03,571
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

276
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,199
Speaker 0: You got anything else?

277
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,238
Speaker 0: Other than the fact that we were at PAX.

278
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,680
Speaker 1: I had my news which is that there's a new game coming out.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,277
Speaker 1: And MagFest.

280
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,239
Speaker 1: You didn't even have a news.

281
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,480
Speaker 0: That was my news, the Geek Bite.

282
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,039
Speaker 1: I thought you said there's so much gaming news.

283
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
Speaker 0: There is and I didn't want to waste all our time talking about all this gaming news.

284
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,180
Speaker 0: We could talk about how the Overwatch League has had already two separate instances of high profile sexism.

285
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got problems.

286
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Speaker 0: And also the fact that I watch the games and I enjoy them.

287
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,365
Speaker 1: I only watch New York vs.

288
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,998
Speaker 1: Philly and it's like even as someone who's never played Overwatch, it's like, "Oh, alright, it's

289
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:33,319
Speaker 1: okay.".

290
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 0: But I literally do not care who wins any game.

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I wanted to root for New York but it's like there's no connection between that team and New York whatsoever.

292
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:52,180
Speaker 0: The New York team has so little tie to New York that if you change the names of all the teams, so they were officially from different cities, I don't think anyone would notice.

293
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,419
Speaker 1: They don't play in New York.

294
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,240
Speaker 0: They don't play in New York.

295
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,519
Speaker 0: They're not from New York.

296
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:02,098
Speaker 1: I mean, their name is Excelsior which is New York-ish because of the New York State motto.

297
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,100
Speaker 0: There's only two kinds of people who recognize that word.

298
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,320
Speaker 0: People who care a lot about New York State and comics fans.

299
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,438
Speaker 1: People who like Stan Lee.

300
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one else even thinks about that word and that word means nothing to them.

301
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, "Uh,

302
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:17,520
Speaker 1: alright.".

303
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:19,079
Speaker 1: The logo doesn't even look good.

304
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,240
Speaker 1: It doesn't make me want to buy their merch.

305
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,220
Speaker 0: The token effort of having like a physical place somewhere in New York doesn't even have to be a good place.

306
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,440
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure all these games are played at the Blizzard Arena in LA.

307
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,460
Speaker 0: They need a place in New York where they sell tickets for people to physically sit and watch the game on a screen.

308
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:35,639
Speaker 1: They do at the LA.

309
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:36,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 1: At the Blizzard Arena.

311
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:43,279
Speaker 0: The teams are just so interchangeable that I can't care about them.

312
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,340
Speaker 0: Despite being a crazy fan of both Overwatch competitively and playing Overwatch.

313
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,359
Speaker 1: They came so close.

314
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:54,919
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that Overwatch is such a fast game to watch.

315
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,211
Speaker 1: And they keep the camera work.

316
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 1: They keep switching between characters.

317
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,160
Speaker 0: They don't do it well.

318
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,406
Speaker 1: Constantly.

319
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,400
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest spectator experience.

320
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,068
Speaker 1: I feel like they should just use a zoom.

321
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,140
Speaker 1: They should never use the first person view ever.

322
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,940
Speaker 1: You don't have a first person view when you're watching NFL.

323
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,653
Speaker 1: Just give me the all 22 the whole time.

324
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,037
Speaker 0: You know what I would do actually?

325
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,981
Speaker 1: I guess in this case the all 10.

326
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:25,300
Speaker 0: If I were the production manager for esports like Overwatch.

327
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,635
Speaker 0: I would always make sure that there are two different feeds for every game.

328
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,700
Speaker 0: that's our real game.

329
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,200
Speaker 0: There'd be the normal spectator view that has a certain kind of commentary.

330
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,820
Speaker 0: And it's that high level never first person zoomed out curated view.

331
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,288
Speaker 0: And then I'd have a separate stream.

332
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:46,000
Speaker 0: that is are you a serious Overwatch player?

333
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:46,859
Speaker 0: Here's your crazy bullshit.

334
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,840
Speaker 0: Here's the zoomed in view that you want.

335
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,560
Speaker 1: I don't know why we don't have more like a user control of the cameras during esports.

336
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,980
Speaker 1: Because if you look at say Hearthstone.

337
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,940
Speaker 1: When you watch Hearthstone on Twitch everyone's using these plugins now.

338
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,637
Speaker 1: All the streamers.

339
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,920
Speaker 1: And the plugins allow you to like move your mouse over the deck to see how many cards are left.

340
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,760
Speaker 1: Or hover your mouse over a card to see what the text is.

341
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,620
Speaker 0: Dude old FPS tournaments in the old as days before modern esports.

342
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,760
Speaker 0: The spectator mode was you join a game like a tournament.

343
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:14,699
Speaker 0: They still have that.

344
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,960
Speaker 0: Yeah but you join it as a spectator and that was the primary way you'd watch.

345
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,240
Speaker 0: You just move around and watch whatever you wanted to watch.

346
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,046
Speaker 0: So there's actually.

347
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,559
Speaker 1: this is gonna be my other news.

348
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,089
Speaker 1: But I guess we got.

349
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,020
Speaker 1: we got to it right.

350
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,640
Speaker 1: So this crazy thing happened.

351
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,539
Speaker 1: Where the I forget is it Dota I think.

352
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,179
Speaker 1: Or was it Dota or was it LoL?

353
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,820
Speaker 1: I forget but basically.

354
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,480
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

355
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,367
Speaker 1: I think it's.

356
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:36,978
Speaker 1: I think it's Dota.

357
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,400
Speaker 1: And the oh right I know what it is.

358
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,300
Speaker 1: Okay so ESL the European esports right group right.

359
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:47,892
Speaker 1: They made an exclusive agreement to stream on facebook.

360
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:48,454
Speaker 1: only right.

361
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,400
Speaker 1: So the official ESL dota championship was streamed on facebook.

362
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,220
Speaker 1: And if you were to restream that on twitch they would shut you down for copyright infringement.

363
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,660
Speaker 1: Because you're like restreaming this you know broadcast that you don't have expressed written consent.

364
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,660
Speaker 0: You had only implied oral consent.

365
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
Speaker 1: You had no consent whatsoever.

366
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,879
Speaker 1: Right well you know what some people did.

367
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,980
Speaker 1: What some people did is they used dota TV which is sort of like half-life TV.

368
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,740
Speaker 1: They basically spectated the pros in dota on their computer.

369
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,249
Speaker 1: And broadcasted that on twitch with their own commentary and their own camera.

370
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:25,670
Speaker 1: work right.

371
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,880
Speaker 1: Basically it'd be like if I was at the NFL game with my own camera making my own TV channel.

372
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:35,367
Speaker 1: According to valve.

373
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,960
Speaker 1: that is a-okay you can totally do that.

374
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,445
Speaker 1: And that doesn't violate.

375
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,556
Speaker 1: you know the only one who can stop you from doing.

376
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,300
Speaker 1: that is valve.

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,740
Speaker 1: But ESL was trying to shut people down on twitch for doing that.

378
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,940
Speaker 1: They weren't rebroadcasting ESL stuff.

379
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,240
Speaker 1: And valve and ESL are now butting the heads and this is really awesome.

380
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,740
Speaker 0: Now my opinion and fascinating.

381
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 0: ESL independent of any like what the actual legal arguments will be.

382
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:03,420
Speaker 0: Is making a big goddamn mistake by trying to do this kind of nonsense.

383
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,420
Speaker 0: That is not the way to monetize your esports.

384
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,640
Speaker 0: Because you cannot treat that aspect of it like traditional sports.

385
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,220
Speaker 0: Because there is no culture in watching baseball of recreating the baseball games and then streaming that.

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Speaker 1: I think another thing is that you know you look at TV sports right.

387
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,880
Speaker 1: If you sign an exclusive TV agreement for a sport.

388
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,277
Speaker 1: So now your favorite team is on this channel instead of that channel.

389
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:27,840
Speaker 1: right.

390
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,420
Speaker 1: The only real difference is the announcers.

391
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,220
Speaker 1: And it's like oh you lost the announcer you liked and now you got a shitty one.

392
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,480
Speaker 1: Or maybe you get a better one.

393
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,720
Speaker 1: That's the only real difference right.

394
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,280
Speaker 1: You don't care if your football game is on CBS or Fox that much.

395
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,079
Speaker 1: Because they're all shitty announcers.

396
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,368
Speaker 0: Except for like two right.

397
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,280
Speaker 0: There is not a culture in those sports of doing streaming.

398
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,020
Speaker 0: Esports right.

399
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,040
Speaker 1: No but what I said but here in esports right.

400
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,960
Speaker 1: Facebook watching on Facebook is very different than watching on YouTube.

401
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,719
Speaker 1: They're very different than watching on Twitch.

402
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,760
Speaker 1: The actual channel it's on matters a lot.

403
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,700
Speaker 1: So when Facebook wants to get some gaming content on their streaming site.

404
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,680
Speaker 1: So they make these deals and they pay ESL to bring the games exclusively to Facebook right.

405
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,320
Speaker 1: That's basically like well this games on a shitty channel that's worthless to watch on.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Speaker 1: And now people are gonna watch these other people instead.

407
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,240
Speaker 1: Who are broadcasting their own broadcast competing with the official one.

408
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,120
Speaker 0: I just I wonder who makes these kinds of decisions like do they not.

409
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Speaker 1: Facebook paid ESL a bunch of money and ESL said wow we could really use that bunch of money.

410
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,159
Speaker 1: Okay sure we don't give a fuck.

411
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:33,477
Speaker 0: But no one involved on either side thought for a minute of wait.

412
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:34,099
Speaker 0: is this gonna work?

413
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,015
Speaker 1: I mean ESL I think probably realized but I mean like.

414
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:38,638
Speaker 1: well it'll stream.

415
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:39,060
Speaker 1: who cares.

416
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,340
Speaker 1: And Facebook I guess you know has so much money and they're stupid.

417
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:48,440
Speaker 0: Yeah I feel like companies like Facebook are going to vastly mishandle this.

418
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,798
Speaker 0: In a way that.

419
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,800
Speaker 1: They already mishandled.

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,920
Speaker 0: Yeah I feel like they're gonna continue to mishandle it.

421
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:57,420
Speaker 1: But yeah this is a fascinating story here and there's more to come in this arena.

422
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,538
Speaker 1: I'm watching it closely.

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,240
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

424
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,340
Speaker 0: What do you got?

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,511
Speaker 1: What did I have?

426
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:09,940
Speaker 1: I forget.

427
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,298
Speaker 0: Getting Over It?

428
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,280
Speaker 1: Yeah so this is a game called Getting Over It.

429
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,699
Speaker 0: Which I literally had never heard of.

430
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,280
Speaker 1: Raymond never heard of this even though it's a big deal and everyone's raving about it lately.

431
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,580
Speaker 1: Anyway so.

432
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:20,859
Speaker 0: I just never encountered it.

433
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,580
Speaker 1: You may have if you haven't if you don't know exactly what I'm talking about already.

434
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,820
Speaker 1: You may have seen a game where there is a man or some sort of human inside of a cauldron with their torso sticking out.

435
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,740
Speaker 1: And they have a sledgehammer and they wield this sledgehammer to climb.

436
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:39,999
Speaker 1: And they basically poke the sledgehammer down to push themselves up.

437
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,180
Speaker 1: Swing it around to grab onto things.

438
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:45,340
Speaker 0: It's quap crossed with mount your friends.

439
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,660
Speaker 1: That's basically what it is.

440
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,599
Speaker 1: It's climbing quap.

441
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,480
Speaker 1: It has real as the controls are as awful as you think they are by looking at it right.

442
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,800
Speaker 1: And you can get used to it though if you played a bunch.

443
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:56,200
Speaker 1: And this game has been all the rage lately.

444
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,280
Speaker 1: There have been a lot of videos of it.

445
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,160
Speaker 1: The game has a few jump scares.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,920
Speaker 1: So there was some great video going around of people getting freaked out by the jump scares.

447
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,890
Speaker 1: And then falling all the way down.

448
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,040
Speaker 1: So yeah it's a pretty good game.

449
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,553
Speaker 1: I'm not playing it because I feel like watching the video.

450
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:12,760
Speaker 1: I got all I need to get out of it.

451
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:13,999
Speaker 1: And it's not worth my time.

452
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,660
Speaker 1: But I still applaud this game.

453
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,139
Speaker 1: Good job.

454
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,980
Speaker 1: Nice design.

455
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,340
Speaker 1: Nice.

456
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,159
Speaker 1: You know very clever.

457
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,200
Speaker 1: Very funny.

458
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:19,918
Speaker 1: You know.

459
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,777
Speaker 1: Good job you.

460
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:28,040
Speaker 1: Anyway here is my thing of the day which is somebody getting the world record time for beating this game.

461
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,759
Speaker 1: Which is basically like a few minutes.

462
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,440
Speaker 1: And you can see the whole game really really quick.

463
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,320
Speaker 1: This person is like a master.

464
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,380
Speaker 1: They practiced so much.

465
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,940
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

466
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,820
Speaker 1: And then they uninstalled the game right after they got this world record.

467
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,099
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty sure it is still the world record for beating this game.

468
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,199
Speaker 1: Good job.

469
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,297
Speaker 1: I clap for you.

470
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:45,999
Speaker 0: That is amazing.

471
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:46,817
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:53,679
Speaker 1: So yeah if you somehow are like rim and have been living under a rock and haven't seen the game called Getting Over It.

473
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:55,034
Speaker 1: Here you go.

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,279
Speaker 0: I don't know how I missed this.

475
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:57,880
Speaker 0: It's just my social media feed.

476
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,198
Speaker 1: I imagine most of you have seen it.

477
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,180
Speaker 0: And somehow in my social media feed literally no one has mentioned this game.

478
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,039
Speaker 1: It's been around for a while.

479
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:04,540
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

480
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
Speaker 0: It just never came up in my social media.

481
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,498
Speaker 0: Alright.

482
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,760
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid at Cedar Point.

483
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,699
Speaker 0: There was a roller coaster that I rode.

484
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,339
Speaker 0: And it was called Avalanche Run.

485
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:14,017
Speaker 1: Okay.

486
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,717
Speaker 0: Didn't have rails.

487
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:17,860
Speaker 0: It was like a toboggan run.

488
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:18,760
Speaker 1: Like half pipes.

489
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:19,806
Speaker 0: No.

490
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,600
Speaker 1: So like a bobsled but instead of ice just wood?

491
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,540
Speaker 0: Basically yeah it was a roller coaster bobsled.

492
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:25,949
Speaker 1: How did the friction?

493
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:27,480
Speaker 1: not like just start a fire or something?

494
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:28,700
Speaker 0: I mean it worked fine.

495
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,180
Speaker 1: Was it like a fiberglass tube or something?

496
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
Speaker 0: Yeah this video will actually get into detail on all that.

497
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,559
Speaker 1: I imagine the friction would like wear away the thing you're sitting in right?

498
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,165
Speaker 1: Like one of the two surfaces.

499
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:42,120
Speaker 1: either the track or the thing you're in the vehicle are gonna like erode right?

500
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,160
Speaker 0: That would end up being fine.

501
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,160
Speaker 1: Scratching against each other?

502
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:44,740
Speaker 0: But anyway.

503
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:48,579
Speaker 0: The ride was not popular because it actually just wasn't that good.

504
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,876
Speaker 1: I imagine that would not be a smooth ride.

505
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,960
Speaker 0: No it was smooth.

506
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,440
Speaker 0: It just wasn't that scary or fun.

507
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,380
Speaker 0: Like it was a pretty sweet milk toast roller coaster.

508
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,620
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why the friction didn't start fires.

509
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,323
Speaker 0: So.

510
00:24:59,447 --> 00:24:59,698
Speaker 0: They.

511
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,220
Speaker 0: This coincided.

512
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,460
Speaker 0: When they decided this roller coaster wasn't actually that popular or doing that well.

513
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:07,200
Speaker 0: With Star Tours.

514
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:08,739
Speaker 1: In Disney.

515
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,660
Speaker 1: Oh the one where.

516
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 1: I've done Star Tours.

517
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,772
Speaker 1: Star Tours is a Star Wars ride.

518
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,299
Speaker 1: It used to be the only Star Wars ride in Disney.

519
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,959
Speaker 1: But now they're building a Star Wars land around it I guess.

520
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,180
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Star Tours is gone.

521
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:19,876
Speaker 1: Is it?

522
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,999
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was gone a long time ago.

523
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,660
Speaker 1: Oh I've ridden it many times.

524
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,579
Speaker 1: Oh yeah as a kid.

525
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,360
Speaker 0: I probably rode it like eight times in a row.

526
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,740
Speaker 1: You go and you sit in what appears to be a Star Wars vehicle.

527
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,880
Speaker 1: They close the door and there's a screen in the front.

528
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,060
Speaker 1: Yes Scott it closed eight years ago.

529
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,177
Speaker 1: Okay.

530
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,800
Speaker 1: I've ridden it many times thankfully.

531
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:46,466
Speaker 1: And you get a video of C3P and R2D2 doing something and the thing moves around but it doesn't move forward or back.

533
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:49,522
Speaker 1: it just sort of moves in place and makes you feel like you're moving.

534
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:55,560
Speaker 1: and they have improved on that not moving ride technology much since the time of Star Tours.

535
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Speaker 0: Oh the newest Harry Potter equivalent of that is pretty fucking crazy.

536
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:06,580
Speaker 1: Even the Spiderman one I went on in the late 90s early 2000s or whatever that one was is way way way beyond Star Tours.

537
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,560
Speaker 1: Star Tours and it's like back to the future ride level of you know action.

538
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,723
Speaker 0: This video is basically a really deep dive into what Cedar Point did with that roller coaster?

539
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:27,440
Speaker 0: because what they did I mentioned this on Geeknet a long time ago they built a building around the roller coaster and they made it a themed Star Tours like experience.

540
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,280
Speaker 1: With no Star Wars.

541
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,571
Speaker 0: With a Disney style lot.

542
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:30,379
Speaker 0: yeah no Star Wars.

543
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,086
Speaker 1: Did they use Snoopy?

544
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,180
Speaker 1: because it's a Snoopy park.

545
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,707
Speaker 0: It wasn't Snoopy park.

546
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:36,300
Speaker 0: then it became Snoopy park relatively recently.

547
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,066
Speaker 1: I thought it is.

548
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,419
Speaker 1: I thought it's no longer Snoopy Park.

549
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,420
Speaker 0: Well but before that it wasn't anything.

550
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Speaker 0: They had a Berenstain Bearsland like in the middle for kids but there was no licensed.

551
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:48,160
Speaker 0: there was no license to anything at Cedar Point.

552
00:26:49,300 --> 00:27:00,179
Speaker 0: So this video is a pretty well researched deep dive into the whole story of why Cedar Point did this what this ride was like and it sort of has this implied story of.

553
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:05,319
Speaker 0: there's not a lot of footage or photographs of this or a lot of similar things from this era.

554
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:11,679
Speaker 0: It is amazing how much information from the late 70s through the early 90s is just fucking gone.

555
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:18,565
Speaker 0: And this video like does the best it can to get all the information that's possible to describe.

556
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,613
Speaker 1: you think information for that era is gone.

557
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:22,779
Speaker 1: if you go back in time it's even more is gone.

558
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,900
Speaker 1: As you go back in time more information is gone.

559
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,920
Speaker 1: Until recently where we've had ridiculous recording and storage technologies.

560
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,160
Speaker 1: Even now think about how much is gone.

561
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,440
Speaker 1: We can't even keep fucking websites from Geocities around.

562
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,894
Speaker 0: But like the only reason we actually know like what it like.

563
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:45,099
Speaker 0: we can see today what it looks like inside this ride is because some rando carried a camcorder in there once and we got a hold of that footage.

564
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:59,216
Speaker 0: So this video is just really interesting about the history of this one roller coaster in detail and like why it was made the way it was and how Cedar Point decided to try to copy Disneyland and have an experience as opposed to a thrill ride.

565
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,160
Speaker 0: and then they realized fuck that and they never did that again and now they make just crazy thrill rides.

566
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,720
Speaker 0: It's also interesting because you might have seen me complaining on Twitter about this.

567
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:20,237
Speaker 0: The only complaint I have is this is another one of those videos that is really good except the person who does the narration is a fragile child who has modulated their voice because they don't like what their voice sounds like when they hear it.

568
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:24,460
Speaker 0: And that bothers me to the point that is very hard to watch videos that have that.

569
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,655
Speaker 1: You know just my initial guess though is that you know Cedar Point.

570
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:36,700
Speaker 1: the employees who make the rides are engineers largely and thus they would fail to make an experience whereas Disney Imagineers actually extremely creative people.

571
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,078
Speaker 0: So actually the engineers the experience they made was actually really high production values.

572
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,580
Speaker 1: Well just that doesn't mean it's creatively good.

573
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:53,553
Speaker 1: You could give me a ton of money to make a movie and it will say this video answered a question that was burning in my mind for decades.

574
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:59,065
Speaker 0: because when you got when I got off this ride because when Cedar Point got a new roller coaster it was a big deal as a kid.

575
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,659
Speaker 0: So when you got off this ride this attendant would be there and they'd be like welcome to Alaska and I didn't know what the fuck they meant.

576
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,900
Speaker 0: And now someone validated that that wasn't just something I made up that that did happen and why it happened.

577
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,969
Speaker 0: They had two different stories around this roller coaster and they never actually linked them up.

578
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,739
Speaker 0: So it's just interesting this whole thing.

579
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:33,600
Speaker 0: In the moment the book club book which will I'll be updating the website will be reading soon is Emily Wilson's translation new translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

580
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,120
Speaker 1: Yeah not dancing home.

581
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:35,639
Speaker 1: I'm at home.

582
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,558
Speaker 1: Just regular home.

583
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,357
Speaker 1: Stabbing Homer.

584
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,083
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,967
Speaker 0: Well he does stab that Cyclops in the eye.

586
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,658
Speaker 1: so Homer isn't the one who stabs.

587
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,880
Speaker 0: Well if Homer wrote it then I ostensibly if you take the Princess Tutu look Homer did stab that Cyclops in the eye by way of a character that he created.

588
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:54,339
Speaker 0: But I digress.

589
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,100
Speaker 0: We were at Pac South.

590
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,378
Speaker 0: We were at Mag Fest.

591
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,940
Speaker 0: We have video from both those conventions on a YouTube channel and much more to come.

592
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,719
Speaker 0: We also Scott just uploaded like today.

593
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,700
Speaker 1: It's a little bit late because it's like there's already like three or four episodes in the current anime season but we didn't see any of them at the time of this recording.

594
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,620
Speaker 1: So we still judged the winter 2018 anime season by its cover.

595
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,592
Speaker 1: And I mean all this if you know.

596
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,198
Speaker 1: I think it's in time right.

597
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,339
Speaker 1: The spring one will be more on time.

598
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:27,340
Speaker 0: Yep.

599
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Speaker 0: And more you need to subscribe to Scott's YouTube channel because this video is good and we're doing this as a series but they're on Scott's channel because he makes the videos and I mean I can't upload them to your channel.

600
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,009
Speaker 1: Yeah.

601
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:41,040
Speaker 1: It's your channel.

602
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,039
Speaker 1: I can't log into it.

603
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,720
Speaker 1: I need your Google account.

604
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Speaker 0: And we are way too far down the road of having our own channels to make like a new branded channel that will have no subscribers.

605
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:59,000
Speaker 1: There is a Geek Nights channel and we sort of I think I can still log into it but it's it's problematic because we made it in an ancient era of YouTube and Google.

606
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,777
Speaker 1: I mean the real goal is to like if we're ever making enough video to where it matters.

607
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,420
Speaker 1: we would just like you know like YouTube would talk to us right.

608
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:08,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

609
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,698
Speaker 1: Make us an accommodation.

610
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,560
Speaker 1: And if it's not at that point then who gives a shit really.

611
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,719
Speaker 0: But anyway if you if you feel like you're missing out on some Geek Nights talks and videos.

612
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:21,460
Speaker 1: You can always go to front row crew dot com where all of our content is forever.

613
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,324
Speaker 0: Except this one.

614
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,859
Speaker 0: because we go to front row crew dot com it's still the balancing game design.

615
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,659
Speaker 1: No I put they put the thing on.

616
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,180
Speaker 0: I think you set the date behind the date of balance and game design.

617
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,396
Speaker 1: Did I?

618
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,239
Speaker 0: Balance and game design shows up in the front page.

619
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:33,713
Speaker 1: I don't know.

620
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,858
Speaker 1: Go check it right now.

621
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,440
Speaker 0: No.

622
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:42,540
Speaker 0: So yeah otherwise we got no conventions until PAX East.

623
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:42,925
Speaker 1: Good.

624
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,159
Speaker 0: We can finally relax and actually do Geek Nights again.

625
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,035
Speaker 0: So follow us and all our stuff and stay tuned.

626
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:56,600
Speaker 0: the next video I'm going to upload is the top 40 tabletop games you need to play for magfest which was actually a pretty good panel.

627
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:04,740
Speaker 0: So we played a game that Chris and Anthony brought and it's another one of these like indie Japanese tabletop games.

628
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,480
Speaker 1: We played at magfest and PAX out.

629
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:13,537
Speaker 1: And it was made by the same person who made what the Yokohama and which we didn't like and what other games.

630
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,799
Speaker 1: It's Sashi Hayashi.

631
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,870
Speaker 0: Let's see.

632
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:17,939
Speaker 1: Yeah Yokohama.

633
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
Speaker 1: We played a few games by this person.

634
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,600
Speaker 0: Yep.

635
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,919
Speaker 0: Yokohama is the one that I remember.

636
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,399
Speaker 1: There was also some emperor one or something that I sucked at.

637
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,917
Speaker 0: No no no here we go.

638
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,860
Speaker 0: Emperor's Choice.

639
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,479
Speaker 1: That one.

640
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,238
Speaker 1: I sucked at that.

641
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,260
Speaker 0: I liked Emperor's Choice.

642
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,440
Speaker 0: It has some problems but I enjoyed it.

643
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,179
Speaker 1: Was Emperor's Choice the one I was good at?

644
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,839
Speaker 1: I forget.

645
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,936
Speaker 1: Well the one where the scoring cards flipped over.

646
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:39,359
Speaker 1: is that it?

647
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,718
Speaker 0: Or is it the one?

648
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,800
Speaker 0: That is Emperor's Choice.

649
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,339
Speaker 1: Okay that's the one I sucked at.

650
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,460
Speaker 1: The one where you place your worker and you could occupy two spots.

651
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,140
Speaker 0: That is the game you'll never forget.

652
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,960
Speaker 0: Your year with the dragon.

653
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,279
Speaker 1: Is that made by the same person also?

654
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,444
Speaker 1: No.

655
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,053
Speaker 1: Okay.

656
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 1: Anyway.

657
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,879
Speaker 0: This is the Emperor's Choice person.

658
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:12,650
Speaker 1: Anyway so yeah this game is called Ratineer and when we saw the game at least I was immediately attracted to it because as the name implies it is a combination of rats, squeak squeak, eating pizza, and also buccaneers, yarr.

659
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,460
Speaker 1: we are pirates, let us be cute pirate rats, pirates who are cute.

660
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,140
Speaker 1: I don't know why they didn't translate it to pirat but Ratineer is okay.

661
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:25,980
Speaker 1: Yeah it's a game where you are pirate rats trying to out pirate the other pirate rats.

662
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,860
Speaker 0: So it's not a great game?

663
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,000
Speaker 0: It's not in the class of like Tiggers and Euphrates.

664
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,058
Speaker 1: I mean the theme though.

665
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,695
Speaker 1: The theme.

666
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,619
Speaker 0: The theme's good.

667
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:32,887
Speaker 0: Yeah.

668
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:38,358
Speaker 0: And the game is relatively unique in that there are few games that use a mechanic like this.

669
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,159
Speaker 1: I cannot, there are not many games that you can compare this game to mechanically.

670
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:42,219
Speaker 1: no.

671
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,829
Speaker 0: The game, but the game has a lot of the elements, like.

672
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,697
Speaker 0: I feel like a game that was meteor.

673
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:51,400
Speaker 0: that did some of the things this game does would be very much up my alley.

674
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:52,920
Speaker 0: But this game is good.

675
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:00,620
Speaker 0: It's a good game to bust out at a convention because it generates a lot of moments where everyone goes oh shit really and something crazy happens.

676
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,339
Speaker 1: So first of all the game is really cute.

677
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,540
Speaker 1: I was immediately attracted to these pieces in the game.

678
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 1: One of which had a tiny cute rat and a little red and white floaty rat.

679
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,018
Speaker 0: There are only two images of this game on BoardGameGeek.

680
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

681
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,329
Speaker 1: Which is the cutest little rat I've ever seen?

682
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,357
Speaker 1: and then I was told that that is the rat king of the sea.

683
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,739
Speaker 0: The rat king of the land is pretty good though.

684
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,717
Speaker 1: The rat king of the land is also cute but not as cute as the rat king of the sea with the red and white floaty.

685
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:27,859
Speaker 0: The floaty is what does it.

686
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,739
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm all about the rat king of the sea.

687
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 1: I almost thought about making that a Twitter avatar.

688
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,228
Speaker 0: So the theme is your rat pirates.

689
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:35,400
Speaker 0: whatever but the gist of the game.

690
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,511
Speaker 1: The main mechanic.

691
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,120
Speaker 0: that matters.

692
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,320
Speaker 0: You do a blind bid for where you're gonna go on this chain of islands.

693
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,378
Speaker 1: Everyone's got two pirates and you never get more and you could get some deckhands but whatever.

694
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:56,880
Speaker 1: You basically secretly allocate to, there's a chain of islands from the land out to the treasure island in a straight line and you allocate secretly where you're gonna send your pirates and your deckhands.

695
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,598
Speaker 0: You'd be like I'll send a pirate to island one and island three.

696
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,120
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll send a pirate to the magical treasure island and a pirate to this middle island and a deckhand on the land and so forth.

697
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,479
Speaker 0: And the islands all have goods that you're gonna do some stuff with.

698
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,540
Speaker 1: All the islands do stuff.

699
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,359
Speaker 0: Well the islands all have goods on them.

700
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:15,120
Speaker 0: The treasure island has crazy bullshit on it.

701
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 1: Everyone reveals and then simultaneously sends out their pirates and deckhands to the thing but starting at the land where I guess the tavern is right where the money is.

702
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,160
Speaker 0: You do the thing on the first place then the second place then the third place.

703
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,320
Speaker 1: And as soon as you reach a spot in the chain, it's just a straight line where there nobody sent anybody.

704
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,340
Speaker 1: No one sent a pirate.

705
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,400
Speaker 1: No one sent a deckhand.

706
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,120
Speaker 1: No one sent anything to that spot.

707
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,900
Speaker 1: All of the islands further out in the chain.

708
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,340
Speaker 1: Everyone just gets swept away to the beach and doesn't get to do that stuff.

709
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,620
Speaker 1: So it's really hard to do the treasure island because to do the treasure island you need to have something on every single other spot.

710
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,440
Speaker 1: Something to keep that chain alive so that I guess you can get home safely with a treasure.

711
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:04,280
Speaker 0: Now also this leads to those situations where every round especially later in the game people are thinking did anyone go on space one?

712
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,018
Speaker 0: Please I hope someone went on space one.

713
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,676
Speaker 1: There are a lot of times where no one goes on space one and everyone gets washed away to the beach.

714
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,375
Speaker 0: Yup.

715
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:11,872
Speaker 1: The end.

716
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,460
Speaker 0: Now the rest of the game is pretty simple mechanically like it's not even that exciting.

717
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Speaker 1: Each of the different islands does something.

718
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,000
Speaker 1: The first space just gives you money.

719
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,620
Speaker 1: The second space lets you buy helping cards and more deckhands.

720
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:32,778
Speaker 1: All the other normal spaces are all the same and they have cards that line up next to them that have goods and the goods become victory points and then at the very end of the treasure island.

721
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,359
Speaker 1: And I think there's another one that lets you flip victory points and then the beach.

722
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:38,019
Speaker 1: Yup.

723
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,313
Speaker 1: Whatever.

724
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,620
Speaker 0: The game is only of sort of moderate actual depth in terms of strategy.

725
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:56,565
Speaker 1: The main mechanic that's fun and interesting and that you care about is the one I just described where you want to send your guys deep but if you do they might just get washed away to the beach and sort of risk and also looking at what other players are going to do.

726
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:57,960
Speaker 1: And if you fill in stuff.

727
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,520
Speaker 1: But try to guess what they're going to do and then you know.

728
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,879
Speaker 0: If you fill in stuff to go deep you're giving other people potentially a stepping stone to go deeper.

729
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,357
Speaker 1: Right.

730
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,762
Speaker 1: And if you look at some spaces in the middle and it's like well that's a really good spot to go.

731
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:14,260
Speaker 1: but if I go there, Rim also goes there, he's going to, I'm going to get less stuff.

732
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:18,080
Speaker 1: but wait if I don't go there, Rim's going to go there alone and take all the stuff.

733
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:29,919
Speaker 0: So here's where this has another level of that same sort of like guessing what the other people are going to do and anticipating and risk taking is that all the islands where you get stuff, if you're there by yourself you get all the stuff.

734
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:33,560
Speaker 0: If you're there with other people you take turns based on some rules and who gets stuff.

735
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,400
Speaker 1: You're basically looting cargo ships.

736
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Speaker 0: But if one of those islands has fights on it, you gotta win the fight.

737
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,100
Speaker 1: Otherwise everyone dies and goes to the beach.

738
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,573
Speaker 0: And when you win the fight, if you win the fight, the dudes you use to fight the fight generally die.

739
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,100
Speaker 0: So ideally.

740
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:49,899
Speaker 1: Unless you have cards.

741
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:54,880
Speaker 0: But all the people on that island share the fight and the results together.

742
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Speaker 1: So if you get someone else to fight, you can get treasures by joining in.

743
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,639
Speaker 1: So there's multiple levels of- But if you go there and then no one else goes to fight there, you could just die.

744
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,879
Speaker 0: Multiple levels of anticipating what other people might do and planning on that and risk taking based on that.

745
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,040
Speaker 0: Now in terms of strategy, the trouble with the game is that really the only thing, like the strategy is pretty simple.

746
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:28,340
Speaker 0: You play conservatively when you're ahead in the sense that you play easy plays early in the board and you don't ever give people opportunities to go deeper.

747
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,200
Speaker 0: Because why would you?

748
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,436
Speaker 0: If you're already ahead and there's a turn where no one gets to do anything, you stay ahead.

749
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:44,958
Speaker 0: And if you're losing, you take increasingly desperate risky strategies to try to go deeper, to try to get a big payoff because you're hoping that nobody went on the place with three fights and you get all the goods.

750
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:50,460
Speaker 0: And that's really the only strategy involved.

751
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,960
Speaker 1: I mean, but that's the interesting part, right?

752
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:54,540
Speaker 1: What other game does that?

753
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,686
Speaker 1: Most of the risk reward games are games of like pushing, like, you know, no thanks where it gets deeper and deeper and deeper and you take it.

754
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:10,680
Speaker 1: or infiltration where you go deeper and deeper and deeper than turn back or deep sea adventure where you go deeper and turn back.

755
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,540
Speaker 1: In this game, every single turn, it's like, how deep is it safe to go?

756
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,858
Speaker 1: Every single turn, you're making a brand new judgment and you're getting severely punished for going too deep.

757
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,800
Speaker 0: Is the splendor of that kind of game.

758
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,657
Speaker 0: But then you can try again.

759
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,540
Speaker 0: Actually, Antdecker has that to a big degree.

760
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:28,937
Speaker 1: A little bit.

761
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,500
Speaker 0: Antdecker, when you're exploring, that's the how much are you going to risk?

762
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,659
Speaker 0: What's the risk reward ratio?

763
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,136
Speaker 0: But most of these games, the risk taking is independent of anticipating what other players will do.

764
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,339
Speaker 0: Like in infiltration, it's obvious what other players will do because the game's actually infiltration.

765
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,800
Speaker 1: I don't have as much freedom.

766
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,638
Speaker 0: I have an increasingly dour opinion of because the game always plays out the same way and you have very little agency.

767
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:56,179
Speaker 0: It takes too long for what you get out of it.

768
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:56,758
Speaker 1: That's true.

769
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,502
Speaker 0: And there is.

770
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:03,080
Speaker 0: it is almost never viable to go even halfway into that stupid place.

771
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,339
Speaker 1: You need some luck to get deep.

772
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,719
Speaker 0: You need a lot of luck to go deep.

773
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,438
Speaker 1: Unlike Deep Sea Adventure, where you can get the big treasures reliably.

774
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:18,039
Speaker 0: Retinaire is a pretty good balance of these mechanics and you get to have that go deeper not anticipate other players over and over and over again.

775
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,620
Speaker 0: My only complaint and I'm not going to complain that the game's a little random with the cards because it is, but that's not bad.

776
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,220
Speaker 0: That's fine for this level of game.

777
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,695
Speaker 0: My only complaint is the game takes about 10 to 15 minutes longer than it feels like it should.

778
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:38,098
Speaker 1: My complaint with the luck actually in this game is that you have the land seat rat king and the water rat king, right?

779
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,100
Speaker 1: The cutest pieces and they rotate around the board fairly.

780
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,160
Speaker 1: So everyone gets a roughly even number of times as both.

781
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:52,977
Speaker 1: And basically what those do is they allow you to either have priority on the land spaces or priority on the water space, which gives you more context to decide what other players are going to do.

782
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,522
Speaker 0: So when

783
00:40:53,542 --> 00:41:01,580
Speaker 1: you are the sea rat king, you want to play your guys out in the water and you will get first dibs even if someone goes to the same space you go to, but everyone

784
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,365
Speaker 0: knows you're going to do

785
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,279
Speaker 1: that obviously, but I mean you just do it anyway because you still get first dibs.

786
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,179
Speaker 1: What they can do about it, right?

787
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,580
Speaker 1: And then if you go land, you're the land rat king.

788
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:13,729
Speaker 1: You also get first dibs, you can get more money or more cards or whatever before other people.

789
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:17,019
Speaker 1: And so they rotate evenly and it's kind of fair.

790
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:25,980
Speaker 1: But the thing is there's a lot of situations where, for example, I was the sea rat king once and no one went on the one space, just coincidence that time.

791
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,660
Speaker 1: And I had a good play and I just, Oh, I got, I got burned.

792
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,905
Speaker 1: And that's, you're only going to get to be the sea rat king, like two or three times GG.

793
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,279
Speaker 1: I basically lost right there.

794
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,379
Speaker 0: Why'd you take that risk?

795
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,440
Speaker 1: I didn't, you know, how was I, why would I go on the land space when I'm the sea rat king?

796
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,560
Speaker 0: You put one deck hand there as insurance.

797
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:50,120
Speaker 0: I just, but I'm just saying it's like, you know, you know, this risk reward, this game, you literally can spend actions, which are the primary economy in the games.

798
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,857
Speaker 0: You don't get many.

799
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:51,416
Speaker 1: Yep.

800
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,039
Speaker 0: To buy insurance.

801
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:53,518
Speaker 1: Yep.

802
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:02,578
Speaker 1: By putting a deck hand somewhere to ensure, you know, it's just the thing that can happen, It could be not even getting a big, not as that's, that's an example of really big, bad luck.

803
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,160
Speaker 1: I'm talking about a little bad luck.

804
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,000
Speaker 1: Like, Oh, I was the sea rat king and there really weren't any good islands to go to.

805
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,499
Speaker 1: Like there weren't a lot of cards out there to pick up on when I happened to be the sea rat king because of the way the turns went.

806
00:42:14,881 --> 00:42:18,360
Speaker 1: And then I, so I, you know, I did what the best I could and whatever.

807
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:23,699
Speaker 1: And then I passed the sea rat king to the left and suddenly all these amazing diamonds get dealt out.

808
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:30,519
Speaker 1: And now the person to the left of me is the sea rat king and they get all these victory points by going to this awesome island.

809
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,800
Speaker 1: And because I was just the sea rat king, I have more, I have like no priority on water.

810
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:36,699
Speaker 1: I've heard on land.

811
00:42:37,082 --> 00:42:39,259
Speaker 1: I can't get those victory points just because luck.

812
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:39,858
Speaker 0: Yep.

813
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,900
Speaker 0: I mean, that's why I said, I'm not saying this is bad.

814
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,059
Speaker 1: Board games have luck.

815
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,758
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

816
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,620
Speaker 0: But that's why I'm saying the game needs to be like 15 minutes shorter.

817
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,857
Speaker 1: It doesn't ruin the game.

818
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:51,118
Speaker 1: It's just, it's a thing.

819
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:55,579
Speaker 0: If the game were shorter, that would be less of a concern because you just play it again.

820
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,580
Speaker 0: Uh, the other funny thing as Demoisell just pointed out in the chat, it's not localized so well.

821
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:03,640
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

822
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,439
Speaker 1: There's some really funny things like, so this money art is in.

823
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,810
Speaker 1: Yes.

824
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:07,458
Speaker 1: There's a cut.

825
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:11,540
Speaker 1: There's, there's cards for the special rats that you can buy on the land at the tavern.

826
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,140
Speaker 0: A few of them are basically like translated wrong.

827
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,299
Speaker 0: So like the surgeon is the thief.

828
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:17,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

829
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:18,760
Speaker 1: They wrote the wrong words on them.

830
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:27,999
Speaker 1: But the, the, uh, the best one, the bogus money artisan, the counterfeiter who gives you like a money every turn, basically, uh, something like that.

831
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,660
Speaker 1: But instead of saying counterfeiter, it says bogus money artisan, which is amazing.

832
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:41,260
Speaker 0: I will at any point in my life where there is an opportunity to say the word counterfeit, I'm going to say bogus something, say bogus money and say bogus money artisan.

833
00:43:41,428 --> 00:43:41,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

834
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:42,160
Speaker 0: But it could be bogus.

835
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,239
Speaker 0: I mean, we're gonna do a geek nice episode in the future.

836
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,728
Speaker 0: Are you a bogus MP3 artisan?

837
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:49,637
Speaker 1: Is that what you are?

838
00:43:50,680 --> 00:44:00,419
Speaker 0: But I would say that if you are the kind of person who whips out games for people like you're the kind of person who brings a game to your group and says, Hey, let's play this game.

839
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,218
Speaker 0: It's cool.

840
00:44:01,944 --> 00:44:02,920
Speaker 0: This is a game to have.

841
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,760
Speaker 0: This is a game that a lot of people you bring games for have not played before.

842
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,899
Speaker 1: Also it's, people haven't played this.

843
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:13,540
Speaker 1: It has cute rats that can bring people in as a cute pirate theme that you can get into.

844
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:14,340
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

845
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,080
Speaker 1: Even though it has some problems, you can still get enjoyment out of it multiple times.

846
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:19,858
Speaker 1: It's easy to learn.

847
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:24,780
Speaker 1: It's quick to learn, even though it's too long for what it is, it's still not long to play overall.

848
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,156
Speaker 0: Yup.

849
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:26,720
Speaker 1: Uh, and it's unique.

850
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,140
Speaker 1: It's not like other games.

851
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,760
Speaker 1: You have this unique mechanic that make it worth playing.

852
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,520
Speaker 1: There isn't like some replacement game that's like, Oh, you shouldn't play right near play this instead.

853
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,200
Speaker 1: It's like, there isn't really a game that I've seen that has that chain connection mechanic.

854
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:40,460
Speaker 1: That's really interesting.

855
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Speaker 1: Uh, I almost sort of feel like it's a furry and it's obviously nothing like for you of Dracula, except free of free of Dracula has the Dracula's hidden movement mechanic.

856
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,900
Speaker 1: that is amazing.

857
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,560
Speaker 1: That is unlike any other game.

858
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:00,780
Speaker 1: And the rest of the game is may rat near has the chain simultaneous placement mechanic, which is unique and unlike any other game.

859
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:02,058
Speaker 1: And the rest of the game is a game.

860
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:09,199
Speaker 0: If we could make the, make the combat and fury of Dracula act somehow like this blind bed system in right near.

861
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,300
Speaker 1: So basically take two unique systems and combine them.

862
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,998
Speaker 1: And that's the whole game.

863
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,360
Speaker 1: Two really interesting, unique systems together.

864
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:15,518
Speaker 0: I feel like that could work.

865
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,357
Speaker 1: Go for it.

866
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Speaker 0: That goes against most of the advice we give people for designing games.

867
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,078
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's a, you know, definitely, I think, you know, there was so much attention on the Euro games.

868
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:30,577
Speaker 1: I'm glad we have some friends who pay attention to the, uh, Japanese produced board games out there.

869
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,620
Speaker 0: I haven't been, I do not have time to pay attention to that right now.

870
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:42,300
Speaker 1: And I'm sure there are other countries besides Japan and European union that are produced and United States that are producing quite excellent tabletop games.

871
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,954
Speaker 1: And I would like to see some of those, please translate them and deliver them to us for the win.

872
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,640
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

891
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,668
Speaker 0: And once I decide when I'm going, I will tell all of you when I'm going to be there in case you happen to be there.

892
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,110
Speaker 0: But anyway, now I leave you with something that has nothing to do with Cedar point.

893
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:32,829
Speaker 1: you don't belong to them.

894
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,810
Speaker 0: They left me in a world of darkness without your sexy hands.

895
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:42,381
Speaker 1: And I miss you.

896
