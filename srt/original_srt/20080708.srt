Speaker 1: I love it to be about 99 degrees and dry.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,677
Speaker 0: I think it's been pretty clear that when we say warm today We're not complaining and when we say woman.

13
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,423
Speaker 0: We are complaining quite a bit.

14
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was really weird.

15
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,435
Speaker 0: I was in Florida.

16
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:56,580
Speaker 0: It was warm.

17
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:00,082
Speaker 0: I got off the plane in New York Just as warm.

18
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:06,068
Speaker 1: well I remember very clearly because I went down to the beach over the weekend Wildwood with scojo and everyone.

19
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:11,064
Speaker 1: and as We drive down it was so hot and we didn't have air conditioning.

20
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,610
Speaker 0: It was like why didn't you have air conditioning?

21
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:18,430
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't take my car which has no air conditioning because my car also the transmission is no longer cooled.

22
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:28,331
Speaker 1: Yep, so we took Emily's car, but we didn't realize the air conditioning hasn't worked on that car in a long time Uh-huh, and Alex's car the air conditioning doesn't work either Huh?

23
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:32,008
Speaker 0: I'm not my the only person with air conditioning in the car until I buy a new car.

24
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,156
Speaker 1: Yes Alrighty, but so we know we drive down.

25
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:37,284
Speaker 1: It's crazy hot crazy hot.

26
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:38,427
Speaker 1: we get to Wildwood.

27
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,070
Speaker 1: We open the door.

28
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:41,509
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty chilly in Wildwood.

29
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,559
Speaker 0: Cuz you know what the difference was?

30
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,589
Speaker 0: you were closer to the waters.

31
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:49,720
Speaker 1: Well, no It was actually just a really cool weekend.

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,262
Speaker 1: all things considered until the day we got up like the day We left it actually got stupidly hot again.

33
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:57,929
Speaker 0: No see in Florida It was weird because like every day there was rain.

34
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:04,921
Speaker 0: But it was like these really tiny storms like in terms of the amount of ground they covered But the intensity of the storms was big.

35
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,910
Speaker 0: so it's like for like an hour every day.

36
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,106
Speaker 0: It would grain like crazy, but which hour that was?

37
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,990
Speaker 0: you had no idea.

38
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:12,821
Speaker 1: That was how it was with all the times.

39
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,410
Speaker 1: I visited Florida with my family.

40
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,510
Speaker 1: We'd know that at some point during the day.

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,008
Speaker 0: Well usually I've only ever really been to Florida like in the winter or in this.

42
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,579
Speaker 0: you know I never went in this in the middle of the summer before.

43
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:26,197
Speaker 1: I think that's it cuz I've only ever been to Florida in the Dead of summer.

44
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,690
Speaker 0: see I've never been there in the summer.

45
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:34,057
Speaker 1: I've been there in the winter in the spring and literally I was down there for like a week and a half and every single Day for about ten minutes.

46
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,210
Speaker 1: It would rain harder than you can imagine.

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:46,230
Speaker 0: The thing is I looked at the weather map while I was there and there was a. I saw a green Precipitation markings all the way up from Maine to Florida, and I was just feeling good.

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,882
Speaker 0: I was trying to think of you on the beach getting rained on except.

49
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:49,927
Speaker 1: It didn't rain on us.

50
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,157
Speaker 0: well That's either what other channel said.

51
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:55,230
Speaker 1: so well the thing is it was actually really cool every morning.

52
00:02:55,311 --> 00:03:04,670
Speaker 1: It would rain right and scare Okay, and scare everyone off the beach or people would go home or whatever and then the Sun would come out and it'd be amazing.

53
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:07,197
Speaker 0: Did you go to El Russo's?

54
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,300
Speaker 1: actually we did.

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,466
Speaker 1: oh, man, I played some DDR.

56
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,790
Speaker 1: I played some air hockey.

57
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:18,239
Speaker 1: No, I got to say supernova 2 is pretty hot Tenth mix of DDR.

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,595
Speaker 0: at this point it is I Hung out with old people.

59
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,602
Speaker 1: I hung out with young people.

60
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:24,565
Speaker 0: They were old.

61
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,030
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to say one thing.

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,874
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you air hockey people are still listening But I know a lot of.

63
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,190
Speaker 1: at least for a time a bunch of people in the National Air Hockey League found out about us when we talked about air hockey.

64
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:45,944
Speaker 1: But one thing we learned from you people was the that the Masters the Pete like most of the people who compete on the professional Level use this alternative grip kind of like how in ping-pong.

65
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:46,245
Speaker 1: well.

66
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,470
Speaker 0: I think it's not an alternative grip.

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,609
Speaker 0: I think it's the grip and we were using an alternative grip.

68
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,096
Speaker 1: well No, it's like how in ping-pong.

69
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:54,850
Speaker 1: most people who play ping-pong play with a standard grip.

70
00:03:55,251 --> 00:04:05,106
Speaker 1: But all the super super pros mostly use the Chinese grip mm-hmm And I think it's kind of like that because I never I've never seen anyone do that except these tournament people.

71
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:06,350
Speaker 1: so I tried it.

72
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:08,186
Speaker 1: I've seriously tried it.

73
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,720
Speaker 1: I could pretty much pick where I wanted the puck to go.

74
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:22,522
Speaker 1: every time I could hit it as Hard as I could ever hit it with all my arm strength with the flick of the road because it's really air hockey is one Of those wrist games like throwing a baseball is all in the wrist.

75
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,210
Speaker 0: air hockey is also all in the wrist.

76
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:31,468
Speaker 0: You know the things that involve arm are like throwing a football is arm Shooting a basketball is wrist.

77
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,907
Speaker 0: I guess hitting a tennis ball is arm and wrist combined.

78
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,533
Speaker 1: actually no It's just arm.

79
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,681
Speaker 1: if you're using your wrist you're doing it wrong.

80
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,330
Speaker 0: You got to like rotate the racket into position.

81
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,270
Speaker 0: You don't hit it with the wrist, but you have to have the racket at the correct angle with the wrist.

82
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:47,022
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not good.

83
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,533
Speaker 1: That's lame Good way.

84
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:55,795
Speaker 1: if anyone out there is trying to learn tennis to get good at tennis quicker is to wear like a Rollerblading wrist guard.

85
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,341
Speaker 1: that won't let you move your wrist.

86
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:04,381
Speaker 1: You'll be able to get become a lot better in a hurry Anyway, but yeah air hockey is definitely all wrist action.

87
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,250
Speaker 1: So I don't think you'll ever have a chance of beating me again.

88
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,289
Speaker 1: I think I've pulled ahead.

89
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,490
Speaker 1: I think I pulled ahead because you won't play air hockey anytime.

90
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:19,899
Speaker 1: I'm not playing air hockey, but I practiced for over the weekend and Wait until I get an air hockey table, then you're in big trouble.

91
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,742
Speaker 1: What do you get?

92
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:23,150
Speaker 1: an air hockey table that I share in my house?

93
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,200
Speaker 0: I'll get my own house my own air hockey table.

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,230
Speaker 0: We'll see after I win my air hockey lottery.

95
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,395
Speaker 0: No, I'm just what I'm gonna do.

96
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:45,579
Speaker 0: my strategy is I'm gonna watch the videos of those guys because they had their triangle technique And I'm gonna basically do everything they do and just keep doing it no matter how much I lose and no matter how much anything No matter how uncomfortable it is Until I get it right.

97
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:49,937
Speaker 0: because if one human being can do it I also have an arm that works.

98
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:59,196
Speaker 1: what can also do it much like Lance Armstrong eventually will run across the Genetic freak who has like a double arm Then we lose.

99
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:03,390
Speaker 0: I mean I. if I if you know the guy can bicycle I can also do it.

100
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:12,380
Speaker 0: I watch his legs and I move my legs in exactly the same way and I just keep doing it forever and ever and ever Until I achieve the best my physical body can possibly do.

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,756
Speaker 0: if his lungs happen to be twice the size of mine That's the end of it.

102
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:20,425
Speaker 0: What I can't go to the doctor is a doctor.

103
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:26,007
Speaker 0: I need double lungs So I can beat Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France is better than axes.

104
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,175
Speaker 0: twice as good I need Z day.

105
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:31,109
Speaker 0: I Can do archery.

106
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:37,750
Speaker 1: So speaking of games that only use the wrist there is in fact another class of sports that only uses the index finger.

107
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,373
Speaker 0: Oh Burn you just.

108
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,319
Speaker 0: you're really lightening up with this today.

109
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,542
Speaker 0: It's a second huge burn.

110
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,946
Speaker 0: You've laid out this game.

111
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:59,240
Speaker 1: So so activism vision and Makers of pitfall, but we don't care about that at all because blizzard Announced someone was a makers of Warcraft one.

112
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:07,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll say this when I heard this I Honestly thought it was a joke and when I saw the link, I thought it was a hoax.

113
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,930
Speaker 1: There were it took three sources for me to accept that this is true.

114
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,766
Speaker 1: But blizzard is making a third sequel to click.

115
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:22,141
Speaker 0: It's not a third sequel It's the second second sequel to the franchise of clicking.

116
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:22,703
Speaker 1: Yep.

117
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,750
Speaker 1: I can't believe they're making another Diablo.

118
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:26,195
Speaker 0: Everyone knew they were gonna do it.

119
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,824
Speaker 0: I mean they're making Starcraft 2. they made World of Warcraft.

120
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,570
Speaker 0: Diablo 3 is obvious.

121
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:44,798
Speaker 0: They pretty much you know, they've settled down into just you know, these three Franchises really and they're just gonna continue to produce games pretty much in these franchises and I really don't see them doing Much else you see on the horizon.

122
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:51,457
Speaker 0: They're pretty much only gonna make Warcraft Starcraft and Diablo games from here on out.

123
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:54,507
Speaker 0: lizard makes a game that isn't in one of those three franchises.

124
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:55,310
Speaker 0: I'll be shocked.

125
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,540
Speaker 1: I just don't understand.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,810
Speaker 1: I mean Diablo 1.

127
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,190
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way and some of you might get around love about this, but Diablo 1 was a shit game.

128
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,326
Speaker 1: Well, I never played shit game.

129
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:14,903
Speaker 0: I never played Diablo 1 because I was in the PC gaming area at the time But I had like a shitty PC and I didn't buy it or what.

130
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:19,365
Speaker 0: I don't even remember but I was a game I never played but I saw and it was really popular.

131
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,136
Speaker 0: and I knew it was popular But I didn't play it.

132
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,639
Speaker 1: when Diablo 1 came out Some of my friends played.

133
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:43,730
Speaker 1: in fact a lot of the people I knew played it But I and by I I mean me and all the smart people I knew we saw the game We played at other people's houses a little bit and we realized right away that Diablo is the equivalent of playing hero quest alone by yourself in your mom's basement.

134
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:50,408
Speaker 1: The only difference is that sometimes in Diablo you would cheat people cheated hero quest.

135
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:54,886
Speaker 0: Yes No, but I mean Diablo 2 came out when I was like late high.

136
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:58,872
Speaker 0: It must have been 99 I think because I was late in the high school years I had my own.

137
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:05,650
Speaker 0: I had a better computer my Pentium 3450 with my bx6 r2 motherboard the best motherboard ever except to slow.

138
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:06,902
Speaker 0: but it's price still works.

139
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:11,010
Speaker 0: I have it and Diablo 2 came out and I said money at that time.

140
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:18,877
Speaker 0: So I said I'm gonna buy it and at the time is pretty good because you know what unlike a lot of other Nerds at that time of my life.

141
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,125
Speaker 0: I hadn't really played hero quest.

142
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,772
Speaker 0: if you said what's hero quest I would have been like.

143
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:23,536
Speaker 0: that sounds familiar.

144
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:24,863
Speaker 0: I have no idea what it is Scott.

145
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:28,988
Speaker 1: Diablo 2 didn't come out until No way.

146
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:35,523
Speaker 1: Sorry 2000. in 2001 it became quote one of the most popular on games ever.

147
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,778
Speaker 1: and when I say quote that is an Uncited citation needed thing.

148
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,543
Speaker 0: on what month did it come out in?

149
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:45,449
Speaker 0: 2000 doesn't even say this article is terrible So it must have come out either.

150
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:47,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely.

151
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:52,974
Speaker 0: I think it came out early in 2000 because I must have June 29th Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,640
Speaker 1: good game captain Scott.

153
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:56,065
Speaker 0: see I saw here.

154
00:09:56,145 --> 00:10:02,350
Speaker 0: I graduated from high school I got the game then I played it and then I went to Israel for a month.

155
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,129
Speaker 0: I came back I played it and then I went to RIT.

156
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:10,767
Speaker 1: See I did play Diablo 1 and what I remember is the Diablo 1 was terrible and I remember very.

157
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:20,228
Speaker 1: it's kind of like nowadays where I Really don't like Wow and I kind of make fun of it a lot and I kind of look down and found people who really Get into it because the game is so simple and all these sorts of.

158
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:25,190
Speaker 1: But when Diablo 1 was out, I remember looking if people played it and I'd ask them the same things.

159
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,073
Speaker 1: I asked about Wow.

160
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:26,253
Speaker 1: Now.

161
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,099
Speaker 1: Why are you playing this game here?

162
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:29,223
Speaker 1: Here's how it works.

163
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:29,564
Speaker 1: Ready?

164
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:34,835
Speaker 1: Click click click click Pushing click like that.

165
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:35,518
Speaker 1: Oh I won.

166
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:40,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I played Diablo 2. now I figured out exactly which months I played it in.

167
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:46,629
Speaker 0: the reason I played it and the reason it was fun in those days Is because a I hadn't really played that kind of thing before.

168
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,543
Speaker 0: B there wasn't much else for me to do until I got to RIT and such.

169
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:56,529
Speaker 0: because as soon I know as soon as I played Counter-Strike Diablo 2 pretty much went in the trash bin and never played it again.

170
00:10:57,051 --> 00:11:06,241
Speaker 0: But because I had a 56k modem and it was pretty much the only game that worked with Multiplayer with real-time on my 56k modem.

171
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:10,096
Speaker 1: I was still playing weapons factory I had a cable.

172
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,041
Speaker 0: if I had a cable modem.

173
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,191
Speaker 0: I probably never would have played Diablo 2.

174
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:17,787
Speaker 1: I guess it's just I saw through Diablo 1 when it first came out and I didn't.

175
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,153
Speaker 0: I didn't play Davos I didn't know.

176
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:32,558
Speaker 1: so when I didn't even notice when Diablo 2 came out and what I really want I mean, I think Dave and Joel and fast karate said it best and I'm not even gonna try to parrot what they said, but What could Diablo 3 possibly be?

177
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,645
Speaker 1: if it's probably gonna be I imagine well done.

178
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:44,037
Speaker 1: if it's like the other Diablo games It's going to be a super generic super lame Super easy clicking game.

179
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,582
Speaker 0: click on the bad guy.

180
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,086
Speaker 0: Okay now click on the other bad guy.

181
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:50,980
Speaker 0: if you're about to die Just push the health potion by one.

182
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, click on the bad guy again.

183
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:56,990
Speaker 0: Click on the bad guy again, if you level up pick any of the squares.

184
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,710
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter which square you pick to upgrade.

185
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,370
Speaker 0: Click on the bad guy again.

186
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,962
Speaker 0: If you're about to die and you're out of healing potions push the town button.

187
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,086
Speaker 0: go to town.

188
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,561
Speaker 0: if you're in town Sort your shit out.

189
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,610
Speaker 0: It's just it's work.

190
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,190
Speaker 0: It's not even like a strategy of what how to sort your shit out.

191
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,510
Speaker 0: It's pick the best shit you can afford and the best shit you have.

192
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,761
Speaker 0: Get rid of everything else.

193
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,092
Speaker 0: conserve space Potions.

194
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:22,115
Speaker 0: buy more town potions.

195
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:26,990
Speaker 1: repeat like it was such an inane game like there was no gameplay at all.

196
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,370
Speaker 1: I would say that it's practically zero engaging gameplay in Diablo.

197
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,990
Speaker 0: It's I think it's it's really in the same genre as gauntlet only worse.

198
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:46,103
Speaker 0: I mean on the one hand you sort of have the the Upgrading bits and the managing equipment stuff which a lot of people find fun and I could see how you know Psychologically, it's so it's semi can be rewarding.

199
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:57,437
Speaker 0: but as a game Gauntlet is more complex at least in gauntlet You have to like, you know navigate mazes that are actually not just you know, sort of go to the next screen They're actually navigate the maze.

200
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,281
Speaker 0: You're there.

201
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,469
Speaker 0: The bad guys are actually sort of difficult.

202
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,163
Speaker 0: You have to manage your you know potions fighting death.

203
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,950
Speaker 0: You can't return to town or anything.

204
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:18,602
Speaker 1: I think part of the reason why I saw through Diablo was because of that shadowrun game on the SNES because combat in that game was Yeah, I never played that either I didn't really existed.

205
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,969
Speaker 0: so I got sorry I played through that game to the end.

206
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even know that game existed so well into college.

207
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:31,620
Speaker 1: I actually remember very clear when I discovered that not only could I talk to that Fox girl But I could join my girl in your party and then she died.

208
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:33,206
Speaker 1: Fox girl, right?

209
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,030
Speaker 1: She didn't die.

210
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:35,434
Speaker 1: She died once.

211
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:41,210
Speaker 1: I turned the game off started again, and I discovered that it is almost impossible to keep her alive, right?

212
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,948
Speaker 0: So the hubbub about Diablo 3 right here is the way I see it.

213
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:50,528
Speaker 0: either it's gonna be like the old Diablos in which case why would I play?

214
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:57,136
Speaker 0: or This is my prediction actually is that it's going to be Just like World of Warcraft.

215
00:13:57,317 --> 00:14:01,930
Speaker 0: However, it's gonna be a little bit simpler a little bit less stuff, right?

216
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:05,356
Speaker 0: But you know basically the same idea but of course it'll have the different.

217
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:10,729
Speaker 0: love the classic Diablo three-quarter overhead of you and not the World of Warcraft behind the avatar view.

218
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 0: And it's going to be like one big elaborate Co-op Wow raid.

219
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,759
Speaker 0: that's what it's gonna be.

220
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,070
Speaker 0: It's gonna be one big really fancy Wow raid.

221
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,801
Speaker 0: So if you like Wow raids, you're probably gonna love Diablo.

222
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:29,669
Speaker 0: You mean, you know just getting in line to pay 50 bucks We're not if you haven't guessed that?

223
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,681
Speaker 1: Now I got to say one other thing.

224
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,279
Speaker 1: Dave and Jill also brought this up So I don't think it really needs.

225
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:48,410
Speaker 1: I don't need to say much about it But their term raffle gate is something that needs to be used more on the internet The the fact that people are seriously and earnestly complaining about the fact that the new Diablo game looks good.

226
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:50,294
Speaker 0: Well, this is one thing.

227
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:51,778
Speaker 0: that's actually one thing.

228
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,918
Speaker 0: while I was playing Diablo 2 and before I decided it was stupid back in The day, you know played Counter-Strike instead.

229
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:02,964
Speaker 0: I was actually angry at the game because everything was dark and like.

230
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:10,472
Speaker 0: there were no colors and it was hard to see bad guys and tell things apart and a lot of bad guys are the same bad guy only a Different color.

231
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,681
Speaker 0: and it was really like I understood that like.

232
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:20,463
Speaker 0: hey, you know the darkness sort of goes along with the Diablo theme but really it made the game sort of ugly and hard to play.

233
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:32,273
Speaker 0: and now that the game is actually Colorful and the bad guys aren't just the same bad guy with a different color and all that shit and People are complaining about that Yeah, okay.

234
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:39,097
Speaker 0: Actually, that's one thing that I can guarantee is probably the only thing that's good about Diablo 3 Is that there's actually colors.

235
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:45,950
Speaker 1: now the real question that's on everyone's mind I think is whether or not the chat gem is going to be there the what remember that gem?

236
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:51,392
Speaker 1: This is a big part of the Diablo mystique or Experience.

237
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:51,874
Speaker 0: all right.

238
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:54,985
Speaker 1: There was that gem you could click on in the chat screen in Diablo 2.

239
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:56,330
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

240
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,812
Speaker 0: I didn't really.

241
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:57,675
Speaker 0: I didn't really chat.

242
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,523
Speaker 1: people freaked out about that thing.

243
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna spoil the game for you all.

244
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,336
Speaker 1: It didn't do anything.

245
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,488
Speaker 1: Okay, it had no effect on the game at all.

246
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:08,765
Speaker 1: All right, not like those buttons and Raptor call of the shadows that did do something.

247
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:09,930
Speaker 0: I said I'm really chatted.

248
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,150
Speaker 0: I mostly click click clicked on bad guys.

249
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,674
Speaker 1: So you're so once again.

250
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:20,598
Speaker 1: you had the opportunity to play a cheating version of click hero quest online But instead you chose to play it by yourself.

251
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,125
Speaker 0: I played it with other people.

252
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:23,169
Speaker 0: Also, I just didn't chat.

253
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:26,529
Speaker 1: They might as well have been bots then.

254
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:31,910
Speaker 0: Well, no, because basically what you would do is you would go online right and they had to say like battle net.

255
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,930
Speaker 0: Well, no, they had two sets of servers, right?

256
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,047
Speaker 0: They had the battle net and they had the not but in the end the open right and the battle net.

257
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:38,890
Speaker 0: there was no cheating.

258
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,844
Speaker 0: Yes, there was.

259
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:46,107
Speaker 0: well Technically there was supposed to be no cheating because there are blizzard servers that were controlled that were completely full of cheating.

260
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:52,190
Speaker 0: BS, of course But I would go in there and I would get killed and I'd be like fuck this cuz in on the battle net.

261
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,900
Speaker 0: It's like when you died you died.

262
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,450
Speaker 0: It was serious business, right?

263
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:59,810
Speaker 0: And then they had the open battle net which is sort of like do whatever the hell you want We don't give a shit.

264
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:07,857
Speaker 0: You can actually bring your character from your single-player game into that action and I would go in there and I would just kill nubs And take all their shit.

265
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,890
Speaker 0: that way I could get a lot more shit with a lot less clicking.

266
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:11,737
Speaker 0: And that's what I did.

267
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,229
Speaker 0: the hand with the online action.

268
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:28,854
Speaker 0: We get a lot of people arguing with us all the time about issues sort of like what we just said about Diablo and World of Warcraft where we're talking about How Oh games got to be a test of skill games gotta have a strategy games got to be hard or else It's you know, not a game.

269
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:29,636
Speaker 0: It's crap.

270
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:32,124
Speaker 0: It's you know, people fight with us over this.

271
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:33,930
Speaker 0: So like, oh no, it's it's fun.

272
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,510
Speaker 0: I don't care if it's not a fair even game when they change the team fortress - it's it's still fun.

273
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:49,394
Speaker 0: I like it that you can't tell me I don't like it whatever and People really really have a hard time understanding exactly What we're saying.

274
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:55,129
Speaker 0: and I think maybe this little article that showed up might help you understand a little bit.

275
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,332
Speaker 0: basically, this dude is Complaining.

276
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:12,500
Speaker 0: Well, he's I don't know if he's complaining but he's basically saying that game developers sort of the way he sees it game developers have this idea that Games have to be strategic games, right?

277
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:25,689
Speaker 0: Which is what we say, right and he thinks that you know It's all game developers since they like strategic play put something that at least appears to be strategic play into pretty much all their games.

278
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:40,135
Speaker 0: and what he's saying is that you can make games that don't have strategic play games that are not a just a series of interesting decisions or skill tests and There's nothing wrong with that.

279
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:47,978
Speaker 0: and there's a lot of games out there that are sort of would be good if they would just Not try to be strategy or not Try to include strategic elements.

280
00:18:48,038 --> 00:19:05,466
Speaker 0: and on the one hand I agree with them and on the other hand I disagree with them because on the one hand I'm someone who really likes strategy games first and foremost right, and there are a lot of games out there that either pretend to be strategy games and aren't or just aren't.

281
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,438
Speaker 0: and You know those games are games I don't like.

282
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,263
Speaker 0: so when he's saying oh games don't have to be strategy games I'm saying no, I want strategy games.

283
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,290
Speaker 0: I want real strategy games.

284
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:17,417
Speaker 1: See what I think he's saying.

285
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:23,965
Speaker 1: the idea here is that you can create Experiences that aren't necessarily what we would look at as a traditional game exactly.

286
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:25,250
Speaker 1: They're more like a movie.

287
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:34,050
Speaker 1: It seems like every time someone mixes game and movie They just take half of each and do both kind of weekly and those you get modern Final Fantasy games.

288
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,710
Speaker 0: And this is this is where I agree with him and that he's saying stop trying to be a strategy game.

289
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:48,900
Speaker 0: You know there are plenty of good games out there that aren't strategy games, and he some examples he gives are like brain training or Grand Theft Auto or Guitar Hero or the sims.

290
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,505
Speaker 0: right the sims is just a sandbox.

291
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:52,110
Speaker 0: It's not a winning and losing game.

292
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,584
Speaker 0: It's not a you know series of interesting decisions game.

293
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,090
Speaker 0: There's no strategy to the sims.

294
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,220
Speaker 0: It's just do what you want and have fun.

295
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,390
Speaker 0: It's a. it's just entertainment software.

296
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,557
Speaker 0: There's not really a game to it.

297
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:19,270
Speaker 0: You know in the in the definition of game that involves tests of skill and competition but in the definition of game that is you know entertaining pastime And there are a lot of games out there that because developers like strategic play or have strategy on the brain.

298
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:20,096
Speaker 0: You know like.

299
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,372
Speaker 0: look at like Metal Gear Solid 4.

300
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:25,765
Speaker 0: You know they put in the stealthy bits, and they put in.

301
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:30,709
Speaker 0: you know some of the movie bits And I guess people like that even if I don't like Metal Gear right, but other people do.

302
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:32,674
Speaker 0: But they also put in.

303
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:37,370
Speaker 0: you know why does it have to be a game where you win and lose?

304
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,244
Speaker 0: And you gotta you know guide him to the to the thing with a chance of being caught.

305
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,536
Speaker 0: why not just make it a game Where Solid Snake's gonna win?

306
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:48,870
Speaker 0: it's a movie, but you can sort of control the action scenes to make them awesome.

307
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:58,966
Speaker 1: You know people maybe even you could lose But it's kind of like if you took a Final Fantasy game And it was mostly the decisions and talking with characters that changed the story in different ways.

308
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:10,637
Speaker 1: you made an adventure game But then you could still have combat or something like that But maybe only the so-called boss fights not get rid of the level and instead of the combat being fight Or cast this magic spell.

309
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:20,915
Speaker 0: the combat would be much simpler decisions You know such as you know attack run away, or you know Beyond guard or surround.

310
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:27,435
Speaker 0: you know much fewer simpler commands that were more of a choose your own adventure thing and less of a Manage lots.

311
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:30,810
Speaker 1: I do know this sort of thing is very very popular in Japan.

312
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:38,338
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean that antenna game for the Sega Saturn is basically just to choose your own adventure book And with possible with multiple possible endings.

313
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,890
Speaker 0: right chrono triggers actually close to it if you take the combat out.

314
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,960
Speaker 0: so I disagree with this guy in that I like strategy games.

315
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,188
Speaker 0: I want more real strategy.

316
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,477
Speaker 0: if you haven't noticed from past geek nights episodes.

317
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:55,159
Speaker 0: That's what we like.

318
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,348
Speaker 1: well That's I mean that's partly the reason why despite all the German board games We know most of them sit unplayed.

319
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz while there is a strategy there It's not much in many of them or none at all.

320
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:14,733
Speaker 1: Well that if you go by a game theory perspective a strategy a winning strategy is one Which is predetermined and will always win and once you figure that out.

321
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:16,280
Speaker 1: There's no point in ever playing the game again.

322
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:25,732
Speaker 0: Yes, because then you're not making a decision because a strategy in the game theory Speak a strategy is the set of decisions you will make.

323
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:35,380
Speaker 0: and if that set of decisions is already if you're if you already Determined your strategy when the game begins, and you're not going to change it, then you're already done playing the game.

324
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,368
Speaker 0: There's no more decisions for you to make.

325
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:38,333
Speaker 0: it's already locked in.

326
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:39,196
Speaker 1: that would happen to us.

327
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:40,040
Speaker 1: a lot playing.

328
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:50,475
Speaker 1: We me Scott and Alex would play Puerto Rico over and over and over again one summer and it got to the point where We would play about I don't know ten rounds in and we'd stop and pretty much agree.

329
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,040
Speaker 1: Yep Alex won this one.

330
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,773
Speaker 1: Let's start over.

331
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:58,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, you wouldn't even bother finishing the game because we knew we knew exactly all the decisions We'd make right up to the end.

332
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:11,474
Speaker 0: yep, so on the one hand I want strategy games, and I want games to actually be a series of interesting not much so much interesting But difficult and meaningful non arbitrary non random decisions.

333
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,359
Speaker 0: that interesting is good as well.

334
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,069
Speaker 0: Entertaining is also good.

335
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,619
Speaker 0: throw all those in there.

336
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:22,474
Speaker 0: but if someone's gonna make a game you know some sort of entertaining piece of software.

337
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:33,547
Speaker 0: if that is their goal to make entertaining software and Their Strategy gaming doesn't really have to play a role There's no need for in many cases a sandbox.

338
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,555
Speaker 0: you know type of entertaining software is great.

339
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,620
Speaker 0: a a just a story.

340
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,080
Speaker 0: Entertaining software maybe with you know some choosing of adventures and not necessarily winning and losing.

341
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:54,575
Speaker 0: Strategy is great and people need to sort of embrace that and stop trying to ham-fist bad or fake strategy into Everything you know.

342
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,633
Speaker 0: So yeah, this is an interesting read.

343
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:57,217
Speaker 0: you check it out.

344
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:11,631
Speaker 1: So before I do my thing of the day Scott should probably get his out first since I kind of lead right into the gist Of what we're talking about today.

345
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:12,480
Speaker 0: all right rim.

346
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,684
Speaker 0: So you know those.

347
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:17,598
Speaker 0: you know people like to play the miniatures games the war hammers and such right.

348
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,039
Speaker 1: yeah I was interested in them, but never really my bag.

349
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:28,155
Speaker 0: for most I mean one of the big reasons not to play those is because they take too long and mostly because they're really expensive.

350
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:39,320
Speaker 0: right and You know if if the only thing holding you back is the expensiveness right even after you buy your miniatures Let's say you even buy the paints and the brushes and you do the whole thing right.

351
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:42,417
Speaker 0: There's still the expense of the terrain.

352
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:55,554
Speaker 0: right now there's a lot of ways to get terrain on the cheap you know going to the craft store and whatnot but Here is the cheapest way of all to get the highest quality terrain of all Papercraft terrains.

353
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:58,868
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, it's about time of course now.

354
00:24:58,908 --> 00:24:59,550
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

355
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,500
Speaker 0: there's only three terrains at least on this page.

356
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,691
Speaker 0: But I'm sure this is something that's going to take off quite a bit.

357
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:10,760
Speaker 0: and these terrains actually don't look Like they're supposed to be used for say a war hammer.

358
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:17,264
Speaker 0: They look like they're supposed to be used for say you know D&D because it used miniatures now because it's like Wood crates.

359
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,520
Speaker 0: here are some one inch by one inch by one inch wooden crate paper crafts.

360
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:24,218
Speaker 0: Here are some two inch by one inch by one inch.

361
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,710
Speaker 0: Tombs you know paper craft.

362
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:29,700
Speaker 1: I can put them right next to the see.

363
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:34,637
Speaker 1: For all the years that RIT and all the years we really wanted that what it?

364
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,500
Speaker 0: what was it called?

365
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,345
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that three-dimensional thing.

366
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,152
Speaker 0: basically it was you would buy these sets.

367
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:49,797
Speaker 0: It was like mage something something I forget, but it was basically you bought these sets of already pre-made pre-painted like Actual dungeon bits.

368
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:55,020
Speaker 1: no I was actually going to go a shade cheaper and talk about how I never owned a hex or a square.

369
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they were too expensive.

370
00:25:57,428 --> 00:26:06,579
Speaker 1: and then finally finally after all these years Randomly I found one for really really cheap, so I bought the offset one right.

371
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:13,614
Speaker 1: yep We used it once and then Burning wheel happened, and I have yet to even unroll it in almost a year.

372
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,240
Speaker 0: We could play some battle day.

373
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:16,368
Speaker 1: That'll take.

374
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,299
Speaker 1: suck you suck.

375
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:23,153
Speaker 1: I'm done with battle day That'll take is only awesome in the college days.

376
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:23,775
Speaker 1: What do you have?

377
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,880
Speaker 1: infinite free time?

378
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,943
Speaker 1: I miss those days.

379
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:28,709
Speaker 0: we become idly rich when you play battle.

380
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:32,884
Speaker 1: ten probably okay in fact if we became idly rich Don't say it sucks.

381
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:34,088
Speaker 0: Just say you know it's not.

382
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:34,972
Speaker 1: nobody does suck.

383
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:35,293
Speaker 0: No.

384
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,096
Speaker 0: There's a difference between.

385
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,080
Speaker 0: it's not a bad game.

386
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:42,497
Speaker 0: This is not a convenient game that that fits with your current life's the way we played.

387
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:47,954
Speaker 0: it was a bad game That's true, but battle tech on paper is not a bad game.

388
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:48,074
Speaker 0: Yes.

389
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:49,940
Speaker 1: You know what else isn't a bad game on paper?

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,840
Speaker 1: communism.

391
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:55,884
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

392
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,630
Speaker 0: anyway, this is not a good you.

393
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,380
Speaker 0: actually I mean you wouldn't want to rule the world with battle tag.

394
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:07,860
Speaker 0: Yes, there's a constitution of our country isn't that the battle tag compendium?

395
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:11,110
Speaker 1: I think the problem was that we played now.

396
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,100
Speaker 0: roll 2d6 to find out if I kick you in the head or in the net.

397
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,699
Speaker 1: We didn't worry so much about money.

398
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,954
Speaker 1: So we just like oh everyone make an 80-ton mech and let's fight until someone's still standing.

399
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:22,860
Speaker 0: so you really have to play the campaign.

400
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:26,661
Speaker 0: We never did with the money Even.

401
00:27:26,682 --> 00:27:27,604
Speaker 0: I think that's cuz.

402
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:36,872
Speaker 0: a big part of battle tech really is that you know the whole world and the you know the society And we never got into that enough to really make it happen.

403
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaker 1: you would make it like up to 40-ton mechs With nothing but small lasers and run around being ineffectual till eventually you got headshotted by a gauss rifle.

404
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:49,880
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'd make 180-ton mech that had as much gauss rifle as it could.

405
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:58,220
Speaker 0: I basically couldn't get over the fact that my strategy works so well in mech warrior 2 But never worked on in the board game because in the board game everything was kind of broken.

406
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:12,000
Speaker 1: I basically would just sit there with a gauss rifle Only front armor one jump jet just so I could turn around Really quickly in case someone got behind me and a targeting computer, and I just brace myself and fire brace myself and fire.

407
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not really allowed to use a targeting computer in the a lot of things anyway.

408
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:25,313
Speaker 0: So yeah, check it out papercraft stuff for your miniatures and other Relative miniature gaming needs.

409
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,409
Speaker 1: so I have for you You did a lot of work on this.

410
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:29,832
Speaker 1: I did.

411
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:30,495
Speaker 1: I'm proud of this.

412
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:47,113
Speaker 1: it's in my blog not for any reason to get people to read my blog because I point out that the The most recent thing other than what I have put in my blog that I'm linking to is my thing of the day Was when I reviewed the wow CCG on April 23rd.

413
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:48,638
Speaker 0: now didn't hear that on the show.

414
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:54,613
Speaker 0: yes Before that was in March that I posted there's a game that pretends to have strategy.

415
00:28:54,633 --> 00:29:01,974
Speaker 0: that doesn't in fact in my could we make say a CCG or even just a card game a non collectible card game.

416
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,665
Speaker 0: right that wasn't a Game of strategy.

417
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:12,626
Speaker 0: that was perhaps a sandbox or something else kind of game easily some sort of role-playing game Yeah, like a nano fiction.

418
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:15,154
Speaker 0: Well, no no fictionary is still a winning losing game.

419
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:26,976
Speaker 1: We're talking about a role-playing card game Pure role playing cards, but anyway anyway, so Basically there are two webcomics that have been very near and dear to me in my life.

420
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:31,319
Speaker 1: one is penny arcade Obviously best webcomic ever bar none.

421
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:43,949
Speaker 1: The other one it was the bad boys of computer science not the best comic all things considered But it was very close to the way the front row crew was at RIT Which is probably the reason it has so much appeal to me.

422
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:55,440
Speaker 1: imagine you found a webcomic that was to a large degree Effectively about you and the conversations the characters had were often conversations that you and your friends had on a daily basis.

423
00:29:56,721 --> 00:30:08,796
Speaker 1: So between these two comics you can kind of see the entire story of tribes 2 from the very Innocent beginning to the dizzying Heights to the tragic tragic end.

424
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:24,620
Speaker 1: so I have for you in order 18 webcomics that in their wholeness show you everything that was tribes - I Almost cried making this because I look back and much like taiko said I can account for almost.

425
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:32,151
Speaker 1: I think I could account for a full quarter of the gaming I've ever Experienced and remembered and enjoyed as being a result of tribes -

426
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:38,391
Speaker 0: I mean I was reading the latest volume the printed volume of penny Arcade I think is number five the case of the mummies gold.

427
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:49,995
Speaker 0: and in it taiko said that a full 15% of his gaming fond gaming memories come from tribes and Really, I'm really feeling that there's a big because there was a tribes.

428
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:53,106
Speaker 0: whatever the fuck it was It wasn't really tribes 3 just sucked.

429
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,214
Speaker 0: and now we have this legions thing.

430
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,538
Speaker 0: That's on instant action.

431
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 0: calm That's basically tribes light, but it's not really the full-on tribe.

432
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,730
Speaker 1: Also, it doesn't have reverse mouse thus.

433
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,994
Speaker 1: I cannot play it.

434
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:09,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe they added that you should check But I've almost already given up.

435
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean cuz I installed tribes 2 again the other day me too.

436
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:19,234
Speaker 1: I spent an hour just flying around Remembering how great it was right?

437
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,240
Speaker 0: I also installed it.

438
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,220
Speaker 0: We're gonna try to get some tribes to action.

439
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:39,391
Speaker 0: But I'm feeling you know in at least our local community and also I'm feeling it from the penny arcade guys That there is this great desire for tribes action that is like this under current in the PC gaming world At least there's there's a group of people who want this action.

440
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:56,309
Speaker 0: even if the group isn't large we exist And I think we feel strongly enough about the awesomeness of tribes that we're willing to put forth the effort to make it happen even if it only amounts to getting a tribes to server up and Playing even with not not enough people.

441
00:31:56,629 --> 00:32:10,460
Speaker 1: if if it somehow came to be that I could just play straight-up Unpatched original release tribes to online with other people and other people actually played I would probably give up all other FPS is for the rest of FPS.

442
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:15,340
Speaker 0: If there were enough people playing all the time, I wouldn't need another FPS ever.

443
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,904
Speaker 0: I mean unless they saw.

444
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:17,747
Speaker 0: I mean it is pot.

445
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:22,400
Speaker 0: I mean as awesome as tribes 2 is as perfect as it is, right?

446
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:32,200
Speaker 0: the improvements could be made I Mean you could up the graphics that you could make the strike slightly more controllable.

447
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:32,903
Speaker 0: You could.

448
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:36,280
Speaker 0: you could update the the game engine to sort of be more modern.

449
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:46,960
Speaker 0: So it's easier to set the controls the void the the talking to other people, you know with the radio Yeah, microphones could you know and headsets could be supported a little bit better with a better protocol.

450
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,752
Speaker 1: They were supported better in tribes 2 than any game out at the time.

451
00:32:50,812 --> 00:33:00,379
Speaker 0: good guy tribes 2 is the only FPS where you can play online with voice and in 56k modem and you'll be just fine as long as you you know.

452
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,232
Speaker 0: Well, I guess now you'll be just fine.

453
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:18,476
Speaker 1: So In case you couldn't guess what we're talking about on March 21st possibly the greatest team-based Stateless multiplayer capture-the-flag first-person shooter ever was released.

454
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:21,608
Speaker 1: Scott bought it immediately like cuz.

455
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:26,787
Speaker 1: the hype before this game was Unjustifiable at the time like the.

456
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:36,940
Speaker 1: the amount of just people were going crazy about this game And I was leery because I was not terribly familiar with the whole tribes Star Siege thing.

457
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,614
Speaker 0: Well, let me let me sum it up real quick here, right?

458
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:43,080
Speaker 0: There was a game Called Star Siege, right?

459
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:58,880
Speaker 0: Actually, I just found this out from Wikipedia just now there's a game called Earth's siege and it went on Earth's siege and then Earth's siege 2. and who gives a shit right the Really started with Star Siege and Star Siege was a mech game, right?

460
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:07,545
Speaker 0: Just like mech warrior 2. because remember mech warrior 2 was a game of the year and I think 95 if I remember maybe 97 it doesn't matter It was like huge game.

461
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:12,960
Speaker 0: mech warrior 2 absolutely huge took over the PC gaming world and mech games are big back then real big.

462
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:21,279
Speaker 0: So Star Siege is another mech game wasn't quite mech warrior 2 But it came later than that and it had better graphics and what you know, whatever.

463
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:29,648
Speaker 0: Then from Star Siege came Star Siege colon tribes Which was tribes 1 and now this game.

464
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:41,359
Speaker 1: that was 1999. that game in and of itself Had a relatively small but Extremely dedicated fan base much like, you know mega TF and weapons factory All day.

465
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:48,206
Speaker 1: It was one of those games that people who got it and realized what it was and the potential that was there Clung to it like grim death.

466
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:58,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was also one of those games where they're you know There there are certain aspects to a game that when they come out with newer versions people don't like certain things that have changed.

467
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:13,700
Speaker 0: They cling to the old version like people who still play CS 1.6 instead of source because there are things about the old CS that you know, there's certain things about it that they love so much that they don't like that when it's not the same You know, it's like this source is a different game to them.

468
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:23,292
Speaker 0: Like there are people clinging to beta 7 when CS 1 came out, you know, so tribes 1 is one of those things where a lot of the people were dedicated to.

469
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:32,560
Speaker 0: it really clung to like the way Controlled the way it handled the way certain weapons worked and they really didn't like, you know anything about that changing.

470
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:40,818
Speaker 0: but tribes 2 came out in 2001 and So let me tell you a story.

471
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:49,879
Speaker 1: This game, you know it was hyped up and hyped up and hyped up and everyone was talking about how this is gonna be like the best fucking game Ever and I was very incredulous at this point.

472
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:56,840
Speaker 1: But Scott who had money at the time relative to me bought it right away and it sold out almost immediately.

473
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,419
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I was playing counter-strike at the time.

474
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,029
Speaker 0: Tribes is a big deal, right?

475
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:04,638
Speaker 0: I mean at the time the internet was pretty.

476
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:05,662
Speaker 0: you know It was like.

477
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:13,125
Speaker 0: these were days where the my internet usage would be read slash dot read penny arcade Read but read bad boys.

478
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:15,853
Speaker 0: the computer sides read a pit theater.

479
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:21,548
Speaker 1: We would be in front of networked computers Almost six or seven hours a day.

480
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:26,625
Speaker 0: and you know nowadays most of my computer uses like the web browsers The I am that sort of thing.

481
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:30,538
Speaker 0: back then most of my computer uses play multiplayer game.

482
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:38,560
Speaker 1: Yes Music and movies message people and I am to tell them which server I was about to play a game on exactly.

483
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:44,417
Speaker 0: So when this new game was coming it got mad hype and I was like, I'm ready for it.

484
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:45,280
Speaker 0: This is a big deal.

485
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:55,393
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be in on this brand new game because I came into counter-strike, you know Like like beta 5 beta 6 beta 7 something like that and you know I was a little late to the game.

486
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:56,280
Speaker 0: people were better than me.

487
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,638
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm gonna get this game day comes out and be the best.

488
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,480
Speaker 1: So Scott gets it and he brings it out and you know to his dorm room and he plays it and he plays it.

489
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:12,345
Speaker 0: I know the first thing about tribes - like I think we've talked about tribes - on the show before but we've never really We never let loose.

490
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:17,505
Speaker 0: yeah the thing about tribes - I turn this game on and I like, okay Okay, I do the train.

491
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:21,038
Speaker 0: I start a map and the map is loading now.

492
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:21,882
Speaker 0: You gotta understand Let's play.

493
00:37:21,902 --> 00:37:23,130
Speaker 0: There's a penny in three four fifty.

494
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:23,915
Speaker 0: Yes the same one.

495
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:24,540
Speaker 0: I just mentioned.

496
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,599
Speaker 0: So the game didn't load that quickly and I couldn't turn the graphics all the way up.

497
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:36,640
Speaker 0: But when a map was loading and you're waiting It pretty built up this music like.

498
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:53,880
Speaker 0: And Then as soon as the map was loaded like this guitar like full metal comes in like did it did it and this game Built you up and psyched you up for kicking some ass like no game since doom.

499
00:37:54,382 --> 00:38:04,079
Speaker 0: Pretty much because you know doom was the only other game that I can think of that ever did this, you know Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo and then you know.

500
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:19,180
Speaker 1: So, I mean, they'll talk about that a little bit before we get into this, the whole story, but basically we'll try one of the things that tribes had was dynamic music, like dynamic loop based music.

501
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:31,658
Speaker 1: The music would speed up, slow down, change flawlessly and seamlessly based on not only the map loading in the game, starting and everything, but what was going on around you while you were playing.

502
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:32,038
Speaker 0: Yeah.

503
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,660
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of FP, a single player FPS is today have music like half-life two.

504
00:38:37,162 --> 00:38:44,871
Speaker 0: They, and, uh, you know, the games like that, they purposefully put music in at specific points in the game, but it's a match what

505
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:47,463
Speaker 1: ha like seamless, like you're playing half-life two and you'll

506
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:53,532
Speaker 0: turn around a corner, obviously when you turned around that corner that triggered a wave of bad guys and it triggered some music

507
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:55,638
Speaker 1: and you hear the music, you think, Oh, this is one of those.

508
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Speaker 0: It's all choreographed, right?

509
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,118
Speaker 0: And tribes too.

510
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,340
Speaker 0: I mean, sure.

511
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:08,099
Speaker 0: We could probably do it better nowadays with our better technology, but remember this was That was a long freaking time ago.

512
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,240
Speaker 0: And what other multiplayer FPS has had music at all.

513
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,239
Speaker 0: They don't have music.

514
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,919
Speaker 0: A lot of them.

515
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,079
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike doesn't have music.

516
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,977
Speaker 1: All you hear is it does bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

517
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:18,180
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

518
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,880
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ.

519
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:19,358
Speaker 1: Hacks.

520
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,198
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

521
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,260
Speaker 0: Fuck Christ.

522
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:22,198
Speaker 0: Hacks.

523
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,799
Speaker 0: Doom headshot.

524
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:26,376
Speaker 0: That's the music it has, you know?

525
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:27,674
Speaker 0: Dominating.

526
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:28,709
Speaker 0: Yeah.

527
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:31,018
Speaker 0: Not much music going on there.

528
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:36,300
Speaker 1: It was so seamless and dynamic and tribes is tribes.

529
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,359
Speaker 1: Who's one of those games.

530
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,479
Speaker 1: One of those rare games that would pump you up to a level that was almost unreasonable and unsafe.

531
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:56,040
Speaker 0: It was one of the only multiplayer FPS that actually had like atmosphere and intensity and energy, you know, in addition to the actual gameplay, which you want me to, I'm going to begin.

532
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,300
Speaker 0: All right, let me list for you the things that tribes two had going on.

533
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:00,612
Speaker 0: Right.

534
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:02,618
Speaker 0: But let me, let me tell you the basics.

535
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,560
Speaker 0: If anyone has never really understood what tribes is all about, tribes in FPS, right?

536
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,402
Speaker 0: You're?

537
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,860
Speaker 0: the basic game is capture the flag.

538
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:15,819
Speaker 0: You shoot the bad guys and the other teams, you can get their flag and get it back to your base while your flag is still at your base.

539
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,579
Speaker 1: Now there's a couple of things.

540
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:22,220
Speaker 1: It made a lot of really big leaps in terms of what an FPS was.

541
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,717
Speaker 0: Now the second thing you have to know about tribes is that the maps are big, really, really big, like huge.

542
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,100
Speaker 0: We're talking.

543
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:41,797
Speaker 0: If you walk from your flag to their flag and no one interferes with you, if you just walk whole W and just walk, it might take you a good 10, 15, depending on the map.

544
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:44,480
Speaker 0: It could even take in your heavy armor.

545
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:48,780
Speaker 0: If you're in heavy armor, it could take the whole game for you to walk to the other base.

546
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,040
Speaker 0: The map is so big, especially if there's a hill to walk up, all you'll be there forever.

547
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,459
Speaker 0: You might not even be able to walk up the hill.

548
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,385
Speaker 0: All right.

549
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:11,900
Speaker 0: They're outside of their buildings and there, and because the maps are so big, it's not, they're not all complicated buildings, like a game like quake one or two, all the maps are sort of in structures, you know, in tribes, this outside and inside, inside a building.

550
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,800
Speaker 0: The buildings are actually relatively complex buildings with hallways and tunnels and ups and downs.

551
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,318
Speaker 1: And it was just seamless as in there's this big world, you know, Hills and trees and all this stuff.

552
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,600
Speaker 1: And your base is there with a bunch of over entrances and inside the base of the generators and hallways and all that, all your shit.

553
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:50,099
Speaker 0: It wasn't like say descent, three descent, three head outside and inside, it was a free space sort of 3d shooting, go outside and inside, but the outside, it's almost like you could feel and you knew the game engine was switching when you went outside or inside, even though it was a seamless move, you know, you could tell the game was changing what it was doing internally tribes too.

554
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:52,620
Speaker 0: It was the same game outside or inside.

555
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,038
Speaker 0: It was the same thing.

556
00:41:54,661 --> 00:42:03,320
Speaker 0: And outside when you're not in a nice base, you know, a building, it's just hills and valleys and terrain, mountains and little rivers.

557
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,660
Speaker 1: He does water and tick miles effectively.

558
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:07,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

559
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:19,760
Speaker 0: I mean, you, a lot of times, you know, even if you had the best computer and you had enough horsepower to turn the viewing distance all the way up so you could see as far as you could see, a lot of times the enemy base would be like a speck on the horizon.

560
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:24,040
Speaker 0: If that, so how, how does a game like that play?

561
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,819
Speaker 0: I mean, wouldn't you hardly ever run into anyone else?

562
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,980
Speaker 0: You would take, you know, every would be so slow.

563
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,157
Speaker 0: You want a fast FPS.

564
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,480
Speaker 0: We're always talking about how we want fast FPS is right.

565
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:36,340
Speaker 1: Well, one thing was the game was 32 on 32.

566
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,695
Speaker 0: Yeah.

567
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,880
Speaker 0: It was like sometimes we 40 on 40 on crazy math, you know, servers.

568
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:42,459
Speaker 0: You had a lot of people in.

569
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:49,219
Speaker 0: So even though the map was big, you really couldn't sort of hide from everyone to everyone had a jet pack.

570
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,239
Speaker 0: So you could go real fast.

571
00:42:51,460 --> 00:43:08,400
Speaker 0: And I realized that's one thing that these FPS is that we like, like the old quakes and the tribes have that even counter strike doesn't have in that not only was shooting skill based, but maneuvering, moving required more than just pushing the button to move.

572
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,486
Speaker 1: I mean, look at counter strike.

573
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:11,620
Speaker 1: moving requires nothing.

574
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:18,479
Speaker 1: The guys entirely jump strafe and forward and counter strike is click on his head before he clicks on your head.

575
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,219
Speaker 0: Moving in counter strike is standard FPS.

576
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,160
Speaker 0: Moving this, you can jump and duck, but that's about it.

577
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,160
Speaker 0: There's not much to the moving.

578
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,977
Speaker 1: Team forgers two is even less slow.

579
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,498
Speaker 0: You push a button and you were going to move in the direction you want to move unless there's a wall in the way.

580
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Speaker 1: But then let's look back at old games.

581
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,600
Speaker 1: A action quake was so fast that moving was critical, not just for shooting and dodging, but just for aiming and everything.

582
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,460
Speaker 0: There were also maneuvers to execute, you know, like you rocket jumps and grenade jumps.

583
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,119
Speaker 0: And there were, you know, the most grappling hook.

584
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:49,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:54,040
Speaker 0: The most difficult maneuvering I can think of in counter strike is in Italy.

586
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:03,120
Speaker 0: When you try to jump up the crates to get in that window, you know, if you're on the the counter, pretty much once you get that down, you've mastered moving in counter strike.

587
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,301
Speaker 0: Right.

588
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:10,182
Speaker 0: But in tribes to moving was an endeavor like you could practice moving that you had to manage.

589
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:16,120
Speaker 1: I would play a map by myself and just practice like dodging things.

590
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:22,599
Speaker 1: Like I'd circle strafe down valleys, like shooting my spin fuser at a tree while I was going down to try to hit it every time.

591
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:31,922
Speaker 0: It's like not only you had to manage because what it forced you to do was you have a jetpack, but the jetpack has energy and you can't just hold the jetpack down because it'll run out of energy.

592
00:44:31,982 --> 00:44:35,540
Speaker 0: It'll putter, it'll sputter and then you can't move really quickly anymore.

593
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,480
Speaker 0: All you could do is walk and walk in was basically dying.

594
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:38,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:42,722
Speaker 0: Basically, if you were walking, you were going so slow that someone just blow your brains out.

596
00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:49,699
Speaker 0: If anyone was around, the idea was to move fast all the time and but to also move in the direction you wanted to.

597
00:44:49,860 --> 00:45:02,480
Speaker 0: But because of the physics, because the momentum, you know, if you landed on a hill and you tried to suddenly turn around to go uphill, that you basically slowed yourself down to a stop if you did it wrong and you'd get killed.

598
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:11,440
Speaker 1: So this led to crazy, amazing fights between people where like two people are coming up a hill, they see each other, there's some sort of posturing.

599
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,161
Speaker 1: One guy like drops around the hill, but then turns around and chucks a bunch of grenades up.

600
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:25,745
Speaker 0: On the other hand, if someone sees you land on a hill, they can just shoot below you on the hill, knowing that if you want to keep your speed, you're going to have to move downhill.

601
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,439
Speaker 0: So they shoot downhill from you.

602
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:30,720
Speaker 0: And by the time their shot gets there, you've hit it and you've died.

603
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:38,119
Speaker 1: Now, because of all this and the way you'd move, you know, you kind of jet run, jet ski, jet ski, ski, jet, run and all around.

604
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,941
Speaker 0: Skiing was a technique of using going down hills to, you know, with, you know, skis in quotes.

605
00:45:44,962 --> 00:46:00,919
Speaker 0: You didn't actually have skis, but you would use the jet pack and the jump button and in a way to build up an incredible velocity to which you can, if you did it properly, you could traverse extreme distances, which you need to do on these incredibly large maps in a very short amount of time.

606
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,339
Speaker 1: But only in places where the terrain let you.

607
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,529
Speaker 0: I mean, well, you had to.

608
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,700
Speaker 0: you had to do it properly.

609
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:17,500
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, good player can, you know, keep speed on more different varieties of terrain, but also know the map and guide themselves along the terrain, you know, to more advantageous position.

610
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,424
Speaker 1: But don't get us wrong.

611
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:21,420
Speaker 1: This wasn't like bunny hopping in the old Quake games.

612
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,700
Speaker 1: This was built into the game.

613
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,062
Speaker 1: This was.

614
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:25,579
Speaker 1: they even told you this is how to ski.

615
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,063
Speaker 0: Yeah.

616
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:27,138
Speaker 0: And this is how to tutorial.

617
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,000
Speaker 0: The only single player component of tribes two are these three crappy tutorial missions.

618
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,628
Speaker 1: Was it five?

619
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:32,380
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

620
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,578
Speaker 0: But they basically say, push the button to ski down this hill, dumbass, and you'll learn how to go fast.

621
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:53,103
Speaker 1: But the end result of all that the way movement was, was that when people were fighting, it had this incredibly gritty, like realistic, militarily like it felt so real and so immersive.

622
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,920
Speaker 0: OK, so you had this jet packs, the skiing, the big terrain, the big maps.

623
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,584
Speaker 0: What else did you have?

624
00:46:58,624 --> 00:47:00,780
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about vehicles.

625
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,325
Speaker 0: All right.

626
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:07,801
Speaker 0: So there are three for the vehicles where the we can get in all the details later.

627
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:23,102
Speaker 1: But the fact that this game had a large number of vehicles that were critical to strategy and incredibly well-designed and the game useful, the game was basically to the point, I mean, now the one problem with the vehicles is that they controlled sort of crappily.

628
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:28,524
Speaker 0: They controlled better than Half-Life vehicles, but not as well as, say, Halo or Unreal Tournament vehicles.

629
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:31,960
Speaker 0: So the control on the vehicles, it was the best at the time.

630
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:35,720
Speaker 1: I got around it by writing a script and I actually used a joystick when I piloted.

631
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, but considering what we have today, it's not perfect.

632
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:45,580
Speaker 0: But regardless, the vehicles in every other aspect, besides controlling them, were beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

633
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,146
Speaker 1: And also they weren't like it's not like, oh, they're 100 percent necessary because like you just can't get over there.

634
00:47:51,186 --> 00:47:54,080
Speaker 1: But they were very strategically interesting.

635
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:02,140
Speaker 1: You would have strategies like you'll send a bomber and a bomber, remember, needs a crew of three, including the tail gunner, the bomber and the pilot.

636
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:02,401
Speaker 0: Right.

637
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,149
Speaker 0: OK, sorry.

638
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:04,080
Speaker 0: These are the vehicles.

639
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,286
Speaker 0: This is the hover bike.

640
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:09,940
Speaker 0: The way the hover brake works is if you are in light armor, because you can have light, medium or heavy armor.

641
00:48:10,161 --> 00:48:10,443
Speaker 0: Right.

642
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:12,659
Speaker 1: And you're not carrying a heavy pack.

643
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,084
Speaker 1: Right.

644
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:25,039
Speaker 0: You could get on the hover bike and the hover bike let you go on the ground only, but it let you go ludicrously quickly without, you know, having to, you know, use your jet pack or anything.

645
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,902
Speaker 1: I mean, it was so fast that and more than once I would see someone who wasn't that good at the game.

646
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:37,659
Speaker 1: come flying toward our base at high speed, not be able to slow down in time, slam into the wall and die.

647
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:39,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it was stupidly fast.

648
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,999
Speaker 0: Like if you wanted to go from here to there as quickly as possible and you were in light armor, the hover bike was the way to go.

649
00:48:46,100 --> 00:49:11,780
Speaker 0: I would often take the hover bike and a satchel charge, which is a big bomb on my back, drive the hover bike straight across the map, jump off the bike while at full speed, maintaining momentum with the amazing physics engine, use the jet pack to get into position, drop the bomb on their flag or in their generator room or somewhere, continue at the ludicrous speed, you know, turn around as out of my escape route.

650
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:14,200
Speaker 0: And as soon as the bomb was set, boom.

651
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:14,802
Speaker 0: And that was.

652
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:21,400
Speaker 0: I would spend like games just doing that repeatedly to harass the enemy the whole time while everyone else got the flag or whatever.

653
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,895
Speaker 1: But yeah, there was the the tank, the tank, which was just.

654
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:27,645
Speaker 1: it was a tank and it required a crew of two.

655
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:29,020
Speaker 1: And it was great.

656
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,662
Speaker 0: Well, it was.

657
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,470
Speaker 0: it was a little bit slow, but it was.

658
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,133
Speaker 0: that was the point.

659
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:34,567
Speaker 0: you could get stuck on bad terrain.

660
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:35,800
Speaker 0: So you had to drive it carefully.

661
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,580
Speaker 1: Oh, driving like that.

662
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:37,942
Speaker 1: You could also.

663
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:38,948
Speaker 1: there's a mini base.

664
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,880
Speaker 1: that was this gigantic rig.

665
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,299
Speaker 1: You'd have to drive on the back.

666
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:49,840
Speaker 1: How many times I'd be trying to drive the base and I'd drive it like up a hill and then I wouldn't make it and it would fall over backwards and kill.

667
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,699
Speaker 0: Let's talk about him one at a time here.

668
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,928
Speaker 1: We don't need to go into depth.

669
00:49:52,968 --> 00:49:54,380
Speaker 0: That's why I want to go to some death.

670
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,264
Speaker 1: We'll go into death later.

671
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,798
Speaker 1: Remember, you're just trying to overview all the things.

672
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,723
Speaker 1: drive to head.

673
00:49:58,943 --> 00:50:07,480
Speaker 0: OK, so I know I said there's the tank, there was the mobile base, which you would basically drive it out, then deploy it and it would stay in one spot.

674
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:09,120
Speaker 0: And it was sort of like an outpost for you.

675
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,422
Speaker 0: And if you

676
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:28,499
Speaker 1: want an idea of like the kinds of like the way this game would work, you would often have a base go out there with like a two tank escort and you would have a full eight or nine players like milling about or how doing stuff all around this mobile base, like just doing the kinds of things that you would expect troops to be doing in a real war,

677
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:32,210
Speaker 0: getting filling up their health, recharging their

678
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,274
Speaker 1: own terms of like.

679
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:37,841
Speaker 1: the base is going out and you have like the tanks providing escort because people are trying to blow this thing up.

680
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:42,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the tanks tanks basically had a driver and a giant gun, as you would expect.

681
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,820
Speaker 0: And one person was the gunner and one person was the driver set up out there.

682
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:52,680
Speaker 1: You've got all these support people going around, like putting land, spike turrets and radars at the perimeter area and kind of securing it.

683
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,163
Speaker 1: Maybe one guy goes up and clears the mountains of any snipers that might be hanging around in the area.

684
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:02,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had the strike, which was a one man fighter jet thing.

685
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:07,260
Speaker 0: You had the bomber, which is one person flies the bomber.

686
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:11,720
Speaker 0: One person drops the bombs, which were the biggest explosives in the game.

687
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,481
Speaker 1: Oh, those.

688
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:17,487
Speaker 1: the only thing more satisfying than dropping those bombs was firing that fucking mortar.

689
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, getting indoors.

690
00:51:20,282 --> 00:51:24,942
Speaker 0: And then they had the bomber had one person could stand on the back of the bomber to protect it.

691
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:30,824
Speaker 0: And then there was the troop transport, which was basically a big, slow plane.

692
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:33,840
Speaker 0: But like five or six dudes could stand on it.

693
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:34,867
Speaker 1: Heavy guys, too.

694
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:36,680
Speaker 1: That's the only thing that heavy guys could ride.

695
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,905
Speaker 0: So it's basically the only way to get guys in heavy armor to the other side of the map in a hurry.

696
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,680
Speaker 0: But it was also a big target.

697
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,480
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing that tribes had was moving on right from the vehicles.

698
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:50,400
Speaker 1: And I want to get back to the vehicles because they illustrate the point beautifully.

699
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:59,481
Speaker 1: I talk a lot about strategic depth and tactical depth and all those sorts of things in a game like tribe or like Team Fortress 2.

700
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:06,386
Speaker 1: The number of strategies on a map or at a given time or the number of tactical options is extremely limited.

701
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:10,020
Speaker 0: Like you could have a listen, even with the new added stuff.

702
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:11,628
Speaker 0: OK, how does the pyro have?

703
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,840
Speaker 0: you can choose two different pyro loadouts?

704
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,381
Speaker 0: All right.

705
00:52:15,043 --> 00:52:20,300
Speaker 0: And you can choose, you know, between two or three or four weapons, maybe.

706
00:52:21,022 --> 00:52:24,040
Speaker 0: And you maybe have a secondary attack or something like that.

707
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,321
Speaker 0: Right.

708
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:29,604
Speaker 0: Let me go through all the stuff that you had in tribes to just without vehicles.

709
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:31,740
Speaker 1: OK, so just loadout tactic.

710
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,606
Speaker 1: This is just loadout.

711
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:32,887
Speaker 0: All right.

712
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:34,800
Speaker 0: So you could choose light, medium or heavy armor.

713
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:35,965
Speaker 1: And they all like.

714
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:39,480
Speaker 1: light is super fast and can't carry much and kind of weak and heavy.

715
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,160
Speaker 0: Obviously, obviously, OK, depending on the armor you picked was how many weapons and which weapons you could carry.

716
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,120
Speaker 0: So you could actually customize your loadout down to which weapons you had.

717
00:52:50,200 --> 00:53:00,020
Speaker 0: So there was, you know, I could choose to have the blaster, the spin fuser and the missile launcher or the blaster, the spin fuser, the missile launcher, the sniper rifle, the chain gun, the Gauss gun.

718
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,600
Speaker 0: You could choose your specific loadout of weapons.

719
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,640
Speaker 0: You could even say just the spin fuser, please.

720
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,545
Speaker 0: No other weapons.

721
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:07,680
Speaker 1: So what you would do is basically you could save preset.

722
00:53:07,781 --> 00:53:09,660
Speaker 1: So I had like 10 different presets.

723
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,700
Speaker 0: One game came with 10 default preset.

724
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:12,888
Speaker 1: I made 10 more.

725
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:14,080
Speaker 0: You could make your own.

726
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,720
Speaker 0: You could say this is the exact configuration of equipment I want.

727
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:18,925
Speaker 0: And all right.

728
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,788
Speaker 0: So not only was there weapons, some weapons are ammo based, some ones are energy based.

729
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:24,019
Speaker 0: There were packs.

730
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,899
Speaker 0: Everyone had a pack and you could only choose one pack.

731
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:33,560
Speaker 0: There was the shield pack, which is pretty much if you activate it, you're pretty much invincible for as long as it's activated.

732
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:34,679
Speaker 0: But it used your energy.

733
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,047
Speaker 0: You had the energy pack.

734
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:42,159
Speaker 0: It doubled your energy, which is really good if you want your light, because then you could jet twice as far.

735
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:44,580
Speaker 0: But it was also really good to get the sniper rifle.

736
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,591
Speaker 1: Well, you had to have it.

737
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:46,480
Speaker 1: You couldn't use the sniper.

738
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,802
Speaker 0: That's true, because the sniper rifle used a shit ton of energy because it was an energy weapon.

739
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:53,660
Speaker 0: But say an ammo based weapon doesn't use energy.

740
00:53:53,962 --> 00:53:56,239
Speaker 0: You have an ammo pack to increase your ammo.

741
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,095
Speaker 0: There are a whole bunch of packs, the satchel charge, the bomb.

742
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:01,340
Speaker 0: I was talking about that I would drop off in the enemy base.

743
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,838
Speaker 1: There was also a whole separate meta game of stuff where you would pick like.

744
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:12,660
Speaker 1: you could pick up a spike turret or a spider turret or a mini refueling station.

745
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:14,439
Speaker 1: You could go out and stick these things in place.

746
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:14,760
Speaker 0: Yes.

747
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:24,206
Speaker 0: You could pick to have equipment instead of, you know, in addition to your weapons, like, you know, a turret which you could install somewhere on the map that would shoot at other people.

748
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,600
Speaker 0: Or you could have beacons.

749
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,172
Speaker 0: I think everyone has a beacon or two.

750
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:29,200
Speaker 1: started with a bunch of those.

751
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,499
Speaker 1: Those are everyone.

752
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:37,000
Speaker 0: Every single player has beacons, mines, grenades, and I think one health pack.

753
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,179
Speaker 1: And don't forget the targeting laser.

754
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,860
Speaker 0: Oh, and everyone has a targeting laser.

755
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,549
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

756
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,299
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

757
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:42,783
Speaker 0: God.

758
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:44,099
Speaker 0: So the mind so much.

759
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,520
Speaker 0: Look how much shit we're not even half through.

760
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:50,020
Speaker 0: And this is just some of the shit that everyone has by default.

761
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,080
Speaker 0: How much stuff you have on you by default.

762
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,200
Speaker 1: Now, in addition to that, we said you have a base right on a given map, right?

763
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,780
Speaker 1: You have your base, which is a big building.

764
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,780
Speaker 1: And somewhere in that building is your flag.

765
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:05,160
Speaker 1: Somewhere else in that building is your generator and the generator.

766
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:12,940
Speaker 1: Maybe you have multiple generators power things like shields that protect like safe areas of the base or turrets.

767
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:19,440
Speaker 1: And yes, turrets, because you see in the base all over the place by default and you could put more and move stuff around were turrets.

768
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:24,740
Speaker 1: And also outside of your bases, there would usually be a bunch of these like towers.

769
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:26,960
Speaker 1: And in the towers were these giant turrets.

770
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:33,499
Speaker 1: And you could get a pack that all these different kinds of turret heads and you would fly over there and install it.

771
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:33,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:37,980
Speaker 0: For example, outside of the base built into the map is this missile turret.

773
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,240
Speaker 0: And it works in a certain way.

774
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:47,460
Speaker 0: And I can go out there, I can fly over to it and change it from a missile turret to like a laser turret, an electric turret.

775
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:48,139
Speaker 0: Right.

776
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:53,800
Speaker 0: And the electricity turret, what it does, the missile turret locks on to flying things and fires a homing missile.

777
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,160
Speaker 0: The the electricity turret shoots anything in the air and drains energy out of it.

778
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,959
Speaker 0: So if guys are trying to jet jet pack into the base, this is drain all their energy emptying their jet packs.

779
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,140
Speaker 0: They land on the ground and they wouldn't be able to jet.

780
00:56:10,362 --> 00:56:11,459
Speaker 0: And then we blow their brains out.

781
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,980
Speaker 1: Now, in addition to all that, one of the things you could carry was a repair pack.

782
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:23,480
Speaker 1: And I mentioned generators, because one thing you could do in this game, one of the most important things is that you could destroy anything, anything that moved.

783
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,162
Speaker 0: You could destroy turrets, you could destroy generators, you could destroy the things.

784
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:31,300
Speaker 0: Basically, there are these things all over the map, vehicles you can destroy.

785
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:43,020
Speaker 0: There are these things on the map that basically when you want to change your equipment or sort of refresh yourself, like you would spawn, you would immediately enter one of these little stations to sort of equip yourself.

786
00:56:43,162 --> 00:56:44,640
Speaker 0: You know, it's like right now I have nothing.

787
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:48,420
Speaker 0: But you chose the load out of medium armor, grenade launcher, whatever.

788
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,064
Speaker 0: You're right.

789
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:50,440
Speaker 0: You walk into one of these stations.

790
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:51,739
Speaker 0: It goes whoosh, whoosh.

791
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:53,120
Speaker 0: Now you have your load out.

792
00:56:53,320 --> 00:57:01,380
Speaker 1: It's sort of, you know, so if someone was a spy and they broke into your base, they could destroy all that stuff or break the generators.

793
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:04,659
Speaker 1: If the generators are down, none of those things work.

794
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:05,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

795
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:08,499
Speaker 0: So you need to repair the generator in order to.

796
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:09,746
Speaker 1: All right.

797
00:57:09,766 --> 00:57:10,840
Speaker 1: So they destroyed your generator.

798
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,340
Speaker 1: They might still be in your base.

799
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,942
Speaker 1: Not only security systems aren't working, you have to go in there and get them yourself.

800
00:57:16,002 --> 00:57:21,719
Speaker 1: But you got to keep people defending the now undefended flag because all the turrets around it aren't working.

801
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:25,400
Speaker 1: Now, also, I keep talking about these turrets.

802
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,663
Speaker 1: There was this.

803
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:29,460
Speaker 1: there was this command interface to the game.

804
00:57:29,963 --> 00:57:30,205
Speaker 1: You could.

805
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:31,780
Speaker 1: anyone could look at it at any time.

806
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,100
Speaker 1: The way clans would play is they'd have like their clan leader.

807
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,640
Speaker 0: I still don't believe this.

808
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,748
Speaker 1: Clans played this way.

809
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:37,536
Speaker 0: Clans, clans.

810
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:39,539
Speaker 0: I never played with a clan ever.

811
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,840
Speaker 1: Clans played this way.

812
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:42,439
Speaker 0: What clan did you play with?

813
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:44,680
Speaker 1: I want to look on YouTube before I see some videos.

814
00:57:45,381 --> 00:57:46,305
Speaker 1: There's this interface.

815
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:53,568
Speaker 1: There was the interface, though, that would show you everything you could see, because another thing you could put on the map or radar installations.

816
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:54,740
Speaker 1: And you also started with radar.

817
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:00,019
Speaker 0: And so they were built in radar installations, sort of like, you know, just like the turrets that are built into the map.

818
00:58:00,361 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 0: But just like the turrets, you could deploy little tiny turrets, you know, by hand.

819
00:58:04,842 --> 00:58:07,420
Speaker 0: You could also deploy little sensors by hand.

820
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,480
Speaker 1: But you out there also provide like wherever you were provided a radar radius.

821
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,640
Speaker 1: And also like if a strike was flying, strikes provided this wide radar.

822
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,600
Speaker 1: So you could have a strike flying around the map as recon.

823
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:18,942
Speaker 1: Yeah.

824
00:58:19,143 --> 00:58:22,340
Speaker 1: And in the map, because it was so big, you were always the good guys.

825
00:58:22,561 --> 00:58:23,747
Speaker 1: So you'd see all.

826
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:28,459
Speaker 1: any time there was an ally anywhere in the distance, you'd see like a little green triangle to kind of give you a bearing on where they were.

827
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:32,480
Speaker 1: If an enemy was in radar range, you would see a red triangle.

828
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,960
Speaker 1: If no radar saw them, unless you saw them with your own eyes, you couldn't see them.

829
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:40,219
Speaker 1: And furthermore, there's so much to this.

830
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:46,845
Speaker 1: If you went into that control thing, you could see anything that any radar could see on this big map.

831
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:50,420
Speaker 1: And you could give orders to people from that map.

832
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,001
Speaker 1: You could also select any turret that your team controlled and take it over and run it manually.

833
00:58:55,021 --> 00:59:03,480
Speaker 0: So if there's a giant missile turret that's built into the map, you could take manual control of that turret to shoot it, guys, instead of letting it do its own thing.

834
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:17,300
Speaker 0: So between the radar and these turrets and the vehicles and repairing and by the way, if your generators go out, you have no sensors, which means you won't be able to see on your heads up, you know, like that be someone's name would be above them.

835
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,785
Speaker 0: Like if you were on the other side of a hill, you're basically looking at dirt right as you're climbing this hill.

836
00:59:22,368 --> 00:59:29,880
Speaker 0: But if there's a bad guy on the other side of the hill and you have a radar nearby, you'll see his name, you know, sort of floating over his head.

837
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:31,700
Speaker 0: But you'll know he's on the other side of the hill.

838
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,779
Speaker 0: You have radar, just like Counter Strike, even have radar a lot of times, right?

839
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:38,020
Speaker 0: But if your sensors are down, you didn't have the radar.

840
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:42,500
Speaker 0: So imagine if your generators go out, you have no radar, you have no sensors.

841
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:44,640
Speaker 0: Now you don't know where bad guys are.

842
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,625
Speaker 0: They could be in your base.

843
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:48,500
Speaker 0: You don't even know where I'm in your base killing you dudes.

844
00:59:48,803 --> 00:59:49,653
Speaker 0: And you don't know where I am.

845
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:50,260
Speaker 0: I'm just hiding.

846
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,139
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit.

847
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,800
Speaker 1: I mean, that we haven't even really touched on everything.

848
00:59:55,901 --> 00:59:58,000
Speaker 1: But what did all this turn into?

849
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,479
Speaker 1: What was play like?

850
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,240
Speaker 1: Like the kinds of strategies or things you would do are a map starts.

851
01:00:05,082 --> 01:00:07,960
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, maybe everyone will say, like, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this.

852
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,839
Speaker 1: People would say, well, you do this, I'll do this and you do this.

853
01:00:10,242 --> 01:00:11,139
Speaker 1: Then the map would start.

854
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:21,627
Speaker 1: And one strat like one thing, I would go out with another guy and I just go around the map placing radar and obviously skirmishing with people and getting radar in these good positions.

855
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,700
Speaker 1: And then I'd go back.

856
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:31,560
Speaker 1: Maybe I bring like one of those resupply things with me and I fly all the way out behind the enemy base, this hidden area, and I make a little resupply like place.

857
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:40,560
Speaker 0: You really you really like doing those support roles of sort of, you know, play with all the infrastructure and build turrets, build stations to help people out.

858
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:48,880
Speaker 0: You know, other people would be capturing the flag and killing guys, but you would be sort of deploying all the equipment all over the map to make it as easy as possible.

859
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:54,760
Speaker 0: You know, and then you drive one of those mobile bases out to the halfway point of the base defense, defending a base pair thing.

860
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:01,340
Speaker 1: You always have like a one or two people who I guess were your engineers who would go around placing and maintaining infrastructure.

861
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:06,524
Speaker 1: You'd have two or three more people who like maybe one heavy guy who stands near the generator.

862
01:01:06,564 --> 01:01:11,986
Speaker 0: And engineers weren't like TF two where it's build a turret and a dispenser and that's it.

863
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:13,320
Speaker 1: Engineers were all right.

864
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:16,520
Speaker 0: There was lots and lots of stuff near the flag.

865
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,983
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to go place these three radars and then, oh, shit, the North Sector turret is down.

866
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:21,879
Speaker 1: I got to go repair that.

867
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,540
Speaker 1: Guys, the enemies are all over that turret.

868
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,606
Speaker 1: I need an airstrike.

869
01:01:25,827 --> 01:01:28,602
Speaker 1: So then the bomber comes in and takes out all the enemies over there.

870
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:33,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can even destroy your vehicle dispensing machine and you had to go repair that shit.

871
01:01:33,585 --> 01:01:42,704
Speaker 1: So, I mean, strategies you would see would be like you two or three snipers go out and surround the enemy base, like in the hills in the distance, and they wait for the signal.

872
01:01:43,045 --> 01:01:47,308
Speaker 1: And the signal is suddenly a bomber flies over dropping bombs everywhere.

873
01:01:47,612 --> 01:01:48,220
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

874
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:50,280
Speaker 1: So the bomber is taking everything out.

875
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:58,043
Speaker 1: So you see suddenly the enemy troops are like, ah, shit, and you see him going to their vehicle thing to get some strikes to go off, you know, basically fighter jets and take out this bomber.

876
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:03,923
Speaker 1: Oh, no, the snipers kill everyone who goes anywhere near that vehicle dispenser.

877
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:12,983
Speaker 1: And then while you've blown everything up with the bomber and you wouldn't let him build strikes, that's when the troop transport escorted by a strike arrives full of heavies.

878
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:16,460
Speaker 1: They're in the base firing mortars through the doors, generators are out.

879
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,324
Speaker 1: You've got the flag.

880
01:02:17,745 --> 01:02:26,831
Speaker 1: You give the flag to the quick guy who jumps on the bike that someone else had placed hidden behind a tree near the enemy base early in the game, and he drives back to the base and you can't.

881
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:27,980
Speaker 1: That's one cap.

882
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,279
Speaker 1: Got another half hour to go.

883
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,340
Speaker 0: Yes, it has to be play the full on game.

884
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,021
Speaker 0: There are actually a lot of times you would play this game without, you know, bases, really.

885
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:38,900
Speaker 0: It would just be capture the flag, you know, with jet packs.

886
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,780
Speaker 0: And there would be some equipment lying about the map that you could pick up.

887
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,239
Speaker 0: And it was more of a sort of relatively pure FPS.

888
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,580
Speaker 0: And you didn't have the vehicle.

889
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,423
Speaker 1: A lot of don't.

890
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:57,442
Speaker 1: let me, you know, despite all that strategy that that the stress, knowing the strategy of yes, we'll send a strike escorted bomber to bomb them while we play snipers.

891
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:04,020
Speaker 1: And then we every single one of those people also had to have crazy mad FPS skills or they were worthless.

892
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,080
Speaker 0: Well, no, but I mean, I'm saying is that the game had had the scale to it.

893
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:11,259
Speaker 0: The game we're describing is the full load out of 40 on 40 giant map.

894
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,980
Speaker 0: But even the game also had smaller maps that didn't even have bases.

895
01:03:15,382 --> 01:03:19,060
Speaker 0: It had media maps that where you could play on foot, but there were really no vehicles.

896
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:23,920
Speaker 0: It was sort of just a on foot only map where you had all the equipment, but you didn't have vehicles.

897
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,299
Speaker 1: My favorite mode was siege.

898
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,760
Speaker 1: It was 32 on 32 or 40 on 40.

899
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,566
Speaker 1: And it was literally.

900
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,500
Speaker 1: one team attacks this base.

901
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:35,123
Speaker 0: One team defends that one team would be on top of the hill and one team would be on the bottom of the hill.

902
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:36,951
Speaker 0: And you'd basically you'd be.

903
01:03:37,092 --> 01:03:39,753
Speaker 0: one team is pure offense and one team is pure defense.

904
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:40,119
Speaker 0: And that's it.

905
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,754
Speaker 0: There's also rabbit mode, which would be get the flag and hold on to it as long as you can.

906
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,080
Speaker 1: All the sort of fun things you can do with an FPS.

907
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:47,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

908
01:03:47,682 --> 01:03:59,717
Speaker 1: But in terms of just the pure FPS side of it, you know, whatever, if you're doing the crazy like I am the part of the second squad that attacks as soon as the generators are out from the rear mountains, blah, blah, blah.

909
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:07,502
Speaker 1: The individual combat, the way you would fight was in and of itself one of the best FPS ever.

910
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:19,540
Speaker 0: And the thing is, you know, some people look at it on the surface level and they're like, OK, I'm going across this map alone and I encounter this dude and he starts dueling me, you know, and we sort of start jumping up and down, shooting at each other.

911
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,660
Speaker 0: And they're like, oh, man, that's pretty stupid.

912
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:23,059
Speaker 0: You know, why would I stop?

913
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,205
Speaker 0: I just keep going.

914
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:27,847
Speaker 0: You know, I don't want to have all these little one on one dualies all over the place.

915
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:28,939
Speaker 0: I want to have a big war.

916
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,339
Speaker 0: You know, the thing you don't realize is that.

917
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:32,205
Speaker 0: All right.

918
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:32,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

919
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,879
Speaker 0: OK, start running away.

920
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:35,064
Speaker 0: You'll just die.

921
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:44,022
Speaker 0: if you basically ran into someone in that game, your choices are pretty much either kill them or the other thing was with all the strategy and the way the game would go.

922
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:44,424
Speaker 1: All right.

923
01:04:44,444 --> 01:04:47,760
Speaker 1: So you are off in like a remote sector like there.

924
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,280
Speaker 1: Maybe there's this remote base and you're stopping by there.

925
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,063
Speaker 0: That was another thing.

926
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:52,490
Speaker 0: is it was really cool.

927
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,816
Speaker 0: is that the maps are so big.

928
01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:57,020
Speaker 0: there would be sub bases and even sub sub bases.

929
01:04:57,141 --> 01:05:03,480
Speaker 0: And they were actually complicated little structures that might even have basements and upstairs and towers and the whole thing.

930
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,600
Speaker 1: There'd be a lot of times I'd be playing a game and someone would give the call to everyone saying, yeah, the base in the north is totally overrun.

931
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:13,180
Speaker 1: And we'd have to organize a strike team to go out and clear.

932
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,565
Speaker 0: That's like getting one big base, but also had these little bases that they weren't totally unimportant.

933
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:24,360
Speaker 0: I mean, people would stop there to, you know, basically recharge and regroup and get their equipment back and all that sort of stuff.

934
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,647
Speaker 0: But they were all over the map.

935
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:33,440
Speaker 0: And, you know, sometimes these sort of these neutral bases, you would sort of want to take them for your own and not let the other team, you know, get too much control over them.

936
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:33,902
Speaker 1: But all right.

937
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:37,259
Speaker 1: So I'm on my way to my remote outpost to load up and then I'm going to go.

938
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,042
Speaker 1: I don't know.

939
01:05:38,062 --> 01:05:40,220
Speaker 1: I'm going to take out the enemy's radar like that's my plan.

940
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,107
Speaker 1: And then I want to snipe.

941
01:05:41,389 --> 01:05:42,700
Speaker 1: I'm going to do this thing to hurt the enemy.

942
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:44,005
Speaker 1: And I run across.

943
01:05:44,045 --> 01:05:49,520
Speaker 1: I see in the distance in the radar that out in this remote sector where there's no one else nearby, there's another bad guy.

944
01:05:49,903 --> 01:05:50,247
Speaker 1: All right.

945
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:51,380
Speaker 1: I see him in the distance.

946
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,659
Speaker 1: He's probably like 20 clicks away.

947
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,659
Speaker 1: I don't know what his loadout is.

948
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,730
Speaker 1: For all I know, he's a heavy with mortars.

949
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,259
Speaker 1: who's going to completely fuck me.

950
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:01,129
Speaker 0: I don't know.

951
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:01,900
Speaker 0: Heavy with mortars.

952
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,960
Speaker 0: If you get close, you can get them easily.

953
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,640
Speaker 1: But if you're well, the thing is a heavy with mortars, if you're just a light.

954
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,082
Speaker 1: All right.

955
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:11,900
Speaker 1: He's also heavy with plasma and spin that plasma plasma will fuck you up.

956
01:06:12,422 --> 01:06:15,100
Speaker 0: But the thing about it, let me explain the mortars, right?

957
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,160
Speaker 0: Everyone in the game has a laser target or every single person.

958
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:20,740
Speaker 1: What he would do is if you target something.

959
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,719
Speaker 0: Well, the way we work is you would choose the weapon.

960
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:24,319
Speaker 1: So I say, oh, what it would do.

961
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,619
Speaker 1: And then you say what it would do and start talking to you, aim it and you shoot it.

962
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,500
Speaker 0: And suddenly you paint a target.

963
01:06:30,082 --> 01:06:31,039
Speaker 1: Everyone knows how that works.

964
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:31,481
Speaker 0: No, no.

965
01:06:31,561 --> 01:06:39,300
Speaker 0: But everyone can see this gigantic, incredibly bright green laser going from you to what you're aiming at.

966
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,520
Speaker 0: It is so obvious.

967
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:44,580
Speaker 0: It is like everyone in the universe can see this laser when you fire it.

968
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,700
Speaker 0: It is like, oh, there is no hiding when you pull this thing out at whatsoever.

969
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:57,360
Speaker 1: The real thing is what it is, is you paint a target and anyone else on your team, if they are whatever weapon they're wielding.

970
01:06:57,741 --> 01:07:04,880
Speaker 1: If it is a weapon that could hit that target, it'll show in the sky a reticle and that is with that weapon.

971
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,912
Speaker 1: If you aim at that reticle, you will hit whatever.

972
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:09,960
Speaker 0: that thing is really only work with the mortar.

973
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,380
Speaker 1: No, it also worked with the missile and the missile and the close range.

974
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,396
Speaker 1: It worked with everything else, too.

975
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,200
Speaker 0: Did it really work with anything else?

976
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,838
Speaker 1: Like only if you had line of sight, like the spin fuser wouldn't show you where to shoot if you couldn't hit it.

977
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:26,220
Speaker 0: I thought it was mostly used with the mortar and the missile.

978
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,340
Speaker 1: Well, those are the things you're supposed to.

979
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,288
Speaker 0: And the missile really locks on to things, like mostly.

980
01:07:30,328 --> 01:07:35,100
Speaker 0: the missile was mostly for locking on to things in the air and it could lock on to anything in the air on its own.

981
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,859
Speaker 1: The missile could only lock on to something that you had radar sight on.

982
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,579
Speaker 0: Right, if you had radar on it.

983
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,579
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to say.

984
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,140
Speaker 1: Yes, but it could also lock on anything that was targeted with the laser target.

985
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:48,794
Speaker 1: So you could say your radar is down and you can't see that whatever.

986
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,660
Speaker 1: that's coming to get it with a missile from the turret.

987
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,600
Speaker 1: You paint it and suddenly that turret starts shooting missiles at it.

988
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,319
Speaker 0: That's true.

989
01:07:54,621 --> 01:08:02,320
Speaker 1: But the thing that was so satisfying about that mortar is that you more like you always have a few guys with the mortars or something.

990
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:11,560
Speaker 0: And the mortar in this game is basically you can only have it if you have heavy armor and it fires this sort of rocket, but it's a bouncy rocket.

991
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,600
Speaker 1: Well, it's a mortar.

992
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:17,240
Speaker 0: It's slow and it has this huge plume of green smoke that follows.

993
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:20,740
Speaker 1: It is one of the most satisfying weapons I've ever fired in a game.

994
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,460
Speaker 0: It goes like to doom and this thing goes.

995
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:25,179
Speaker 1: And it goes off into the distance like a mile.

996
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:30,240
Speaker 0: It goes stupidly far like you could shoot it halfway across the map, literally.

997
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,020
Speaker 1: So what you would do is like someone say like say all the enemies built their that that drive their rig.

998
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,200
Speaker 1: They have a remote base set up somewhere and they're doing stuff there.

999
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,380
Speaker 1: So your little sniper guy says, hey, guys, I'm going to paint that base.

1000
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,499
Speaker 1: You ready to destroy it?

1001
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:49,038
Speaker 1: And everyone says, yes, Shazbot, let's go.

1002
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:53,359
Speaker 1: So he paints it and then all the people with mortars see the radical in the sky.

1003
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:55,658
Speaker 1: They all start shelling this thing.

1004
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,560
Speaker 0: It's like for they for like a minute, for a second, they see this green laser appear, this bright green laser.

1005
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,513
Speaker 0: And then so they start chasing after who's shooting the green laser?

1006
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:05,979
Speaker 0: because they really have no other option.

1007
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:09,839
Speaker 0: So they go after the sniper and he runs away by the time they get to him.

1008
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:16,260
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, from behind them in the sky, just this shower of green smoke.

1009
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:20,760
Speaker 0: And then like the biggest, biggest explosions you've ever seen just destroy everything.

1010
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:36,939
Speaker 0: Now, what's really frightening and the reason why the transport is so incredible, if you can get a heavy armor with a mortar to the other side of the game, to the enemy base inside, you fire those mortars inside and bounce around like crazy.

1011
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,639
Speaker 1: And it's so spectacular, basically a nuke.

1012
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:40,992
Speaker 1: It is so amazing.

1013
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,779
Speaker 0: You go into the generator room and you just fire like three of them at the walls.

1014
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:46,783
Speaker 0: You don't even need to aim.

1015
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:51,040
Speaker 0: And they just bounce around all over the place with just ridiculous explosions.

1016
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,763
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1017
01:09:52,783 --> 01:09:58,058
Speaker 0: It's basically like like the Fourth of July in your closet.

1018
01:09:58,198 --> 01:09:58,780
Speaker 0: is what it's like.

1019
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,200
Speaker 1: If the Fourth of July involves being shot at by toxic mortars.

1020
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,199
Speaker 0: Like set up an entire fireworks display in your closet while you're in there.

1021
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:11,840
Speaker 1: I do also want to say that equally satisfying was the sniper rifle, which was just perfect in every way.

1022
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,300
Speaker 1: Like the way sniping worked in that game was so good.

1023
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,400
Speaker 1: Counter striking those games are just too small for sniping to make any sense.

1024
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,439
Speaker 1: But in this game, it's true.

1025
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,720
Speaker 1: Like literally, if you were a sniper, it was kind of like a real sniper where you kind of went out either by yourself.

1026
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,760
Speaker 1: You could use the stealth action or you come with a partner like in some really important game.

1027
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:35,020
Speaker 1: Sometimes like a sniper would go out, but he'd have with him like a medium guy because he'd be kind of bait.

1028
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,899
Speaker 1: And then when they came to flush out the sniper nest, oh, shit, there's a medium guy here.

1029
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:43,660
Speaker 1: But you'd like hide in the mountains, pick your target, wait for the critical moment.

1030
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:46,480
Speaker 1: Like, you know, your flag guys coming to do his capture thing.

1031
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:51,380
Speaker 1: So you shoot that heavy and kill him like 10 seconds before your guy arrives.

1032
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,500
Speaker 0: That is one thing is like he's great as counter strike is right.

1033
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,480
Speaker 0: They have these and it's even Team Fortress two and even the original team fortresses.

1034
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,880
Speaker 0: They had the long range and the short range weapons.

1035
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,260
Speaker 0: And it sort of makes sense, right?

1036
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:03,860
Speaker 0: You know, there should be long range and short range.

1037
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,660
Speaker 0: But really, all those games.

1038
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:14,260
Speaker 0: I mean, even though in Counter Strike, like, say, a P90 or a TMP is not effective at, quote, long range.

1039
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:19,820
Speaker 0: I mean, even the longest range in Counter Strike isn't really long range in terms of me aiming.

1040
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:25,500
Speaker 0: It's just long range in terms of, you know, this weapon has really inaccurate bullets in tribes, too.

1041
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:39,840
Speaker 0: Is the is one of the only games or tribes in general where it long and short range actually makes sense because the rap is so big that 90 percent of the weapons are completely useless.

1042
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,180
Speaker 0: I mean, you cannot fire a spin fuser across the map and hope to hit anything.

1043
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,698
Speaker 0: It's just not going to happen.

1044
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:51,720
Speaker 0: You really have to use a mortar or a sniper rifle or maybe a missile if you can lock on.

1045
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:52,858
Speaker 0: And that's it.

1046
01:11:53,566 --> 01:11:54,619
Speaker 0: Like the plasma gun.

1047
01:11:55,281 --> 01:12:01,620
Speaker 0: If you're more than say, you know, like a little bit away from what you're shooting at, it's useless.

1048
01:12:02,043 --> 01:12:03,760
Speaker 0: It is a short range only weapon.

1049
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:05,560
Speaker 0: And range makes sense.

1050
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:10,499
Speaker 0: And it actually means something which is not true for any other FPS I can think of.

1051
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:20,860
Speaker 1: Now, if you need any indication of, I guess, how immersed into this game we were, at least how how immersed I was, this actually happened like this.

1052
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:27,599
Speaker 1: This is something that happened so literally and so exactly as I'm about to describe it, that it's a little embarrassing.

1053
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:32,657
Speaker 1: But I scared the ever living shit out of my roommate is a good story.

1054
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:45,379
Speaker 1: So when you play tribes like turrets lock on and they make noise like and that noise was so like, I would really freak out in the game because you hear it.

1055
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,451
Speaker 1: And when you hear it, you know, a turd is locking on to.

1056
01:12:48,592 --> 01:12:50,700
Speaker 0: usually the maps are somewhat symmetrical.

1057
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:52,558
Speaker 0: You knew where the enemy turrets were, right?

1058
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,380
Speaker 0: You would only really go over there.

1059
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:03,140
Speaker 0: You would try to find a path to circle around back or you'd go so fast that the turrets couldn't lock on you or you would basically try to avoid turrets in any way you could.

1060
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:10,040
Speaker 0: But sometimes they would hide like a like a, you know, a wall mount, a spider clam turret, spider clam turret somewhere.

1061
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,393
Speaker 1: And you'd be like, fuck, but there was a generator to be down.

1062
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:21,480
Speaker 1: But then as you were coming in, they would be they would fix them and then to get how many times that happened to be like I'd be in the enemy base, like ready to do some business.

1063
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:28,078
Speaker 1: The generators are out and suddenly the lights turn back on and I hear like three turrets locking on to me and I just go fuck.

1064
01:13:28,462 --> 01:13:29,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

1065
01:13:29,882 --> 01:13:31,960
Speaker 1: So I'm playing this game a lot.

1066
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,540
Speaker 1: You know, I hear that sound, especially because of the kind of roles I played.

1067
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,639
Speaker 1: I've run afoul of turrets a lot.

1068
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:40,980
Speaker 1: And I'd like my reaction to a turret was this kind of, oh, shit, I get out of the.

1069
01:13:41,921 --> 01:13:48,940
Speaker 1: So I'm sleeping, I'm in my dorm room, in my bunk bed above my computer, and I am asleep.

1070
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:55,580
Speaker 1: I'm sound asleep and I'm woken up by the exact sound that that turret makes.

1071
01:13:56,161 --> 01:14:11,880
Speaker 1: And I kid you not, I yelled turret, but swung around, knocked the arm that keeps you from falling out of your bed off my bed and then fell out of my bed onto the floor, knocked my computer chair over.

1072
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,896
Speaker 1: It is crash bang and I turn it.

1073
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,600
Speaker 1: I'm laying on the ground, fucking hurt because it's a giant bruise in my side.

1074
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:24,060
Speaker 1: And I look around and I look out the window and I see that there's some cherry picker out there doing some work on something.

1075
01:14:24,703 --> 01:14:28,540
Speaker 0: The arm of the cherry picker moves, it goes every time it moved, it made the noise of a turret.

1076
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:33,919
Speaker 1: And then I look up and I see my roommate staring at me and he says, are you OK?

1077
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,319
Speaker 1: And I say, false alarm.

1078
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:38,859
Speaker 1: And I went back to bed.

1079
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:40,639
Speaker 1: I had a bruise for like a week.

1080
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, that can happen.

1081
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,719
Speaker 1: We would walk around campus just going.

1082
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:51,104
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, we had to go in order to get back to the dorm room quickly enough to play more tribes.

1083
01:14:51,447 --> 01:14:52,900
Speaker 1: I mean, Scott bought the game right away.

1084
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:56,360
Speaker 1: I saw the game and I went out the next day.

1085
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,560
Speaker 1: I bought like the second to last copy at that Best Buy.

1086
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,340
Speaker 0: The GameStop was sold out and I had so little money.

1087
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,879
Speaker 0: It's sold out on preorders even.

1088
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,480
Speaker 0: I have a PC game at a GameStop.

1089
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,500
Speaker 1: I spent it was 2001.

1090
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:09,661
Speaker 0: Right.

1091
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:13,640
Speaker 1: I spent money that I was intending to spend on textbooks.

1092
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:17,859
Speaker 1: I did not buy textbooks because I bought tribes, too.

1093
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:19,520
Speaker 1: It was worth every penny.

1094
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,230
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1095
01:15:21,794 --> 01:15:22,620
Speaker 1: I mean, my favorite.

1096
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:24,280
Speaker 1: My favorite roles and play in the game.

1097
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,660
Speaker 1: I love being the strike pilot.

1098
01:15:25,964 --> 01:15:27,119
Speaker 1: I get my joystick out.

1099
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:36,300
Speaker 1: I get in a strike and I escort bombers and I take out other strikes and I'd strafe like if this if the guy was getting it with the flag, I just strafe him as soon as he got on top of me.

1100
01:15:36,381 --> 01:15:43,822
Speaker 0: And it really, really makes me sad to think about like exactly how much how long this game lived, because I mean, we bought it in March of 01.

1101
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:44,734
Speaker 0: That's when it came out.

1102
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:45,017
Speaker 0: Right.

1103
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:51,179
Speaker 0: By the next year, when you're living in colony, the game was dead.

1104
01:15:53,161 --> 01:16:00,242
Speaker 1: That game was so lasted maybe less than five months before we played it in colony quite a bit.

1105
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:02,139
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't remember that.

1106
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:03,618
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.

1107
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:07,380
Speaker 1: In fact, I upgraded my computer and was able to play it better.

1108
01:16:08,144 --> 01:16:09,759
Speaker 0: I don't remember playing it in colony at all.

1109
01:16:10,302 --> 01:16:10,683
Speaker 0: I remember.

1110
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:16,380
Speaker 0: I remember playing it, you know, freshman year after it came out, I remember playing it at home over that summer.

1111
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:18,860
Speaker 0: And then that was all I remember.

1112
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,099
Speaker 1: We definitely played it in colony quite a bit.

1113
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,030
Speaker 0: I don't remember it.

1114
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,900
Speaker 0: But anyway, I don't know.

1115
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:23,645
Speaker 1: How you couldn't.

1116
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:25,599
Speaker 1: That was some of the best times.

1117
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:31,379
Speaker 0: Now they both play on the same server because both are compared to definitely in the freshman year where the game was fresh.

1118
01:16:31,882 --> 01:16:33,320
Speaker 1: How could you not remember, Scott?

1119
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,860
Speaker 1: We would both our computers were in the living room.

1120
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,519
Speaker 1: We would play on the same server on the same team like every time.

1121
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:41,400
Speaker 0: I remember doing Counter-Strike like that.

1122
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,718
Speaker 0: I remember doing tribes like that.

1123
01:16:43,284 --> 01:16:44,458
Speaker 0: I remember being dead by then.

1124
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,758
Speaker 1: That's really weird.

1125
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:53,151
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't think I want to talk about what like why tribes to fell and what happened to it because basically they kept.

1126
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:54,076
Speaker 1: we don't we don't even need.

1127
01:16:54,116 --> 01:16:54,880
Speaker 1: it's so sad.

1128
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,000
Speaker 1: It wasn't even just the patches.

1129
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:05,682
Speaker 1: It was the modding community and the fact that the developers basically listened to all the people telling them what to do with their game instead of just leaving well enough alone.

1130
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:07,451
Speaker 0: Here is something interesting about tribes.

1131
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:20,639
Speaker 0: to is the first game, at least as far as I could tell, where it came with a built in and decent matchmaking system for, you know, starting servers, joining games, leaving games, finding servers to play on this whole community thing.

1132
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,920
Speaker 0: It had a forum built into the game and email email built into the game.

1133
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,167
Speaker 0: I had tribes email address.

1134
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:37,061
Speaker 1: clans were built into the game, like playing the game as a clan, your clan leadership and all that stuff and voting and everything we had into the game.

1135
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:43,180
Speaker 0: We had an RIT logo in the game on our clan, like, you know, the tiger and the whole thing was in the game.

1136
01:17:43,260 --> 01:18:00,800
Speaker 0: You can go to our RIT clan page if it was still up and people could join and leave the clan and you could pick the clan leader and vote and kick in the whole chat rooms, even for the whole everything, a whole gaming community built into the game, not like games today, where if there's a community, it's on the website, it's separate.

1137
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:09,560
Speaker 0: This is, you know, your tabs in the game were pretty much list of servers, chat room, your email, the forum, your clan.

1138
01:18:10,362 --> 01:18:11,687
Speaker 0: It was crazy.

1139
01:18:11,707 --> 01:18:17,819
Speaker 0: And the problem is they paid attention to that forum and they did what people in the forum asked, and that ruined the game.

1140
01:18:18,962 --> 01:18:20,780
Speaker 1: But that game was just so good.

1141
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:22,200
Speaker 0: It was so good.

1142
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,440
Speaker 0: I mean, look at how many Webcomics there are about this game.

1143
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:30,720
Speaker 1: I mean, in a short I spent about 10 minutes and I found 18 Webcomics about tribes, too.

1144
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:36,267
Speaker 0: If I'd included tribes one and this is only two Webcomics, bad boys, computer science and penny arcade.

1145
01:18:36,368 --> 01:18:37,559
Speaker 1: I didn't even look anywhere else.

1146
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,460
Speaker 0: You didn't even look at any other gaming Webcomics.

1147
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,059
Speaker 0: Maybe there's some PVPs about it.

1148
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:42,144
Speaker 0: Maybe there's.

1149
01:18:42,828 --> 01:18:44,720
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's plenty other gaming comics out there.

1150
01:18:45,204 --> 01:18:45,978
Speaker 0: That have tribes, too.

1151
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,540
Speaker 1: I mean, if I if I were to rank and that's just comics, it was just comics.

1152
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:58,000
Speaker 1: It's pretty much tribes to weapons factory, Counter-Strike, Mega TF, Natural Selection.

1153
01:18:58,941 --> 01:19:01,300
Speaker 1: That's fucking hit Action Quake.

1154
01:19:02,162 --> 01:19:02,484
Speaker 0: Right.

1155
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,207
Speaker 0: So we've got.

1156
01:19:03,308 --> 01:19:05,720
Speaker 0: there was also like some mods to tribes, too.

1157
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,700
Speaker 0: They were all awful.

1158
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,602
Speaker 0: Well, there was.

1159
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:13,088
Speaker 0: there was the legacy one that was like so it would play more like tribes one.

1160
01:19:13,108 --> 01:19:13,518
Speaker 0: Remember that?

1161
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:16,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in the dying days that that started picking up.

1162
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, stuff like that.

1163
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,800
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons that tribes, too, started to collapse.

1164
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,100
Speaker 1: I mean, patches didn't just make the game worse.

1165
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:29,499
Speaker 1: They actually broke the game, like at least five or six of the patches they released actually broke the game to where it would not start.

1166
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:30,082
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1167
01:19:30,142 --> 01:19:33,700
Speaker 1: And then suddenly no one was playing tribes because they'd broken the game.

1168
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:39,302
Speaker 0: And the only way to like this huge, huge, huge, huge number of servers and number of users.

1169
01:19:39,684 --> 01:19:42,719
Speaker 0: when the game was brand new and within a few months, it was really.

1170
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:45,080
Speaker 0: it was actually hard to find a full game of 40 people.

1171
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,059
Speaker 0: But the best times are when those servers are full.

1172
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,580
Speaker 1: It lasted longer than a few months.

1173
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:53,820
Speaker 0: I remember very distinctly it was still being played, I guess, you know, later.

1174
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,002
Speaker 1: You considering you don't remember us playing in colony, you really have no right to talk.

1175
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:01,460
Speaker 0: I don't remember being played in colony anyway.

1176
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, tribes, too, for the.

1177
01:20:05,374 --> 01:20:06,440
Speaker 0: I don't know what else to say.

1178
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:12,203
Speaker 1: So anyone who thinks that Team Fortress two is a good FPS, you don't know what you're talking about.

1179
01:20:12,243 --> 01:20:21,943
Speaker 0: God, if you've never played tribes to if you've never played a full game of tribes to meet a lot of people who played tribes to didn't even realize all the stuff that could be done.

1180
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:30,534
Speaker 1: I mean, I know there was a like the clan interface for like the commanding troops until about a month after I was I clicked on.

1181
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:34,377
Speaker 0: most people played and never used a grenade or a mine at all.

1182
01:20:34,901 --> 01:20:37,453
Speaker 0: They didn't realize they had them, but they're.

1183
01:20:37,614 --> 01:20:39,183
Speaker 0: everyone has them and they're super important.

1184
01:20:39,344 --> 01:20:40,980
Speaker 0: They're actually different kinds of grenades.

1185
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:44,600
Speaker 0: They're flash grenades and explosive grenades and the whole thing.

1186
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,868
Speaker 0: They're different kinds of mines, too.

1187
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:47,279
Speaker 0: I think I forget which kinds, though.

1188
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,720
Speaker 1: Oh, there's OK, we're done.

1189
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,620
Speaker 1: I'm just going to start going crazy about this game.

1190
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love tribes to tribes to all tribes to combine.

1191
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:57,722
Speaker 1: It's like.

1192
01:20:57,783 --> 01:21:01,923
Speaker 1: it's like that one time we played Crystal Chronicles over the course of an entire weekend.

1193
01:21:01,943 --> 01:21:03,429
Speaker 1: It just it will.

1194
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:07,144
Speaker 1: it will live in my heart as some of the greatest gaming I've ever had.

1195
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:10,340
Speaker 0: So we're trying to get tribes to go in again.

1196
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:15,120
Speaker 0: We got the client worked as somebody in the forum posted like a how to thing.

1197
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,059
Speaker 0: So I followed it and I got the game to work.

1198
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:19,999
Speaker 0: I just need a server to play on.

1199
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:25,202
Speaker 0: And we're in business because the authentication servers and all that stuff are down now.

1200
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:29,240
Speaker 0: See what you need to do to play is you need to play the single player land mode.

1201
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:37,480
Speaker 0: But then when you're on the server selection screen that looks for land servers, you push the insert key on your keyboard and you type in an IP address.

1202
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:40,660
Speaker 0: And that allows you to play on, you know, remote servers.

1203
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:42,820
Speaker 0: But you need to know the IP address of the servers.

1204
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,507
Speaker 0: And I have been able to find any.

1205
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,858
Speaker 0: so someone can find a working tribe server.

1206
01:21:46,878 --> 01:21:50,420
Speaker 0: because I found some websites that were like, here's an IP address for a tribes to server.

1207
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:52,360
Speaker 0: No, the server is not there anymore.

1208
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:57,840
Speaker 0: So anyone could set up a server or knows where a server is at or anything.

1209
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,840
Speaker 1: We're working on it, especially with the current schedule of you guys.

1210
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:12,639
Speaker 0: We will probably want like if if and when this comes up, we will schedule a time and we will play tribes, but you can set up the client as a how to and it's you can download the game for free and the whole thing.

1211
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:22,100
