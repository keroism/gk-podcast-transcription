1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,760
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:12,084
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 18th 2022.

3
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:15,513
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:17,640
Speaker 0: We are talking about video cables.

5
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:20,358
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:31,846
Speaker 0: so, uh got real warm got like 70s warm and I did a bunch of bike like about Five hours couple days.

7
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:33,852
Speaker 0: It was like upper 60s that second day.

8
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:39,507
Speaker 0: So I've learned that with clay in the era of climate change He even like in New York City.

9
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:43,319
Speaker 0: the forecast for the next day will be radically different by the time that next day comes.

10
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:46,887
Speaker 0: so Anyway, I got a whole ton of biking in.

11
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:48,051
Speaker 0: it was a fantastic weekend.

12
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,560
Speaker 0: I get up this morning thinking maybe I'll bike to work.

13
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,889
Speaker 0: It's like 40 degrees.

14
00:00:52,453 --> 00:01:02,080
Speaker 0: I still bikes but It was not as pleasant as say Biking over the new Brooklyn Bridge bike path, which I did for the first time with Emily over the weekend.

15
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,730
Speaker 0: Mmm, it's it's I'd never been over.

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,333
Speaker 1: It's a path.

17
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:07,919
Speaker 0: Yeah completely separate.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,456
Speaker 0: biking on that was interesting because I saw that the Pedestrian slash tourist part of it was completely packed with people who couldn't even walk.

19
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:22,594
Speaker 0: It was so crowded And there was like two or three other bikers on the bike path.

20
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:23,518
Speaker 0: Everyone's just flying.

21
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:28,640
Speaker 0: It was a good time But it's gonna be cold I think for the rest of this week.

22
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:30,763
Speaker 1: It's annoying.

23
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,311
Speaker 1: it's like it's like we're gonna have climate change right.

24
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:38,699
Speaker 1: at least just give me the one upside Which is it's supposed to be warmer, right?

25
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:39,884
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

26
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:43,540
Speaker 0: The problem is it's gonna be warmer, but it's also gonna be more variable.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,807
Speaker 0: So our winters will be colder and worse.

28
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:47,152
Speaker 0: our summers will be hotter.

29
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,014
Speaker 0: But also worse.

30
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,820
Speaker 0: It's gonna swing a lot more.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,826
Speaker 0: It's gonna be less.

32
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,033
Speaker 1: thing is hotter and worse.

33
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:52,778
Speaker 1: hotter is better.

34
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,554
Speaker 0: I'll tell you hit that wet bulb temperature and the human body just literally dies.

35
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:01,559
Speaker 1: I If I literally die, you know, at least I'll die warm.

36
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:14,651
Speaker 0: But in more exciting news if you haven't noticed The price of video cards is slowly but surely Approaching reasonable prices again for a bunch of reasons.

37
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,216
Speaker 1: It's going down a little bit.

38
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:17,400
Speaker 1: It's actually going down hurt.

39
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:20,352
Speaker 1: Actually, I heard the prices are actually not bad in the UK.

40
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,100
Speaker 0: I saw oh, they're not bad in the u.s.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,984
Speaker 0: So I died.

42
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:24,008
Speaker 0: so I looked again.

43
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:24,812
Speaker 0: I actually bought.

44
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:28,460
Speaker 0: now we bought a 3080 tie Titanium the fancy one.

45
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:42,540
Speaker 0: The big thing I noticed was the biggest price discrepancy is still the 3080 because if you look at MSRP The the GTX 3080 is the absolute sweet spot of dollar for performance like bard.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,082
Speaker 1: No, what's the?

47
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,085
Speaker 1: what's the MSRP?

48
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:44,808
Speaker 1: 700 bucks?

49
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,133
Speaker 0: No, I got to look it up again.

50
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,140
Speaker 0: It's really it's shockingly low.

51
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,921
Speaker 0: Let's see MSRP 3080.

52
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,287
Speaker 0: I live in share my browser.

53
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,515
Speaker 0: So the stream guy can see seven months.

54
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,660
Speaker 1: That's what I just said.

55
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:09,600
Speaker 0: yep, so 700 bucks is a fantastic price for a 3080 but the actual price even if you buy it direct from a store is About double that or more because they're in so much to me.

56
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:10,402
Speaker 1: So you get it.

57
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:19,975
Speaker 0: but I've seen him for like a thousand eleven hundred give or take but very rarely and usually those require Being in a weird line being in a lottery All sorts of nonsense.

58
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:49,890
Speaker 0: and Meanwhile, if you go up to the 3080 tie or the 3090 the MSRP is higher and the performance per dollar Like there's diminishing returns obviously, but if you buy these cards right now the price that you actually pay from a non scalper the difference in price between MSRP and The overcharge from lack of supply is way lower.

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,620
Speaker 0: You're paying a way closer to MSRP, but you're still paying an above.

60
00:03:54,261 --> 00:04:05,657
Speaker 0: so I ended up getting a 3080 TI that cost about the same as what a 3080 is going for right now and Put in Emily's computer with the i9 and that thing one.

61
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,269
Speaker 0: It is huge.

62
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:16,481
Speaker 0: It is absolutely huge Which is terrifying to me because it is still significantly smaller than a 3090.

63
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:41,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's you know, I mean that's the thing is that you know people keep comparing right, you know The Apple computers to write PCs as they should right and you Even if I buy a PC and I pay the overcharge for the 3080 3090 whatever right and it's like, you know You're gonna beat you the Apple computer right?

64
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,357
Speaker 1: Even that new Mac studio.

65
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,393
Speaker 1: You're gonna beat it It's gonna be faster, right?

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,681
Speaker 1: But what you're not counting taking into account is I think I've said this on the show probably a million times is It's?

67
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:58,680
Speaker 1: you know, it's basically using ridiculous amounts of power and generating ridiculous amounts of heat.

68
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,312
Speaker 1: It's like it's not efficient.

69
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:01,380
Speaker 1: What's a whatsoever?

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,282
Speaker 0: Well case in point.

71
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:13,735
Speaker 0: so the price difference between MSRP an actual price right now for the 3090 is Approaching actual MSRP and I thought about buying a 3090 because of that.

72
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,695
Speaker 0: but when I looked at it So Emily's computer has an i9.

73
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:19,388
Speaker 0: It's a super powerful computer.

74
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,760
Speaker 1: The i9 is also sort of you know in that nonsense zone.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,895
Speaker 0: Well, what Emily does is kind of diminishing return it is but for what Emily does?

76
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:35,947
Speaker 1: it actually does make a significant difference like you think I Don't know if there would really be a significant Highest and i7 and an i9.

77
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:44,829
Speaker 0: so an i9 with a The recommendation is the minimum.

78
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:58,399
Speaker 0: PSU is an 850 watt the absolute minimum And a lot of people report significant instability Which I think is because people buy GPS use that say 850 but are a little bit dodgy if you're pushing them that hard.

79
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:03,063
Speaker 1: so Over overheating probably also So.

80
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:08,220
Speaker 0: but also the 30 like generally the 60 is like the normal card for normal gamers.

81
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,834
Speaker 0: The 70 is a weird card.

82
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:16,919
Speaker 0: usually that's faster But maybe like I can't imagine any who actually needs it The 80 is like the sweet spot.

83
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:22,760
Speaker 0: The 80 TI is usually the like the one a professional would get because it's sometimes even as a slower clock.

84
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,309
Speaker 0: But it'll have like more cores or more RAM.

85
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:32,858
Speaker 0: It'll run cooler use less power for performance Gets using less power more less power per performance.

86
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:37,175
Speaker 1: I don't think usually the differences between that's what.

87
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:38,560
Speaker 1: the other thing that surprises me, right?

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,955
Speaker 1: Is it you know, the marketing difference right is like oh, yes this, you know, 30 70 38, right?

89
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,845
Speaker 1: It's like Megato make it time.

90
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:54,027
Speaker 1: I make it too, right but it's like the actual difference between them is So scant, right?

91
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,515
Speaker 1: It's like, you know the 99% of the time, you know.

92
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,691
Speaker 1: Would you ever notice the difference between the 3080 and the 3090?

93
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:04,703
Speaker 1: No, there would be no Perceptible difference.

94
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:05,445
Speaker 1: So mean them.

95
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:20,180
Speaker 0: there are other than if you're making games working in unity working in Maya working in like ZBrush and all these other tools the thing the 3090 has the Two things that has that don't apply to anyone who's playing games.

96
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,565
Speaker 0: These only apply to professionals.

97
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,130
Speaker 0: like a 3090 is worthless for gaming.

98
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:28,427
Speaker 0: even an index VR can run at Absolute max specs on a regular ass 3080.

99
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:35,560
Speaker 0: So the 3090 has double the video RAM and Way more coup de corps.

100
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:37,353
Speaker 1: But would you?

101
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,372
Speaker 1: Used if you're working this out for making how much time?

102
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,760
Speaker 1: how much time is it at real-world time?

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 1: Is it actually saving when you push the render button versus the cheaper the one?

104
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:59,054
Speaker 0: This is like real-time editing and what happens is if you don't have enough RAM like video RAM Then but isn't you know, but is it half as much still enough?

105
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,600
Speaker 1: No, it's absolutely not.

106
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,925
Speaker 0: Like some of these applications.

107
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:04,008
Speaker 0: remember, they're not great.

108
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,814
Speaker 0: Remember how Adobe products used to be like.

109
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 1: then how does it make these applications?

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,565
Speaker 1: What computers did they use to make them?

111
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:10,809
Speaker 1: if they've right?

112
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:14,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the majority of your customers do not have.

113
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,937
Speaker 0: No, they all have cards possible.

114
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:24,400
Speaker 0: It's a big problem in the video game industry last year was that people needed these new cards and literally couldn't get them.

115
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,287
Speaker 1: Well hat that's what I understand.

116
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,334
Speaker 1: It's like if you're making software, right?

117
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:38,267
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, you know You can't make software that at that demands, you know Some rare piece of hardware equipment that none of your customers have.

118
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:44,214
Speaker 1: you have to make your software run on The average hardware that most of your customers are going to be using.

119
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,920
Speaker 0: your customers are professionals.

120
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:49,019
Speaker 1: Then obviously that level is going to be much higher.

121
00:08:49,502 --> 00:09:00,560
Speaker 1: Right, you know, but you can't like be like, oh, you know We know that the 3080 has what 12 gigabytes of Video RAM or something right and the 3090 is 24.

122
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's like a 3080 has to be enough to run your software.

123
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,000
Speaker 1: You can't be writing software.

124
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,881
Speaker 1: That's like actually no you need the 24.

125
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,436
Speaker 1: We're gonna make unique get the 3090 or a software is gonna run poorly.

126
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:13,480
Speaker 0: Well, it depends bad.

127
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:16,771
Speaker 1: That's really bad on the side of the whoever's making the program.

128
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:26,370
Speaker 0: I mean you say that but that's like for example Monitoring software in capital markets takes about four times the performance of the software actually doing the trading.

129
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:28,203
Speaker 1: That's right.

130
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:29,489
Speaker 1: It's poorly written software.

131
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,620
Speaker 0: No, that's that's that the problem is actually more complex.

132
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:39,874
Speaker 0: It's way more work to make the thing than the final like rendered in-game real-time version of it is nobody Obviously, that's true.

133
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:43,508
Speaker 1: But the point is is that you still You know you cut.

134
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:50,740
Speaker 1: you have to consider no matter what software it is You have to consider what the customer is, you know, who's running the software is gonna have yeah, right?

135
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,900
Speaker 1: You can't set your system requirement too high if you want customers.

136
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,460
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is these are happy are pretty reasonable for VR development.

137
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:04,360
Speaker 0: And the only problem is we've had this weird from weird video card crush because of cryptocurrency.

138
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:14,280
Speaker 1: well, there's also the Yeah, but it's just like what I was saying before, you know, these video cards is basically you know, it's like a hot rod.

139
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:22,015
Speaker 0: Some ridiculous car Reviews because you know, I decided against the 3090 for all the reasons we both talked about.

140
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:30,225
Speaker 0: but the best review I saw was this thing is a toaster oven that you put in your computer and turn on and never turn off Right.

141
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,700
Speaker 1: It's like oh you want to make your car faster, right?

142
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:40,520
Speaker 1: It's like well, you know You could cleverly engineer it and come up with better new radical designs that are more efficient and whatnot, right?

143
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,571
Speaker 1: which is the Apple way.

144
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,466
Speaker 1: or Just take the old shitty design.

145
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:48,519
Speaker 1: We've always had and just more power more heat sinks, right?

146
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,525
Speaker 1: Just like Duct-taped something on there, you know put so hands on it Do you know?

147
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,796
Speaker 0: on fighter jets, you know, you hear the term afterburner like.

148
00:10:59,077 --> 00:10:59,819
Speaker 1: that's what that is.

149
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,605
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, do you know how they actually work?

150
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:06,160
Speaker 1: It's even more ridiculous than you just think don't they just ignite the exhaust fumes to me?

151
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,665
Speaker 0: I hope they thrust.

152
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:08,930
Speaker 0: it's even worse than that.

153
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,420
Speaker 0: They basically spray fuel Past the original jet to cause a further set of fire and explosions among the exhaust.

154
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:21,397
Speaker 0: They're spraying fuel and f-16.

155
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:30,250
Speaker 0: I went to Starbase like this program that was obviously in retrospect trying to get kids to join the Air Force and indoctrinate them.

156
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,695
Speaker 0: but an f-16 can run its afterburner for like Seven minutes and then the whole planes out of fuel.

157
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:36,419
Speaker 0: it has to go land.

158
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:40,520
Speaker 1: Well, usually you have in air refueling, right?

159
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,740
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but six or seven minutes of burning that thing because you're literally just spraying fuel out the back.

160
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:49,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what an Nvidia 3080 3090 is.

161
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:59,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but it's like, you know as fast as it is Right and is you know, it's like I don't I'll probably get a new video card, you know, 50 80 something right?

162
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, see 80 something like that.

163
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,528
Speaker 0: So there's a reason.

164
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:04,820
Speaker 0: this 3080 TI is an Emily's computer because she needs it for work.

165
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can play overwatch just fine with my 1080.

166
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:08,683
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna wait.

167
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:09,586
Speaker 0: either 3080 is MSRP or a 4080 comes out.

168
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:17,334
Speaker 0: or honestly I can't upgrade this computer to Windows 11 because it's the.

169
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 0: the CPU is too old.

170
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,720
Speaker 0: So in 2025, I might just build a brand new workstation.

171
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,826
Speaker 1: I mean my.

172
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:31,232
Speaker 1: my 1070 runs both monitors at 4k and any game I've ever played in any Adobe app I've ever used in any program.

173
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,180
Speaker 1: I've ever tried to write.

174
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:35,316
Speaker 1: I've never had any slowness of any kind anywhere.

175
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,372
Speaker 1: The only thing I can do settings or anything with I can't do so with the 1080.

176
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:44,122
Speaker 0: I can't do index VR in full settings I don't do that.

177
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:44,804
Speaker 0: I do.

178
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:50,459
Speaker 0: and also I can't live stream myself doing VR while doing VR.

179
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:59,820
Speaker 1: Well, that's you know, this goes back to my other point I keep making which is like yeah VR is not for the people yet if it requires some kind of ludicrous machine to do it.

180
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,226
Speaker 0: But that's not consumer VR.

181
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,291
Speaker 0: That's the weird edge case.

182
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:06,460
Speaker 0: VR most VR is computerless mmm, anyway.

183
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:13,953
Speaker 0: So in some fantastic news, I haven't actually read the full Court ruling yet because it's recent.

184
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:15,179
Speaker 0: It's actually from today.

185
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,980
Speaker 0: There was a case a while ago that I think we even talked about on geek nights.

186
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,547
Speaker 1: Well, there have been several cases.

187
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:24,440
Speaker 1: I think this is the latest in a short line of them.

188
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,125
Speaker 0: This was the LinkedIn one.

189
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:31,527
Speaker 0: seems to be the one yeah that caused this ruling in the 9th Circuit Court Mm-hmm.

190
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:32,639
Speaker 1: So favorite one.

191
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:39,780
Speaker 0: Yeah The 9th Circuit Court if you're not a US Ian is basically like the one court district in our complicated in Southern, California.

192
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:55,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, that almost always makes the right decision compared to most of the other districts in the US like if there's ever a really good court decision in the US it almost Definitely came through that circuit court For reasons related to how fucked up America is.

193
00:13:55,791 --> 00:14:07,459
Speaker 0: but anyway all these cases but this one in particular Boiled down to one fundamental question Can you take data that is visible on someone else's website and download it?

194
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:20,700
Speaker 0: That's actually what these cases are about Which if it sounds stupid because I'm looking at a web page meaning I have definitely already downloaded this In fact, I'm live streaming the web page that I downloaded to you right now on YouTube.

195
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,008
Speaker 0: So, why would that possibly be illegal.

196
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,039
Speaker 0: well lots of people have tried to make that illegal over the years.

197
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:36,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know because people don't understand Right, like, you know that the two things look different, but they're not actually any different, right?

198
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,650
Speaker 1: It's like oh, you know you view sourced and you hacked our website.

199
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,834
Speaker 1: There was that situation.

200
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, this is web scraping.

201
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:43,686
Speaker 0: What if I?

202
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,880
Speaker 1: so it's like, okay, you let me download a web page.

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,265
Speaker 1: All right, so I make a web page.

204
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,860
Speaker 1: I make a program that just downloads lots of web pages over and over again.

205
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:52,746
Speaker 1: It's like what's?

206
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:53,127
Speaker 1: it's?

207
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,434
Speaker 1: all I'm doing is visiting web pages real fast.

208
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,480
Speaker 1: It's not any different than visiting it in my browser.

209
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:58,847
Speaker 1: It's not doing anything different.

210
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:01,300
Speaker 1: It's just doing it a lot and doing it fast.

211
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:06,559
Speaker 1: It's like is it legal for me to go and go into a store and buy something?

212
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,061
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

213
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:10,755
Speaker 1: Well go into the store and buy something and check out a million times really fast.

214
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,000
Speaker 1: It's like is that illegal?

215
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:13,465
Speaker 1: I guess not.

216
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,533
Speaker 0: Well, that's the old argument with Google Maps.

217
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:18,240
Speaker 0: when they added the street view first It was all right.

218
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,193
Speaker 0: Is it illegal to walk down a sidewalk and look at someone else's house?

219
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,620
Speaker 0: Like just look at it from the sidewalk?

220
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,723
Speaker 0: Absolutely not.

221
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:24,586
Speaker 0: That's perfectly legal.

222
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,296
Speaker 0: Is it legal for me to take a picture of that house?

223
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:28,220
Speaker 0: Perfectly legal.

224
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:32,356
Speaker 0: Is it legal for me to share that picture with other people also legal?

225
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:44,442
Speaker 1: So Google said, all right We'll do that to every single house in America Right now what you just do it computers allow doing things that Individually right are perfectly legal You know.

226
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:48,415
Speaker 1: whether those individual things are should be legal is another question.

227
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,180
Speaker 1: That's not important right now, right?

228
00:15:50,441 --> 00:16:01,680
Speaker 1: And then they allow you to do those things at scale which does Create some sort of meaningful difference on the impact of that, you know a particular activity, right?

229
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:20,801
Speaker 1: you know, but You know, the court shouldn't be shouldn't be saying well doing any legal activity doing a legal activity Many times really fast should not turn it into any legal activity and so therefore web scraping should be legal and it is a Court.

230
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,068
Speaker 0: confirm that and the court basically like.

231
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:28,107
Speaker 0: I'm summarizing and paraphrasing and oversimplifying because we're not lawyers And this is not legal advice.

232
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,435
Speaker 0: You can read these articles.

233
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:30,300
Speaker 0: they link to the rulings.

234
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:39,340
Speaker 0: But what it came down to was the case was around a company mass scraping data out of people's LinkedIn profiles And those are public LinkedIn profiles.

235
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 1: They aren't like, you know accessing so they weren't hacking into LinkedIn or or you know getting secret info.

236
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:51,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we didn't said that's against our terms of service and the court basically said so what?

237
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,531
Speaker 0: Your terms of service are your terms of service.

238
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,099
Speaker 0: You're welcome to block them.

239
00:16:56,742 --> 00:17:00,974
Speaker 0: You're welcome to make that information behind some sort of paywall or gateway.

240
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:10,207
Speaker 0: you're welcome to throttle your website But if it's if you can see it you can scrape it and like, you know Now what they might do with the scraped information?

241
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,213
Speaker 1: right might might cause a problem, right?

242
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:23,240
Speaker 1: So for example, there might be a Website that has I don't know some Sports sports statistics, right?

243
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I pay for access to get those statistics because I'm gonna be doing some sports broadcasting.

244
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:32,340
Speaker 1: No, right, so I pay for the what the Elias Sports Bureau, right?

245
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,860
Speaker 1: I pay for an account there and I I now I paid for this service.

246
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:44,126
Speaker 0: I'm legally allowed to see all this data But you're also legally bound with an asterisk because TOS or their own Can of worms we're not gonna get into.

247
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,620
Speaker 0: you're bound by the terms of service of that contract, right?

248
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:57,560
Speaker 1: So I go and I scrape all the data and now I have it, okay I was legally allowed to see the data with my eyes and access it with my computer cuz I paid for it.

249
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,293
Speaker 1: No problems, but now I go ahead and I open up Scott Sports Bureau.

250
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:02,613
Speaker 1: Okay.

251
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:03,436
Speaker 1: Well now I'm in trouble.

252
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:04,900
Speaker 1: right now that I can't do.

253
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,826
Speaker 0: That is a huge part of my day.

254
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:14,978
Speaker 1: job industry is but I just keep it on my computer or use it for my own Purposes within the license that I'm you know, use it for my broadcast or whatever.

255
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,820
Speaker 0: But you just said use it, you know you license.

256
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:22,540
Speaker 1: Okay, I put it up on Pirate Bay to forever other people to download it.

257
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,323
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm in trouble But that's it.

258
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,558
Speaker 0: you license this data meaning you sign some sort of contract with this company to get the data.

259
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,200
Speaker 0: LinkedIn.

260
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:35,080
Speaker 0: I can go to LinkedIn's website from an incognito browser in a library.

261
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't sign shit.

262
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:43,280
Speaker 1: You could just make up any old LinkedIn account and start browsing around and looking at people's resumes and shit.

263
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,527
Speaker 0: So the this was appealed.

264
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:46,671
Speaker 0: and now the decision.

265
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,256
Speaker 0: this was the second pass at this.

266
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,420
Speaker 0: they went further.

267
00:18:49,801 --> 00:19:04,088
Speaker 0: They live relied on some old Supreme Court thing and they basically said the only time any of this is applicable is if the access to the data was clearly unauthorized and Access by illegal means.

268
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,960
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna quote the article because it says it best quote Using a gate up gate down analogy.

269
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:20,912
Speaker 0: The Supreme Court said that when a computer or websites gates are up and therefore information is publicly accessible No authorization is required period hmm.

270
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:22,957
Speaker 0: And I think that's the exact right call.

271
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:32,700
Speaker 1: as the technologist They got it, right Yeah, meanwhile, they went you know, Aaron shorts killed himself, right because they went after him for trying to download all those journal articles.

272
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:45,759
Speaker 0: You know how many people's lives especially Teenagers in the 90s who accessed government websites and then got like literally the FBI would go after them for Violating laws that were poorly written or didn't even exist.

273
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:54,456
Speaker 0: This is not a new problem and people's lives have been ruined But at least we know for sure scraping websites is perfectly legal.

274
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:57,449
Speaker 1: So scrape on But you know what you do with that.

275
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,936
Speaker 1: scrape data that might.

276
00:19:58,977 --> 00:19:59,680
Speaker 1: that's questionable.

277
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:06,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I scrape location data and use that to make a hitman database and put hits on P there's laws I'm breaking.

278
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:07,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

279
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:09,684
Speaker 0: So, uh and some other news.

280
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:13,214
Speaker 0: a very bad man has tried to buy the very bad company.

281
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,031
Speaker 0: Elon Musk keeps trying to buy Twitter And he seems to have tried to buy it.

282
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,460
Speaker 1: He tried to buy it once then he gave up.

283
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,463
Speaker 0: He seems to have.

284
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:25,668
Speaker 0: it's not clear if he gave up or if he fucked it up so badly that now he can't buy it Because I want to get the.

285
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:31,852
Speaker 1: if you want the full details You're gonna read them online, but he has the vague outline right step one right is.

286
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:34,620
Speaker 1: he was unhappy with Twitter, right?

287
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,473
Speaker 1: You know because he's one of those, you know, lack of doodles.

288
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:39,361
Speaker 0: Well, there's a buried lead there He doesn't.

289
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:42,711
Speaker 1: who hasn't read the XK CD comic about what free speech means?

290
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:43,653
Speaker 0: even worse.

291
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:47,304
Speaker 0: So I found a totally separate article I'm gonna I could use for news today.

292
00:20:47,324 --> 00:21:04,740
Speaker 0: It's too much but it was an analysis of tweets that speak favorably about Tesla vehicles and it found that a huge percentage of all tweets about Tesla vehicles that are positive Come from a very small number of accounts and a large percentage of them appear to be bots.

293
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:11,860
Speaker 1: So but the point is is that he's had a long history of getting in trouble for tweeting things and the SEC getting mad at him.

294
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's also periodically mad about people making fun of him on Twitter.

295
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:20,506
Speaker 1: Well anyway, so You know, he's got enough money.

296
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:24,719
Speaker 1: you could just do whatever he wants, right because that's how this world works right now And it's not good.

297
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,366
Speaker 1: So anyway, he's like in.

298
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:30,380
Speaker 1: the stock price of Twitter is low because it doesn't make any money.

299
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,590
Speaker 1: So he's like, you know what?

300
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,660
Speaker 1: I'll just buy this fucking thing, right?

301
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:43,385
Speaker 1: So he bought a large percentage of it like, you know, so I think he's now the largest single shareholder Although it's like what.

302
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,153
Speaker 1: eight or nine percent something like that.

303
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:46,480
Speaker 1: Yeah some percentage, right?

304
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,822
Speaker 1: I don't know.

305
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:49,479
Speaker 1: Maybe it was six whatever some number but a significant amount.

306
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:53,280
Speaker 1: and Then that number was supposed to get him a board seat, right?

307
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,980
Speaker 1: If you have that much shares in a company you can basically vote yourself into a board seat.

308
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,520
Speaker 0: All right immediately not to get into the nuances of boards, but right it's close enough.

309
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,940
Speaker 1: Yes, so he was gonna get a board seat But then he didn't because there was something about a. you know, there were some rumors swirling.

310
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:14,320
Speaker 0: No, all we know info all we know is he no longer sought the board seat.

311
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:15,944
Speaker 0: No one's game.

312
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,555
Speaker 1: there were some rumors about like a background check or something.

313
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:19,680
Speaker 1: who knows if that's true or not.

314
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,267
Speaker 0: But you know, we know he.

315
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:24,460
Speaker 0: we know he did not submit to the background check that was required by Twitter.

316
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:25,105
Speaker 0: That's all we.

317
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,920
Speaker 1: but anyway, the board seat thing didn't happen.

318
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,630
Speaker 1: So now he went for plan B or C or whatever plan.

319
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,907
Speaker 1: it was plan X. He's like, you know what I'll offer 50 something dollars a share.

320
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:39,100
Speaker 1: right and I'll you know, I'll offer that as a hostile takeover.

321
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,458
Speaker 1: So anyone who wants to sell me your Twitter shares, I'll pay way over what they're actually worth.

322
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,333
Speaker 1: Yeah Which is still Sun on a number he could at least buy.

323
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,059
Speaker 1: his net worth could afford.

324
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:51,624
Speaker 1: Who know?

325
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:52,787
Speaker 0: there's a lot of.

326
00:22:52,847 --> 00:23:03,777
Speaker 0: there are multiple articles talking about how at the time that he made this supposed offer He did not actually have liquid assets arranged to be able to execute it, right?

327
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:11,978
Speaker 1: He would have had to secure financing or sells sell stocks and Tesla or something like that in order to get the money to buy the shares.

328
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:18,560
Speaker 0: if Which you know stating this publicly without having that lined up edge is potentially into malfeasance.

329
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,248
Speaker 1: But I'm sure the SEC is looking into it.

330
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,876
Speaker 0: Oh, the SEC has already issued some statements about all this.

331
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,360
Speaker 0: It's real funny, right?

332
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,328
Speaker 1: So anyway, so he says he's gonna.

333
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:36,420
Speaker 1: so if people had said, you know If the people who already had Twitter shares had said, okay I'll just cash out and take a bunch of money Twitter's going nowhere.

334
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:51,825
Speaker 1: He would have you know ended up owning 51 at least 51% of Twitter and then been Been able to turn it into a private company again and do whatever he wants, but that didn't happen because the board of Twitter Was like, you know what?

335
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:53,009
Speaker 1: We don't want that to happen.

336
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,820
Speaker 1: We don't like you even though you're our largest single shareholder.

337
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,888
Speaker 1: We're gonna do some shenanigans.

338
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,996
Speaker 0: They put a poison pill.

339
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:01,980
Speaker 0: my favorite thing.

340
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:08,899
Speaker 1: It's right.

341
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:15,404
Speaker 1: The bylaws of Twitter itself, right because they're the board they vote on those things like Common example.

342
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,675
Speaker 0: say I had a little company and I was gonna.

343
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:18,840
Speaker 0: I might sell it to someone.

344
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:31,140
Speaker 0: We might in our incorporating documents or bylaws or whatever make a rule that says if the company is sold Then anyone who works at the company as of the date of the sale cannot be fired for 10 years.

345
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:35,419
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's an example a fast I'll example of a poison pill.

346
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:53,039
Speaker 1: Right, so I believe I'm not a hundred percent sure what this one says but it says something along the lines of if this dude tries to come and buy us then Everyone who's already got shares can buy up a bunch of shares right in advance to sort of block him

347
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,240
Speaker 0: out.

348
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,608
Speaker 0: Okay, so I found Matt Levine tweeted Twitter's poison pill is I'm quoting?

349
00:24:58,628 --> 00:24:59,632
Speaker 0: I haven't even read this yet.

350
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:11,939
Speaker 0: an exercise price of $210 allowing each shareholder to pay $210 to acquire stock having a then current market value of twice the exercise of god damn it.

351
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:14,280
Speaker 0: This is complicated.

352
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:22,434
Speaker 0: They basically made it to where if he tries to buy them out the people who are already on the board and existing shareholders can Unbuy it out.

353
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,948
Speaker 1: Yeah They could just acquire a bunch of share.

354
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:27,631
Speaker 0: the more I'm reading.

355
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:28,174
Speaker 0: It's market.

356
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:29,038
Speaker 0: It's too complicated.

357
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:30,848
Speaker 0: to summarize I got to read a deeper article.

358
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:31,914
Speaker 1: they can block him out face.

359
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:32,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all you need to know.

360
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,407
Speaker 0: He could get around this possibly but with more money.

361
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:42,766
Speaker 1: right with more money You know anyway, so he's not being able to buy Twitter.

362
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:43,673
Speaker 1: Twitter is still yep.

363
00:25:44,700 --> 00:26:02,410
Speaker 0: To the two Twitter's boards credit because Twitter has made a series of terrible decisions over the years, but at the same time Letting this particular human being own Twitter and direct it and make it private Would possibly be the worst possible outcome.

364
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,856
Speaker 1: anyway, I mean it would just be a tumbler situation.

365
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,518
Speaker 1: It would just die.

366
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:05,979
Speaker 0: yep.

367
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:12,340
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the final news is that Jack the previous Twitter CEO who's not there anymore?

368
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:15,140
Speaker 1: I think he's on the board, but might leave the board soon or something.

369
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,348
Speaker 1: I don't know what his deal is now?

370
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,495
Speaker 1: who cares about that jerk?

371
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:25,291
Speaker 1: any yeah But he was like yeah, you know the the Twitter board is dysfunctional something something right.

372
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:39,460
Speaker 1: so he you know and Basically his complaint which is somewhat valid Depending on your perspective right from the perspective of someone who is you know got a capitalist motivation?

373
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:48,960
Speaker 1: It's like well if you own Twitter shares that aren't worth very much You want to accept that offer and cash out for 50 something bucks a share, and you'll make a ton of money.

374
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's you know.

375
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:57,042
Speaker 1: the fact that the board turned that down is like not in the interest of purely capitalist Shareholders.

376
00:26:57,123 --> 00:27:01,177
Speaker 1: and his criticism was that hey those board members of Twitter act.

377
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,440
Speaker 1: They don't actually own that many shares themselves.

378
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:05,884
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

379
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:14,030
Speaker 0: There's a screenshot here where someone showed that the top 12 like owners of stock Whoa go.

380
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:14,860
Speaker 0: there's a great quote here.

381
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:26,780
Speaker 0: I'm not sure he's prepared to take on a couple PhDs a few MBAs and a Baroness who use Twitter once a year and collectively own 77 shares of the company.

382
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,106
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean the board.

383
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,560
Speaker 1: the people who do own the shares voted those people onto the board.

384
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but those people on the board don't own that many shares themselves.

385
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:38,005
Speaker 1: So they don't give a crap.

386
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,049
Speaker 1: if it's you know what the.

387
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,639
Speaker 1: if you know then turning that down doesn't hurt them.

388
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,318
Speaker 1: No, right very much at all.

389
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:58,720
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a good thing in one way for Twitter to have people in charge of it who don't have a capitalist interest But it's also not a good well because they they are ultimately beholden to the fiduciary duty to the actual shareholders.

390
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:05,119
Speaker 1: right But it's also not a good thing because technically they're supposed to be capitalist or whatever, right?

391
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,573
Speaker 1: Theoretically, but anyway, so that's what happened there.

392
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:09,819
Speaker 1: I you know.

393
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,117
Speaker 1: Personally, you know, I'm just using Twitter less and less all the time.

394
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:19,840
Speaker 0: It's funny I actually use Twitter a lot and there's a but it's there's specific people.

395
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:25,620
Speaker 0: I talked to a lot on Twitter because I just don't have any other good way to talk to those specific people.

396
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:33,470
Speaker 1: but I mean if I like you I really need to talk to someone and if I were to stop using Twitter all together and I really needed to talk to someone who was only on Twitter.

397
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,257
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could talk to them.

398
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:35,860
Speaker 1: No problem.

399
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:42,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, no It's more than I have like semi public conversations with this like group of people on Twitter who really don't have a good forum To do that.

400
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:45,072
Speaker 0: Otherwise, but like you made some blur died.

401
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:47,380
Speaker 1: those people went somewhere, you know myspace died.

402
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,427
Speaker 1: Those people went somewhere.

403
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:49,132
Speaker 1: Facebook dies.

404
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:50,200
Speaker 1: people went somewhere, right?

405
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,759
Speaker 0: It's like there isn't really anywhere for that kind of conversation though cuz Mastodon sucks.

406
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:56,852
Speaker 1: I mean this play though something will arise.

407
00:28:57,013 --> 00:28:58,600
Speaker 1: people will go somewhere, right?

408
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,205
Speaker 1: but really I'm not gonna.

409
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:08,365
Speaker 0: my main use of Twitter anything dies is as a publishing mechanism and That as long as the audience is there I will continue to publish stuff to Twitter.

410
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,048
Speaker 0: pretty much as much audience.

411
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:23,400
Speaker 0: They're Right, it's like, you know, I mean my biggest my biggest platform is one lips in and to YouTube.

412
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:27,645
Speaker 1: But yeah So that's that.

413
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:29,598
Speaker 1: that's a full drama that played out there.

414
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,592
Speaker 1: You know, I'm more and more.

415
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:39,200
Speaker 1: I just see myself, you know Retreating from the like the public, you know social networking places.

416
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:47,725
Speaker 0: Oh The semi-private curated places are the place to be and always have been the private g-chats the discords the geek nights Forum could see a renaissance.

417
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:55,894
Speaker 1: I don't know maybe but I'm just using those places as Sort of, you know a broad like you said a broadcast mechanism, right?

418
00:29:55,914 --> 00:30:05,899
Speaker 1: Like I uploaded a YouTube video Okay, I guess I'll tweet about it and post about it here and post about it there So that you know, cuz other people I'm not here to decide what you know.

419
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,960
Speaker 1: What other people should use is their platform of choice, right?

420
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,396
Speaker 1: People have their reasons for staying on Facebook or using Instagram or whatever.

421
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,799
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay I'll meet you where you are.

422
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:22,652
Speaker 1: If I want to share something I made or thought so badly Right, then I should go to where you are to tell you about.

423
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:22,832
Speaker 1: Yep.

424
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:25,620
Speaker 0: My philosophy is put it put my stuff everywhere.

425
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:29,567
Speaker 0: That's why I get All these platforms.

426
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:35,280
Speaker 1: as long as they exist I'll go to them and I'll post on them, you know to announce whatever.

427
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:43,200
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know in terms of having a conversation or communications or oh I don't have conversations on Twitter other than with my friends.

428
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:47,106
Speaker 0: Like I post something and if people want to discuss it I tend to just block all.

429
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:52,132
Speaker 1: I don't need to use any of those sites for that You know, even though I might from time to time right?

430
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:52,433
Speaker 1: It's like.

431
00:30:52,514 --> 00:31:00,540
Speaker 1: I'll just bring all that stuff You know back to whatever right even if I have to go back to IRC or who knows dark dark recess over the internet.

432
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,700
Speaker 0: I have to go if I want to see people talking about my work.

433
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,920
Speaker 0: They're coming to my own forum my own discord and I'm not really looking anywhere else.

434
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:11,979
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know, but even if discord goes away it's like I'm okay with that.

435
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,123
Speaker 1: So we don't.

436
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:22,657
Speaker 1: I'm not too upset when I see when I see stories about the collapse of a website, you know platform sites Yeah, I guess what I find interesting is that the world might be better if they all died.

437
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:34,960
Speaker 0: Twitter unlike all other social media platforms it happens to do a fairly unique thing and everyone who's tried to make a clone of it or Take its ideas and do something similar have failed.

438
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,860
Speaker 0: And I think it's mostly because of the critical mass of people who are on Twitter.

439
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,836
Speaker 0: Facebook had a long hemorrhaging of people but Twitter seems to Maintain its audience in a way that other platforms haven't.

440
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:51,260
Speaker 1: because well I don't Twitter doesn't have the largest audience in terms of number of people who are like active all the time.

441
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:57,877
Speaker 1: But I think what keeps Twitter specifically afloat is its connection to news and journalism.

442
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:01,112
Speaker 0: a lot of people Without right using.

443
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:02,665
Speaker 0: like my mom She's like.

444
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:08,358
Speaker 0: she follows me on Twitter only Recently as she started like really like engaging with people on Twitter for most of the time.

445
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:08,900
Speaker 0: She's on Twitter.

446
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,888
Speaker 0: She just read it like a new site.

447
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:16,347
Speaker 1: It's not right, but it's not just reading it as a news site But also you go to right.

448
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,333
Speaker 1: it's like, you know a news site.

449
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:23,069
Speaker 1: like you watch a TV news We'll report on so and so tweeted this.

450
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that right will be but you don't see news.

451
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,166
Speaker 1: So-and-so Facebook posted that.

452
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:28,607
Speaker 1: why cuz?

453
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:31,577
Speaker 1: Facebook posts aren't some public linkable thing exactly?

454
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:34,738
Speaker 1: so You know, that's how that works.

455
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, journalists also go on Twitter and find out the news the same way that we will and then report on it.

456
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,063
Speaker 0: You know as secondary I can say one interesting fact this for the first time ever Twitter.

457
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:48,828
Speaker 0: like when the Ukraine war actually happened.

458
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:53,962
Speaker 0: like when it actually started Twitter told me it was happening before Fark did.

459
00:32:53,983 --> 00:33:00,564
Speaker 0: I have never had Fark not be the first way I found out about fucking anything in my life before Twitter's that Twitter's.

460
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,170
Speaker 1: you've been the fastest for a long time.

461
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,228
Speaker 0: Yep, though Fark had way more Information than Twitter way faster.

462
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,480
Speaker 1: Well, you got a. you know, it's harder to put the information together on Twitter.

463
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,206
Speaker 1: It is far more organized.

464
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,752
Speaker 0: Yep, Fark still hanging on.

465
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,715
Speaker 0: I still pay for Fark.

466
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:16,040
Speaker 0: Fark's gonna someday.

467
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,576
Speaker 0: I think I paid for Fark for a long time.

468
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:19,199
Speaker 0: Fark's great.

469
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:27,615
Speaker 0: So anyway Things of the day.

470
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:32,522
Speaker 0: so check this out Really tiny little thing.

471
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,656
Speaker 0: Uh This is there's.

472
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,621
Speaker 0: this is almost environmental storytelling.

473
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:40,590
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is just a tweet that was making the rounds.

474
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:42,578
Speaker 0: See my thing of the day.

475
00:33:42,678 --> 00:33:43,100
Speaker 0: I'll tweet.

476
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,610
Speaker 0: This is how deeply infested we are with Twitter.

477
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:54,655
Speaker 0: but this tweet was an image and all it said was New at the local game shop from a verified account.

478
00:33:55,436 --> 00:34:00,514
Speaker 0: a lot of people retweeting it lots of conversations Multiple reddit threads about this image.

479
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:10,909
Speaker 0: The image was an opened and defaced Copy of a Super Nintendo game called demons crest which not rare like don't is not a rare game.

480
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:20,190
Speaker 0: And the two notable things about it were one it has Written badly on it in marker and I'm just gonna read what is written on this cartridge.

481
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:21,716
Speaker 0: Fucking mine.

482
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:29,630
Speaker 0: You can only fucking borrow this game and It has a price tag of a thousand US dollars.

483
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:41,663
Speaker 0: So I saw a scary number of people freaking out like there's no way that games worth a thousand dollars and others Trying to rationalize it like but what if this was a rental only copy?

484
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,730
Speaker 0: because there's a third long story short.

485
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:46,370
Speaker 0: Nobody knows who wrote that text on it.

486
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:55,938
Speaker 0: It was probably kid some kid who lent this game to a friend and made it clear that it's fucking his and he's gonna get It back because he's exactly 13 years old.

487
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,652
Speaker 0: He owns a game called demons crest and he's an edge Lord The gate.

488
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,557
Speaker 0: the story is the game.

489
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:10,618
Speaker 0: store owner thought this was really funny and just put this thousand dollar price tag on it Just for a joke and took a picture of it.

490
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,819
Speaker 0: and that picture is online and everyone's freaking out about this and all these Conversations about it.

491
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:17,089
Speaker 0: It's just a joke guys.

492
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:22,010
Speaker 1: And in fact, if you don't give the context then people start, you know thinking, you know.

493
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,940
Speaker 1: try to imagine things except the context was trivial.

494
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:29,016
Speaker 0: discover by clicking on the tweet and Scrolling down in the people.

495
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:29,559
Speaker 0: don't do that.

496
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,829
Speaker 0: The guy who posted it was like FYI.

497
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,447
Speaker 0: Here's the entire story and somehow everybody missed it and there's even people don't do that.

498
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 1: Did you see the picture?

499
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many and how many people copied that picture and pasted it somewhere else without you know?

500
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:50,627
Speaker 1: Even if people set posted a bedded a link to the tweet that doesn't include the whole thread It just includes the tweet itself, you know.

501
00:35:51,411 --> 00:36:05,196
Speaker 0: so if there's probably some kid out there who has a ti-85 calculator where the name rim and I don't remember what I believe I wrote like property of rim and some other stuff with a knife on the back of it And I'm sure

502
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:06,570
Speaker 1: sure that's probably in a landfill.

503
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:11,763
Speaker 0: The fives are pretty good if you replace the batteries anyway, what do you got?

504
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:16,162
Speaker 1: so another social platform right.

505
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:23,110
Speaker 1: read it for the April bullshit day Which was you know a couple weeks ago, they do this thing.

506
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,600
Speaker 1: They've been doing it for a while now called our place Which is basically the way it works.

507
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:38,470
Speaker 1: is they open up a big white canvas And if you have a reddit account You can go to that big white canvas and you can select one pixel and change the color of that pixel.

508
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:46,941
Speaker 1: And I think there's like maybe 16 color 32 not that many colors to choose from very small number of colors to choose from But it's you know, a full Crayola set right?

509
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:48,790
Speaker 1: You're not you're not gonna be like, oh no, there's no red.

510
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:49,861
Speaker 1: It's like they got red.

511
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:58,554
Speaker 1: It's like come on And you set a pixel and then you think you have to wait five or ten minutes and then you can set another Pixel.

512
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:10,930
Speaker 1: or you can get multiple reddit accounts and start doing lots of pixels Or you can get a large subreddit of coordinated people to do a lot of pixels And of course you can overwrite other people's pixels, right?

513
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,710
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I could put down a black and rim can just be like come right on top and turn it white again.

514
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,790
Speaker 0: It's like why you've got to have some amount of community power to do anything interesting here.

515
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:25,430
Speaker 1: Well read it happens to be a social network built around communities, right all these different subreddits.

516
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:28,361
Speaker 1: So you get all the people of your subreddit together.

517
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:33,309
Speaker 1: now, it doesn't just matter how many people are in your subreddit It matters how many of them give a shit?

518
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,627
Speaker 1: How many of them have time for this?

519
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,614
Speaker 1: Right how many of them care?

520
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:40,423
Speaker 1: and you can go and onto this big canvas.

521
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:42,370
Speaker 1: you can draw things and sort of claim.

522
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:54,990
Speaker 1: So it's sort of a game of claiming territory via social influence, but also you know, it's a Artwork thing right where you know, what do we draw?

523
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,993
Speaker 1: Where do we draw it?

524
00:37:56,033 --> 00:38:01,050
Speaker 1: trying to integrate with the things that are drawing nearby right lots of integration going on?

525
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:21,510
Speaker 1: You know, there's just so many dynamics and at the end right when they when they turn it off the end result is Usually I don't want to say picture of the internet But it's basically a picture of the communities of reddit and like, you know You can see like that year at that exact moment, you know, what was big what was not so big, right?

526
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:28,410
Speaker 0: Fascinating to dig through this especially because there's a lot of one-off pixels that are the wrong color because it's a battle.

527
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm very pleased that you know, fuck cars got a really big spot.

528
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:36,350
Speaker 1: So that Kennedy the anti car movement is growing.

529
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:47,369
Speaker 1: You can see that like lots of country flags are large right because you know, like Turkey's got a pretty large right, you know You know, he's really did a lot of this.

530
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:51,750
Speaker 0: There's like multiple whole areas that were done by Turkish reddit.

531
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,579
Speaker 0: Yep, there's a picture of out of Turk.

532
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,210
Speaker 1: There's a giant Turkish flag the out of Turk at the top.

533
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's also the Turkish flag with the Istanbul cityscape.

534
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,170
Speaker 1: Yep, you got there's all kinds of stuff on here and you know, this is only the end picture.

535
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:10,853
Speaker 1: But the website that's actually my thing of the day is the reddit place atlas for 2022.

536
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:12,930
Speaker 1: And what this is is they took the final image.

537
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:29,871
Speaker 1: You see you don't get to see the evolution of it which is sad but They have sort of gone over the image and carved out Every single different piece of it and sort of given you a label so you can understand what everything is Like.

538
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,368
Speaker 1: it's like you see some guy's face and you're like what the hell is that and you hold your mouse over it.

539
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:38,121
Speaker 0: and it's like Oh, oh, it's about show a Turkish rock musician.

540
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:40,910
Speaker 1: It's a total biscuit tribute that guy who died.

541
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,838
Speaker 1: Here's a whole bunch of paragraphs about him.

542
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:43,260
Speaker 1: I forgot.

543
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,425
Speaker 1: Oh, what's this over here?

544
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:45,690
Speaker 1: Oh, it's kpop alley.

545
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,749
Speaker 1: These are all these different kpop groups that all put their shit near each other.

546
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:55,150
Speaker 0: Battle of the heroes a mural depicting the duel between obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, right?

547
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,361
Speaker 1: Here's a Star Wars poster and then even within the Star Wars poster.

548
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,786
Speaker 1: They're like, this is the Death Star.

549
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:14,086
Speaker 1: This is yeah Yeah, so you can learn a lot about the culture of you know, the people of the internet of you know 2022 and Reddit by going over this image and hovering over things and being like what the hell is.

550
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:15,628
Speaker 1: you know, you know What is that?

551
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:24,110
Speaker 1: Why would enough people get together to fight for space to draw that image there and then defend it to the very end, right?

552
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,708
Speaker 1: Why would they care enough to do that?

553
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:38,489
Speaker 1: You know if there were that many people who put that effort forth whatever that image is Must have some significance to enough people on this earth that maybe it's worth knowing what the image is and what it stands for.

554
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:46,235
Speaker 0: So yeah from crosscode the main protagonist of the action role-playing game crosscode released in 2018 From Austria.

555
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:51,097
Speaker 0: The other thing that I think is really striking about it is how extremely non?

556
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:51,419
Speaker 0: u.s.

557
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:52,688
Speaker 0: Centric it is.

558
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:59,885
Speaker 1: Yeah You know those Pete, you know people from those countries have a lot more pride, right?

559
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:06,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know they you know I mean, there's a lot of other and I would not be putting a very super pro-american thing on this thing.

560
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,961
Speaker 1: American flags in the bottom right?

561
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,188
Speaker 1: That's what the pro-america stuff.

562
00:41:10,228 --> 00:41:18,634
Speaker 1: Yeah But you know for example, right, you know a good example of how like the numbers don't line up right the the Vancouver Canucks right.

563
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:24,889
Speaker 1: their logo is somewhere on here and it's actually pretty significantly large and fancy.

564
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:33,710
Speaker 1: and You know somehow the people of Vancouver like they had that thing in there early and they held it like for a long time.

565
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,310
Speaker 1: It's a pretty sure it's in the final image, right?

566
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,397
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the Rangers right?

567
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,601
Speaker 1: We have way more fans.

568
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,930
Speaker 1: Our subreddit is way bigger, right?

569
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,115
Speaker 0: And the workers would have time for that shit.

570
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,721
Speaker 1: I'm like exactly the best.

571
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:49,814
Speaker 1: the best the best we could do is Right, we could.

572
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:58,710
Speaker 1: we tagged along the Colorado Avalanche put like a whole, you know Pretty fancy looking full logo there and we have like a sad looking like Hank.

573
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:08,149
Speaker 1: It says Hank 30 like a blurry like we had to like team up with them to get some space Because so few Rangers fans gave a shit.

574
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:10,334
Speaker 1: Better things to do.

575
00:42:10,475 --> 00:42:14,045
Speaker 0: this is this is not a representation of the biggest internet communities.

576
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,555
Speaker 0: It's the most online Internet communities.

577
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:21,490
Speaker 1: Well the most caring about this particular thing on reddit.

578
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:26,650
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's it's still really fascinating to browse through it and look around it and see what you know, five things.

579
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:31,835
Speaker 1: See things you recognize don't recognize learn about stuff You know, maybe and a lot.

580
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:35,227
Speaker 1: the really useful thing is like you'll see some image and you're like.

581
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:37,476
Speaker 1: I've seen that around I've seen that but what is it?

582
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:41,337
Speaker 1: you hover over it now, you know what it is, you know quack And that's nice.

583
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:43,213
Speaker 0: Oh Is that marks?

584
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:43,798
Speaker 0: is that marks?

585
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:44,160
Speaker 0: Okay.

586
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,087
Speaker 0: Yes, it's Carl Marx.

587
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:51,248
Speaker 0: Good job Okay Anyway in the matter moment the geek nights book club book was NK jemisins the city we became.

588
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:52,475
Speaker 0: we read it We did a show on it.

589
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:53,843
Speaker 0: That book is fantastic.

590
00:42:54,125 --> 00:43:03,030
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read the sequel Basically instantly when it comes out But it won't be a book kind of like how I read the entire wheel of time.

591
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:07,359
Speaker 1: The next book club selection.

592
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:15,706
Speaker 1: the current book club selection is listener choice Nine Fox gambit not ten boxes not eight, but nine nine foxes.

593
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:21,001
Speaker 1: So Listener got their way there where we rims gonna.

594
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:27,184
Speaker 1: I already read the book rims gonna read the book the listener Some point and then we'll do an episode a few months probably.

595
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll give you time to read it.

596
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,194
Speaker 0: I feel like I'll read.

597
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:30,683
Speaker 1: hopefully I don't forget it all.

598
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:37,170
Speaker 0: there is a chance We will record the episode earlier like as soon as I finish it, but not a bad idea.

599
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,884
Speaker 0: But we'll make sure we don't like the.

600
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:39,610
Speaker 0: it's not official.

601
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,876
Speaker 0: We're not gonna put it in this in the.

602
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,965
Speaker 0: we might livestream it if we do that But we won't like put it in the feed until you've had enough time to read it So you can still actually follow along.

603
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:49,669
Speaker 0: it is a book club.

604
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:54,389
Speaker 0: Not everyone reads entire books over the course of like a week like we do Yep.

605
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:56,889
Speaker 0: So I yeah, it's got right into it.

606
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:08,302
Speaker 0: There was a tweet that caused us to think of this idea and the tweet was a an image Posted by YouTube gaming and it said in which era of video cables.

607
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:11,210
Speaker 0: Did you start your gaming journey and anyone?

608
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,670
Speaker 0: Who is older than like being a tiny child?

609
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:24,800
Speaker 0: immediately took issue with the fact that It did not cover most of the cables that were used for gaming over the years And it didn't even have the cables.

610
00:44:24,841 --> 00:44:25,970
Speaker 0: that is showed in the right order.

611
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:27,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we've done.

612
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:40,358
Speaker 1: we've done shows on like monitors and other things of that nature, but we never did a show I think on video cables specifically and video cables are interesting in that There's sort of this unique kind of cable right.

613
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:42,784
Speaker 1: most other cables like power cables.

614
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:44,870
Speaker 1: It's like they send power.

615
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:47,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, there are some differences.

616
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,236
Speaker 0: I mean, you know some that I I work with.

617
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:53,090
Speaker 0: I used to work with I don't anymore with DC driven data centers.

618
00:44:53,211 --> 00:44:59,983
Speaker 0: so our power cables were Giant bars of exposed metal behind glass plates.

619
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:00,826
Speaker 0: do not touch them.

620
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,290
Speaker 1: That's a power cable?

621
00:45:03,174 --> 00:45:03,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

622
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,149
Speaker 1: You've also got data cables which send Data, right?

623
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,290
Speaker 1: But video cables, right?

624
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:19,596
Speaker 1: Are sending a specific kind of data and they under very specific circumstances right that you have.

625
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:47,769
Speaker 1: you're sending data that will represent an image that will be displayed on some sort of monitor of some kind some display device projector or something right and You need to send not only how many different colors the device can display but also You know enough data so that it can render all the frames that it's going to be sending and Consistently so that the frames are displaying, you know at even intervals, right?

626
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:56,556
Speaker 1: So there's like a video cable is like a unique thing in the world of cables and that it has completely different requirements from all others.

627
00:45:57,077 --> 00:46:14,319
Speaker 1: and on top of that over the years the Devices on both ends of a video cable have changed Significantly in how they work and thus the video cables have had to change significantly to meet the requirements on both ends.

628
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:25,370
Speaker 0: and also about the most fascinating part the Signaling over these cables was analog analog for a long time.

629
00:46:25,794 --> 00:46:37,410
Speaker 0: digital video over cables for anything other than extremely niche or like professional use cases was Practically non-existent until and now.

630
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:55,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it seems like a good time to talk about video cables now because what we're seeing in the present time is USBC becoming at least that the physical structure of USBC Regardless of what's going over the cable might be DisplayPort or Thunderbolt or whatever, right?

631
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,553
Speaker 0: It's the cable to rule them all.

632
00:46:56,613 --> 00:47:01,326
Speaker 1: it's the cable that is now replacing all other cables including video cables.

633
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:05,509
Speaker 1: I think in within Definitely within five to ten years for sure.

634
00:47:05,972 --> 00:47:19,440
Speaker 1: I think just everything that's going to connect to anything else with any kind of data whether it's video data or otherwise is going to be that shape of cable and Any other kind of cable is going to be slowly made obsolete.

635
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,529
Speaker 0: I mean networking will remain like that's not going to change.

636
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:29,490
Speaker 1: Right now I could see a world in which well, first of all people are mostly networking wirelessly, right?

637
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know then in the in the data center at the office probably still gonna be Ethernet, right?

638
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because USBC has a very short range remember.

639
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:47,315
Speaker 1: Yes, but I could see a world in which you get a router from Your ISP right in 2020.

640
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:48,393
Speaker 0: Oh We've already had that.

641
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:55,017
Speaker 0: my my router at the right beacon had a USB port on it and you could plug a computer Directly into that.

642
00:47:55,077 --> 00:48:04,343
Speaker 1: No, I thought those USB C ports that are on those That was regularized USB right goes were for plugging in Storage devices that would then become networks.

643
00:48:04,404 --> 00:48:07,959
Speaker 0: there were routers You could directly plug a computer into.

644
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:10,610
Speaker 1: I've there may have been but I've never seen that in my life.

645
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,215
Speaker 0: I've seen them I've used them.

646
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:16,769
Speaker 0: They were slow as shit because USB direct networking sucked shit.

647
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:30,666
Speaker 1: Well, but the point is I could very well see ISPs soon putting giving people routers in their homes that have Wi-Fi and Like a single USB C connection if you really want to connect your device,

648
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:40,010
Speaker 0: I won't - my rationale is Anyone who thinks about that is the kind of person who would never use a wired connection anyway.

649
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:44,710
Speaker 1: Well, because I think what you're getting right someone has like a MacBook Pro, right?

650
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,440
Speaker 1: It's like why should they go out and buy some USB C to use?

651
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,143
Speaker 0: the router is almost definitely not gonna be where their Mac Book is and you can't make a long USB C cable.

652
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:53,148
Speaker 1: You don't know.

653
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,280
Speaker 1: You can make something that you absolutely cannot.

654
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,650
Speaker 1: this I could very I I could see very much.

655
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,219
Speaker 1: No, not too distant future.

656
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,910
Speaker 1: No more Ethernet in people's houses.

657
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,663
Speaker 1: So yes, but I think it's replaced except for nerds who have it on purpose.

658
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:09,570
Speaker 0: I think it's replaced by all wireless.

659
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:11,176
Speaker 1: I think there would.

660
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,450
Speaker 1: you know, there might be replaced by all wireless.

661
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,020
Speaker 1: But if it's not I think there might be a USB C on the.

662
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:23,370
Speaker 1: I don't think so because nothing in the USB C Physical you're also gonna see like a cable box that has USB C to go to the television.

663
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:24,133
Speaker 0: You'll see that.

664
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,037
Speaker 0: you'll see that easily.

665
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,303
Speaker 1: It's all the same, right?

666
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:29,134
Speaker 0: You'll just get now, but it's your range There is.

667
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:32,865
Speaker 0: you have you ever read the specs for a physical USB C cable.

668
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:34,390
Speaker 0: There is no provision for long.

669
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,139
Speaker 1: I got one really long one and it does work really long.

670
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:38,965
Speaker 0: How long Ethernet can go a kilometer.

671
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:40,370
Speaker 1: It's not that long.

672
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't need it to go a kilometer though.

673
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:43,710
Speaker 1: It's not across the living room.

674
00:49:43,850 --> 00:50:01,270
Speaker 0: One thing I've seen is a lot of people and this gets back to that YouTube tweet because knowledge of old cables is lost Coaxial RF cables The same cables used for old TV signaling were used for cable modems and to this day are used even my FiOS.

675
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:11,465
Speaker 0: It's FiOS into my front like the front of the apartment and then there's a device there that has coax that goes through the apartment into the computer room where the router is.

676
00:50:11,485 --> 00:50:21,490
Speaker 0: a Lot of people don't know that those cables are dirt cheap Trivial to run and they pay a lot of money to get Verizon or something to run that cable for them through their own house.

677
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,505
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the the oldest video cable will go back to the beginning because you guys do it.

678
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:31,890
Speaker 0: That would be proprietary Soldered or twisted on RF cables because right?

679
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,087
Speaker 0: So was transferred from any device like early gaming devices.

680
00:50:37,227 --> 00:50:47,950
Speaker 0: early everything they had to connect to existing TVs and existing TVs were designed to be connected directly to a 300 ohm RF antenna connection.

681
00:50:48,713 --> 00:51:01,970
Speaker 1: exactly so you had this antenna on your roof and it was picking up signals from the air from some broadcast antenna wirelessly and then Just like a radio that signal went into your television and that was the only input the television had.

682
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:07,510
Speaker 1: So what you would end up having to do to send some other thing into your television?

683
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:09,740
Speaker 1: That wasn't from an antenna.

684
00:51:10,243 --> 00:51:10,323
Speaker 1: is?

685
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:17,690
Speaker 1: you would basically have to Broadcast television right only instead of broadcasting it on an antenna, right?

686
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:24,293
Speaker 1: so the whole world you would broadcast it over a wire and Which I want to point out TV That is all.

687
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:28,990
Speaker 0: cable TV is the signals going over like cable TV when it first was introduced.

688
00:51:29,472 --> 00:51:32,749
Speaker 0: Same signals that are going over the air just on a cable instead of in the air.

689
00:51:33,572 --> 00:51:35,379
Speaker 1: Yep, just the exact same broadcast.

690
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:37,266
Speaker 1: You could take like a VCR, right?

691
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:38,290
Speaker 1: So what is a VCR?

692
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:45,810
Speaker 1: It's a magnetic tape and on the tape they've recorded the RF signal and you play it back again just as it was.

693
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:51,370
Speaker 1: It's not converting it to other it's just writing it down and playing the signal back again.

694
00:51:51,470 --> 00:52:01,450
Speaker 0: Well, even worse consent tape records FM, you know It's encoded in this complicated spiral slant way because you don't there isn't enough bandwidth on a VCR tape a VHS tape.

695
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,610
Speaker 0: But

696
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:18,130
Speaker 1: regardless you could if you could take a VCR with the VHS tape Right, and if you had a big enough antenna and a big enough amplifier You could broadcast directly over the air and some old TV with an antenna could then watch what the videotape you were playing.

697
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:19,888
Speaker 1: Alright, that would totally work.

698
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:26,910
Speaker 1: So an old Atari or an old Nintendo right would just create TV signals.

699
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:33,310
Speaker 1: You could hook up an NES or an Atari 2600 to a giant antenna and the whole world to be watching combat.

700
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:46,350
Speaker 1: Pat man, right you could do it and then you would connect it to the back of the TV where the antenna goes and Usually it was in the form of these two prongs because the antenna is always connected with these little forks.

701
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,967
Speaker 1: Right, you would put the screw in the middle of the forks, right?

702
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,250
Speaker 0: So yeah.

703
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:55,470
Speaker 0: So the funny thing is I needed a picture of that and I discovered something terrifying.

704
00:52:56,231 --> 00:53:00,023
Speaker 0: By and large the internet doesn't even know that the twin lead RF existed.

705
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:02,290
Speaker 0: I found and I googled for it.

706
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:03,418
Speaker 1: That's how old we are.

707
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:12,090
Speaker 0: Nobody knows what it's called and I found mostly people posting questions asking what the fuck are these two?

708
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,539
Speaker 0: Screw things in the back of this old TV.

709
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,462
Speaker 0: What do they do?

710
00:53:15,743 --> 00:53:16,466
Speaker 0: What's this called?

711
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,530
Speaker 0: What can I plug into it?

712
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:28,224
Speaker 0: Nobody knows but it's twin lead RF or 300 ohm RF designed to be plugged in directly to an antenna The coax cables that come out of cable boxes or cable TV.

713
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:33,386
Speaker 1: that is RF But it's exactly the same as the two forks only it's 75 ohm.

714
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,056
Speaker 0: There's multiple differences.

715
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:41,059
Speaker 0: You actually have to convert that signal if you want to plug it into a TV That does not have a coaxial input.

716
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:42,185
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

717
00:53:42,205 --> 00:53:47,076
Speaker 1: It came way later Yep But yeah So the had that.

718
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:53,429
Speaker 1: and then what you would have to do with those that was a lot of fun back in the day is It's like well, I want to plug my Atari into my TV.

719
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:57,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I also want to plug the TV into the antenna.

720
00:53:57,424 --> 00:53:59,190
Speaker 1: still I still want to watch TV sometimes.

721
00:53:59,752 --> 00:54:04,470
Speaker 1: So you would have an RF switch and you would go behind your TV and flick the switch.

722
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:16,042
Speaker 1: yeah, so and you would plug the antenna into the switch and the Atari into the switch and then the switch into the TV and You would switch between the two just like an HDMI switch nowadays.

723
00:54:16,062 --> 00:54:18,330
Speaker 0: and that switch it would basically the art.

724
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:22,960
Speaker 0: Ari would send its T It's RF signal through that box.

725
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:24,225
Speaker 0: on the frequency.

726
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:30,450
Speaker 0: that happened to be US channel 3 but it was different frequencies in other countries, right?

727
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,097
Speaker 1: So you had to turn in the United States.

728
00:54:32,157 --> 00:54:37,159
Speaker 1: you have to turn your TV to channel 3 to watch What was being broadcast by the attack.

729
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:39,430
Speaker 0: when I was a kid the two greatest mysteries in my life?

730
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:39,690
Speaker 0: Where?

731
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:41,076
Speaker 0: why channel 3?

732
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:42,481
Speaker 0: and why isn't there a channel 1?

733
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,910
Speaker 0: because there wasn't an internet to look that up on and you know.

734
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,477
Speaker 1: Only now to literally this moment.

735
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:52,270
Speaker 1: I realized you know what they could have done if they had a more powerful, right?

736
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:54,969
Speaker 1: You know Atari back in the day.

737
00:54:55,531 --> 00:55:05,824
Speaker 1: You could have broadcast different parts of the game on different channels and you could have had like you could have had the Atari sending Out, you know data on like seven channels and you flip between them like channel 2. is the map?

738
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:10,884
Speaker 1: channel 3 is the right You know, they could have done that if they had enough power.

739
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:14,517
Speaker 0: There's lots of nonsense you could have done But yeah, pretty much no one did that ever.

740
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:18,589
Speaker 0: but in terms of video cables that consumers used in their own homes.

741
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:24,030
Speaker 0: Twin lead RF was it for most of the history of video existing in homes?

742
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:31,218
Speaker 1: Yep, the coax RF came around when cable TV became a thing And they still had switches for those.

743
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:32,582
Speaker 1: but the switches were like they had.

744
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:34,730
Speaker 1: the NES came with like an automatic switch.

745
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,626
Speaker 1: You didn't have to go back and flick it yourself.

746
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you turn this gray box, right?

747
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:47,295
Speaker 1: It automatically detected when you turn the NES on and then would turn off the TV antenna and then when you turn the NES off The TV would come back.

748
00:55:47,335 --> 00:55:48,780
Speaker 0: But also that NES device.

749
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,724
Speaker 0: I want to say it took.

750
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,567
Speaker 0: it only took in 75 Ohm.

751
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:56,168
Speaker 0: So if you had an old 300 ohm antenna, you still needed a converter.

752
00:55:56,871 --> 00:56:00,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you had the twin lead you needed a special extra thing.

753
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,946
Speaker 0: Yeah that TV we had up until beacon had twin lead on the back.

754
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:04,810
Speaker 1: So Atari, right?

755
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:11,129
Speaker 1: So Atari was twin lead NES was coax, but also the NES did have at the Famicom didn't have it.

756
00:56:11,832 --> 00:56:17,170
Speaker 1: But the NES actually had one advantage over the Famicom and that it did have component RCA.

757
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,357
Speaker 1: It didn't have stereo sound.

758
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:27,309
Speaker 1: It just had a red and a yellow and a white or a white whatever Yellow and it just had one video and one audio and that was it.

759
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:32,230
Speaker 1: But if you had a TV that took RCA in that was definitely preferred.

760
00:56:32,592 --> 00:56:33,215
Speaker 1: Do you use that?

761
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:35,810
Speaker 0: but TVs that could take RCA in were?

762
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,633
Speaker 0: Extremely rare.

763
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:44,106
Speaker 1: for until the later 90s at least mid mid to late 90s, I'd say yep I didn't really see too many.

764
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:48,164
Speaker 0: now This is where it starts to get a little complicated because what signal is going over?

765
00:56:48,184 --> 00:57:00,160
Speaker 0: a cable is not necessarily like one-to-one related to what kind of cable you're losing and it gets more and more complex into the future, but RCA is what most people call it.

766
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:09,037
Speaker 0: some people call it component RCA But a lot of people who call it that think that that is component Which is no component is different.

767
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:18,110
Speaker 0: and also component was rarely used by any Consumer except nerds and it only was really popular for a very brief period of time.

768
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:20,257
Speaker 1: Though it's the best option.

769
00:57:20,277 --> 00:57:24,575
Speaker 0: if you have a Wii, I hope you have a Wii or like a Gamecube That is the best possible.

770
00:57:25,096 --> 00:57:25,678
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

771
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:43,274
Speaker 0: It was so much better than using RCA, but yeah RCA Basically became the defacto standard for video for a long time in the US and It was a standard that included video and audio which was made it easy, but the signaling over that thing It wasn't RF.

772
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,498
Speaker 0: It was something completely different.

773
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,870
Speaker 1: And this yeah, I never really I never fully understood it how it worked.

774
00:57:48,393 --> 00:57:50,366
Speaker 0: It just sent two components basically.

775
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:58,450
Speaker 1: Yeah But the main thing the main significant difference for the the RCA over the RF right was that number one?

776
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:01,208
Speaker 1: It was much easier to figure out how to set it up, right?

777
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:04,969
Speaker 0: Yeah Switches there were standardized colors yellow red and white.

778
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, now the video was separated from the audio.

779
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:18,989
Speaker 1: So now you could send the video to the television and the audio to a receiver Separately without having to have the TV get involved and you could now suddenly do you know?

780
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:23,290
Speaker 1: Hook up sound systems and things to your television more easily with RCA.

781
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:42,181
Speaker 1: Also, you didn't need this external switching thing to go behind the TV or whatever because now your TV could just have like five sets of RCA inputs and In this is when the first TVs instead of turning to channel 3 or something You would just push the input button on your remote control.

782
00:58:42,462 --> 00:58:50,970
Speaker 0: TVs didn't have the input button before RCA really and in fact a lot of TVs they had a big switch to flip between VHF and UHF.

783
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:54,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now once you had RCA It's like okay.

784
00:58:54,812 --> 00:59:04,530
Speaker 1: now the TV has an input button and one of the inputs is the antenna which is could be cable TV Or could be an antenna, but then there'll be other inputs, which are the RCA input.

785
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:17,650
Speaker 1: So now your VCR eventually DVD players when they came out right all video game consoles for a long time all Used RCA as the way to plug into the television even up to Gamecubes.

786
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:23,703
Speaker 0: PlayStations right now Is an ancient standard that predates any of this.

787
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:25,910
Speaker 0: it just wasn't used in console a lot of consumer technology.

788
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:33,570
Speaker 0: It was used heavily in audio, but not commonly used in video until way later, but the other I mean, yeah There were plenty of audio devices.

789
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:39,608
Speaker 1: I've seen that just like I have cables that go from like, you know headphone size to just red and white.

790
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,097
Speaker 0: Yeah It's unbalanced like.

791
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:45,269
Speaker 0: it's not the best way to send audio but it works.

792
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:46,493
Speaker 1: And it was.

793
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:51,510
Speaker 1: it was the most friendly, you know, you didn't need a screwdriver You didn't need to know what the hell's going on.

794
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,213
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to hear about.

795
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:52,816
Speaker 0: you want to know.

796
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:57,576
Speaker 0: you know, like my stalagmites might hang from the ceiling But they don't mnemonic.

797
00:59:58,038 --> 01:00:01,070
Speaker 0: I have an equally terrible red is on the right side, right?

798
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,854
Speaker 1: White is on it.

799
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:03,859
Speaker 1: White is on the left side.

800
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,950
Speaker 0: Right is red and left is white.

801
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:08,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how I used to remember it.

802
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know and I want to say it Craig.

803
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:11,690
Speaker 0: I might be wrong.

804
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:24,990
Speaker 0: it's been a long time because the official rule is If you only plug in the white one Then the device is supposed to assume you're sending an analog signal and send that audio to both speakers.

805
01:00:25,494 --> 01:00:33,902
Speaker 0: But nothing modern does that Mono, yes, it's supposed to assume its mono and send it to both speakers But I don't think any modern device does that.

806
01:00:34,203 --> 01:00:41,450
Speaker 1: but the other problem is RCA was the cable from all the way from like the NES and even the Commodore 64.

807
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:47,310
Speaker 1: I remember the Commodore 64 monitor had RCA on the front of it as the way to plug your Commodore into it.

808
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:48,294
Speaker 0: Oh, I had.

809
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:52,450
Speaker 0: there were devices that used RCA connectors, but they sent RF signals over them.

810
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,834
Speaker 0: This is where RCA gets complicated.

811
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,123
Speaker 0: RCA is just a cable specification.

812
01:00:57,464 --> 01:00:59,550
Speaker 0: There's lots of different ways to use those connectors.

813
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:05,069
Speaker 0: So if you heard about component with the three different colored things, I think it's like green blue there.

814
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:07,278
Speaker 0: yet Yeah, but that's RCA.

815
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:08,824
Speaker 0: That's also RCA.

816
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,012
Speaker 0: It's in the same specification Yep.

817
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:13,199
Speaker 1: Anyway, so though that was this.

818
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:16,268
Speaker 1: that was the way to plug things into a TV from.

819
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:21,489
Speaker 1: you know Commodore 64 up through I mean ps2 still used it, right?

820
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:24,889
Speaker 1: I guess until you know HD was a thing.

821
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,789
Speaker 0: My TV still has a yellow white and red in the back and also another white and red for audio in the back.

822
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:32,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, my TV.

823
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:32,675
Speaker 1: All right.

824
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:40,530
Speaker 1: So while during that long period where RCA was the thing for televisions Computers had all kinds of different shit going on.

825
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:40,707
Speaker 1: right.

826
01:01:41,772 --> 01:01:46,288
Speaker 1: All these old computers had all kinds of different weird things that they used.

827
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:52,590
Speaker 1: you had Frickin the Apple computers all had like RGB cables and all kinds of weird things going on.

828
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:56,869
Speaker 1: PCs had VGA cables then they had DVI cables.

829
01:01:57,892 --> 01:02:00,699
Speaker 1: All right, they had the S video cable.

830
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:03,186
Speaker 1: the S video cable is really weird as video.

831
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:08,076
Speaker 0: when I when I first encountered it I thought wow, that's amazing It's just is it's just a better cable.

832
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:13,077
Speaker 0: and then I discovered rapidly that almost nothing supported it by the time It was widely available.

833
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:15,310
Speaker 0: It was already obsolete and now it's gone.

834
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,598
Speaker 1: Yep, so as video was this inch.

835
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:27,369
Speaker 1: it was interesting though in that there was enough Deployment of it that you could use it like TVs had an S video in for the most part during that time period.

836
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:27,510
Speaker 0: why?

837
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:30,761
Speaker 0: During that period TVs had it but no devices had it.

838
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:31,725
Speaker 0: No VCR fight.

839
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:35,256
Speaker 1: There were devices that had Video cards that had it.

840
01:02:35,397 --> 01:02:39,428
Speaker 0: almost every device that had it was a was either a camcorder.

841
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:40,110
Speaker 0: That's the place.

842
01:02:40,933 --> 01:02:41,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

843
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:41,755
Speaker 1: Yep.

844
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:46,070
Speaker 0: Yep, and a handful of video cards.

845
01:02:46,612 --> 01:02:50,730
Speaker 1: I think there were some game consoles to where it was possible to have a game console.

846
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,318
Speaker 1: Maybe a dreamcast could had one.

847
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:54,993
Speaker 1: maybe I want to say I'm not a hundred percent sure I have.

848
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:57,930
Speaker 0: anyway, I'm actually unaware of any game console that had S video.

849
01:02:58,694 --> 01:03:05,262
Speaker 1: I think there were some that you could have as video but regardless it was all as video was sort of a like.

850
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:14,150
Speaker 1: it never got fully adopted I think because Even if it was deployed somewhat significantly, it was never alone, right?

851
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,526
Speaker 1: you were never in a situation where like that was what you had to use.

852
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:23,590
Speaker 1: because like if If a device had an S video out it had another video out besides as video.

853
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:25,756
Speaker 1: Oh TV had an S video in.

854
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,424
Speaker 1: it had plenty of RCA ends and other ends.

855
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:36,096
Speaker 1: So you were never in a situation We're like S video was the one you were gonna use And it wasn't.

856
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,390
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was different or not, but it definitely wasn't significant.

857
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:41,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I was gonna get to.

858
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:53,629
Speaker 0: so as video is one cable But all it sends is Luma and chroma The same fucking Luma and chroma that we send over that yellow cable at RCA.

859
01:03:54,252 --> 01:03:56,279
Speaker 0: It just has more grounding like it's.

860
01:03:56,821 --> 01:03:58,929
Speaker 0: it's better designed, but it's not better.

861
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:11,528
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, so all those computer cables right the VGA VGAs and DVIs right those were basically like, you know breaking things down into tons of.

862
01:04:11,749 --> 01:04:16,872
Speaker 1: you know Separation right a bunch of a little wires all on separate pins But also what.

863
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:30,590
Speaker 1: that's also where we started to move to digital signaling because VGA was analog signaling still Yep still but there was a VGA still has a digital signal for like the v-sync, right?

864
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:41,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the some of those pins because that's the one difference with a computer versus a television right the television Like, you know what the the frame rate is on the television at least in those days, right?

865
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:49,250
Speaker 1: It was locked in whereas with computers right your vertical refresh rate was could be anything and your resolution could be different as well.

866
01:04:49,912 --> 01:04:59,190
Speaker 1: So a lot of those pins on VGI and DVA were to synchronize the clock DVA VGA DVI whatever.

867
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:14,110
Speaker 1: Yeah But a lot of those pins were there to synchronize the clock so you could get the frame rate and resolution Correct, right the horizontal sync but all the data was just pure analog RGB HV, which was literally red green blue.

868
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:19,370
Speaker 0: Horizontal sync vertical sync and all the other pins are just in support of those.

869
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:26,510
Speaker 0: Yep, there's also some data pins power pin and there were some data pins that I don't think were ever used by anything ever.

870
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:29,808
Speaker 1: We had a recent thing of the day Ben eater.

871
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:35,390
Speaker 1: He has a video where he shows you how to basically make a VGA display video card, right?

872
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,429
Speaker 1: It's like world's worst.

873
01:05:36,751 --> 01:05:41,910
Speaker 1: It calls the video like world's worst video card to something and if you watch that video, you'll understand how VGA works.

874
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:48,950
Speaker 0: Yep, but VGA for all these pins It's not really that different from component which used RCA.

875
01:05:49,392 --> 01:06:00,330
Speaker 0: But instead of having one for video one for left channel one for right channel It had three video pins and VGA actually very similarly just has three video pins for the three colors.

876
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:09,809
Speaker 1: But but due to the vertical and horizontal syncs being in there It supported a wide variety of resolutions and frame rates that the other cables couldn't do.

877
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:19,028
Speaker 0: And VGA was the standard for computers for a long time and D long time Didn't actually replace it.

878
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,245
Speaker 0: It just coexisted alongside it because it added some things.

879
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:26,670
Speaker 0: but it also wasn't Super universally adopted and it starts the company.

880
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:30,910
Speaker 1: I did have some other features that but like those features never really got used.

881
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:31,213
Speaker 1: I don't know.

882
01:06:31,233 --> 01:06:35,598
Speaker 0: if you could well DVI you could run VGA signaling over some of the pins.

883
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:39,008
Speaker 0: on DVI you can have analog and digital signals coexisting.

884
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:43,290
Speaker 0: on DVI You could drive two monitors from the same DVI cable and yep.

885
01:06:43,491 --> 01:06:44,917
Speaker 0: Very little of this was ever used.

886
01:06:44,937 --> 01:06:47,869
Speaker 0: DVI was kind of over engineered and ahead of its time.

887
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:50,454
Speaker 1: And then HDMI came.

888
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:54,165
Speaker 0: Yep, and HDMI rapidly became what I'm basically at.

889
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:59,159
Speaker 0: from HDMI onward We are at the basically pure digital signaling.

890
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,482
Speaker 0: These are just digital cables.

891
01:07:00,502 --> 01:07:01,605
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

892
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:06,922
Speaker 1: once we went into the HD realm It's like okay this that's the end of all those other things, right?

893
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,330
Speaker 1: Everyone has an LCD panel, right?

894
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,593
Speaker 1: That's HD at least.

895
01:07:11,054 --> 01:07:13,982
Speaker 1: so we can all use HDMI now, right?

896
01:07:14,022 --> 01:07:15,746
Speaker 0: Well, so there are two.

897
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:23,690
Speaker 0: there's HDMI and DisplayPort are basically the two right now and most video card report is really only used by computers.

898
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:26,881
Speaker 0: Yep, so most computer like we just got a 3080 a TI right?

899
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:29,490
Speaker 0: It's got three display ports and one.

900
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,045
Speaker 0: That's kind of the default right now.

901
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:36,193
Speaker 1: Yep, that's just about any video cards gonna have that Yeah days.

902
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:43,566
Speaker 1: and at this point if you get if you get you know The thing is DisplayPort right is there even if you don't realize it's there at the start of the show.

903
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:46,113
Speaker 1: We talked about USB C. Yeah Like ah, that's.

904
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:50,670
Speaker 1: but USB C is just display port only on a different to a degree display port.

905
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,139
Speaker 0: It's just USB C because these.

906
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:58,608
Speaker 0: this is where we have completely disentangled the physical spec of the cable from what the fuck you're doing over it.

907
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:03,570
Speaker 0: and DisplayPort and USB C as cables can both do basically anything.

908
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:09,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much DisplayPort has the added bonus of it can ruin your computer.

909
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:13,069
Speaker 1: Well only in that one weird case that's largely solved now.

910
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:18,470
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah largely solved because devices had to protect themselves from the fact that most of the cables are still broken to this day.

911
01:08:18,892 --> 01:08:20,603
Speaker 0: I encountered a broken cable recently.

912
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:22,609
Speaker 0: They're out there still Sure.

913
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:27,149
Speaker 1: Something else is that you know these cables since they can do just about anything, right?

914
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:35,064
Speaker 1: We're seeing them do more things at once right but much like DVI We're not seeing those things really used thoroughly.

915
01:08:35,086 --> 01:08:38,732
Speaker 1: so like DisplayPort you can daisy chain DisplayPort.

916
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:52,090
Speaker 1: you can go from your computer to a monitor and then from that monitor to a second monitor with two DisplayPort cables and That's supposed to work, but it only works if everything is super great and it supports things properly.

917
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:57,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of times it doesn't and it's not you know, it's like come on just make it work people, right?

918
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,318
Speaker 1: You could theoretically put like networking.

919
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:03,046
Speaker 1: I have HDMI cables that are ultra thick.

920
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:07,010
Speaker 1: I got rid of it though But I had one that was Ethernet over HDMI.

921
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:15,563
Speaker 1: so you could theoretically get a monitor or a TV and plug it in to a device and Then that device could provide the TV.

922
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:19,709
Speaker 1: Let's say it was a smart TV because you were a fool and you were gonna use.

923
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:25,384
Speaker 1: You could let the smart TV get its internet over the HDMI cable.

924
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:25,685
Speaker 1: It's like.

925
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:27,330
Speaker 1: have I ever seen that working?

926
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:31,223
Speaker 1: The only time that's probably ever worked is in like some commercial setting.

927
01:09:31,264 --> 01:09:38,550
Speaker 1: right where they're they have networked Paddles for displaying things like an airport or some shit like that, you know advertising displays or something.

928
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,301
Speaker 1: I don't think it's ever gonna work in anyone's house.

929
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:42,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I get.

930
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:46,118
Speaker 1: there are ways I think of sending power over certain HDMI cables.

931
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,386
Speaker 1: I've never seen that work if that exists.

932
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:49,649
Speaker 1: I think I've seen it.

933
01:09:50,212 --> 01:09:54,750
Speaker 1: I think I've seen it like mentioned but I've never seen it working in person, right?

934
01:09:55,492 --> 01:10:00,850
Speaker 1: But that would be cool because you could have a display with no power cable just one cable the end, that'd be nice.

935
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:01,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we'll get there.

936
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,793
Speaker 0: I think we'll see.

937
01:10:03,154 --> 01:10:07,689
Speaker 0: you just plug your computer into your monitor via a USB C cable and everything just works.

938
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,087
Speaker 1: Yep, that'd be good.

939
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:16,150
Speaker 1: Another table are we gonna see another cable after USB C at any point?

940
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:19,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, what most of the research right now that is around?

941
01:10:20,493 --> 01:10:24,590
Speaker 0: Doing increasingly complex things over the existing physical cable standards.

942
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:31,850
Speaker 0: So the physical cables are evolving but also reaching sort of upper limits of what you can do with them without like novel materials.

943
01:10:32,372 --> 01:10:35,988
Speaker 0: And it's the signaling standards and the specifications of how they're used.

944
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:46,263
Speaker 0: the auto Negotiation between devices like in the old days if you use USB a there was a way to send video over that and do sorts of nonsense but weak though, yeah.

945
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:54,481
Speaker 0: also Cables like look think about old computer cables even old video cables Really easy to break stuff and cause problems or things just don't work.

946
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:59,750
Speaker 0: or the negotiation you plug a newer device into an older device The auto negotiation fails and everything breaks.

947
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:10,523
Speaker 0: we're getting to the point to where any modern device can just plug USB C cable into any other modern device and They'll figure out what they can even do with each other if I plug.

948
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:17,131
Speaker 1: I've been reading a lot of articles from people who are Like, you know really sticklers for specifications Laining.

949
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:20,340
Speaker 1: they're all complaining like ah USB C is a mess.

950
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,362
Speaker 1: Everything's wrong.

951
01:11:21,382 --> 01:11:24,130
Speaker 0: It's less of a mess than DisplayPort or HDMI, right?

952
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:24,573
Speaker 1: They're like.

953
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:25,828
Speaker 1: this doesn't work with that.

954
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:26,592
Speaker 1: You know the.

955
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:29,604
Speaker 1: the Mac says it supports this but it doesn't right.

956
01:11:29,644 --> 01:11:32,314
Speaker 1: and I'm like and they're showing like these Weird edge cases.

957
01:11:32,374 --> 01:11:36,710
Speaker 0: and I'm like, oh you're trying to do firewire over USB C. who cares about that?

958
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:39,517
Speaker 0: But you I really don't right.

959
01:11:39,537 --> 01:11:39,738
Speaker 1: It's like.

960
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:42,766
Speaker 1: let's talk about real practical examples, right?

961
01:11:42,826 --> 01:11:44,190
Speaker 1: Here's a real practical example.

962
01:11:44,372 --> 01:12:07,003
Speaker 1: I can go and buy a generic USB C device that on one end has USB C a cable and on the other end has an HDMI output and an SD card reader and I can plug that one generic device into a MacBook, right my PC and the bottom of a Nintendo switch.

963
01:12:07,604 --> 01:12:17,130
Speaker 1: and on all three of those devices And a phone and a phone an Android phone or an iPad also right five different devices that have USB C holes.

964
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:27,166
Speaker 1: I can plug that same generic thing into all five devices and in all five of them The HDMI port will work and the SD card reader will work.

965
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:27,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

966
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:33,110
Speaker 1: so Practically speaking in terms of you know an everyday person, right?

967
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:40,508
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit if there's like these Spec problems that some people are complaining about where this device doesn't work with that one or that person.

968
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:43,604
Speaker 0: people like that How you get all as the OTG.

969
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:44,670
Speaker 0: rest in peace, right?

970
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,452
Speaker 1: It's like the it.

971
01:12:46,155 --> 01:12:57,814
Speaker 1: it works enough that it's a miracle for people's lives that they could buy one Adapter and use it with every fucking thing they own and don't have to buy a second one and it works Properly.

972
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's what counts.

973
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:02,501
Speaker 1: Rest in peace.

974
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:03,370
Speaker 1: RF cable.
