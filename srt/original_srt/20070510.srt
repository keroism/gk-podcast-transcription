8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:40,469
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone involved in the organization I'm about to call out is ever going to listen to our show and that's fine, but to after hours formal wear.

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,702

Speaker 1: I. Your after hours formal wear is now on my like top 15 Boycotted businesses, well, I don't know enough about the company itself.

11
00:00:54,986 --> 00:01:01,210
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't care about business I know, but that one employee definitely and oh particular branch definitely.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,792
Speaker 1: Here's the.

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,623
Speaker 1: the background story is two friends of ours are getting married.

14
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:05,870
Speaker 1: Hey, this is gonna be fun.

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:12,053
Speaker 1: I gotta get a tuxedo for it and it has to be the right kind of tuxedo and they registered through after-hours formal wear Whatever.

16
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:19,439
Speaker 1: I just have to go to this place one of them get fitted then go before I drive to the wedding pick up The tuxedo and then drop it back off the next Monday.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,142
Speaker 1: No big deal.

18
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:29,579
Speaker 1: So, uh, I Go eventually because it turns out that there aren't any Anywhere near our house at all.

19
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,510
Speaker 0: There is one in the one mall like 15 minutes up the road.

20
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:34,445
Speaker 1: It's more than 15 minutes.

21
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,228
Speaker 1: Remember to actually get to that mall and a park somewhere to get into that stupid place and then to get back?

22
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:43,661
Speaker 1: it takes about 45 minutes to go to the mall not counting doing anything.

23
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,755
Speaker 0: if it doesn't take 45 minutes to get to the mall actually Yeah, it does.

24
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,370
Speaker 1: Oh, it does to get and come back.

25
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:52,728
Speaker 0: Oh in the der driving total to get there and come back me Which is what I said.

26
00:01:53,352 --> 00:02:01,010
Speaker 1: And it's often taken us a bit more than that just because all the other issues on the road and construction or slow traffic Or usually because we stop in other places.

27
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:03,470
Speaker 1: Well, usually because Scott says it doesn't take so long.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,679
Speaker 1: But every time I watch my cell phone and I keep track of exactly how long it takes It's always a lot longer than Scott thinks it is.

29
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,621
Speaker 0: next time we're gonna tell look you don't show me the stopwatch though I think you're trying to hide something.

30
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:14,106
Speaker 0: All right.

31
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:14,510
Speaker 0: All right.

32
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,161
Speaker 0: So next time we're gonna look at the clock.

33
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,742
Speaker 1: when we anyway look at the clock It's a gigantic pain in the ass to go up there.

34
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:21,089
Speaker 0: It is a gigantic plus.

35
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:24,910
Speaker 1: remember It's not like I can really go on weekends cuz we're always busier out of town on weekends.

36
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:34,150
Speaker 1: So I'd have to go on a weekday After work when it's already 630 by the time I get home and I'm already sweaty and that road because of rush hour.

37
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,547
Speaker 1: It would take 45 minutes just to get to the mall in the rush hour.

38
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,046
Speaker 0: in the rush hour Absolutely, which is the only time we can go.

39
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,126
Speaker 0: Yep.

40
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:46,090
Speaker 1: So finally after two weeks of trying to go to the stupid place we end up going halfway up the road.

41
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I convinced Scott to drive me the rest of the way to the stupid mall where I didn't need to go.

42
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,383
Speaker 0: I didn't know either think about how nice I am.

43
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,750
Speaker 0: rim never goes anywhere.

44
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,246
Speaker 0: He doesn't need to go no matter how badly I need to go.

45
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:58,809
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.

46
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:04,714
Speaker 1: When I drove you to the grocery store a bunch of times when all I needed was like a bag of apples I didn't really need him.

47
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:08,330
Speaker 1: When was this back when I still drove around?

48
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:10,172
Speaker 0: Sure.

49
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:14,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I drove your ass around for years in college and not so much.

50
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,330
Speaker 0: That was we didn't in college.

51
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:16,394
Speaker 0: We never went anywhere.

52
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,281
Speaker 0: We needed to go cuz we didn't need to go.

53
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:19,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did groceries.

54
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,870
Speaker 0: We didn't need groceries.

55
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

56
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,081
Speaker 1: No anyway, Mr.

00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,609
Speaker 0: I needed a more than you did.

59
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:32,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we finally get up there and the employee is basically just standing there and yet he will not serve me.

60
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:34,936
Speaker 1: He keeps saying we're busy.

61
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:41,368
Speaker 0: I'll get to you in 45 minutes and he just stands there the guy I went into the store cuz I was mostly just.

62
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:45,209
Speaker 0: you know If I'm at the mall, I'm not gonna spend my time waiting with rim doing his BS.

63
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,506
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go around the mall and maybe Save the trip, you know, so I actually get something out of my trip to the mall.

64
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,530
Speaker 1: We did get something out of it.

65
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,610
Speaker 1: We saw that horrible bootleg anime store.

66
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:55,347
Speaker 0: Oh he did Yes.

67
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,557
Speaker 0: But so I go in there to get rim.

68
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:57,758
Speaker 0: like.

69
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,460
Speaker 0: what's the deal?

70
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,524
Speaker 0: and I see this guy.

71
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:07,305
Speaker 0: he's standing there leaning on the counter Holding the tape measure Obviously, he's a tailor of some sort and he's just standing there not talking not doing anything.

72
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:11,023
Speaker 1: and he keeps saying Oh, I got an alteration to do you'll have to wait.

73
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:11,486
Speaker 1: You'll have to wait.

74
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:12,110
Speaker 1: You'll have to come back.

75
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,974
Speaker 0: Why aren't you doing it?

76
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaker 1: So I stuck around.

77
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,450
Speaker 1: I said, alright, I'll come back and I came back.

78
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,875
Speaker 0: I should be glad that I wasn't the customer.

79
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:22,210
Speaker 1: a good half hour 35 minutes later, and it's a little busy now.

80
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,829
Speaker 1: He's obviously the only employee in this stupid place and he still will not serve me.

81
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:31,226
Speaker 1: And when I try to ask him like hey I have places to be is there any way?

82
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:35,222
Speaker 1: all I need is to be measured For this tuxedo, it'll take a second and he's just so rude.

83
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,050
Speaker 1: He basically won't serve me at all.

84
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,185
Speaker 1: And so I'm like, uh, well, can I make an appointment?

85
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,270
Speaker 1: He's like we don't do appointments.

86
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:47,770
Speaker 1: So I'm like well fuck this and I just leave because at this point I've wasted almost 50 minutes on this stupid thing.

87
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:54,813
Speaker 0: I would have yelled at the guy until and like either he would had to start a fight with me and go to jail or Something okay.

88
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:55,094
Speaker 1: Mr.

89
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:55,756
Speaker 1: Combat.

90
00:04:55,937 --> 00:05:00,190
Speaker 0: I really I would have just yelled at the guy until he caved in seriously at that point.

91
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,819
Speaker 1: See at that point I decided all right.

92
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,910
Speaker 1: I just will not give your store my business.

93
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:08,730
Speaker 0: I that also but I would have also yelled at him and so not giving him my business I get home.

94
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,709
Speaker 0: I've given up like if I yelled at him and then he gave in and said, okay, I'll size you like.

95
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,629
Speaker 0: no I don't want it now cuz you suck.

96
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:25,667
Speaker 1: So anyway, I go home and I look online and he's after-hours formal wear have pretty much zero useful locations Anywhere people live there aren't any down in Manhattan I can go to.

97
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:26,390
Speaker 1: that are accessible.

98
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,630
Speaker 1: They're all in like Long Island or New Jersey way out of my way.

99
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,350
Speaker 1: So I end up driving to one in some stupid town in the strip mall somewhere in New York.

100
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,979
Speaker 0: Oh, you went to another one and you know what?

101
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,828
Speaker 1: Hmm the exact same goddamn thing happened.

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:40,330
Speaker 1: Really?

103
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, one implode this time.

104
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:49,945
Speaker 1: The guy was actually busy, but while he was actually busy He would not take the time to help me and he couldn't tell me when he could help me.

105
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,293
Speaker 1: and I waited there for well over a half hour.

106
00:05:52,675 --> 00:06:01,623
Speaker 1: and he's just answering the phone and answering the phone and answering the phone and filling out paperwork and there's all these and just These in stores just can't seem to deal with any number of customers.

107
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:05,456
Speaker 1: and the guy was totally rude and I After waiting too long.

108
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:06,279
Speaker 1: I had to go back to work.

109
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,105
Speaker 1: Fuck this and I left.

110
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:09,570
Speaker 0: I would just stop trying.

111
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:10,996
Speaker 1: So today worth it.

112
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,870
Speaker 1: So today I drove to fucking white Plains.

113
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,402
Speaker 1: You actually tried again to the worst mall.

114
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:17,984
Speaker 1: This is the mall.

115
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,810
Speaker 1: I bought the Apple in Mac.

116
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:24,162
Speaker 1: This is probably the worst mall in the world.

117
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,830
Speaker 1: And when I say the worst, I mean, it's opulence.

118
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,577
Speaker 1: It's super expensive.

119
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:29,782
Speaker 1: It's gigantic.

120
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,490
Speaker 1: It's designed like a maze.

121
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,974
Speaker 0: That's white Plains.

122
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:38,550
Speaker 1: It very specifically is designed to not allow people to get in without cars.

123
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:42,101
Speaker 1: Easily, that's white Plains and I hate this mall.

124
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,606
Speaker 1: I can't stand being in there.

125
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,790
Speaker 1: just painful for me to be in there.

126
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:56,750
Speaker 1: So I drive 45 minutes to this place during the workday and I go in and I go to this after-hours formal wear and the exact same Fucking thing happens to me again, really?

127
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, three times three different stores same deal.

128
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:03,090
Speaker 1: the employee acted in the same manner wouldn't serve me.

129
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,930
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of other people waiting.

130
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:08,828
Speaker 1: they're just doing bullshit paperwork or answering the phone or just standing there.

131
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:13,707
Speaker 1: and Finally, they're helping the person before me after I've been waiting for an hour.

132
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:17,421
Speaker 0: Wow And and you didn't yell at them any of these three times.

133
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,810
Speaker 1: No, I I was so paid.

134
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,204
Speaker 1: This is probably the most sufferance of fools I've ever engaged in in my.

135
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:25,910
Speaker 0: I don't even know why you suffered a single fool.

136
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,633
Speaker 0: You didn't have to.

137
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:27,516
Speaker 0: you shouldn't have had to.

138
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:35,490
Speaker 1: I've done this all for the sake of my two friends who are getting married And I'm gonna get to what the moral of all this at the end because I've made a resolution in my life.

139
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:53,630
Speaker 1: So the people in front of me like this one guy and this other guy and this other guy They're just standing there and I figure they need something quick they need to be measured and it ends up being this gigantic thing where They don't like the pants because the pants are too tight and the guy who's saying the pants are too tight is Wearing pants that are like eight sizes too big hanging off his ass.

140
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,714
Speaker 1: I can see his ass.

141
00:07:55,296 --> 00:08:01,080
Speaker 1: and yet he wants to wear his tuxedo low like that and the lady's like, um You can't wear a tuxedo that way.

142
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,590
Speaker 1: and they go through this whole thing.

143
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:10,935
Speaker 1: and then she trying to scan his credit card his credit card doesn't work and the name's not right in there and all this crap and Finally I get served.

144
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:11,917
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

145
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:12,919
Speaker 0: I didn't think that was gonna happen.

146
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 1: and Well, it's gonna cost me more than twice as much as any tuxedo.

147
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,069
Speaker 1: I've ever rented in my life.

148
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,145
Speaker 1: Wow for one it's a hundred and fifty bucks.

149
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,190
Speaker 0: four hundred fifty bucks.

150
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:32,389
Speaker 0: I just buy a tuxedo because the tuxedo is like four hundred bucks But the thing is to rent one for one night.

151
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,874
Speaker 1: It's not like.

152
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:38,067
Speaker 1: how many times have I had to wear a tuxedo in my life?

153
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:38,890
Speaker 1: I will name them.

154
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:46,237
Speaker 0: Yes, however, let me submit this I know you if you owned a tuxedo for four hundred dollars Would you wear it in your?

155
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,190
Speaker 0: you would intentionally wear it at times that were not necessary?

156
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:56,978
Speaker 0: You would wear it more than three times and it would be worth it to buy one for $400 as opposed to rent one for 150. now

157
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,568
Speaker 1: Scott while I agree with you on that point in most cases because

158
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:01,110
Speaker 0: I do

159
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:06,971
Speaker 1: Like to dress up a lot more than I have chance to and I will just wear a suit to work if I have any Excuse at

160
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:07,392
Speaker 0: all,

161
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:13,407
Speaker 1: but a $400 tuxedo is kind of crappy for one and I don't like tuxedo.

162
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:13,948
Speaker 0: It's a $600 tuxedo.

163
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,803
Speaker 0: You have to wear it four times for it to be a good deal.

164
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:23,295
Speaker 1: It is my opinion that Tuxedos are Horrible and ugly and unstyling.

165
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,899
Speaker 1: I really don't like tuxedos.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,162
Speaker 1: Oh, we agree on some.

167
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:30,134
Speaker 1: I much prefer to wear some sort of nice Three-piece suit.

168
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:30,937
Speaker 1: I like suits.

169
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,102
Speaker 1: I like sport jackets.

170
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,528
Speaker 1: I hate tuxedos.

171
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:36,376
Speaker 1: They Everything about them bothers me.

172
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,161
Speaker 1: They're not actually fashionable.

173
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,930
Speaker 1: They just pick what's fashionable and then you have to wear it.

174
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,396
Speaker 0: I think the point of dress clothes is Now this is they're similar to sunglasses.

175
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:48,164
Speaker 0: the more money they cost the more people they look good on.

176
00:09:48,345 --> 00:10:00,090
Speaker 0: even a fat ugly nasty guy He looks alright in a tuxedo because it covers so much And it's so slick itself that if you're an ugly horrible person you wearing that you're okay to look at.

177
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:08,815
Speaker 1: But the thing is when I see a tuxedo ever The only thing I think is that guys either go into a wedding or a high school prom because no one wears Tuxedos anywhere else.

178
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,950
Speaker 0: at least not guys even wear tuxedos to prom so much anymore either.

179
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we all did but my tuxedo cost me 40 bucks to rent and it was the same tuxedo.

180
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,116
Speaker 0: Well, there's also a kid size.

181
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:19,421
Speaker 0: There's a lot less material going.

182
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,345
Speaker 1: I wasn't a kid size.

183
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,530
Speaker 1: I was the same size in high school.

184
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:24,789
Speaker 1: Now Anyway, actually, I'm a little thinner now.

185
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:31,494
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, I could go on and on but I just think tuxedos are kind of ugly and garish And I really don't like them.

186
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:41,550
Speaker 1: and while there are occasions where a tuxedo I would feel would be justified like a white tie Formal dinner that is not the time kind of tuxedo you get at a mall in white Plains.

187
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,686
Speaker 1: That's the kind of tuxedo you pay a lot of money for.

188
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:49,190
Speaker 1: yeah So, uh, there's no reason for me to buy a tuxedo and I'm gonna have to spend this hundred fifty bucks and all that.

189
00:10:49,512 --> 00:11:07,250
Speaker 1: So I finally get the thing and the lady's like, I'm sorry it took so long blah blah blah and I was very nice to her despite all this and I pay my hundred and fifty bucks on my credit card and I walk out and I decided now from this point forward in my life other than this wedding because I've already committed to it.

190
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,635
Speaker 1: So I got to wear the stupid tuxedo.

191
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:20,880
Speaker 1: I will never in the rest of my life I give my solemn word Wear a rented cheap or crappy tuxedo to any occasion for any reason for any person ever.

192
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,030
Speaker 0: Again, I already had that resolution and I've never even worn a tuxedo in my life.

193
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,650
Speaker 1: I have ever put into a situation where a tuxedo is necessary and I feel that I really need to wear a tuxedo.

194
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:39,890
Speaker 1: I'm going to get a custom real tuxedo and I'm going to pay whatever that costs and whatever it costs to get served right away.

195
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,370
Speaker 0: You're paying so much money that they'll put the other customers make them wait longer.

196
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:57,210
Speaker 1: I hate to say this but I used to think when I was a kid and I'd see people who would spend like Ungodly amounts of money for something that was effectively the same as something that I got cheaper Only for the convenience of having it in an easier fashion.

197
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,868
Speaker 1: But now I fully see the value of that because time is so much more valuable than money.

198
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,498
Speaker 0: Yes I agree with that it is.

199
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:08,139
Speaker 0: it is worth it for me at this point I have so I have enough money to pay for convenience.

200
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,408
Speaker 0: However, I don't really think any to.

201
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:14,038
Speaker 0: for me personally Almost no clothing is work.

202
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:21,933
Speaker 0: No single item of clothing or a single Arrangement of clothing to be worn at the same time is worth more than like $50.

203
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, well this cuz I really don't care about arrangement.

204
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,850
Speaker 1: at the same time I mean all my pants cost more than $50.

205
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:45,563
Speaker 0: I mean my shorts cost like 20 but like if I was to pay $50 for a single clothing it would have to be like some super awesome one-of-a-kind like Metroid anniversary shirt Signed by the guy all right met for some reason.

206
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:49,777
Speaker 1: I thought I thought you were going to say Metrosexual and instead you said Metroid.

207
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,288
Speaker 1: I think that is one of the defining things that makes geek nights what it is.

208
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:53,990
Speaker 0: Okay?

209
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:58,518
Speaker 0: but Honestly geek nights officially on endorses.

210
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,841
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you never did endorse.

211
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,010
Speaker 0: but we anti endorse all tuxedo rental place.

212
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:11,863
Speaker 1: Especially no just after hours for hours formal wear because the times I rented tuxedos in my youth for other events I did not have nearly this difficulty.

213
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,069
Speaker 1: I walked in well.

214
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,101
Speaker 0: So wait now don't you have to go to one of these places to pick the tux?

215
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:22,469
Speaker 1: Oh, oh you realize before this wedding on Thursday I have to either during rush hour or sometime during the day.

216
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,037
Speaker 1: Drive all the fuck way out to white planes.

217
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:27,445
Speaker 1: go to this goddamn mall again pay for parking.

218
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,593
Speaker 1: walk 20 minutes Mall.

219
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,339
Speaker 1: yeah, it keeps the riffraff out.

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,283
Speaker 1: It's like three bucks.

221
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:34,427
Speaker 1: It's just to keep riffraff out.

222
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,399
Speaker 1: white planes I really don't like white planes.

223
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,110
Speaker 0: white planes is where all these rich uppity Jews live.

224
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:52,784
Speaker 1: See I don't mind the people who live there on mine the the atmosphere of the commercial sectors there and the roads Because 287 is on my shit list of the ten roads.

251
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:17,945

253
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:29,350

00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:32,697
Speaker 0: All right.

275
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:41,273
Speaker 1: Now I have a very similar story in my work where we were talking about weddings and whatever Back it.

276
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,697
Speaker 1: I want my old work back at IBM.

277
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:48,697
Speaker 1: I was a lot more vocal about my opinions because the people there Generally were a lot more.

278
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:55,102
Speaker 1: I would I want to say intelligent but Interested in debate and arguing as opposed to just sitting there.

279
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:55,523
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

280
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,510
Speaker 1: So also I actually ate with them.

281
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:05,770
Speaker 1: I don't really eat with anyone at my current work So I really don't have much opportunity to argue with anyone Mm-hmm, and we had an argument where I was talking about how you know.

282
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,713
Speaker 1: If you go to a flower place and you say you want flowers for an event They give you X price.

283
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:16,477
Speaker 1: if you send someone else in and order the exact same thing, but say it's for a wedding They'll charge you quite a bit more money.

284
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I a lot of people have verified this.

285
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,390
Speaker 1: you can verify it yourself.

286
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,771
Speaker 1: Yeah if

287
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:33,769
Speaker 0: you want to verify get two friends go to a florist and say I want a bouquet of These flowers and then pay for it and then send your other friend in to get the same exact flowers But say it's for a wedding specifically and see what they charge you.

288
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:39,930
Speaker 1: Well, really not for a single bouquet but for like a flower arrangement, yeah the flowers for an event that sort of thing.

289
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,360
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah, we got to do another show on that.

290
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,927
Speaker 1: cuz we've got actual things to talk about.

291
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:44,791
Speaker 0: Hey weddings What.

292
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:47,704
Speaker 0: there's no point in spending so much money on one single party.

293
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,958
Speaker 0: You could have gone on vacation You could have bought a house.

294
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:50,826
Speaker 0: You could have bought a car.

295
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,737
Speaker 1: You're an $75,000.

296
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:57,588
Speaker 0: you could have bought a BMW which would have lasted you for many years.

297
00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:01,949
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't Finish my anecdote, okay I just kind of went nowhere with that.

298
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:06,549
Speaker 1: So we're talking and I was like and he's talking about a wedding and he's like this wedding is gonna cost.

299
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,974
Speaker 1: it was Same kind of number.

300
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:23,850
Speaker 1: you just gave some ludicrous number for this crazy amount of money on the wedding and I was like You know, you probably they could have had the exact same wedding for maybe not half that price But at least a significant percentage off without having to sacrifice any of the quality and the dude didn't believe me.

301
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, people just refuse to accept that they fucked up.

302
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:35,670
Speaker 1: but if they believe you're a total day It's your special day it you got to spare no expense because this only happens once it's your special day.

303
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:36,696
Speaker 0: That's the argument.

304
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:39,937
Speaker 0: every other fucking day except this it's a day I'm signing a contract.

305
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:45,804
Speaker 0: if I want to celebrate signing a contract I'll have a party like party can't go over a certain level of fun.

306
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,550
Speaker 0: It doesn't take that much to get fun.

307
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is like a hundred bucks a fire and some meat.

308
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:54,550
Speaker 1: See the thing is I have no problem with the idea of a wedding or any of that or even marriage.

309
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:58,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing that bothers me is the wedding planning.

310
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,307
Speaker 0: That is that's what I'm saying.

311
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:01,290
Speaker 1: in the United States.

312
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,535
Speaker 1: We're not disparaging weddings.

313
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:10,120
Speaker 1: We're disparaging the wedding planning industry much like the funeral home in I was just gonna mention the funeral home the prison industrial complex.

314
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,481
Speaker 1: Yeah.

315
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:10,882
Speaker 1: Yeah.

316
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,449
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the news, oh my god.

317
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott didn't expect this cuz I kept this all bottled up for the last three weeks.

318
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,305
Speaker 0: Well, I knew that you had the trouble the first time but I didn't know you had three more trouble.

319
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,490
Speaker 1: never in your wildest dreams.

320
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,690
Speaker 1: Would you think that I would have the same problem at two additional store?

321
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:33,608
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that you didn't like blow those stores up and that you're not on the news as some sort of terrorist Because it's their special day.

322
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:43,468
Speaker 1: so, uh These this was on slashdot and it appears that the United States government very much is outlawing wedding ceremonies.

323
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:49,870
Speaker 1: Yes Wants to somehow limit the access that people have to satellite imagery of the earth.

324
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,350
Speaker 1: And all right, I had a lot more to say about this, but we've already gone a while with our ranting.

325
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'll keep it short.

326
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:05,630
Speaker 1: I don't think that the government really has the right to prevent access to pictures of things from public space.

327
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much

328
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:22,468
Speaker 1: also the fact that it's not like the u.s Controls all the satellites and there's a lot of commercial satellites out there and satellites from other countries And it's not like you can't get access to this and I really don't see how a short of shooting down a bunch of satellites This is feasible at all.

329
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:33,190
Speaker 1: and in fact It bothers me even now that like Google Will if India because this happened India complained that you could see some of their industry and some of their military stuff on Google Earth.

330
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:37,941
Speaker 1: so Google very nicely blurred it out and I say that's crap.

331
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:47,601
Speaker 1: if you're a government and you're trying to hide your military operations You've got to deal with the fact that there are satellites out there and that me Rim can sit here in my house and look at your shit.

332
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:51,536
Speaker 0: for thousands of years of human existence We had no reliable maps.

333
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:52,700
Speaker 0: Look at old maps.

334
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,282
Speaker 0: They suck.

335
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,430
Speaker 0: all people needed better maps.

336
00:20:56,393 --> 00:21:00,670
Speaker 0: With maps we can actually go around the earth and know where shit is.

337
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,733
Speaker 0: It's very important.

338
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,219
Speaker 0: and now we finally have perfect maps.

339
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,130
Speaker 0: We have high-resolution imagery of the entire surface of the entire planet.

340
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:12,945
Speaker 0: It's so incredibly amazing and there are people who want to take that away.

341
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:17,121
Speaker 0: We should put those people away Alright, so my news.

342
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:17,443
Speaker 0: I don't know.

343
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:20,289
Speaker 0: we were going to discuss this a lot now I don't know how much we're gonna discuss it.

344
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:23,118
Speaker 0: It's an article about on CNN money.

345
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,485
Speaker 0: calm about for gas saving.

346
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,990
Speaker 0: myths, right?

347
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:32,928
Speaker 0: There are things they've evil believe about saving gas some things that even I believed that are true and or not true.

348
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:34,994
Speaker 1: is the acetone trick in there?

349
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:36,097
Speaker 0: no nothing.

350
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:50,230
Speaker 0: if anyone ever tells you that adding something to your fuel some sort of fuel additive or Putting a sticker on your gas tank or some sort of magnet somewhere in your fuel all those stupid stickers All of those things are complete bullshit.

351
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:53,682
Speaker 0: They will not if they're think about this right it?

352
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:56,030
Speaker 0: your Chevy your your General Motors, right?

353
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:01,550
Speaker 0: You want to put the highest possible number you can on the windshield of your car for fuel efficiency, right?

354
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:10,990
Speaker 0: Now imagine if there was a sticker that if you put it on the gas tank up the fuel efficiency Wouldn't you put that sticker on every car and thus raise the fuel efficiency of all your cars?

355
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,890
Speaker 0: And then a lot of people would buy your cars because there was so much more fuel efficient, huh?

356
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,162
Speaker 0: I wonder why they don't put these stickers on the gas tanks.

357
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:21,169
Speaker 0: Oh because it's just a fucking sticker.

358
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:25,304
Speaker 0: Goddamn anyone who believed that is an idiot anyway, so that's the first myth.

359
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:26,970
Speaker 0: the second myth now.

360
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:35,664
Speaker 0: This is a myth that I believed and that okay if you turn on your air conditioning Or you open your windows while you're driving it hurts your gas mileage now.

361
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:36,647
Speaker 0: This is true.

362
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:39,689
Speaker 0: however, it is apparently.

363
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:51,550
Speaker 0: according to various studies the amount of significance to how much gas mileage you lose by opening windows or turning on air conditioning is Really not that much compared to other factors.

364
00:22:51,992 --> 00:23:00,790
Speaker 1: However, I do point out because kinda argued about this quite a bit before the show and in the interest of time We'll leave all the argument out because we came to a consensus that this study is technically correct.

365
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:02,274
Speaker 1: But what speed were they going at?

366
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:03,597
Speaker 1: 55 65 65?

367
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:07,608
Speaker 1: I think that that starts to break down when you're going.

368
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:08,049
Speaker 1: I don't know.

369
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,512
Speaker 1: 8090.

370
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:16,110
Speaker 0: yes, if you're going really fast and you've got like the sunroof and all the windows open that is gonna hurt you a measurable amount.

371
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:20,610
Speaker 0: Still not as much as some other factors But you're probably at going fast on the highway.

372
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:24,825
Speaker 0: You're probably a little bit better off with the air conditioning and going around town.

373
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:31,241
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter Seriously, yep Well, there's also the fact that I mean my personal experience.

374
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:38,590
Speaker 1: one of the things I've always done as long as I've owned cars is Every time I fill up the gas tank, I always fill it and then I click the trip meter.

375
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,830
Speaker 0: Yep, and I used to do that now I stopped.

376
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got out of the habit because I go to the gas station so not often now.

377
00:23:44,231 --> 00:24:06,290
Speaker 1: Well, the main reason I do it is that I always always keep track of how much gas mileage I'm getting and in fact I used to keep a spreadsheet of every time I filled my tank the gas mileage I'd gotten I'd always calculate it Mm-hmm and that way I could see not necessarily trends in my driving because I know pretty well from you know years of experience How different kinds of driving affect my gas mileage?

378
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:15,730
Speaker 1: What I did is I use this to tell if anything is going wrong with my car Because if my gas mileage starts dropping in a trend something is wrong.

379
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:20,930
Speaker 1: Mmm and several times I have been able to use this to realize that something was indeed wrong.

380
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:26,621
Speaker 1: Like my transmission was kind of going My front end was a little out of alignment.

381
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:28,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you can you sell that by the tires.

382
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:43,958
Speaker 0: Anyway, the next myth is apparently a myth that I did not know that it's cheaper to buy gas on Wednesday because gas prices go Up on the weekend and while this is true Sometimes that some yet gas can be more expensive on the weekend Sometimes some places on the whole.

383
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:51,089
Speaker 0: if you buy all your gas on Wednesday as opposed to just buying it when you need it It's not gonna make a significant difference in how much you spend on gas.

384
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:55,828
Speaker 1: Yep, if anything the best strategy is just to go buy gas in New Jersey.

385
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:58,425
Speaker 0: Yep Here's another myth that I actually believed.

386
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:04,790
Speaker 0: now I thought that like light bulbs the turning on your car used quite a bit of gas.

387
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,568
Speaker 1: In fact, my driver's ed instructor in high school even told me that.

388
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:17,330
Speaker 0: yep So it's like okay if you have a choice between you know sitting in your car and letting it idle without moving anywhere for like Five minutes or turning it off and then turning it on five minutes later.

389
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,842
Speaker 0: I thought that it was probably a better idea just to idle there.

390
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:25,248
Speaker 0: and but if you waited like ten minutes Then it was probably a better idea to start and stop the car.

391
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:36,680
Speaker 0: Apparently if you have a modern car, but you do you have a modern car Your car does not have a carburetor unless it's an old hot rod or a really old classic car Like a Model T or some 50s car.

392
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,850
Speaker 0: your car has fuel injection.

393
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,170
Speaker 1: Yep And you have a thing called that coil the inducting coil or something like the thing that broke on my Sunfire twice, right?

394
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,254
Speaker 0: You have fuel injection.

395
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,842
Speaker 0: You do not have a carburetor in your car.

396
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,670
Speaker 0: old NASCAR actually still uses carburetors.

397
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,347
Speaker 0: it's why one of the reasons I hate NASCAR.

398
00:25:51,408 --> 00:26:01,996
Speaker 0: but Therefore if you are idling for even 30 seconds Like if you're stopping at someone's house like putting something on there like your UPS guy you stop you put something on their porch you Get back in the car.

399
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:03,890
Speaker 0: It's worth it to turn the engine off?

400
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,098
Speaker 1: Well, maybe not UPS guy because that's diesel.

401
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:09,590
Speaker 0: No, actually UPS themselves is why I said UPS guy.

402
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:16,796
Speaker 0: They did a study and they told all the UPS guys to turn off the trucks whenever they get out hot Damn, and they save money that way.

403
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,968
Speaker 0: They also make only right turns when whenever possible.

404
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:20,390
Speaker 0: I knew that.

405
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,357
Speaker 1: I think we talked about that.

406
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:22,908
Speaker 0: All right, here are some ways.

407
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:23,130
Speaker 0: now.

408
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:26,803
Speaker 0: Those are the factors that people thought were significant to fuel mileage, but are not.

409
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:28,770
Speaker 0: here are the significant factors.

410
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:28,971
Speaker 0: What?

411
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:30,374
Speaker 0: pretty much there's only two.

412
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:35,850
Speaker 0: you can save about like seven percent or so using your cruise control.

413
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,158
Speaker 0: Cruise control saves you money on the highway number.

414
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:46,075
Speaker 0: two, if your tires are properly inflated that's gonna save you something Reducing weight in your car.

415
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:53,365
Speaker 0: if you take the golf clubs out of the back out of the trunk when you're not going golfing That's gonna save you in the long run because you have less weight in your car.

416
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:57,399
Speaker 0: that that's actually a factor But the most significant factor by far.

417
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,445
Speaker 0: it can save you anywhere from 15 to 98 cents a gallon.

418
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,310
Speaker 0: It's just don't go too fucking fast.

419
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 0: I mean, we're always talking about how speed limits are bullshit and in when it comes to safety versus Towns trying to rob people from out of town to support their local governments.

420
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:15,330
Speaker 0: Yes speed limits are bullshit.

421
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:26,433
Speaker 0: However, it's absolutely true that if you were to drive your car say 85 90 miles an hour on the highway all the time that would use a lot more gas because your car is not very Aerodynamic.

422
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:30,167
Speaker 1: Yep, it depends really on exactly what kind of car it does transmission.

423
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,050
Speaker 1: What kind of engine?

424
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you had a Ferrari you could probably go eight.

425
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:46,970
Speaker 0: I mean the Ferrari doesn't have good gas mileage to begin with but going 85 in the aerodynamic Ferrari or Lotus Eliz a is Not going to hurt the overall gas mileage of the car compared to what the car gets for gas mileage with his giant v8 engine.

426
00:27:47,010 --> 00:28:00,018
Speaker 1: well my current car and Obviously I keep track of my gas mileage I get the best gas mileage at about 74 miles an hour like just under 75 is when I get Absolute optimal gas mileage.

427
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:07,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not really sure where my car gets optimal gas mileage It's a little hard to tell mostly because I didn't keep perfect track.

428
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:20,350
Speaker 0: I kept semi track but like between 65 and 75 somewhere around there It's mostly the RPMs that I look at, you know If I keep it around between 2,000 to 3,000 RPMs, I can get the most out of the car all the time.

429
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to be in that good power band.

430
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:30,686
Speaker 1: Yep Things of the day.

431
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:34,000
Speaker 1: this was on dig and I'd saw it for a while.

432
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:35,252
Speaker 1: People are posting.

433
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:38,958
Speaker 1: that is really old But I don't care because it's new to me and I think it's new to a lot of people.

434
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:43,262
Speaker 1: It's a video called Mother's Day picture Rofl.

435
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:44,449
Speaker 1: the tea is silence.

436
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:45,113
Speaker 0: Oh, yep.

437
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,180
Speaker 0: That one's new to me also.

438
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:56,580
Speaker 1: Well, uh, I ignored it for a while because it didn't look like it was gonna be something funny And it didn't really get super dug up or anything, but we eventually clicked on it because there was really nothing on dig yesterday.

439
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:57,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like.

440
00:28:57,894 --> 00:29:03,340
Speaker 0: this is a video I probably never would have clicked on in my entire life and I just really didn't care about a Mother's Day picture.

441
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,288
Speaker 0: It looked like some stupid thing two guys put together.

442
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:06,970
Speaker 0: That wasn't funny.

443
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,103
Speaker 0: So I just ignored it, but we're so bored We clicked on it.

444
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:16,200
Speaker 1: Anyway, well it not only met expectations but far exceeded them and I did Rofl.

445
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:21,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not the funniest thing ever but it was pretty funny and I didn't expect it to be funny at all.

446
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,400
Speaker 0: So the win for them can't ruin anything.

447
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:30,919
Speaker 1: But suffice to say the moment the first instance where he just punches the other guy in the nipple That is that is when I just started cracking up.

448
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:32,725
Speaker 0: It's a good video.

449
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:33,348
Speaker 0: You should watch it.

450
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:33,749
Speaker 0: It's funny.

451
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't say more without ruining the joke.

452
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,445
Speaker 0: Alright now a while ago.

453
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:46,246
Speaker 0: I think rim had a thing of the day which was the algorithm dance, which is a dance from a Pitaka rasui G. Yes.

454
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:52,280
Speaker 0: So this is a video of also the algorithm dance, but It's not.

455
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:55,900
Speaker 0: It's not from the TV show where they're doing the algorithm dance.

456
00:29:56,341 --> 00:30:13,360
Speaker 1: This is from a prison in the Philippines where they have a record breaking performance of The algorithm dance by the prisoners, you know I was talking a lot about my top 10 and top 15 list in the rant at the beginning of this Filipino prison.

457
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,371
Speaker 1: Real-high on my do not want to be list.

458
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:18,194
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

459
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,980
Speaker 0: I definitely don't want to be in the Filipino prison.

460
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:33,539
Speaker 0: However, it seems to me like the Filipino prison actually from this video alone, which isn't much to judge by Seems to be a lot better than the American prison, which I imagine is full of just lots of rape in the.

461
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,064
Speaker 1: well Here's the problem.

462
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:38,840
Speaker 1: My knowledge of American prison comes from a lot of documentaries.

463
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:47,469
Speaker 1: So I actually have real knowledge, but to be more silly my media knowledge comes from Oz Mostly and that prison comics I picked up at mocha.

464
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,335
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that was good one.

465
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what I got about that.

466
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,622
Speaker 0: You know that.

467
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:52,123
Speaker 1: you know what?

468
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:52,525
Speaker 1: I like.

469
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:53,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got it somewhere.

470
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:55,013
Speaker 1: You know, I like more than killing people.

471
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:59,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing stab Except maybe biscuits.

472
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:01,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, this video has no shivs.

473
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,687
Speaker 1: I was really expecting a shiv, you know The part where they swing left and right.

474
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:07,240
Speaker 1: I was just waiting for one person to just have a shiv in his hand.

475
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:17,876
Speaker 0: It seems to me like they run those prisons a lot like military detention centers Like they have these guys lined up and following orders and stuff, which is an American prisons.

476
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,984
Speaker 0: I don't think that's how it goes Prisons not so bad.

477
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, it's shanker be shanked.

478
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:31,394
Speaker 1: Of course, but you can make sangria in the toilet All right, I'm aware it was out of order.

479
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,191
Speaker 0: yes, I know All right, so we couldn't figure out what to do today.

480
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,255
Speaker 0: well, we have a couple.

481
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:37,480
Speaker 0: good we had a bunch of ideas.

482
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:40,319
Speaker 1: We have to crab people's just because we went so long on.

483
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,525
Speaker 1: You know the opening bit.

484
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,954
Speaker 1: Yes that we wouldn't do either those ideas justice.

485
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:45,757
Speaker 1: We're holding off off on him.

486
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,559
Speaker 1: Also that new computer is just looking at me.

487
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's already late here much later than I thought because rim has caused me great delays today.

488
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:01,946
Speaker 0: Well partly because we were playing out the Cold War again and building a computer and we spent a lot of time in between The two halves of the show and whatever.

489
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:06,905
Speaker 0: Oh, so I said I did remember last week I promised that we were gonna.

490
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:12,080
Speaker 0: I asked for listeners suggestions and listeners gave suggestions on what to do on Thursday night.

491
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:20,911
Speaker 0: So I said last week since we asked for the suggestions whether we think they're good or bad We're gonna do them anyway, because you asked for them.

492
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,176
Speaker 0: So if they suck it's your fault.

493
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:27,309
Speaker 0: Well, I Realized today that you really suck Is?

494
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:37,299
Speaker 1: I think the interesting thing is that we get a lot of ideas from email a lot in the forums and Most of the things people suggest are the same thing over and over again.

495
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:39,579
Speaker 1: You know many people say do an episode on food.

496
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:42,293
Speaker 0: We've already done like two episodes on food.

497
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:47,520
Speaker 1: you realize there was a time When every Thursday we ended up talking about food for a while because we had nothing better.

498
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:54,080
Speaker 1: We got our friend Adam on the show and we literally made the show about food because he happened to have a funny food anecdote.

499
00:32:54,484 --> 00:33:01,197
Speaker 0: Yep, and The other thing is people give ideas for shows that are so generic and broad.

500
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:02,260
Speaker 0: It's like what do we say?

501
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:03,550
Speaker 0: It's like you do a show about food.

502
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 0: What do we say about?

503
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:08,171
Speaker 0: There's a whole TV network about food.

504
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:09,376
Speaker 0: There's a lot to say.

505
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:13,273
Speaker 0: last week It was actually kind of okay because the guy had specific questions.

506
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:14,660
Speaker 0: He had a whole episode outlined.

507
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:23,140
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't really, you know, really cohesive with a central idea But it was a show that was doable because there were questions and I answered them.

508
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,771
Speaker 0: There were specific discussion topics, which we could discuss.

509
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,436
Speaker 0: and how do you discuss?

510
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,686
Speaker 0: Alright, someone says food Discuss.

511
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:32,094
Speaker 0: what the fuck do you say?

512
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:41,748
Speaker 1: Well, I mean maybe they're assuming to play devil's advocate here that we're so awesome that we would take their seat of an idea and Create from it a more specific idea.

513
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:42,531
Speaker 0: if I could do that.

514
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:43,856
Speaker 0: I wouldn't need your suggestion.

515
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:45,040
Speaker 0: I can think of food also.

516
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,502
Speaker 0: Thanks.

517
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:46,465
Speaker 1: Oh, can you now?

518
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:46,907
Speaker 1: Yes.

519
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:48,191
Speaker 1: I just thought how can you prove it?

520
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,918
Speaker 1: Because you've the wells been taint.

521
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:50,520
Speaker 0: I find you ready.

522
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,342
Speaker 0: I'll do another one.

523
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,408
Speaker 0: You ready sleep discuss.

524
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,691
Speaker 1: I like it.

525
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:55,292
Speaker 0: I like it.

526
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,516
Speaker 1: Also, I don't get enough.

527
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:59,525
Speaker 0: No, I never have Nope the end.

528
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:03,400
Speaker 0: So I just came up with actually a great idea for a show.

529
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:09,780
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read all these ideas for shows that we're not gonna do and tell you why.

530
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,587
Speaker 0: Let's start at the bottom here.

531
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:13,149
Speaker 0: Let's see.

532
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:14,475
Speaker 0: I gotta find an idea.

533
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:18,628
Speaker 0: Oh, okay Ebbe in the forum says so.

534
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:21,840
Speaker 0: I searched the front page for ninjas and nothing pulled up oddly enough.

535
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:26,337
Speaker 0: So unless I screwed up you guys really need to do a podcast about ninjas in all caps.

536
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:27,199
Speaker 1: All right one.

537
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:31,340
Speaker 1: We've already made it very clear that we're on the side of pirates.

538
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,125
Speaker 0: That is quite obvious.

539
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:36,434
Speaker 0: If you haven't noticed our talk like a pirate day episode.

540
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:37,978
Speaker 0: We really are pirate fans.

541
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:40,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't do walk like a ninja day.

542
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:41,643
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

543
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:52,120
Speaker 1: however back when I DJ that rit anime club the pirate ninja thing I was in fact DJ plunder if you can't figure out what kind of DJ I was.

544
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:58,460
Speaker 0: Also, I don't think I've ever dressed up as a ninja yet I have dressed up as a pirate quite often.

545
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:01,844
Speaker 0: I own many articles of pirate Costumery.

546
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:10,116
Speaker 1: I dressed up as a ninja when I was in middle school And in fact, I bought my ninja outfit from an actual well not my like.

547
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:15,100
Speaker 1: it wasn't a ninja outfit But I bought actual karate clothes from some karate place.

548
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,660
Speaker 1: It wasn't really probably a real karate place, but it was one of those McDowjoes.

549
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:30,820
Speaker 1: But I bought of all the stuff there And then I went somewhere else and I bought Basically the thing that you would expect a bank robber to wear and I put it over my face and I became a ninja.

550
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:41,520
Speaker 1: I'm still laughing about my dojo and I had two Real shuriken shuriken shuriken that I immediately lost throwing them at things.

551
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, I threw one at a tree.

552
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,019
Speaker 1: it bounced off the tree bounced into the bushes never saw it again.

553
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,366
Speaker 1: Later, I was out in the woods.

554
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:53,760
Speaker 1: I threw one at a piece of wood and it fell to the ground in the leaves.

555
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,594
Speaker 1: I never found it again.

556
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,418
Speaker 1: Lost him both within the span of a week.

557
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:00,900
Speaker 0: So ninjas is not something we can really do a whole show on.

558
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:07,505
Speaker 0: Keep saying the word McDowjoe over and over again and laughing I use that word kind of often I don't know.

559
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:12,291
Speaker 0: I haven't heard it and like it's a word I knew but it didn't Come around in a while.

560
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:13,138
Speaker 0: So it's funny again.

561
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:14,583
Speaker 0: All right.

562
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:15,769
Speaker 0: Let's scroll up a little bit.

563
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:27,789
Speaker 1: I also owned a pair of nunchucks And I would like to point out that the number of times I hit my target with them was fewer than the number of times I hit myself in the nuts.

564
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,466
Speaker 1: I Threw them away There.

565
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,579
Speaker 1: that was the ninja episode.

566
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 0: all right HMTK Steve says how about doing a show on the whole carbonated beverages hurt me thing?

567
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,410
Speaker 1: Uh, very simply that's just one of Scott's quirks.

568
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:46,257
Speaker 1: There's nothing more I can say about that.

569
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:46,840
Speaker 1: on my end.

570
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:49,268
Speaker 0: I don't like to drink carbonated beverages.

571
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:50,793
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel good.

572
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:53,521
Speaker 0: If you want to force me to do it It's not like.

573
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:57,153
Speaker 0: I'm afraid I'll drink one because I just don't like to.

574
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:57,895
Speaker 0: so why should I?

575
00:36:57,976 --> 00:37:01,787
Speaker 1: I'll point out that while Scott Very clearly refuses to drink alcohol ever.

576
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,576
Speaker 1: He did try that hobo wine.

577
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,963
Speaker 0: I did try the hobo wine I'll you know, it's like.

578
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:09,491
Speaker 1: he also tried a spoonful of rum once.

579
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,676
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not like I'm afraid to death It's I don't enjoy it.

580
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,647
Speaker 0: So I don't do it intentionally.

581
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:18,920
Speaker 1: and he said if I ever actually make it he'll at least try a sip of grog.

582
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:22,580
Speaker 0: But I haven't gotten around to trying to make just to know what it tastes like cuz it's grog.

583
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said we're on the side of the pirates.

584
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:32,337
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, he also says what about a show on landing tech jobs and what sort of salary you should request and/or expect?

585
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:35,910
Speaker 1: hello Thursday Ideas, well, did he do that in a Thursday thread?

586
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,411
Speaker 1: Yes.

587
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:38,620
Speaker 1: Oh, ah, man, you were so close.

588
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,610
Speaker 0: All right, Wally B man Thursday show idea.

589
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,400
Speaker 0: How about a how not to suck at cooking?

590
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:48,885
Speaker 0: well, that's a little more specific than the Food idea.

591
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,271
Speaker 1: I think I can answer though.

592
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,300
Speaker 1: You could probably also answer why we're not doing this.

593
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,980
Speaker 1: I think the answer is we suck at cooking.

594
00:37:55,321 --> 00:38:01,260
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I don't suck at cooking as badly as people who make TV dinners and they can only cook ramen and maybe an egg.

595
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:09,517
Speaker 0: But then again, I'm not good enough at cooking to where I'd ever consider Thinking that I have the right to tell anyone else how to do it.

596
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:15,296
Speaker 0: most often I ask other people how to cook and I would probably like a cooking podcast.

597
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:16,360
Speaker 0: Maybe I should look into that.

598
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:18,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.

599
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:26,860
Speaker 0: So you didn't give me a Thursday show idea, but you gave me a go downstairs and look for cooking podcast idea.

600
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:36,320
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we're only proficient between the two of us and cooking maybe 20 or so like actual dishes and Beyond that it's trial and error.

601
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:42,940
Speaker 0: Yep Beyond that while the B man goes on to say start off simple with a grilled cheese then maybe spice it up with a deluxe.

602
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,007
Speaker 0: All right, I'm gonna.

603
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:45,639
Speaker 0: anyone can make a grilled cheese.

604
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,310
Speaker 0: When I was in Boy Scouts they made an awesome grilled cheese.

605
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:52,499
Speaker 0: damn now, I'm gonna have to go make one or four.

606
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:52,539
Speaker 0: I

607
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:04,115
Speaker 1: Eat grilled cheese quite a bit and people have actually more than one person has told me on more than one occasion I make a pretty damn good grilled cheese and I'm gonna let you all in on the secret because it's not that hard to make a good grilled cheese.

608
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:12,117
Speaker 1: number one if you think that a Microwave is in any way involved in making a grilled cheese sandwich kill yourself because you're wrong.

609
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:15,514
Speaker 0: one time My friend's mom made me a grilled cheese with a microwave.

610
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:16,700
Speaker 0: It was mushy and disgusting.

611
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,479
Speaker 1: Number two use a teflon nonstick pan.

612
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:29,008
Speaker 0: Number three unless you have a real grill like at a burger joint where it's a big flat hot piece of metal Yeah, which is basically a similar thing.

613
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:30,031
Speaker 1: I mean has the same effect.

614
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:30,292
Speaker 1: Yes.

615
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:32,220
Speaker 0: You want a big flat hot piece of metal.

616
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,206
Speaker 1: That's all you want.

617
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,459
Speaker 1: Don't try to use one of those sandwich making machines.

618
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:41,700
Speaker 0: Well, if you have the garlic cheese presser thingy not it's not some sort of you know electronic device or anything.

619
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,445
Speaker 0: It's just a clamp.

620
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:53,559
Speaker 0: If you have the grill to hide the clamps You want me to use these clamps the clamps that I. yes If you have the grilled cheese clamp, you can use it and I actually prefer the grilled cheese clamp method But it's not necessary.

621
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:56,211
Speaker 1: So here's what you do make the pan hot.

622
00:39:56,572 --> 00:40:05,229
Speaker 1: hot enough to where the butter will go When you put it on but it won't burn but not hot enough to where the butter will turn brown Before you can put the bread on.

623
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:07,519
Speaker 0: also it has to be hot enough to melt cheese.

624
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:10,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but luckily you can get around that really quickly.

625
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:16,397
Speaker 1: The best way to tell is if you sprinkle water on it Does the water bubble up and go pretty quickly?

626
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,361
Speaker 1: if so You're ready.

627
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,526
Speaker 1: take a stick of butter.

628
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:21,016
Speaker 1: go all over the pan to make a nice pool of butter.

629
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:22,120
Speaker 0: also go all over the bread.

630
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:23,328
Speaker 1: No, see I don't do that.

631
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,759
Speaker 0: I see I put the butter on the bread.

632
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:26,389
Speaker 1: See, you know, I you don't want to do that.

633
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,999
Speaker 0: Usually I like to do it that way.

634
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:32,079
Speaker 1: You just put it on the in the thing and let it melt and then you drop a piece of bread on it.

635
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:35,900
Speaker 1: Then you drop either one or two slices of cheese to pay anyone good cheese.

636
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,047
Speaker 1: Don't use American cheese.

637
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,193
Speaker 1: use any other cheese.

638
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:39,420
Speaker 0: American cheese is okay.

639
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:42,470
Speaker 0: I actually if you're gonna use American cheese, don't use Kraft singles.

640
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,199
Speaker 0: get like slices of nice American for the deli.

641
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:55,239
Speaker 1: I particularly recommend Monterey Jack for grilled cheese sandwiches because it's good and it has some flavor But yet it's not so flavorful that you can't do other things to the grilled cheese.

642
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,540
Speaker 0: now Here's the really all about the melting point of the cheese.

643
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,915
Speaker 0: You don't want to use a cheese that's all mushy and you don't want to use a cheese that won't melt.

644
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:04,797
Speaker 1: you got your looks Really works really really well to yeah munchy cheese also works.

645
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,832
Speaker 1: Yep So then you then you put the piece of cheese on.

646
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:09,480
Speaker 1: now the critical part.

647
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:13,612
Speaker 1: I always sprinkle a little bit of dill in there on the cheese.

648
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:21,095
Speaker 1: Oh you just adding your shitty cheese and Dill and sometimes a dash of oregano on the outside when it's almost done.

649
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,720
Speaker 0: No, I really know it's just a tiny day.

650
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,469
Speaker 0: It acts it works pretty well.

651
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:26,600
Speaker 0: I like butter cheese and bread toasted.

652
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,660
Speaker 1: So anyway, you got the cheese on don't put the other piece of bread on yet.

653
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:39,360
Speaker 1: Now what you do is you take a small cup of water and you take a pelt the lid to your pan and you Dump a little bit of water in the pan and then you cover it.

654
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,351
Speaker 0: So, you know don't put the water too close to the bread.

655
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:42,135
Speaker 1: Don't get the water wet.

656
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:42,900
Speaker 1: Don't get the bread wet.

657
00:41:43,142 --> 00:41:44,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's gonna ruin your grilled cheese sandwich.

658
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:45,500
Speaker 0: It'll make it all mushy.

659
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,440
Speaker 0: You want to put the water far away from the bread?

660
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:59,040
Speaker 0: But you want it to steam and then you put the lid on and it keeps the steam Around the bread and in the pan under the lid so it can melt the cheese But it doesn't make your bread soggy unless you do a whole lot of water.

661
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,897
Speaker 1: So see you're grilling the bread and now you've melted the cheese.

662
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:11,274
Speaker 1: now Put the third the piece of bread on top pick the grilled cheese up Melt more butter into the pan quickly and then put it upside down on the.

663
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:16,080
Speaker 0: if you would have just put butter on the bread In the first place you wouldn't have to do the quick butter melting in the pan business.

664
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,980
Speaker 0: Plus you could then butter both sides of the bread instead of just one side.

665
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:20,626
Speaker 1: You're only supposed to butter one side.

666
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:22,011
Speaker 0: butter both sides of the bread.

667
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:24,240
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to do that in a grilled cheese.

668
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:25,344
Speaker 0: It's the way to go.

669
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:27,591
Speaker 1: hi, I think your grilled cheeses are pretty nasty.

670
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:33,719
Speaker 0: then butter is the best anyway, yeah Oh, obviously, you can see why a whole episode cannot be done about food by us.

671
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:38,079
Speaker 1: Well, it could because we could probably go on arguing about how to make a grilled cheese for another 20 minutes.

672
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:39,636
Speaker 0: But all right, here we go.

673
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,367
Speaker 0: Next idea HMTK Steve again.

674
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:45,697
Speaker 0: He says after reading Hungry Joe's post about old toys.

675
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:50,072
Speaker 0: I think the dynamic duo I guess that's us should do a show on toys from their childhood.

676
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:50,955
Speaker 0: We did.

677
00:42:51,316 --> 00:42:52,360
Speaker 0: we did do that episode.

678
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:55,007
Speaker 1: It's one of our most popular episodes ever.

679
00:42:55,047 --> 00:43:00,463
Speaker 1: it gets downloaded constantly to this day and it's an old shitty episode - yeah We did it.

680
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:01,567
Speaker 1: We just say the same thing.

681
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:08,980
Speaker 0: so duplicate and a hitman heart says Star Wars and Star Trek seem to be obvious topics or a general non anime movie show.

682
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:10,467
Speaker 1: I'd like to talk about it.

683
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,798
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't know anything about nor does he like Star Trek.

684
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:15,434
Speaker 0: nope I do not like Star Trek and I know very little about it.

685
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:16,420
Speaker 1: and Star Wars.

686
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,524
Speaker 1: I think we did an episode.

687
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,010
Speaker 0: did we do an episode in Star Wars?

688
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,700
Speaker 1: if we didn't then we will and thanks for the suggestions.

689
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:27,603
Speaker 0: Not much to say about Star Wars other than we really like Star Wars and we think the same things about it that most Other people see.

690
00:43:27,684 --> 00:43:28,145
Speaker 1: I disagree.

691
00:43:28,186 --> 00:43:30,596
Speaker 1: I think there's a lot to say about Star Wars like what we.

692
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:33,311
Speaker 1: I would talk a lot about Why I liked it and the scenes I like.

693
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,035
Speaker 1: the things I like.

694
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:34,740
Speaker 0: Vader is awesome.

695
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,409
Speaker 0: X-wings and TIE fighters are awesome.

696
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,214
Speaker 0: The Emperor's awesome.

697
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,842
Speaker 1: I talk about the aesthetics I like.

698
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:44,596
Speaker 1: I talked about how much or little of a an effect George Lucas probably actually had.

699
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:48,918
Speaker 1: I talked about the new Episodes and why I think they failed compared to the older ones.

700
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:53,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could do a show by myself for at least a couple hours about Star Wars.

701
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:57,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's also still sort of a too general a topic.

702
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,940
Speaker 0: It's like are we gonna talk about the books and the comics and the movies and the TV shows?

703
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,330
Speaker 1: And we could be an overview of the Star Wars universe.

704
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:06,360
Speaker 0: We could have like a whole Star Wars podcast.

705
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,626
Speaker 0: It's not a Thursday show.

706
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:08,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

707
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,520
Speaker 1: I think it would have been a good Thursday, but Scott was now on it.

708
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was only Scott.

709
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:13,373
Speaker 1: I thought it was cool.

710
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:14,840
Speaker 0: Star Wars is too big an idea.

711
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:17,820
Speaker 1: I was ready to do the Star Wars episode anyway.

712
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:21,039
Speaker 0: Any or a general non anime movie show.

713
00:44:22,004 --> 00:44:29,959
Speaker 1: You realize for the first I don't know like five months of geek nights We always defaulted to do in Thursday about whatever movie we just watch.

714
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:38,200
Speaker 0: Also lately we really kind of stopped watching Movies besides anime movies and even then there's not so many anime movies granted.

715
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:46,259
Speaker 1: The only reason is that we haven't had time and once the Netflix queue goes off the anime that we've been getting to review We're gonna see a bunch of movies again.

716
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:48,660
Speaker 0: It's just I think mostly lately.

717
00:44:48,780 --> 00:45:01,960
Speaker 0: There are just too many anime fan subs and we only really have time to watch things in like small blocks as opposed to big Hour blocks to you know and such and also we tend to do some up to do something else instead of watch something.

718
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,480
Speaker 0: We'll always play a game or make something or podcast instead of watching a movie if we have the option.

719
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:13,800
Speaker 0: Okay, I was thinking a Thursday show talking about strange interesting foods.

720
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:23,600
Speaker 0: You guys have eaten again with the food again with the food Although the topic is a little more specific, but it's also broad because we eat lots of strange and interesting foods.

721
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:33,979
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is very little of what I eat is interesting to me because like all that like the dim sum breakfast A lot of that stuff is really weird to a lot of people but to me, it's just food that I like.

722
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:36,856
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the line is in terms of interesting.

723
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:41,675
Speaker 0: Oh rim I think you also purposefully eat a lot of foods that just not many other people eat.

724
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:42,980
Speaker 1: Why like why?

725
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:45,632
Speaker 0: You're always like what you just talked yesterday about.

726
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:47,180
Speaker 0: you ate the pet but ten.

727
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:48,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what cuz?

728
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:52,160
Speaker 1: I'd never had it before and I finally had it and it's fucking awesome.

729
00:45:52,341 --> 00:46:02,656
Speaker 0: I didn't say it wasn't but I'm saying you intentionally seem to go out of your way to try all kinds of foods Especially if you think or if they are unpopular in the first part, I won't disagree with.

730
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:04,402
Speaker 1: I do like to try all sorts of Different foods.

731
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:12,750
Speaker 1: I'll try just about any food once because I'm curious about it and I've discovered a lot of good foods that way I don't see any backing for the second part at all.

732
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,939
Speaker 0: is all your favorite foods are unpopular in America?

733
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:18,040
Speaker 1: food What are my favorite food Scott?

734
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,366
Speaker 0: See what does rim really like?

735
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:26,139
Speaker 1: because I can tell you what one of my fav my favorite white castle White Castle is pretty popular.

736
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:29,150
Speaker 0: White Castle is not so popular sides.

737
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:30,836
Speaker 1: I really like White Castle.

738
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:31,800
Speaker 1: What's wrong with that?

739
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:38,257
Speaker 1: You're saying that somehow I like White Castle because it's rare or because other people don't I?

740
00:46:38,277 --> 00:46:42,451
Speaker 0: just one of the things you like My favorite meal is raw red meat.

741
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:43,897
Speaker 0: How is that weird?

742
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:44,620
Speaker 1: How is that?

743
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,447
Speaker 0: Special because most people don't get it.

744
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:51,639
Speaker 0: So raw that's only thing, you know, you always but as it tastes better raw.

745
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:52,948
Speaker 1: That's the only reason.

746
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,953
Speaker 1: if I didn't like the taste of it raw I wouldn't waste my 20 bucks on a steak getting it raw.

747
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:58,515
Speaker 1: I'd get it cooked.

748
00:46:58,535 --> 00:46:59,499
Speaker 1: However, it tastes the best.

749
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:03,940
Speaker 0: Last week you had to cook pretty raw and then you put it back on there.

750
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:06,160
Speaker 1: Actually, I cut it in half.

751
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:11,359
Speaker 1: I ate half of it raw and I cooked the other half to be rare because I wanted to have both.

752
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:16,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, always and they know you're putting your dill on your grilled cheese to make it weird.

753
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:16,740
Speaker 0: No one does that.

754
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,993
Speaker 1: Actually, you know how I learned to put dill on my grilled cheese from the dill bottle.

755
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:23,480
Speaker 1: the bottle of dill had some suggestions on it.

756
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:30,186
Speaker 1: It said like what dill is used for and I also looked on some recipe sites and it says that dill is really good on Pork and anything with pork.

757
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:35,045
Speaker 1: It's really good to be mixed with cheeses and any cheese dish Grilled cheese.

758
00:47:35,146 --> 00:47:37,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I started putting it on grilled cheese and it's really good.

759
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,789
Speaker 1: Dill is also really good in omelettes and scrambled eggs.

760
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,156
Speaker 0: You just put all sorts of it's like.

761
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:45,102
Speaker 0: you can't eat something Just plain.

762
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:49,100
Speaker 0: you always got to reach for that spice box and put all sorts of crap on all sorts of crap.

763
00:47:49,221 --> 00:47:50,890
Speaker 1: I put dill on my grilled cheese.

764
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:52,559
Speaker 0: you do lots of stuff like what?

765
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,190
Speaker 0: Whenever you cook anything you like just throw so much crap.

766
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:56,632
Speaker 1: when?

767
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:58,940
Speaker 1: what do I put in there when I make sauce?

768
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,679
Speaker 1: Sometimes I put a bunch of paprika in to make it spicier.

769
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:04,207
Speaker 0: You do lots of stuff like what.

770
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:07,960
Speaker 0: whenever you cook there's always ends up like being four or five spices out.

771
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:11,039
Speaker 0: You buy like all kinds of spices that I would never even think of using.

772
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:11,260
Speaker 0: never.

773
00:48:11,341 --> 00:48:13,520
Speaker 1: I haven't bought spices in over a year.

774
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,109
Speaker 0: You just keep using the ones you already bought.

775
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:17,060
Speaker 1: cuz I bought all the spices I use.

776
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:18,405
Speaker 0: Yeah You use a lot of spices.

777
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:20,860
Speaker 1: so I'm saying but I haven't run out of any of them.

778
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,612
Speaker 1: The only one we ran out of we didn't actually run out of.

779
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:25,419
Speaker 1: we just lost it and then we found it later.

780
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:27,906
Speaker 0: Anyway, you're not.

781
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:30,639
Speaker 1: I don't see where you're coming from with this.

782
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,279
Speaker 0: You spice up your food so much and you feel like ketchup on your eggs supposed to put ketchup on a.

783
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:37,902
Speaker 1: no You're not.

784
00:48:38,062 --> 00:48:39,788
Speaker 1: you realize more Americans do than don't.

785
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,117
Speaker 0: yeah, there are most Americans who don't.

786
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,020
Speaker 1: oh, okay?

787
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:47,040
Speaker 1: Anyway besides you're the one who makes the McDonald's egg.

788
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,768
Speaker 1: I make an omelet, and you know I make it like.

789
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:54,353
Speaker 0: I don't make an omelet when I make an omelet We would never was the last day made an omelet the last time.

790
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:54,855
Speaker 1: I made an omelet.

791
00:48:54,875 --> 00:49:04,254
Speaker 1: I failed yeah Last time before that a few months ago, and I made an omelet with onion I don't think so and some slightly stale taco cheese.

792
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:05,640
Speaker 0: Who ended this happen?

793
00:49:06,683 --> 00:49:12,297
Speaker 0: You realize I get home before you every day Yeah, so you could just make up any story, and then I supposed to assume.

794
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:12,740
Speaker 0: That's true.

795
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,430
Speaker 1: So now I mean if we don't have any food eat, and I'm hungry.

796
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,820
Speaker 1: I make some eggs or something.

797
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:22,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so let's keep going up this list of ideas.

798
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:23,640
Speaker 0: how much time do we have left in this crazy?

799
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,616
Speaker 0: We can stop any time good God, so we'll only do a couple more of these ideas.

800
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:28,479
Speaker 1: We should stop now.

801
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:30,174
Speaker 0: Well, I'll do one more.

802
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:32,154
Speaker 1: uh All right, it's all.

803
00:49:32,174 --> 00:49:38,720
Speaker 1: you Antitrust laws all right that would be a topic that require a lot of research and a lot of effort.

804
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,126
Speaker 0: And what do I know about any trust laws?

805
00:49:40,346 --> 00:49:41,672
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to be a monopoly.

806
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,680
Speaker 1: um I know quite a bit.

807
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:52,278
Speaker 1: I could talk about the history of antitrust laws and all the things that start you know during the Industrial Revolution and the oil industry.

808
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:59,799
Speaker 0: and Yeah, yeah Rockefeller and all them, but even so Requires a lot of research.

809
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:01,968
Speaker 0: What do we know about any trust laws?

810
00:50:02,028 --> 00:50:02,470
Speaker 0: that you know.

811
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,253
Speaker 0: it's more of a sudden.

812
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:05,080
Speaker 0: economist would know so we'd have to research it.

813
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,791
Speaker 1: Well, I know about the history of them, but that's just because I took.

814
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:12,047
Speaker 1: you know basic high school Civics and basic high school history.

815
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:13,994
Speaker 0: yeah, but it's like it's also.

816
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:16,221
Speaker 0: This is another too broad an idea You got.

817
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:21,817
Speaker 0: it's got to be more specific like history of antitrust laws, or what are the antitrust laws?

818
00:50:21,997 --> 00:50:22,920
Speaker 0: or recent?

819
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:25,825
Speaker 0: Antitrust Infractions like we could talk about.

820
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:27,935
Speaker 0: we could do a whole show on Microsoft's antitrust.

821
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:28,518
Speaker 0: That's a Monday.

822
00:50:28,618 --> 00:50:31,519
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I'm just saying in general you know that's I don't know.

823
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,160
Speaker 1: I think you're asking too much of these people.

824
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,673
Speaker 1: I mean they just need to give us a seed idea and then we go from there.

825
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,723
Speaker 1: we can pick what direction we want to Go with the idea.

826
00:50:38,224 --> 00:50:41,496
Speaker 0: It's true, but it just feels like going through these ideas.

827
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:46,812
Speaker 0: You know people submit them And we don't actually end up thinking up a better show to do.

828
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,420
Speaker 0: besides talk about all the ideas people came.

829
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,319
Speaker 1: That's just because all the ideas are food.

830
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:54,368
Speaker 1: Don't ever suggest food.

831
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:55,876
Speaker 1: We're not gonna do food episodes.

832
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:56,520
