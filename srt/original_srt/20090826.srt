1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,447
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday August 26th.

2
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:12,572
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:13,174
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,499
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,380
Speaker 0: Tonight we review and then do some final thoughts on Bocurano.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,592
Speaker 0: I actually had a pleasant surprise coming out of work today for lunch.

8
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:35,480
Speaker 0: I wander over to Brian Park.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,439
Speaker 0: You know, gonna get me some French lunch.

10
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,726
Speaker 1: And there's this crazy crowd.

11
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,392
Speaker 0: Like I can't get anywhere near the restaurant.

12
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,440
Speaker 1: Is it Britney Spears like it was outside of my work?

13
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:44,779
Speaker 0: It's just crazy crowded.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,952
Speaker 0: There's all these people everywhere making rabble and walking around and taking pictures and in Brian Park there's some giant ESPN looking monstrosity.

15
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:54,700
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking god damn it.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,438
Speaker 0: I can't like lay on the grass have my nap like I usually do.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,628
Speaker 0: So I eat and then I walk over there.

18
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:04,331
Speaker 1: Wonder how much you have to pay the city to let them get the rights to put a monstrosity there for a day.

19
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,717
Speaker 0: I don't know but this summer.

20
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 0: They do it a lot.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
Speaker 0: Well this summer more so than any summer.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,160
Speaker 0: It seems like they have just been really milking it because the grass in Brian Park is fucked.

23
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,199
Speaker 1: I don't know why they just don't like put down some turf.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,920
Speaker 0: That would be terrible for when there isn't stuff there.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, but maybe you know if you're gonna have grass don't have the stuff.

26
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:24,540
Speaker 1: If you're gonna have stuff don't have the grass.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,603
Speaker 1: Make up your mind.

28
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,000
Speaker 1: Or have some sort of awesome like revolving floor.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,079
Speaker 1: It's like the grass faces down and there's some lamps under there.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,440
Speaker 1: And then the grass faces up when you don't need to put anything on it.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
Speaker 0: Hey, grow lights are expensive.

32
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,980
Speaker 1: But you're getting paid because all these people are paying to put their stuff there.

33
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,640
Speaker 0: What it ended up being was some promotion for DirecTV, US Open, whatever.

34
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,939
Speaker 1: But if you want to watch all the US Open matches get DirecTV.

35
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:53,840
Speaker 0: But what they set up were two tennis courts.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,106
Speaker 1: What material were they?

37
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,275
Speaker 1: composite clay or.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,952
Speaker 0: Composite clay.

39
00:01:58,973 --> 00:01:59,600
Speaker 0: I don't know.

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,917
Speaker 1: You don't know what color were they.

41
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,260
Speaker 0: You realize color is not an indicator unless you're playing a Nintendo game.

42
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:05,003
Speaker 1: I know.

43
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,914
Speaker 1: But they you know the clay.

44
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:07,940
Speaker 1: they usually leave it red.

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:08,844
Speaker 1: I don't know.

46
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,098
Speaker 1: It was a grass court.

47
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,228
Speaker 0: What do you care?

48
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,539
Speaker 0: You've never played tennis in your life.

49
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,899
Speaker 1: I want to see what kind of court it was.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Speaker 0: So what's the difference between, say, a clay court and a cement court?

51
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,420
Speaker 1: The way the ball bounces when it hits the ground.

52
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,868
Speaker 1: In what way?

53
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:23,559
Speaker 0: What's the difference?

54
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:24,905
Speaker 0: What are you going to?

55
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,800
Speaker 0: what's going to happen differently on a cement court?

56
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:28,773
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not cement.

57
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,240
Speaker 1: There's composite clay and grass.

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,881
Speaker 1: Grass.

59
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:38,600
Speaker 1: The ball is a lot slower when it bounces off the grass because it goes with the frictions in the grass.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Speaker 0: You realize that grass is cut really short, right?

61
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still, you know, it's a lot slower when it bounces off at you.

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,061
Speaker 0: I know.

63
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:48,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, anyway, it doesn't matter.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,340
Speaker 0: The point is what they had were a bunch of professional tennis players there and they played a whole bunch of exhibition matches.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,160
Speaker 0: So I saw Venus against someone and I saw the end of a match between two guys.

66
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,098
Speaker 0: I don't know who any of these tennis people are, so I can't really say who.

67
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,639
Speaker 0: But they were all big names and people are going crazy about it.

68
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,419
Speaker 0: And I was sitting like I was sitting in the front row.

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,380
Speaker 0: Somehow I just walked up.

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,459
Speaker 0: It was totally free and it was kind of cool.

71
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:13,650
Speaker 1: That's not fair.

72
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,440
Speaker 0: That was great.

73
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,780
Speaker 1: I had Britney Spears blocking my way out of the office two days ago.

74
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,120
Speaker 1: That's not like the opposite of good.

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,060
Speaker 0: I get back to work and people like, where you were, where were you?

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,785
Speaker 0: You took a long lunch.

77
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:24,738
Speaker 0: And I was like, yeah, I was just watching tennis.

78
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,280
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we don't need to go to the U.S.

79
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,562
Speaker 1: Open.

80
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:30,165
Speaker 0: Yeah.

81
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,823
Speaker 0: The thing is, they had a contest to win tickets, but I couldn't stick around and enter it.

82
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:33,869
Speaker 1: It's very it's.

83
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,171
Speaker 1: it's.

84
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,520
Speaker 1: it's real difficult to go to.

85
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:37,180
Speaker 0: No, it's really easy.

86
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,140
Speaker 0: That contest, they gave like four tickets away every hour.

87
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,480
Speaker 0: And you had to do a test of skill at tennis.

88
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:42,961
Speaker 0: No, no.

89
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 1: I mean, it's real hard to go to tennis and not not to win the tickets.

90
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,659
Speaker 0: So I show up and I give him my ticket and they let me in.

91
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,105
Speaker 1: It's not it's.

92
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:55,259
Speaker 0: it's, you know, if I have my ticket, I can go.

93
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,519
Speaker 1: You got to get there.

94
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,459
Speaker 0: What is there anywhere in the world where the U.S.

95
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,124
Speaker 0: Open would be?

96
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,540
Speaker 0: where I can't open is always in Queens.

97
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,079
Speaker 0: So so I can't get to Queens.

98
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,187
Speaker 1: You take the seven train.

99
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:09,180
Speaker 0: OK, so I don't see how this is a problem.

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,948
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's just it's.

101
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,059
Speaker 1: you got like all the different courts and you got to.

102
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

103
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:18,010
Speaker 1: You know, like you go into one court, but then you got you want to go out and go to the different court.

104
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,959
Speaker 1: It's like a situation.

105
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,503
Speaker 1: Yeah.

106
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,240
Speaker 1: So it's not like you go to a game.

107
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,125
Speaker 1: It starts, it ends.

108
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:22,669
Speaker 1: It's you know, there's.

109
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,520
Speaker 1: there's all these different matches being played and you got to go.

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,102
Speaker 0: All right.

111
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:29,220
Speaker 0: So I guess it's just impossible to watch tennis and you just never try.

112
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,820
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I just don't know how this is so difficult.

113
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,779
Speaker 1: It's not a direct thing like it is with, say, baseball's.

114
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:38,820
Speaker 0: So it's more like an anime con.

115
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,599
Speaker 0: I got to pick which panel room I want to be in.

116
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:42,418
Speaker 1: I guess depends what kind of ticket you have to.

117
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Speaker 1: You might have a ticket for like, you know, the shitty court early in the day.

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,888
Speaker 1: And then what are you going to do?

119
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:48,140
Speaker 0: I think it was some fancy ticket.

120
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,399
Speaker 0: One thing I noticed, though, this was what it was like.

121
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Speaker 0: It's weird now when I see public events that are not like geeky conventions because they're run in the same way, you know, professional people and they have like the staff check in and the staff badges and the volunteers, the emcee.

122
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,440
Speaker 0: And, you know, all sorts of events like that are all the same.

123
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,659
Speaker 0: But after going to PAX.

124
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:22,240
Speaker 0: Even the so-called real world, normal person, big business, you know, infinite money events like ESPN renting out the park in the middle of New York City are so janky and poorly put together.

125
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:25,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, PAX makes everything in the world look like shit.

126
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

127
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,278
Speaker 1: All right.

128
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,199
Speaker 1: So there's not a lot of news going down.

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,581
Speaker 0: What?

130
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:31,600
Speaker 0: No anime news?

131
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,324
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

132
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:38,180
Speaker 0: There's a vibrant and thriving anime industry in America and an equally powerful rising one in Japan.

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,503
Speaker 0: So because of that, there's also more irony in this room that I can deal with right now.

134
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,098
Speaker 0: Sarcasm is coming out.

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,979
Speaker 1: Irony and sarcasm are not the same thing, aren't they?

136
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,863
Speaker 1: No, but so because of that situation that the wonderful, awesome situation rim just described to you.

137
00:05:55,284 --> 00:06:01,260
Speaker 1: I'm just going to do a geek bite on Wednesdays until further notice of awesome news that is important.

138
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,083
Speaker 1: We're talking about.

139
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:08,000
Speaker 1: So this geek bite, I'm going to do one out of the ordinary, something, you know, I'm going to try to do things people don't realize.

140
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:08,863
Speaker 1: Right.

141
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,840
Speaker 1: So Marvel Comics, right.

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,580
Speaker 1: Their current outer space superhero stuff is mostly the Thor in it.

143
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,638
Speaker 0: What is their Thor?

144
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,320
Speaker 1: Thor is not in outer space.

145
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,047
Speaker 0: I don't care that.

146
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,180
Speaker 0: Wait, he's a god.

147
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,682
Speaker 0: How can he?

148
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,260
Speaker 1: He does go in outer space, but he's not a part of this story.

149
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:28,479
Speaker 0: So then why would I care?

150
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:29,564
Speaker 1: I don't know.

151
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,880
Speaker 1: You might not care, but other people might care.

152
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,584
Speaker 0: It's Thor.

153
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 1: OK, so Thor has his own book.

154
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:36,580
Speaker 1: If you want to read about Thor, get the Thor book.

155
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,320
Speaker 1: It's called Thor anyway.

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,120
Speaker 1: So there was a book called Annihilation and then there was a sequel Annihilation Conquest.

157
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,300
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of related books like Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy.

158
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:54,348
Speaker 1: And there was a Thanos book that sort of started off way back, you know, like in the early 2000s.

159
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,460
Speaker 1: I have that actually.

160
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,960
Speaker 1: But anyway, these are all the Marvel outer space stuff.

161
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,279
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's really good.

162
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 1: It's done by these guys, Abnett and Lanning, who don't get enough respect.

163
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:18,460
Speaker 1: And anyway, the thing is, because a lot of these characters that are in these books, people who just start reading comics now might not know who all of them are, even though I know who they are, because I read these same shitty books.

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,206
Speaker 1: And I was a kid.

165
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:39,680
Speaker 1: They came out with a book called Annihilation Classic that basically has a bunch of origin stories for a bunch of the characters that are in Annihilation and Guardians of the Galaxy and such so that, you know, if you are reading Annihilation now and digging it, you can read the old 70s and 80s comics and one 90s comic that sort of got the ball rolling.

166
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:49,738
Speaker 0: One thing I do like, even when it's a comic that is not my alley, whenever they remake something, I love to read the original and the new one just to see, you know, what they drew, what they didn't and where it came from.

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,181
Speaker 0: Yep.

168
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,912
Speaker 1: So I'm reading this and it's got like.

169
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,710
Speaker 1: it's got the origin of a bug, which is like a one issue from the 90s.

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,317
Speaker 1: It's got like this or it's got this really old comic, like a suspense story about the Groot, who's the big tree.

171
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:11,419
Speaker 1: It's got a story about Star Lord and a story about like Drax the Destroyer and Thanos, just a short one.

172
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:16,463
Speaker 1: And it's an Adam Warlock story, the re-origin of Adam Warlock, because he was around before.

173
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:18,699
Speaker 1: But this is sort of like the second coming origin.

174
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,961
Speaker 1: But in the middle, right, those are all one issues that single issues that are put in this trade.

175
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:31,639
Speaker 1: There's also a four entire four issue miniseries in here for Rocket Raccoon, who is one of the characters in Guardians of the Galaxy.

176
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,778
Speaker 0: Rocket Raccoon.

177
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,895
Speaker 1: Yes, Rocket Raccoon.

178
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,359
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound like it fits.

179
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,419
Speaker 1: He's basically just a space ranger kind of dude with a laser gun and a rocket ship.

180
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:41,138
Speaker 1: But he's a raccoon.

181
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,458
Speaker 0: He's actually a raccoon.

182
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's actually a raccoon.

183
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,020
Speaker 0: Now, raccoon, like the size and shape of a normal Earth raccoon.

184
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,970
Speaker 1: No, he's a furry.

185
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,340
Speaker 1: He's a furry, but he's very small.

186
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,899
Speaker 0: OK, I was curious.

187
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,460
Speaker 0: He talks anyway.

188
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm reading I read, you know, like the first thing in there.

189
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:58,880
Speaker 0: How did he get the rocket?

190
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,654
Speaker 0: You don't want to know, was he just a raccoon?

191
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:03,620
Speaker 0: and then he got the rocket?

192
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,201
Speaker 0: Yes.

193
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:10,520
Speaker 1: OK, so he started out as just a raccoon.

194
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,214
Speaker 1: So anyway, the so I'm like, why is there?

195
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:21,080
Speaker 1: everyone else gets like a single issue and why is there a rocket raccoon for issue miniseries in here, the whole four issues?

196
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,300
Speaker 1: And it's in the middle of the book.

197
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,320
Speaker 0: I'm like, so really that's like prime real estate.

198
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, OK, so the whole middle of the book, in fact, the vast majority of this book, probably almost half of it is all about Rocket Raccoon.

199
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,580
Speaker 1: And the rest is just, you know, other, you know, single issues.

200
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,563
Speaker 0: I have a feeling you wouldn't bring this up unless it was either really good or really bad.

201
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:42,060
Speaker 1: Well, the story was, you know, a story, right?

202
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,560
Speaker 0: It was definitely a story about a raccoon who gets a rocket.

203
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's about a lot more than that.

204
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,825
Speaker 1: But, you know, the story wasn't like the greatest story ever, but it was definitely different.

205
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,359
Speaker 1: You know, it wasn't your it wasn't what you would think it would be.

206
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:59,582
Speaker 1: It was something else which made it kind of interesting, even if it wasn't amazingly high quality.

207
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:04,639
Speaker 1: What was amazing about it was I turned the page to the Raccoon Raccoon story and I'm like, what the fuck?

208
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,409
Speaker 1: Why the first page?

209
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 1: I see it and I'm like, what the holy shit?

210
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:13,280
Speaker 1: Why is the art on this Rocket Raccoon four issue miniseries from who knows when?

211
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,008
Speaker 1: Maybe the 80s.

212
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:14,638
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

213
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:15,245
Speaker 1: Right.

214
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:15,852
Speaker 1: I don't know.

215
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:16,136
Speaker 1: Early 90s.

216
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,098
Speaker 1: I got to go look again, see when it was from.

217
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,680
Speaker 1: Why is the art on this so great?

218
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:24,580
Speaker 1: Like there was the issue of the bug from the 90s was not so great.

219
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:28,218
Speaker 1: You know, the other you know, the other comics were like 60s and 70s comics.

220
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:32,000
Speaker 1: They did you know, the art was varying in quality.

221
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:35,699
Speaker 1: But there was like this Rocket Raccoon miniseries, like this greatest art.

222
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:41,560
Speaker 1: And so I looked to see who the artist was and it was Mike Mignola, the Hellboy guy.

223
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,459
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, oh, what the fuck?

224
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,624
Speaker 0: I got to read this now.

225
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,190
Speaker 1: Why did they not like?

226
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:52,940
Speaker 1: it's sort of like this secret, I guess, that there is this, you know, Rocket Raccoon miniseries with great arts.

227
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:59,900
Speaker 1: So if you are someone who wants to, you know, they should have just sold the Rocket Raccoon thing in a trade on its own and forgotten the other stuff.

228
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,700
Speaker 1: But if you want to read the Rocket Raccoon miniseries, go on Amazon and look for Annihilation Classic.

229
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,023
Speaker 0: Oh, hey, I see.

230
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:16,804
Speaker 0: OK, the origin story, at least, you know, with all comics, if you explain the plot and like just like this happens, then this happens, they often make sense.

231
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 1: Rocket Raccoon won't make sense.

232
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:18,862
Speaker 0: I don't know.

233
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:21,840
Speaker 0: There's a one sentence summary here that seems to make a lot of sense.

234
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,263
Speaker 1: All right.

235
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,238
Speaker 1: Tell me what the sentence summary is.

236
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:30,299
Speaker 0: Rocket Raccoon comes from Half-World comma in the Keystone Quadrant comma, an abandoned colony for the mentally ill.

237
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,699
Speaker 1: This is a run on sentence, isn't it?

238
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:39,549
Speaker 0: Where animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.

239
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:40,200
Speaker 1: Yep.

240
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,028
Speaker 0: Colon.

241
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:41,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

242
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,739
Speaker 0: Rocket Raccoon was Half-World's chief law officer parentheses, quote, Ranger, who protected the colony against various threats.

243
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:52,024
Speaker 0: Yep, that sounds about.

244
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,070
Speaker 1: OK, that was a long, that was a run on.

245
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,940
Speaker 1: say it's cheating, as that was a that was a paragraph, as far as I'm concerned.

246
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,915
Speaker 0: Currently, as a friend, Mr.

247
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,560
Speaker 1: Wall, Ross, who has tusks that are interchangeable and are do different things.

248
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:09,159
Speaker 1: He's got laser tusks and he's got like grabber tusks.

249
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,640
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's weird how I'll look at like a lot of superhero comics and just think of the stupidest things ever.

250
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,300
Speaker 0: But for some reason, something like this, I just really want to read.

251
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,520
Speaker 1: It has stupid parts, though.

252
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, you're not you're not.

253
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,904
Speaker 1: if you search for Rocket Raccoon on Amazon, I don't think you're going to find it.

254
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 1: Search for Annihilation Classic and you'll find this.

255
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,860
Speaker 1: And it has other stuff in it, but you'll just get it for the Rocket Raccoon.

256
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:39,700
Speaker 1: And also, if you like that stuff, you can read, you know, Annihilation, Annihilation, Conquest, Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are all the related.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,925
Speaker 1: That's what I like about it.

258
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:43,580
Speaker 1: It's like they sort of started this story off.

259
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:46,113
Speaker 1: And I got, you know, that first issue way back.

260
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:48,853
Speaker 1: that sort of started the whole thing first trade.

261
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:49,299
Speaker 1: Right.

262
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,220
Speaker 1: And they didn't like cross it over with too many other books.

263
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,064
Speaker 1: It's really only like four books that things cross over in so you can just get the whole thing easily.

264
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:05,320
Speaker 1: But you're still getting the crossover action, but you're not getting the have to know the entire history of Marvel Universe action.

265
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:09,340
Speaker 1: It's all just in a handful of books and most of them are just Annihilation.

266
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,307
Speaker 1: So it's really easy.

267
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:11,859
Speaker 1: And it's outer space.

268
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:19,820
Speaker 0: So because there is such a vibrant anime industry going on in the US, I'm going to talk about a bunch of things really briefly.

269
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:27,080
Speaker 0: I figure I'll cover everything that is even remotely worth talking about from like the last four months of anime news.

270
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,210
Speaker 1: They better make them all quick.

271
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,939
Speaker 1: We don't have a lot of time.

272
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,300
Speaker 0: So real quick, you know what?

273
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,660
Speaker 0: The top four manga in Japan are right about four right now.

274
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,184
Speaker 0: Right now.

275
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,620
Speaker 0: You don't have to get the order.

276
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,370
Speaker 1: One Piece.

277
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:37,799
Speaker 1: You know what?

278
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:38,548
Speaker 0: Top five.

279
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:39,420
Speaker 1: One Piece.

280
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,699
Speaker 0: Actually, One Piece is not anywhere on this list.

281
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,399
Speaker 0: Naruto Bleach Tennis, Prince of Tennis, I Shield 21 and something I've never heard of.

282
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,559
Speaker 1: What's the song you never heard of?

283
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:50,478
Speaker 0: Bakuman.

284
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,129
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what that is.

285
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:53,200
Speaker 1: That's it.

286
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,560
Speaker 0: And even then, nothing sold more than a million.

287
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

288
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,040
Speaker 1: There you go.

289
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,643
Speaker 1: Well, that's kind of.

290
00:13:57,663 --> 00:14:00,220
Speaker 1: is that kind of Tango Bonds or Shonen Jumps or what?

291
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,280
Speaker 0: You know what is counting?

292
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,590
Speaker 0: Anime News Network.

293
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,460
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

294
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,980
Speaker 1: Does it say source something, something?

295
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,618
Speaker 0: I bring this up only because it seems like.

296
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:19,779
Speaker 0: There's never any anime news and there's always the Japanese comic ranking and those sorts of things, and in the past I used to default to them and talk about them, but nothing will ever change.

297
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,040
Speaker 0: The same kinds of things will always be at the top.

298
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,928
Speaker 1: The numbers always talks about.

299
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:27,660
Speaker 1: Japan has a million animes and million mangas, and we only see a fraction of them.

300
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,960
Speaker 1: Well, we see most of the anime is like ninety nine percent of them and we see a fraction of the mangas.

301
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,500
Speaker 1: But the thing is, the same mangas are the popular ones.

302
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,066
Speaker 1: They're not bringing us.

303
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,780
Speaker 1: They're not bringing us over the unpopular mangas, right?

304
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,440
Speaker 1: If you're going to spend the money to bring over a manga, they bring over the popular one.

305
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:46,979
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the unpopular ones that we don't get to see.

306
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,200
Speaker 0: What generally is the most popular in comics in Japan?

307
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,319
Speaker 0: It's the crap aimed at like 14 year old guys.

308
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's what most, you know, even though manga is read by other people in Japan a lot more than comics are read by other people in the

309
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:01,994
Speaker 1: U.S.,

310
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,020
Speaker 1: the majority of readers is still kids reading Shonen Jump.

311
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,299
Speaker 0: I mean, I realize this partly.

312
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,180
Speaker 0: You know, we've been doing these like Gekiga panels and we talk about sanctuary a lot and, you know, Kazuoka is golf manga.

313
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:26,573
Speaker 0: And I realized that a lot of our listeners seem to have started to foster this impression that all the manga that isn't brought over to America is exactly like Sanctuary and Eagle, and that all the shoujo manga we don't get to read is exactly like the 49ers stuff.

314
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:26,999
Speaker 0: that's good.

315
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,160
Speaker 0: Most of it is crap, just like most of anything ever from any source is crap.

316
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

317
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,800
Speaker 1: there's a lot more of it in Japan.

318
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:46,744
Speaker 1: You know, if you want to sort of get a better picture on this, go to the comic book store, find a comic book store that actually has every single comic for Marvel and NBC.

319
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:46,987
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,019
Speaker 1: It's sort of hard to find one.

321
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:54,571
Speaker 1: And you'll go to the shelf and you'll see Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, et cetera.

322
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:55,020
Speaker 1: Right.

323
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,600
Speaker 1: Justice League, X-Men, Avengers.

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:11,099
Speaker 1: Then you give you actually look around, you'll start seeing all this stuff that's like they actually come out with like this third rate character that only incredible nerds know about every month.

325
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,162
Speaker 1: They come out with a comic for this person and they sell enough to pay everyone in that chain.

326
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,539
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, they do.

327
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,980
Speaker 1: And they do the same shit in Japan.

328
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,002
Speaker 1: Some manga that's like incredibly, you know, nerdy and only a handful of people are into it.

329
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:30,820
Speaker 1: every, you know, month or week or two is in the Shonen Jump or whatever it is.

330
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,345
Speaker 1: And there every time, just like in America, like, you know, like they'll have a Blue Beetle comic.

331
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:39,020
Speaker 1: You know, I guess he's the Blue Beetle.

332
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:44,520
Speaker 1: They he had his own comic for a while and then they stopped and then, you know, they started up again and stop it again.

333
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,059
Speaker 1: You know, that's how it goes.

334
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,140
Speaker 1: I mean, Booster Gold, all nerds know who that is.

335
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,060
Speaker 1: But I only know who it is because I listen to nerds talk about him.

336
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Speaker 0: And I only know who it is because you told me about the nerds talking about.

337
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,087
Speaker 1: He has his own.

338
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:57,100
Speaker 1: There's a book, Booster Gold.

339
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,007
Speaker 1: It comes out every month.

340
00:16:58,593 --> 00:16:59,037
Speaker 1: They print it.

341
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,099
Speaker 0: Dang, that's the that's, you know, so speaking of which, it all culminates in this.

342
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:11,300
Speaker 0: What is coming out and there's a trailer for it now is Dragon Ball Online, the MMO.

343
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:13,880
Speaker 1: My joke is everyone just super single.

344
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:22,039
Speaker 0: My joke, and I'm not going to say anything beyond this, is that I hear the controller for combat is a microphone and a volume meter.

345
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,842
Speaker 1: So moving on the you know what, though, I just want to say this real quick, a fist of the North Star.

346
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:40,899
Speaker 0: I was thinking that the whole time I was talking about the North Star MMO would honestly be great if combat were just random matching random letters, scroll across the typing of the North Star.

347
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,179
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, we have to make it.

348
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,862
Speaker 0: We could make that you do 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80.

349
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:48,486
Speaker 0: No, then you have to type.

350
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,519
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh, in the end.

351
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:51,839
Speaker 1: And then the guy explodes.

352
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,340
Speaker 1: If you don't type it fast enough or if you misspell it, the guy can attack you.

353
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:55,644
Speaker 1: No.

354
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:56,032
Speaker 0: Then you get.

355
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:56,358
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

356
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:57,899
Speaker 1: You type in the move you want to do.

357
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,339
Speaker 1: You type in like, you know, I'll get it to go.

358
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,599
Speaker 0: What easy it would be to make typing of the fist of the North Star.

359
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,363
Speaker 1: It would be great.

360
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:09,728
Speaker 1: All you would do is take the arcade game and replace the punching things with keyboard.

361
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:10,251
Speaker 1: That would be it.

362
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:14,551
Speaker 0: I feel like I should take that game without any consent from anyone who owns the property.

363
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:15,033
Speaker 0: Do it.

364
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:18,367
Speaker 1: Just take, just, I have every episode of the TV show.

365
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:21,140
Speaker 1: You can just copy and paste video right out of the TV show.

366
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,251
Speaker 0: I could make a flash game right out of the movies.

367
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:26,868
Speaker 0: I could just write it in Python and put it in like a package repository.

368
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,214
Speaker 1: You know what you could do actually?

369
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,545
Speaker 1: Uh, I've actually been investigating.

370
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:31,309
Speaker 1: This is a towel.

371
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:35,145
Speaker 1: Save this for a tech day, but basically you could do X and a in Python.

372
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:35,988
Speaker 0: Really?

373
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:36,450
Speaker 0: Yes.

374
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:36,992
Speaker 1: Really?

375
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:37,313
Speaker 1: Yes.

376
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:37,754
Speaker 1: Really?

377
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:38,958
Speaker 0: I should just do this.

378
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

379
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,052
Speaker 0: So she finally is making another live action movie.

380
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:48,660
Speaker 0: The first one since Avalon, which sucked.

381
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,647
Speaker 1: Even though some people like it, we think it sucks.

382
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:56,615
Speaker 0: The thing is I liked it and then there was a twist at the end and I was like, well, I saw that coming.

383
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,662
Speaker 1: I didn't like any of it.

384
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,169
Speaker 1: I thought it was just sort of boring.

385
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,416
Speaker 1: And then what the fuck?

386
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:04,014
Speaker 0: Then there was another twist and then another twist and then I just turned the movie off.

387
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:04,456
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

388
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,260
Speaker 1: It was bullshit.

389
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,235
Speaker 1: Well I think the problem was also that it was hyped incredibly.

390
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,387
Speaker 1: I didn't even know it was Mama Roshi when I watched it.

391
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:10,749
Speaker 0: Me either.

392
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:16,293
Speaker 1: It was just incredibly hyped up as like this awesome sci-fi movie from Eastern Europe and then it was poop.

393
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:17,237
Speaker 1: So whatever.

394
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,384
Speaker 0: But his new movie sounds a lot better.

395
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,127
Speaker 0: You know what it's about?

396
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:27,329
Speaker 0: It is about women with assault rifles fighting whales in the desert.

397
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,257
Speaker 1: How does a whale go in the desert?

398
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 1: Does it need water?

399
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,987
Speaker 0: Suna Kujira, sand whales.

400
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,252
Speaker 1: So it's Dune with guns.

401
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:37,335
Speaker 0: And girls.

402
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:38,137
Speaker 1: And girls.

403
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,400
Speaker 0: Dune gun girls.

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,822
Speaker 1: Crying Fremen.

405
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,754
Speaker 0: Why can't he just go back to making anime?

406
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,003
Speaker 0: Every anime he makes is just amazing.

407
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,757
Speaker 1: Mama Roshi, you know, it's been said before by us and other people.

408
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:55,463
Speaker 1: He is pretty much the greatest example of someone who's incredibly talented and refuses to do what they're talented at.

409
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,073
Speaker 1: I mean at least Guy Ritchie made a bunch of Guy Ritchie movies.

410
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:05,578
Speaker 1: It's like here, you know, Mama Roshi does like amazing comedy and action scenes and animation.

411
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:11,214
Speaker 1: And all he wants to do is like, you know, crazy, weird sci-fi live action things.

412
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,811
Speaker 1: And he should really go do some comedic action animes.

413
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:20,363
Speaker 1: He'd actually make like a good Hokuto Nuken or a Dragon Ball.

414
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,267
Speaker 1: It would be like the best.

415
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:25,685
Speaker 1: It would actually be funny and have great action scenes in it.

416
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:30,680
Speaker 0: So last and certainly not least, I don't have our schedule handy.

417
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,464
Speaker 0: I'm not going to bother.

418
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:32,068
Speaker 0: You'll see us there.

419
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:35,807
Speaker 0: But the New York Anime Festival is coming up September 25th through 27th.

420
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:43,559
Speaker 0: We'll probably be there Friday night and Saturday night doing a couple of panels and otherwise Friday night and some portion of Saturday.

421
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,226
Speaker 1: We'll probably go to the city all day Saturday.

422
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,100
Speaker 1: Go to the anime festival for a portion of the Saturday.

423
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:52,617
Speaker 0: Once we know our schedule and I think to actually think about it, we'll put it up.

424
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:56,075
Speaker 0: I mean the New York Anime Festival, we kind of do the same panels we usually do.

425
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,005
Speaker 0: We don't do anything crazy or special at it.

426
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,662
Speaker 0: But if you're in New York, we're going to try to do something better next year.

427
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:05,160
Speaker 0: Well, I'm putting more of my eggs in the New York Comic-Con basket, to be honest.

428
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good idea.

429
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:11,304
Speaker 0: We need more non anime cons because most of our good panels are not anime panels.

430
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:15,463
Speaker 1: New York Anime Festival last year, we just like walked into our panels and walked out.

431
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,753
Speaker 1: It was sort of it was really weird to do that.

432
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:21,107
Speaker 0: It felt very professional, but kind of jerky.

433
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:21,851
Speaker 0: But it was weird.

434
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:25,168
Speaker 0: Like literally we walked in, we got our badges from the like the special booth.

435
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:26,194
Speaker 0: We find Pete to terror.

436
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:26,999
Speaker 0: We're like, Hey, we're here.

437
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,863
Speaker 0: This is going to be awesome.

438
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,974
Speaker 0: We did like all these panels in a row and then we left.

439
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:31,019
Speaker 0: Yeah.

440
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,207
Speaker 1: I walked around the dealer's room once.

441
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:32,589
Speaker 1: Yep.

442
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,526
Speaker 1: Because really all it is the dealer's room and then some panel rooms next to it.

443
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:42,856
Speaker 0: But you know, if you live in the New York area, all cons like this, pretty much any con is worth going to for one day.

444
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:43,620
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

445
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:56,160
Speaker 1: This is definitely, it's like if you're an anime person and you're close to New York City, you know, if you can get there by train or quickly by car, if you're in North Jersey or Southwest Connecticut or Southern New York or Long Island, they always have good guests.

446
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,224
Speaker 1: They always have good panels.

447
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:59,014
Speaker 1: They just go all day Saturday.

448
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:03,511
Speaker 1: It's totally worth, you know, your all day Saturday if you need some anime con action.

449
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:07,368
Speaker 1: And it is, you know, it's the end of the anime con season.

450
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,258
Speaker 1: You're not getting nothing until like next year.

451
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,404
Speaker 1: Anime Boston time.

452
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:10,665
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:12,333
Speaker 0: Because we don't know what's up with Kazucon.

454
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:12,575
Speaker 0: Yeah.

455
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:13,640
Speaker 1: This is your last chance.

456
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,701
Speaker 1: So for this year, anime con.

457
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:19,324
Speaker 1: So go and behold and also see us.

458
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:37,063
Speaker 0: So things of the day, I know I talked about how I was watching Irresponsible Captain Tyler again recently, and I cannot express to any of you anime people how great that show is.

459
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:47,902
Speaker 0: If you think you're like Gurren Lagann is great and you're watching it and you haven't seen at least some giant robo Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Irresponsible Captain Tyler.

460
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:51,316
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that's the only reason you like Gurren Lagann.

461
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:52,020
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

462
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,662
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

463
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,466
Speaker 1: Smackdown.

464
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:54,290
Speaker 0: Gurren Lagann's okay.

465
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 0: It's pretty good, but I'm getting the feeling the more I watch it that it's not that great.

466
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:08,112
Speaker 0: It's just there's a lot of homage to older, better shows and right down to the sunglasses on Kamina.

467
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,094
Speaker 0: Jesus, you people.

468
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:22,237
Speaker 0: Anyway, Irresponsible Captain Tyler is just such a great anime and the more I watch it again, especially now, the more I realize just how utterly great it was and how much I love it.

469
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:26,136
Speaker 1: I watched one of the episodes and I was like, yeah, it's as good as I remember it.

470
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:31,456
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of that and we always call them the camaraderie shows and it's got a lot of that in it.

471
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:37,511
Speaker 0: It's just here is Greenwood in space to a small gambler.

472
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:41,031
Speaker 0: They're all just weird and they're all kind of stupid and they're all kind of jokes.

473
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,007
Speaker 1: A lot of shows nowadays have like the full cast of characters.

474
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:47,262
Speaker 1: You know, that's one thing at the guy, the strong guy.

475
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:52,001
Speaker 0: That's something Fullmetal Alchemist did really well and I think that's one of the only reasons it was popular.

476
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,856
Speaker 1: Even the Gundam shows would sort of have the cast.

477
00:23:56,157 --> 00:24:02,664
Speaker 1: A bunch of the cast is always will be like, for example, they'll take the like the crew who works on the mechs will be like.

478
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:07,683
Speaker 1: the only character they'll have is like the lead guy and everyone else will just be generic guy, generic guy.

479
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:11,355
Speaker 1: And in Tyler, no one's generic guy.

480
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,102
Speaker 0: They have the full load out.

481
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:26,633
Speaker 0: There are people who have like one speaking line in the entire show and are in the background in like three random other episodes and yet they are fully fleshed out and the weird shit you see them doing in the background is totally relevant to the characters.

482
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:27,856
Speaker 0: But I digress.

483
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,522
Speaker 0: If you don't get it, watch this AMV.

484
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:34,933
Speaker 0: It's Irresponsible Captain Tyler.

485
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,378
Speaker 0: It doesn't really spoil anything.

486
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:43,183
Speaker 0: This shows you exactly why Irresponsible Captain Tyler is one of my favorite anime ever.

487
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:44,066
Speaker 0: All right.

488
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:44,929
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

489
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,834
Speaker 0: Also, it was rereleased in a thin pack.

490
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 0: You can get it for like 40 bucks.

491
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:49,984
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

492
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:50,746
Speaker 0: Yeah.

493
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:53,293
Speaker 1: So what do?

494
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:56,601
Speaker 1: one thing I like is Ming vases.

495
00:24:57,343 --> 00:25:01,075
Speaker 0: Uh, do you actually like them or are you setting yourself up for something?

496
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:02,223
Speaker 1: No, they're totally awesome.

497
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:04,133
Speaker 1: They're pretty cool, but I am also setting up for something.

498
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:12,787
Speaker 0: But what particularly about the Ming dynasty as opposed to other dynasties say the ones before and after, which you probably cannot name.

499
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,574
Speaker 1: I just like the white with the blue stuff.

500
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,867
Speaker 1: Anyway, I like the way they look anyway.

501
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:23,572
Speaker 1: I actually at the at the what's it called the Pearl River Mart, you can get like plates that are, you know, white with the blue.

502
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:24,233
Speaker 1: The nice.

503
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:24,554
Speaker 1: OK.

504
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:29,046
Speaker 1: Also, I like robots, right?

505
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,117
Speaker 0: Is there a transforming robot that turns into a Ming vase?

506
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:34,627
Speaker 1: No, there's a dude who made some vases.

507
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,660
Speaker 1: And basically all the vases look like a touchy coma had sex with the Ming vase.

508
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:41,670
Speaker 1: And he calls them.

509
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:48,750
Speaker 1: he calls his name is Brandon Tangus and he calls them his manga, Ming or more Lou vases.

510
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,396
Speaker 1: I call them mecha Ming.

511
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:51,801
Speaker 1: That's what I call them.

512
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:54,089
Speaker 0: There's something special about that.

513
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,702
Speaker 1: So yeah, when you take a look at these, there are.

514
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,074
Speaker 1: there's just a few photos of, you know, five or six of them.

515
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:00,601
Speaker 1: And they're totally awesome.

516
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:01,907
Speaker 1: And I want one.

517
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,740
Speaker 1: But hopefully I would get one that is functional as a vase.

518
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,175
Speaker 1: I could put some flowers in there or something or maybe some grains of rice.

519
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:10,703
Speaker 1: I don't know what you store in a Ming vase money.

520
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:15,925
Speaker 1: If you can afford a Ming vase, I mean, these are multiple smaller vases.

521
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:19,500
Speaker 1: He didn't actually take real Ming vases and put, you know, Max on them.

522
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,552
Speaker 1: He made vases in the Ming style and put Max on, you know.

523
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,460
Speaker 1: So anyway, yeah, take a look.

524
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,042
Speaker 1: It's cool.

525
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:25,705
Speaker 1: I like it.

526
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:26,247
Speaker 1: I want one.

527
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,832
Speaker 1: I probably can't afford one.

528
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,295
Speaker 1: Ming or no Ming.

529
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:31,099
Speaker 1: Ming the Merciless.

530
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:37,094
Speaker 0: So in a momentous occasion has occurred for geek nights.

531
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:39,103
Speaker 0: And this is kind of an important announcement.

532
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,195
Speaker 0: Scott finished watching some anime recently.

533
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:51,105
Speaker 1: I mean, it was twenty four episodes and I started watching and I was like, OK, I watched like four episodes in one night.

534
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,237
Speaker 1: So I was like, OK, I was to, you know, an hour and change.

535
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,967
Speaker 1: I'll finish this and I finished it in three days.

536
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:07,700
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of it I've realized how to stop watching, how to tell if I really like an anime or not, because some anime like I was trying to watch through Nadeshiko, which I just never really watched all the way through.

537
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,524
Speaker 1: I couldn't.

538
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,050
Speaker 1: I had no interest to continue.

539
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,683
Speaker 0: The further I get, like I have to force myself to watch it.

540
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:13,246
Speaker 0: Exactly.

541
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,255
Speaker 1: I had the same problem with Kazenoyo Jimbo.

542
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,300
Speaker 0: It's just kind of shit.

543
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,621
Speaker 0: And I remember watching it and like forcing myself to watch the next episode to finish it.

544
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,676
Speaker 0: One day I was like, I shouldn't have to force myself to watch anything.

545
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:26,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kazenoyo Jimbo is nice and average.

546
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:27,792
Speaker 0: Bokerana was definitely a show.

547
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,870
Speaker 0: I remember once I got past the first couple episodes, I just watched it every moment.

548
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,586
Speaker 0: I had to watch anime until it was done because I had to know what happened.

549
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:35,028
Speaker 1: Yeah.

550
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:40,390
Speaker 1: Now, the thing was right is let's you know, we'll talk about it and then we'll do a spoiler line.

551
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,621
Speaker 0: Yes, this is a final thoughts show.

552
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:43,466
Speaker 1: You want to do a final thoughts?

553
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:43,727
Speaker 1: All right.

554
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:48,490
Speaker 0: But we're going to review it first because we haven't talked about it in a long time or at all.

555
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,072
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

556
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:54,079
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we brought it up because I watched all of it like way back, like as soon as the last episode was.

557
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,667
Speaker 1: So just quick plot summary.

558
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:55,969
Speaker 1: Right.

559
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:58,398
Speaker 1: This is sort of a spoiler, but really, come on.

560
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,542
Speaker 1: Everybody knows this.

561
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,031
Speaker 1: And it's they tell you right up front.

562
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:05,605
Speaker 1: Basically, the story is some kids are at nature camp.

563
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:08,537
Speaker 1: It's basically summer camp on some tropical island.

564
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:08,838
Speaker 1: Right.

565
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:17,615
Speaker 1: And it's happy times in the summer and they're hanging out on the beach and there's a secret cave and they go in the secret cave and there's a weird guy and some weird sci fi shit happens.

566
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,539
Speaker 1: And basically they have to.

567
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:27,351
Speaker 1: they think they're going to play a video game, but really they end up piloting a robot to fight these robots and, you know, defend the earth from monster robots.

568
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:35,387
Speaker 0: And now the thing is, it's one of those shows where if you describe for real, you describe the plot like, yeah, it's about a bunch of kids, blah, blah, blah.

569
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:36,954
Speaker 0: Now they pilot a giant robot.

570
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:38,702
Speaker 0: That sounds derivative and shit.

571
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,227
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's not.

572
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:45,406
Speaker 1: every time they pilot the robot, one of the kids is the pilot and everyone else just sort of sits there.

573
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:49,100
Speaker 1: Whoever is the pilot totally dies.

574
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,104
Speaker 1: Now, here's the thing.

575
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,414
Speaker 1: After the fight is over right away.

576
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,442
Speaker 0: The reason why these win or lose.

577
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,753
Speaker 1: Oh, and if you lose, the whole world is destroyed.

578
00:28:56,813 --> 00:28:59,605
Speaker 1: So it's either you die or the whole world dies, including you.

579
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:09,084
Speaker 0: So the reason I like this show straight up and I realized this when I was watching a couple episodes again, just to remember, is that it does the same thing that Death Note did.

580
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:19,437
Speaker 0: It has a world that is 100 percent self-consistent, where every character acts in a believable, believable, responsible, rational manner.

581
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:24,195
Speaker 0: Or if they are irrational, it is very understandable why they were irrational.

582
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:26,223
Speaker 0: It goes straight to the military.

583
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:29,700
Speaker 0: Everybody's like does exactly what a smart person would do in that situation.

584
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

585
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,913
Speaker 1: The show also does the same thing that Utena does.

586
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:42,787
Speaker 1: You have a long list of characters and you go through each character one at a time and examine, you know, their personality and who they are and what they're all about.

587
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:48,610
Speaker 1: And then the battle at the end of that character's story arc, which, of course, they're going to die at the end of.

588
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:48,972
Speaker 1: Right.

589
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:49,374
Speaker 1: Duh.

590
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:52,585
Speaker 1: That battle is a metaphor for that person.

591
00:29:52,645 --> 00:30:00,592
Speaker 1: And then somehow that person's life is resolved for good or ill or otherwise, except for Captain Jerkface, who dies.

592
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,536
Speaker 0: Well, anyway.

593
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:02,158
Speaker 1: Right.

594
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,912
Speaker 1: But you know what I'm saying is that, you know, that's how that's how it goes.

595
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:12,982
Speaker 0: But it's a show that really Bocorano takes a bunch of children, confronts them with the inevitability of their own death.

596
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:27,030
Speaker 0: And you watch them very realistically grapple with the understanding that they are going to die and them trying to come to terms with it and trying to come up with or just have a reason to leave a legacy behind,

597
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:32,851
Speaker 1: but also simultaneously working very hard and intelligently to get out of it and not die.

598
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:36,806
Speaker 0: The one of the best scenes in the show is to defend the Earth.

599
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:45,020
Speaker 0: It's not really a spoiler, but the kids basically people go straight to the military and they're like, oh, Jesus shit, this is what's going on right here.

600
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,606
Speaker 0: And the military is like, oh, really?

601
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:55,142
Speaker 1: And they sort of look like in the first battle, the robots are semi invisible, even though they're making like big waves and destroying things.

602
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,799
Speaker 1: But then in the second fight, it's just like, yeah, OK, the robots are out.

603
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,542
Speaker 1: Everyone can see it.

604
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:06,760
Speaker 0: Like the fact that the show cuts to like the news reports of, oh, shit, giant robots and like the militaries of the world are reacting to this.

605
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,183
Speaker 1: And it's not portrayed like, you know, in the news today, robots, it's like portrayed like real news.

606
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:16,526
Speaker 1: One of the kids parents is like the news guy, you know, that comes into play later on.

607
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,980
Speaker 1: Actually, every everything comes into play.

608
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:22,360
Speaker 1: But yeah, actually, I heard a story a long time ago.

609
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:31,360
Speaker 1: I think we did it as a news in some ancient episode about how the director of this anime asked the mom because it was originally a manga.

610
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:40,320
Speaker 1: He asked the manga person if he could make it like, you know, less tragic because it was just so terrible killing these kids off every episode or whatever.

611
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,185
Speaker 1: And yes, well, if you're not, I think the manga person agreed, but I haven't read the manga at all.

612
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,480
Speaker 1: But but I did watch the entire anime.

613
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:52,100
Speaker 1: It is no I don't know how you could make it more tragic.

614
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,200
Speaker 0: Really, Mohiro Kito is the person who originally wrote the manga Bokerano.

615
00:31:57,381 --> 00:32:05,368
Speaker 0: And he is also well known for Shadow Star Naruto, which, oh, that explains everything, which can be described as Pokemon.

616
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,700
Speaker 0: if everyone were depressed and people fucking die.

617
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,463
Speaker 1: Yeah.

618
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:10,440
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

619
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,587
Speaker 1: This guy is just hitting.

620
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,580
Speaker 1: Oh, something else you have to know about this anime.

621
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:21,779
Speaker 0: Oh, Scott, I'll just point out I have not read and I didn't I don't know anything about this, but one of his other works, a manga is called Hallucination from the Womb.

622
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:23,198
Speaker 1: I never heard of that ever.

623
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,240
Speaker 0: So this guy seems to and just looking at pictures and going through this is a winner.

624
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,900
Speaker 0: He is the guy Ritchie of depressing.

625
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:35,260
Speaker 0: Oh, he is Guy Ritchie of killing children and making you cry about it.

626
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,842
Speaker 0: All right.

627
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:39,360
Speaker 1: So something else to know about the anime is made by Gonzo.

628
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:47,040
Speaker 1: And that usually means that the trailers and the first episode of like amazing animation and they're going to look really awesome and get you all hyped up.

629
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,460
Speaker 1: But then it's not going to deliver.

630
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,420
Speaker 1: This is probably like the Gonzo show that delivers like the only one.

631
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:54,119
Speaker 0: It must have not really been Gonzo.

632
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,340
Speaker 1: Well, it was Gonzo.

633
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,420
Speaker 1: The thing is, we did some research and we found out a reason.

634
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,387
Speaker 0: Here's the story.

635
00:32:59,448 --> 00:33:00,640
Speaker 1: The show worked out.

636
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:08,500
Speaker 0: So Scott said that the director went to the mangaka to get permission to not have to kill as many children.

637
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:09,282
Speaker 1: Yeah.

638
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:12,460
Speaker 0: And the director is someone who I actually had not heard of.

639
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Speaker 0: I had no idea who this person was, but Hiroyuki Morita and Morita only directed one other major animation, and that was The Cat Returns.

640
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,378
Speaker 1: For Studio Ghibli.

641
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,520
Speaker 1: So that's a pretty great one right there.

642
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,274
Speaker 1: So he's got two winners.

643
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:27,840
Speaker 0: The Cat Returns.

644
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,160
Speaker 0: So I'm one really looking forward to see.

645
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:31,099
Speaker 1: But how do you wait?

646
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,540
Speaker 1: OK, so he did The Cat Returns and he did Bocorano.

647
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,732
Speaker 1: Two great shows.

648
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:35,440
Speaker 0: Right.

649
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,440
Speaker 1: So but you don't just get to direct Cat Returns for Studio Ghibli out of nowhere.

650
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,480
Speaker 0: How does this guy come out of nowhere and direct The Cat Returns?

651
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,620
Speaker 0: Well, he did key animation for freaking every Satoshi Kon work ever.

652
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:51,678
Speaker 0: Ah, I mean, he was key animator for Rogen Z, Perfect Blue, That's an Otomo work.

653
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, Paradise Agent, Magnetic Rose also related to Otomo.

654
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
Speaker 1: So the guy who directed this and they went.

655
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,479
Speaker 1: he went to the Otomo and Satoshi Kon school of anime, which is probably one of the best schools of anime to go to.

656
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:07,200
Speaker 1: So that is not a surprise that he is awesome.

657
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,225
Speaker 1: And I am.

658
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,020
Speaker 1: I wonder what he's directing now, because I imagine it's awesome.

659
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:12,440
Speaker 0: And I like even stuff.

660
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:19,179
Speaker 0: He did key animation for the first Tenchi movie, which is widely regarded as a great movie and independent of what you might think about Tenchi Muyo.

661
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,679
Speaker 0: He did not work on the second Tenchi Muyo, a.k.a.

662
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,800
Speaker 0: no need for incest.

663
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:37,580
Speaker 0: And while he worked, sadly, on the third Tenchi Muyo movie, which was basically a fanfic now need incest in that movie, I note that he had no creative control.

664
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,739
Speaker 0: He just did the storyboards and the key animation and the unit direction for the already written shitty story.

665
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:46,300
Speaker 0: I can't blame him for that one, but just getting paid.

666
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:51,719
Speaker 0: This guy is definitely one of the last people who kind of came out of the protege system.

667
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,998
Speaker 0: And I really look forward to what he's going to direct next.

668
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy's looks like a winner to me.

669
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,620
Speaker 0: He's the picture, too, of him in the anime news network, at least.

670
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:02,979
Speaker 0: He has a smile that it portrays one thing.

671
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,427
Speaker 0: I am hot shit.

672
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,172
Speaker 0: I know it.

673
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:05,715
Speaker 0: You know it.

674
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:06,399
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

675
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:08,372
Speaker 0: You got to see the smile.

676
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:09,219
Speaker 0: It is just perfect.

677
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,014
Speaker 1: So Bokerano is a totally awesome 24 episode show.

678
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:15,879
Speaker 1: You should totally watch it.

679
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,115
Speaker 1: I don't really have a lot more to say without spoiling.

680
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,839
Speaker 0: the whole show is eminently spoilable.

681
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,140
Speaker 0: It's just it's beautiful.

682
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:28,140
Speaker 1: I guess the animation is, you know, it's not like the best animation in the universe, but it's really great.

683
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:30,739
Speaker 1: It stays great even towards the end of the show.

684
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,832
Speaker 0: One thing I'll say it is like surprisingly on.

685
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:35,880
Speaker 1: the designs are very unique.

686
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,959
Speaker 0: But like the show is on model to the point that I was kind of startled by it.

687
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:46,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, they have all these characters and all the characters like totally stick, you know, like they don't you know, they they.

688
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:51,240
Speaker 1: they're not just on model visually, but they're on model like the full character wise.

689
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,659
Speaker 1: And they start with a whole bunch of them.

690
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,879
Speaker 1: And obviously they decrease over time.

691
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:59,059
Speaker 0: The fact that they have that many characters in Gun Tron, the anime here.

692
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:04,419
Speaker 1: And I'm sorry, people, if anyone knows a Gun Tron is you'll like it.

693
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,480
Speaker 0: But they have so many characters.

694
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,020
Speaker 0: The first episode was like a million kids.

695
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,358
Speaker 0: You have no idea who they are.

696
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,339
Speaker 0: By the second episode, you pretty much know who they all are.

697
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,800
Speaker 0: By the third episode, you care about all of them.

698
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,971
Speaker 0: Except Captain Asshole.

699
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:17,879
Speaker 0: And don't worry, he dies.

700
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of amazing how they have so many characters, yet they actually managed to get you to know all of them and care about all of them.

701
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:27,980
Speaker 1: And they introduce more characters and it's not a burden.

702
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:32,167
Speaker 1: And that just shows you that they're they're delivering it in the proper the proper way.

703
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:34,040
Speaker 1: And the show really is all about the characters.

704
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,560
Speaker 1: It's not about the robots that just happen to be there.

705
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,620
Speaker 1: The robot battle is just a metaphor for the character.

706
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,359
Speaker 0: It really it does the same thing that Cowboy Bebop did in that Cowboy Bebop had a world with an epic story.

707
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:54,100
Speaker 0: But the true epic story of the Cowboy Bebop world, the gate disaster and all that stuff had nothing to do with the direct story of the characters.

708
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,039
Speaker 0: Cowboy Bebop was about these characters coming to terms with their own lives.

709
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:01,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the story of like where these robots come from and all that stuff is there.

710
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:03,166
Speaker 0: It's there.

711
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:06,820
Speaker 1: They tell you a bit more about it than the Cowboy Bebop tells you about the gate explosion.

712
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:10,780
Speaker 0: But it's not fully resolved because it doesn't need to be.

713
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,500
Speaker 0: It doesn't need to be about that.

714
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:18,439
Speaker 0: But that Cowboy Bebop and this have a complex, self-consistent, realistic, interesting and compelling world.

715
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,839
Speaker 0: But beyond that, the story is just about these equally compelling characters within that world instead of being about the world.

716
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,260
Speaker 1: It's also a relatively new, non-stupid, serious science fiction anime.

717
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,809
Speaker 1: It's kind of rare.

718
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,140
Speaker 1: Enjoy it while you can.

719
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,500
Speaker 1: And you only get one of these once in a while.

720
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:43,579
Speaker 0: The show, too, I just want to point out before we get to the spoiler line, which I'm kind of itching to get to because there are some great freaking moments in the show.

721
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:54,340
Speaker 0: But aside from the fact that it made me cry like 15 or 16 times and I cried continuously throughout the last like 15 minutes of the last episode, nonstop.

722
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:57,014
Speaker 0: Just like I was on the train the whole time.

723
00:37:57,034 --> 00:38:00,940
Speaker 0: I'm just like, like not full on crying.

724
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,940
Speaker 1: Did the person next to you think you were weird?

725
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,682
Speaker 0: I don't know.

726
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:06,540
Speaker 0: It wasn't full on crying, but it was definitely that like my eyes are tearing.

727
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,459
Speaker 1: I didn't have any full on crying either, but it was definitely like, oh man.

728
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,627
Speaker 0: Get choked up.

729
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:15,120
Speaker 1: And the thing is, I sort of knew what was going down, but it was just oh man.

730
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,144
Speaker 0: I didn't know, but it was.

731
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:24,500
Speaker 0: it's like Trigun where the act of what happens in an episode, someone dying or something like that is not what made me cry or made me go crazy.

732
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:30,060
Speaker 0: What made me cry was like the moment later where someone else reacts to it.

733
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,752
Speaker 1: The worst is when it's 24 episodes, right?

734
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,550
Speaker 1: The thing is, there's only like.

735
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,740
Speaker 1: there's a lot less than that.

736
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,620
Speaker 1: There's like 15 robot battles.

737
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:43,000
Speaker 1: So a lot of times one character will get like two or even three episodes before their battle.

738
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:47,600
Speaker 1: So they're really like pushing this person on to you before they rub them out.

739
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,836
Speaker 1: And it's just like, oh, fuck you.

740
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,220
Speaker 1: You should if you did if they did every character, just one episode gone, one episode gone.

741
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,219
Speaker 1: It'd be a lot less tragic and torturous.

742
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,459
Speaker 0: Granted, then again, I just they don't let you off easy.

743
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,280
Speaker 0: I point out as a counterexample, burrado, but you can bradow this show.

744
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,120
Speaker 0: I bradow people continuously.

745
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Speaker 0: It's horrifying.

746
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,599
Speaker 1: It's just bradow the show.

747
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,180
Speaker 0: So anyway, I want to point out one other thing.

748
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,717
Speaker 0: The mute before we get to the spoiler line, the music in this show is amazing.

749
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,960
Speaker 1: Oh, the opener is is is really great music during the show.

750
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,700
Speaker 1: I think just average background music.

751
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:21,980
Speaker 0: It is, but it's not good or bad.

752
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:24,560
Speaker 1: It's not like I want the soundtrack, but the opener is totally awesome.

753
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,097
Speaker 0: The music.

754
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:35,040
Speaker 0: The reason I say the music during the show is so amazing is because it's in the background where it should be like complimenting the anime, but not overpowering the anime.

755
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:36,400
Speaker 0: And it never appears out of place.

756
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:39,500
Speaker 0: There's no like random pop song in the middle or anything weird like that.

757
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,219
Speaker 1: I'll say I'll just you know, I agree with that.

758
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,240
Speaker 1: But that only that those qualities that you are ascribing to it are exactly correct.

759
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:50,020
Speaker 1: But those qualities only give it the mark of good in the Book of Scott.

760
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,520
Speaker 1: Well, you achieve the mark of great.

761
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:57,620
Speaker 1: You have to be like a cowboy bebop or something where I want the OST of all the background where the for where the form and function are intertwined.

762
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:58,280
Speaker 1: Exactly.

763
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,760
Speaker 1: So but the opener is great.

764
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:01,039
Speaker 1: Well, uninstall song.

765
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:09,240
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing I'll point out is that the show does the thing that Gundam seed did where the music is mostly this very one specific style of music during the show.

766
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:21,720
Speaker 0: But there are a couple of times during the show where music like the opener plays instead, much like how in Gundam seed, where there were those I'm seen as great music, but Gundam seed has like one kind of music throughout the show.

767
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,518
Speaker 0: But there are like four.

768
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:23,640
Speaker 1: So it's going to see it again.

769
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:24,498
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

770
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,839
Speaker 0: That show is so great.

771
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:32,879
Speaker 0: But there are like four scenes like the scene on the island or the scene in the opera house where a different kind of music plays.

772
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:33,662
Speaker 0: Yeah.

773
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:37,200
Speaker 0: And that music like stands out and kind of takes over the scene and pushes you away.

774
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,239
Speaker 0: Boccherano pulls that out a little bit.

775
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

776
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:41,168
Speaker 0: But that's on.

777
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,120
Speaker 0: uninstall is just a great song.

778
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,260
Speaker 0: And also there's a little bit of intertwining with form and function.

779
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,640
Speaker 1: But they also change the closer halfway through the show.

780
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,222
Speaker 0: They do.

781
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,228
Speaker 0: I like that.

782
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,918
Speaker 0: Old shows used to do that a lot more.

783
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:54,826
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

784
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,020
Speaker 1: Different shows mix it up differently.

785
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,860
Speaker 1: I mean, there are some shows that are mixing it up constantly.

786
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,820
Speaker 0: I think the closer of Boccherano was designed solely to make people who didn't cry at the end of the episode cry during the closer.

787
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, possibly.

788
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:15,180
Speaker 0: So spoiler line, if you have not seen or read the mono, do not listen past this point.

789
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,820
Speaker 0: We're going to spoil the ever living shit out of the show.

790
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,440
Speaker 0: The rest of this episode is going to be all mad.

791
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,586
Speaker 0: Remember when X happened?

792
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:24,160
Speaker 0: Yes, you do not want these things spoiled for yourself.

793
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,860
Speaker 1: OK, so my two most awesome parts are two.

794
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,500
Speaker 0: I'm going to write down my two and we'll see if they're the same.

795
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,043
Speaker 0: Give me a sec.

796
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,480
Speaker 1: I hear the two most awesome parts of Boccherano.

797
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,742
Speaker 1: Right.

798
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:34,027
Speaker 1: Ready?

799
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:34,820
Speaker 1: Awesome.

800
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,560
Speaker 1: Part number one was the fat kid, right?

801
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,262
Speaker 1: Because.

802
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:39,826
Speaker 1: All right.

803
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:42,240
Speaker 1: So the fact is this fat kid, I forget his name.

804
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,296
Speaker 1: I don't forget most of the characters names, but basically the whole show, he's the quiet kid who doesn't do a lot.

805
00:41:47,398 --> 00:41:47,560
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,400
Speaker 1: But then eventually he's chosen to be the next pilot.

807
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:50,784
Speaker 1: Right.

808
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:52,399
Speaker 1: So you wonder what he's going to do.

809
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:56,480
Speaker 1: So the thing is, he goes out in his first battle.

810
00:41:57,101 --> 00:42:01,980
Speaker 1: And, you know, the thing is, the robot is powered by like life energy.

811
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,860
Speaker 1: So he just doesn't move the robot at all.

812
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,938
Speaker 1: He stands perfectly still.

813
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:06,264
Speaker 1: And the fat.

814
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:10,907
Speaker 1: So basically, if he can survive this battle without moving the robot, he won't die.

815
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,000
Speaker 0: Well, he thinks he won't die.

816
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:20,080
Speaker 1: And he's correct, because what happens is the the enemy robot just freaking kills itself and he makes it through the battle.

817
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,491
Speaker 1: And of course, that was symbolic of the fact that his mom just tried to kill herself, et cetera, et cetera.

818
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:26,200
Speaker 1: It's telling his story.

819
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,522
Speaker 1: Right.

820
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,920
Speaker 1: So that was totally awesome.

821
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Speaker 1: But the thing is, he comes back for another fight.

822
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:32,903
Speaker 1: Right.

823
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:35,060
Speaker 1: And he says, you know, his mom is happier now.

824
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,060
Speaker 1: And, you know, his his sort of life is better.

825
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,300
Speaker 1: And he realizes that, you know, everything's cool.

826
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,220
Speaker 1: And, you know, his story, you know, he resolves his personal issues and he's going to fight to save the world.

827
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,419
Speaker 1: It's a world worth saving.

828
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:47,679
Speaker 0: His fight is great.

829
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,560
Speaker 1: So all the fights up until now, the robots is giant robot.

830
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,600
Speaker 1: It's kind of slow and it's kind of lumbering.

831
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:03,260
Speaker 1: And it's usually about whether the character is going to like, you know, not care and step on all the buildings or try not to kill normal people and reduce collateral damage.

832
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:03,583
Speaker 1: Right.

833
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:05,679
Speaker 1: But the robot has always been slow and lumbering.

834
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:07,340
Speaker 1: And like the lasers are useless.

835
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,619
Speaker 1: It always has to punch and kick.

836
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:14,662
Speaker 1: And so the fat kid gets in it and they're like, oh, man, he's the most dangerous kind of robot.

837
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:22,760
Speaker 1: And when he fights in the robot, like the robot moves like like elegantly and quickly, like it like it like it spins and kicks.

838
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:25,180
Speaker 1: And he's just wicked dangerous and just wins immediately.

839
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,419
Speaker 1: And it's like, fuck, yeah, look at that.

840
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:34,479
Speaker 1: And no one else in the entire rest of the show is able to match controlling the robot in like an equally awesome way.

841
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:35,045
Speaker 0: OK.

842
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,620
Speaker 1: And it was totally wicked awesome.

843
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,600
Speaker 0: But I have one other alternate because my number one awesome scene number one or maybe number two, because I have to get to the better one later.

844
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,042
Speaker 0: All right.

845
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:48,459
Speaker 0: The gun in the beginning when the kids go to the military and the military is like, well, call that.

846
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,366
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

847
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:51,160
Speaker 0: And the kids are like, don't beatle, don't beatle.

848
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:51,422
Speaker 0: Come.

849
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:52,359
Speaker 0: And he just fucking appears.

850
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:54,278
Speaker 0: And the military guy is like, what the fuck?

851
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:54,901
Speaker 0: Jeez.

852
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:55,485
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,399
Speaker 1: And he pulls a gun on it right away.

854
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

855
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:00,479
Speaker 0: Just immediately pulls the gun on it.

856
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,719
Speaker 0: And of course, he gets screwed by that.

857
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,563
Speaker 1: He gets teleported and then his hand lands on the ground, which is important for the rest of the show.

858
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:09,579
Speaker 1: Well, they actually that matters for the whole show.

859
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:10,844
Speaker 0: That is my whole.

860
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:12,048
Speaker 0: but why?

861
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:19,280
Speaker 0: that is my number two of my two awesome moments, because not only did that matter, it was a Chekhov's hand holding a Chekhov's gun.

862
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:19,600
Speaker 0: Yep.

863
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:29,100
Speaker 0: So I'm hoping the fact that like no better example of people reacting the way you would expect people to react than him pulling the gun and threatening the thing.

864
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

865
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:33,383
Speaker 1: So I'm hoping my number one awesome moment is the same as your number one awesome moment.

866
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:41,020
Speaker 1: So towards the end of the show, they basically the plot is that they build these towers, right, to use the what's it called program?

867
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:42,091
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

868
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:42,780
Speaker 0: Uninstall.

869
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:43,361
Speaker 1: Right.

870
00:44:43,421 --> 00:44:50,560
Speaker 1: So the you know, because basically the humans are evil and they try to like use the robots technology to get like free energy.

871
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:51,799
Speaker 1: But actually it's a trap.

872
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:52,222
Speaker 1: Right.

873
00:44:52,483 --> 00:45:00,720
Speaker 1: And the people who made the robots actually want you to do that, because basically it's a trap in that if you lose, your universe gets destroyed because you lost the fight.

874
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:04,920
Speaker 1: If you win, it's because you stole the technology of the robot to win.

875
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:12,659
Speaker 1: And that technology, when you use it, means that the people who made the robots get you and they take the life energy of your whole earth and they get you.

876
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,292
Speaker 0: So, you know, they're so far beyond exactly.

877
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:18,280
Speaker 1: the earth almost falls for this trap.

878
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:29,179
Speaker 1: They build a tower and that tower basically, as long as it exists, is going to make the humans lose, even if the robot wins all the fights and all the robots appear near the tower and for all the fights.

879
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:32,220
Speaker 1: And then they build a second tower and shit gets crazy.

880
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:39,934
Speaker 1: But then once the traitor girls, when she fights, the first thing she does is blow up both towers, just like, boom, boom.

881
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:50,619
Speaker 0: And I was like, yes, because, yes, there are a couple of times where a kid will use the robot, you know, they can do whatever they want in the robot, like someone uses the robot to get revenge on the teacher.

882
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:52,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

883
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:53,679
Speaker 0: The thing is that teacher.

884
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,780
Speaker 1: And then the sister is still defending the teacher.

885
00:45:57,261 --> 00:46:00,380
Speaker 0: And shit, that was, you know, the whole show.

886
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,820
Speaker 0: I'm thinking, don't die, don't die for all the characters.

887
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,260
Speaker 0: The fact that that guy didn't die, that guy needed to die.

888
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,789
Speaker 0: Something fierce.

889
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:09,059
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

890
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, that sort of stuff is all Naruto.

891
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,843
Speaker 1: Definitely.

892
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:20,640
Speaker 0: But the fact that these kids have control of this thing and the fact that the other robot is going to fight just kind of, they got 48 hours to win the fight.

893
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:27,318
Speaker 0: If you can like you can do whatever you want in the robot, that the other robot with all the other kids in it from the other world just waits and lets her do this.

894
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:44,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, because so you could tell some of them have figured it out because that's the thing is like they didn't know what the deal was, but like some other people know what the deal is and they sort of, you know, basically, you know, the fact that you're fighting the role, you know, it's a robot that you're fighting is actually a robot from another universe.

895
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:45,008
Speaker 0: We're assuming everyone's seen.

896
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:47,783
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,372
Speaker 1: But it's right.

898
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,120
Speaker 1: But it's that the kids don't learn this until later on.

899
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,620
Speaker 1: So some of their opponents know this and some of them don't.

900
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,448
Speaker 0: Well, the slow reveal was like it.

901
00:46:56,729 --> 00:47:00,064
Speaker 1: it bothered me was I saw you sort of guessed it, but you didn't know it.

902
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:07,499
Speaker 0: It's one of those things where you guessed technically like, yes, you were correct in one level, but you didn't really figure out the scope of it.

903
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:07,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

904
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:17,684
Speaker 0: And like when the one robot just kills itself or when they just rip it open and look inside and see all those other kids looking back at him and then when they figure out what the lights mean.

905
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:24,803
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's that that other robot killed itself during an away match just so that it could, you know, teach something to the robot that it was fighting against.

906
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:27,620
Speaker 1: You know, if they did it on the home mat, you know what I'm saying?

907
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:28,304
Speaker 0: Yeah.

908
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:28,628
Speaker 0: Yeah.

909
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,700
Speaker 1: It's it's stuff like that.

910
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,880
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it would have worked also if they did it on the home match.

911
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:38,400
Speaker 0: But, you know, the point is when they get to the world where everyone's helping out the robot because the whole world is banded together to survive.

912
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:39,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

913
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:39,979
Speaker 0: Now, think about that.

914
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,748
Speaker 0: You're rooting for these.

915
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:41,860
Speaker 1: I like that one.

916
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:43,140
Speaker 0: You're rooting for these kids.

917
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,307
Speaker 0: You don't want them to die.

918
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:49,480
Speaker 0: And you know that their entire they're the characters, you know, their entire universe and world will be destroyed if they lose.

919
00:47:50,102 --> 00:47:56,284
Speaker 0: But in that fight, when they win, they are knowingly doing the exact same thing to someone else.

920
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:58,599
Speaker 1: But there was also the one where they open up.

921
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,689
Speaker 1: It was that the same one where they open up the the pod and I forget which one that was before they squish it.

922
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:04,959
Speaker 0: That was because they had to be sure.

923
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:07,699
Speaker 0: And then how each character reacts to that.

924
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:13,920
Speaker 1: Well, the one guy, the person who was doing it was like, nobody look, you know, he's like, don't look, I'm going to look and don't look.

925
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:15,420
Speaker 1: But everyone else looked anyway.

926
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like, you know, he had to know, but he didn't want to know because he was going to die.

927
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:19,979
Speaker 1: So it didn't matter if he knew.

928
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:21,920
Speaker 1: But everyone else had to live with knowing.

929
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:28,937
Speaker 0: So, yeah, as an aside, this show gets bonus points for being for making me cry when I see a chair.

930
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:30,483
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

931
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:35,350
Speaker 0: In some random context, like I see a chair is like, oh, but no, my it was really weird.

932
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:36,020
Speaker 1: It was really cool.

933
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,660
Speaker 1: Like usually shows will have like things that go with characters like a Gundam show.

934
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:41,560
Speaker 1: Everyone has a robot that sort of goes with them.

935
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:41,903
Speaker 1: Right.

936
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:43,640
Speaker 1: In this show, it's a shared robot.

937
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:48,142
Speaker 1: So they came up with these chairs and everyone has a chair that really speaks to their character.

938
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:48,986
Speaker 0: And they really do.

939
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:51,680
Speaker 0: the chair, the air on chair, the little cushion.

940
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:52,363
Speaker 1: Yeah.

941
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:54,760
Speaker 1: The guy who's like, you know, his mom is the science lady.

942
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,559
Speaker 1: He's got the air on chair because he's got mad moneys.

943
00:48:56,941 --> 00:49:02,480
Speaker 1: And the girl who like, you know, sits at home in the living room as living room chair with the Ottoman and, you know, the poor kid.

944
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:10,380
Speaker 0: And, you know, there's like the school desk because his dad runs the school and the fact that, you know, there's the whole Russian roulette thing of who gets picked and whatever.

945
00:49:10,923 --> 00:49:12,498
Speaker 0: And normally an anime would just let that be.

946
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:17,320
Speaker 0: But toward the end, when you just find out, no, that whole rigmarole is just bullshit.

947
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:19,120
Speaker 0: He's just picking because he's an asshole.

948
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

949
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:24,900
Speaker 1: It's like the show sort of makes you think that some of the things that are going on are like, you know, part of the mystery.

950
00:49:25,322 --> 00:49:27,100
Speaker 1: But then, no, really, it was just bullshit.

951
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:29,720
Speaker 1: The only real mystery is this stuff over here.

952
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,019
Speaker 1: And the rest of it was just, you know, fucking with you.

953
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:40,480
Speaker 0: But speaking of that, when you find that out is my number one moment when they pull the trick where you think the one kid has the gun and he goes to reach for it.

954
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,405
Speaker 1: That was so great.

955
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:41,766
Speaker 0: And it was.

956
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:44,280
Speaker 0: and then it was the traitor girl killing her own brother.

957
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:44,843
Speaker 0: Yeah.

958
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:47,319
Speaker 1: Well, her brother was like the real bad guy in the show.

959
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:48,448
Speaker 0: Well, she sort of.

960
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:49,700
Speaker 0: But then again, you understood.

961
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:51,748
Speaker 1: Like you think about it, right?

962
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,740
Speaker 1: The robots they're fighting against aren't really evil.

963
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,300
Speaker 1: They're just all fighting for their own survival.

964
00:49:55,781 --> 00:50:05,920
Speaker 1: And the, you know, the mysterious elders in the white shirts or whatever, you don't know enough about them to know whether they like they're secretly saving the universe and you don't realize it, you know, but and, you know, they're there.

965
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,260
Speaker 1: They feel bad about it, but they realize there's no other choice.

966
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,205
Speaker 1: That's a possibility.

967
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:12,260
Speaker 1: But for a game, what a dung beetle.

968
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:18,463
Speaker 1: He is just bad, especially because his replacement, your Coco Peli isn't even bad at all.

969
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:19,640
Speaker 0: But he's very sympathetic.

970
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,600
Speaker 0: But the fact that dung beetles replacement is pretty cool with their decision.

971
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:24,528
Speaker 0: He's like, all right, sure.

972
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:25,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's just like whatever.

973
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,540
Speaker 1: But dung beetle is just bad.

974
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,179
Speaker 1: He's a bad guy in the show.

975
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:35,752
Speaker 0: That whole scene where he pretends to have the gun and then she shoots him from behind and it actually works.

976
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:36,580
Speaker 1: I like how that works.

977
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,960
Speaker 1: Usually they'll come up with some excuse.

978
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,560
Speaker 1: I was like, actually, they just freaking shot him to death and just awesome.

979
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:42,163
Speaker 0: All of that.

980
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:46,985
Speaker 0: The fact that, you know, he's pleading for his life and she just keeps shooting him.

981
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:49,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was well, she's going to die anyway.

982
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that was an intense scene.

983
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,484
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

984
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:55,100
Speaker 1: My favorite scene, especially the way they drew him getting shot.

985
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,563
Speaker 1: Like that.

986
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,400
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you just kept getting smashed.

987
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,371
Speaker 0: That was harsh.

988
00:50:58,391 --> 00:50:59,000
Speaker 1: It was rough.

989
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:01,380
Speaker 0: Hands down, my favorite scene in the whole show.

990
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,343
Speaker 1: Really?

991
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:07,342
Speaker 1: I think I'm still with my to my because it was my fat kid and I blow up the two towers.

992
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:10,339
Speaker 0: One that those two characters asked to avoid him.

993
00:51:10,783 --> 00:51:12,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did it well.

994
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:19,680
Speaker 0: And the whole scene that followed where then she fights and she reveals all the secrets and you learn that all the Russian roulette stuff is just complete bullshit.

995
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:23,717
Speaker 0: And you basically get everything you need to run out.

996
00:51:23,737 --> 00:51:24,360
Speaker 0: the rest of the show.

997
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:33,960
Speaker 1: A significant portion of the show is spent concentrating on what's his name with who has the sister, Kata Chan and their quote, their mom, who they don't realize is their mom.

998
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,148
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I love all those.

999
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:40,285
Speaker 1: that whole thing is pretty much like the main focus towards the end of the show.

1000
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:46,195
Speaker 1: That's really those are the final those the characters that are left at the end that pull, you know, they sort of they start.

1001
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:51,282
Speaker 1: those characters sort of stick out a little bit in the beginning, but then they sort of fade away to concentrate on the others.

1002
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:54,560
Speaker 1: And then about halfway through the show, they push them to the forefront.

1003
00:51:54,721 --> 00:52:00,544
Speaker 1: So it's always whatever character is currently in the focus and them and they're the focus until the end of the show.

1004
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:04,362
Speaker 1: And we didn't even talk anything about the mom, the military lady.

1005
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:06,931
Speaker 0: She again, she is basically asked for a boy.

1006
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:11,046
Speaker 1: She reminds me a lot of the gym teacher in Ozumanga Dao.

1007
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:12,189
Speaker 0: I can see a little bit.

1008
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:12,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little bit.

1009
00:52:14,516 --> 00:52:16,101
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, this show is just great.

1010
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:16,844
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1011
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:22,401
Speaker 1: And the oh, and oh, don't even get me started about the sanctuary ask diet man.

1012
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:29,357
Speaker 0: Ah, the whole politics and everything about the show is great.

1013
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:35,320
Speaker 0: Also, the science mom, who was kind of evil, but good in the end, mostly evil, but not all totally evil.

1014
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,450
Speaker 0: She reminded me to a strong degree of Ritsuko from Ava.

1015
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:43,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of character, same flaws, a little bit of paprika ish.

1016
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little bit in this a little bit.

1017
00:52:45,277 --> 00:52:49,353
Speaker 1: But yeah, Ritsuko from Ava totally dead on more like, you know, also Genda.

1018
00:52:49,393 --> 00:52:49,795
Speaker 1: All right.

1019
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:50,698
Speaker 0: Come on.

1020
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:51,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little bit.

1021
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:55,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was also there was the show had just really great.

1022
00:52:55,738 --> 00:53:01,400
Speaker 1: I'm not sure it was stolen from the manga while stolen if it was from if this was from the manga or not.

1023
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:27,712
Speaker 1: But like the show just had great design and sort of everyday things like, you know, like we talked about chairs, like chairs are often a very a big focus for like industrial designers, you know, but like, you know, like people's apartments and, you know, all these sorts of everyday cars, you know, the show is it's not in the distant future, but it's in sort of a semi future earth, you know, like the helicopters and all these sorts of just everyday things were just so well designed, like.

1024
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:36,694
Speaker 1: I'd like to live in a world where everything was designed that nicely probably would only be the Japanese portion of the world where everything is already sort of designed better than the rest of the world.

1025
00:53:36,754 --> 00:53:44,071
Speaker 1: But, you know, it was just like the fact that I don't know if that was just from the manga, that great sense of design or if, you know, any of that came from the animators.

1026
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:45,357
Speaker 1: But regardless, it's there.

1027
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:48,312
Speaker 1: And it really, you know, it gives the show a great feel.

1028
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:56,385
Speaker 1: And it also makes you wonder, like, you know, the show is all about these robots from different universes that are all pretty similar universes.

1029
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:57,752
Speaker 1: They all have a, quote, Earth.

1030
00:53:58,093 --> 00:53:58,254
Speaker 1: Right.

1031
00:53:58,294 --> 00:54:02,031
Speaker 1: You wonder if, you know, you sort of take it for granted that this is Earth, Earth.

1032
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:06,450
Speaker 1: This could just be a story of any of the Earth, Earth's that are all fighting against each other.

1033
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:11,349
Speaker 1: It does not necessarily our Earth, Earth, our, you know, Bocorano ours.

1034
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:11,971
Speaker 1: Yes.

1035
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:16,168
Speaker 1: You know, but I mean, it could be, you know, any Earth, but it just is.

1036
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:17,817
Speaker 1: this is the Earth that you're paying attention to.

1037
00:54:17,877 --> 00:54:26,182
Speaker 1: But, you know, this could be the story of a universe that's alternate to ours that, you know, it has different cars and different helicopters and different, you know, I don't know why that reminded me, but I was not.

1038
00:54:26,242 --> 00:54:28,294
Speaker 0: I was talking about the music and then we got distracted.

1039
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:35,606
Speaker 0: The reason I wanted to bring up the music, because the guy who did the music, Yuji Nomi also did the music to Hinatori and The Cat Returns.

1040
00:54:36,088 --> 00:54:36,811
Speaker 1: Oh, that makes sense.

1041
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:38,557
Speaker 0: And Whispers of the Heart.

1042
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:45,162
Speaker 0: He actually he's the guy who did, you know, he wrote he did the music and did the arrangement of the core theme song.

1043
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:46,847
Speaker 0: He didn't do much else.

1044
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:50,076
Speaker 1: That's a good music guy.

1045
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:50,497
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1046
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:51,079
Speaker 0: So there was.

1047
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,627
Speaker 1: he's probably done a lot of non anime music work.

1048
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,855
Speaker 1: That's why he's so good, but good stuff.

1049
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:57,762
Speaker 0: And the show is just great.

1050
00:54:57,823 --> 00:54:58,445
Speaker 0: And I loved it.

1051
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:00,153
Speaker 1: And I it's not like.

1052
00:55:00,354 --> 00:55:04,391
Speaker 1: it's not like, you know, some of the I mean, there's some other Gonzo shows that are OK ish.

1053
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:04,632
Speaker 1: Right.

1054
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,158
Speaker 1: Like we can talk about last exile.

1055
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:07,503
Speaker 1: We can talk about Gonkatsu.

1056
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:11,534
Speaker 1: Oh, this is the only amazing Gonzo show.

1057
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:12,817
Speaker 1: It's only 24 episodes.

1058
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,290
Speaker 1: The manga is going to come out from this eventually.

1059
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,558
Speaker 0: We don't need to convince you to watch it.

1060
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:17,927
Speaker 0: You already watched it or you're an idiot.

1061
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,154
Speaker 0: You got the whole thing spoiled for you.

1062
00:55:19,174 --> 00:55:20,541
Speaker 0: But, you know, good job, genius.

1063
00:55:20,802 --> 00:55:21,486
Speaker 0: Watch it anyway.

1064
00:55:21,506 --> 00:55:22,149
Speaker 0: The show is great.

1065
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:28,618
Speaker 0: And I have a feeling it's a show that, you know, five or six years from now, I'll probably rewatch at least one more time at some point.

1066
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:28,739
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1067
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:34,541
Speaker 1: I want to basically forget a lot of the show over a year or few and then rewatch it again with some people.

1068
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:39,340
Speaker 1: I watch the whole thing alone really quickly because one is some people haven't seen it.

1069
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:43,699
Speaker 1: So I can just watch them cry because it'll be a laugh instead of having to cry.

1070
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,183
Speaker 1: I'll be able to laugh or I'll be able to go.

1071
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:55,257
Speaker 0: It's kind of like when I was watching Gundam seed again and I was watching it with Emily and I knew like when the island scene was going to happen.

1072
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:56,261
Speaker 0: and I'm just watching.

1073
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:57,927
Speaker 0: I watch her the whole time, not the scene.

1074
00:55:57,947 --> 00:55:59,030
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

1075
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:06,279
Speaker 1: But I think there's some people that we've we have befriended recently who have not seen attack the gas station.

1076
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:07,763
Speaker 0: It's getting about time to watch that again.

1077
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:09,929
Speaker 1: Attack only one.

1078
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:14,302
Speaker 0: Hey, Bocorano attack only one because there only is one.

1079
00:56:14,363 --> 00:56:14,664
Speaker 1: I know.

1080
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,653
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying there's this joke to be made there.

1081
00:56:17,296 --> 00:56:17,657
Speaker 0: All right.

1082
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:18,441
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

1083
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:20,626
Speaker 0: But this show was just so great.

1084
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,188
Speaker 1: Show now.

1085
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:26,463
Speaker 0: that whole end scene was so like mundane and yet brilliant.

1086
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:29,296
Speaker 1: I like how they saved the big robot battle for the end.

1087
00:56:29,356 --> 00:56:29,557
Speaker 1: Right.

1088
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:29,778
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1089
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:31,526
Speaker 0: But at the same time, like how long it is.

1090
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:33,233
Speaker 0: And he like brought food in with him.

1091
00:56:33,313 --> 00:56:39,577
Speaker 0: And and then there's that whole super long dental molt where you get like the sister telling the story.

1092
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:40,902
Speaker 0: And that was when I cried at the end.

1093
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,892
Speaker 0: I didn't cry in the entire last episode, really.

1094
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:43,896
Speaker 1: Well, no, it wasn't.

1095
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:46,607
Speaker 1: it wasn't just that the sister was telling the story.

1096
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:50,823
Speaker 1: It was that the three the siblings of the other kids show up.

1097
00:56:50,863 --> 00:56:51,144
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1098
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:51,586
Speaker 1: It's like.

1099
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:53,252
Speaker 1: I real I didn't really like.

1100
00:56:53,393 --> 00:56:57,290
Speaker 1: if I was smart, I would as soon as I saw the kids fighting, I would have known that they were those kids.

1101
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,585
Speaker 1: But it's like the girls like you're taught you're those kids.

1102
00:57:00,686 --> 00:57:01,972
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, shit, they are.

1103
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:02,856
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.

1104
00:57:03,117 --> 00:57:04,362
Speaker 0: And the show basically ends on.

1105
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,787
Speaker 0: let me tell you the story.

1106
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:06,489
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1107
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:13,354
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, and you wonder, like, you know, if it had been that other world with like the people trying to cheer the robot on.

1108
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:14,077
Speaker 1: Right.

1109
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:15,182
Speaker 1: They wouldn't have had it.

1110
00:57:15,283 --> 00:57:15,443
Speaker 1: Right.

1111
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:17,614
Speaker 1: But in this world, it's like, will anyone even believe it?

1112
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:20,426
Speaker 1: You know, it's like so few people know the real deal.

1113
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:22,172
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, man.

1114
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:28,995
Speaker 1: Well, especially all those like political and Yakuza moverings to like conceal from the public what was going on.

1115
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:32,367
Speaker 1: And oh, man, that was like all that cool stuff in the middle.

1116
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:35,519
Speaker 1: But it's sort of it was sort of Ava-esque in a in a way.

1117
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:41,624
Speaker 1: in that, you know, when the show sort of starts out right, it's sort of like, you know, everyone is just living the normal life.

1118
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:42,648
Speaker 1: Everyone's going to school.

1119
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:43,170
Speaker 1: Right.

1120
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:47,325
Speaker 1: And then sort of like the world knows something's up.

1121
00:57:47,726 --> 00:57:53,951
Speaker 1: And in the final stages, it's like the world is quiet and it's just the people who are involved and the rest of the world disappears.

1122
00:57:54,554 --> 00:58:00,460
Speaker 1: And that's Ava follows the same pattern of, you know, OK, in the beginning, everyone's going to school, having a good time.

1123
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:03,449
Speaker 1: Then the world knows this shit is going down.

1124
00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:06,198
Speaker 1: And then the world is empty except for nerve.

1125
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,706
Speaker 1: And Bocorano has that same thing as Ava.

1126
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:10,250
Speaker 1: It's Ava.

1127
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:11,313
Speaker 1: It's Utena.

1128
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:12,537
Speaker 1: It's right.

1129
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:13,480
Speaker 1: What was the other show?

1130
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,813
Speaker 0: Death Note in that it's so that it's so procedural and so precise.

1131
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:17,994
Speaker 1: Right.

1132
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:19,037
Speaker 1: It's all these.

1133
00:58:19,298 --> 00:58:21,204
Speaker 1: it's all these great things.

1134
00:58:21,986 --> 00:58:22,227
Speaker 1: Good.

1135
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:29,082
Speaker 1: It's amazing aspects of all these great shows combined into a show that is not quite like any of them, but is like all of them.
