1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,710
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 10th 2012.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,231
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:16,540
Speaker 0: I'm sky and this is geek nights tonight Pokemon conquest.

4
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:26,629
Speaker 0: Let's do this aka no bungas ambition with Pokemon.

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,754
Speaker 0: So we've.

6
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:43,147
Speaker 0: you might yell at me Scott for saying an old joke, but it's not a joke It's an anecdote so long ago, right guys We uh, we're doing like early geek nights and we might have talked about this on the show once And someone find what episode it was.

7
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:47,442
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I figured out came up but also we at a convention.

8
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:51,390
Speaker 0: we're talking about video games and We brought this up as well.

9
00:00:51,732 --> 00:01:05,050
Speaker 0: I think we were talking about like mispronunciations and how Like before the internet had audio and stuff like half the people who play D&D said dro and the other half said drow And sigil and sigil and those sorts of like mispronunciations.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,573
Speaker 0: Manga Otakon are being quashed by the fact that there's an internet.

11
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:09,994
Speaker 1: Yep.

12
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,539
Speaker 0: That was at least the argument.

13
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:18,467
Speaker 1: and Well, the Internet's also hurting it too because people are reading a lot on the internet and there's not always talking.

14
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:24,130
Speaker 1: and true So you can people are learning words that they wouldn't have learned without the internet, but they're not hearing the words.

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:40,796
Speaker 0: There's also a weird like resistance culture Like I know people who have been to more Otakons than we went to who to this day Despite hearing tens of thousands of people say Otakon and being corrected by us tens of thousands of times We'll say Otakon.

16
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm like, no that's a character in Metal Gear Spelled with the C and you're an idiot.

17
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:48,966
Speaker 1: It's the thing that I don't understand right?

18
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,137
Speaker 1: sometimes Let's say you're having conversation with someone.

19
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:51,438
Speaker 1: right?

20
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:59,130
Speaker 1: if I if someone's talking to me and they've mispronounced a word Oh, you probably end up using the word because it's we're having conversation involving that topic.

21
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll pronounce it correct.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,344
Speaker 0: you do what I do.

23
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:02,310
Speaker 0: I don't correct them.

24
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,133
Speaker 0: I just now.

25
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:03,656
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

26
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,379
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

27
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,263
Speaker 1: I use it correctly.

28
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:08,476
Speaker 1: if I do that I know that I am thinking.

29
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,650
Speaker 1: I will use it correctly and hopefully teach this person to connect pronunciation.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,017
Speaker 0: Maybe they're thinking the same thing.

31
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,610
Speaker 1: Maybe they're thinking the same way that lady.

32
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,810
Speaker 0: I was biking the other day and you know, we always complain about people who don't know how to use gears on their bike.

33
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:24,205
Speaker 0: And this lady is like you can change gears.

34
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:30,170
Speaker 0: and I realized she's yelling at me Because she doesn't know how gears work and she was giving the opposite advice.

35
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:33,358
Speaker 1: She was she knew that you could change them.

36
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,783
Speaker 1: that's a big step up.

37
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,630
Speaker 1: for most people she gets points.

38
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:41,309
Speaker 0: I had that problem when I've got my first geared bike when I was like eight.

39
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,276
Speaker 1: It's like I knew I could change them.

40
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,702
Speaker 1: But when do you change?

41
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:46,549
Speaker 1: which one do you use when people don't know?

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,946
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a car where it tells you this up like at a panel or something.

43
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:55,590
Speaker 0: and then as an example I was like, so if any of you you know, just believe this how many of you played?

44
00:02:55,851 --> 00:03:04,435
Speaker 0: Bunga's ambition on the NES and the audience was like, oh No, Bunga was a very common Pronunciation.

45
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:08,914
Speaker 1: you don't because when it's written out on the screen if you don't look at it closely You don't see that other a there.

46
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:16,770
Speaker 0: so you think I know Bunga and if you don't Watch it like if you're not an anime fan where you just kind of like you start to poor historian.

47
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:28,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anime or Japanese person Like if you hear a lot of Japanese and you don't speak it you'll start to recognize that no the guy's name is not It's yeah, yeah, but you don't notice this.

48
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,168
Speaker 0: a Pokemon those from Tenchi manga.

49
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,404
Speaker 0: in high school I was hanging out with someone and someone's like blah blah blah.

50
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:34,867
Speaker 0: Yeah kids.

51
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:41,336
Speaker 0: We're all like Yeah, okay So, yeah, no Bunga.

52
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:47,940
Speaker 1: what the worst thing is is I hate it when people admit there's some people who know the right pronunciation right.

53
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:53,212
Speaker 1: so they'll know that it's manga and not manga and And They will.

54
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,760
Speaker 1: there won't be arguing that it's that they're right.

55
00:03:56,121 --> 00:04:03,806
Speaker 1: They'll say yeah, it is manga, but they won't say Manga, they'll say yeah, you're right and then they'll continue to say manga even though they're.

56
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,555
Speaker 0: every time I have those I always interrupt and it.

57
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,843
Speaker 1: the thing is are now I'm questioning.

58
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:09,986
Speaker 1: Sometimes I do that.

59
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,090
Speaker 1: I'll say Titan.

60
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

61
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:13,738
Speaker 1: Are they doing the same?

62
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:14,782
Speaker 0: Well, that's why it's tricky.

63
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,466
Speaker 0: I mean, how often do we say Chipotle?

64
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:17,329
Speaker 1: That's right.

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:27,110
Speaker 0: It's been like wow a friend of ours a few weeks ago was like you guys realize it's Chipotle right and I was like Yeah.

66
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,234
Speaker 0: And I didn't like.

67
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:33,090
Speaker 0: I didn't know what to say other than to explain in a very like laborious sense.

68
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:36,628
Speaker 0: We mispronounced it on purpose because we find it vaguely funny.

69
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,879
Speaker 0: Is that not hipsterism?

70
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,203
Speaker 1: I learned something today.

71
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:42,045
Speaker 1: I learned something today.

72
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:46,630
Speaker 1: you learn what is specifically a Chipotle pepper.

73
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:48,772
Speaker 0: It's.

74
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:54,015
Speaker 0: I know what it tastes like but I don't know what it looks like, do you know What anything about it?

75
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:59,550
Speaker 0: I know that that Chipotle flavor is what is in for example Chipotle sauce.

76
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,013
Speaker 1: It's Chipotle.

77
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,940
Speaker 1: Yeah is a smoked jalapeno.

78
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:03,562
Speaker 1: That's it.

79
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,267
Speaker 1: It's not actually a different pepper.

80
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:05,970
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

81
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,094
Speaker 1: I just learned that today.

82
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:08,038
Speaker 0: I learned today.

83
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:09,604
Speaker 0: like I always make a so did you?

84
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:13,885
Speaker 0: I learned yeah, it's okay And you I make enchiladas right like all the time.

85
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,129
Speaker 1: I like enchiladas So with the chicken and the sour cream.

86
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,759
Speaker 0: Anyway, enchiladas however are way harder to make than quesadillas.

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,009
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, so usually I'll be like I'm gonna make quesadillas like yesterday.

88
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,890
Speaker 0: I was like I'm gonna make quesadillas, and then I was thinking about it.

89
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,652
Speaker 0: I was like you know what.

90
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,002
Speaker 1: nah fucking in fact ate lunch at Chipotle today.

91
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:31,564
Speaker 0: Nah.

92
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:32,989
Speaker 0: Did you have a quesadilla?

93
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:48,190
Speaker 0: No But So I was like wait a minute Why don't I just put roasted poblanos in there, and I never thought to do that before and it was awesome.

94
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,077
Speaker 0: That story doesn't go anywhere.

95
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:51,458
Speaker 0: I was just.

96
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,165
Speaker 1: no I was trying to end this all right.

97
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:53,467
Speaker 1: Let's go.

98
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:54,149
Speaker 1: news all right.

99
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,534
Speaker 1: So gaming time right.

100
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:56,416
Speaker 0: it is gaming time.

101
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:57,078
Speaker 1: check this out.

102
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:57,560
Speaker 1: I'm checking.

103
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,970
Speaker 1: everyone heard about this steam green light coming soon.

104
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,350
Speaker 1: There's not a whole lot of info so we can't we're not gonna heavily analyze.

105
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:08,610
Speaker 0: Does this mean that captain dicks and the dick squad is gonna be on steam now?

106
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,607
Speaker 1: So is the thing right?

107
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:20,264
Speaker 1: so The way steam works now is you submit your game to valve and they have like a panel of people to decide What goes on steam and what doesn't go on aka dartboard?

108
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:21,088
Speaker 0: Yeah?

109
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,882
Speaker 1: What they want to do is they want to change it to.

110
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:40,130
Speaker 1: basically it seems like They're gonna have like a reddit of game submissions, so if you have a game you submit it to You know steam and then Users of steam game players will go and vote like yeah that game.

111
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:47,436
Speaker 1: We want to be able to buy that game as fuck that one right and vote games up and down and the high and then You know the valve people.

112
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:59,390
Speaker 1: I think they still make the final decision, so if everyone votes up poop on a stick It doesn't mean it's gonna show up on steam, but they're gonna greatly take into consideration What games gamers want to be on steam and what games they don't want to be on steam?

113
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,749
Speaker 0: It's a nice sort of save.

114
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,598
Speaker 0: I mean it'll be.

115
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,770
Speaker 0: it's easy for something to admit.

116
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,696
Speaker 0: I mean how many times even do we as connected to the internet as we are like miss out on a big boat That's about to set sail.

117
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:09,945
Speaker 1: Here's the thing I don't understand.

118
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,368
Speaker 1: all right We have this problem where it's like.

119
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:19,967
Speaker 1: okay We don't want to just accept everything in the universe to be on steam because it'll be an Atari problem.

120
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,179
Speaker 1: And also you know iOS problem.

121
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:25,890
Speaker 1: right you search for any apps on iOS, and it's impossible.

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:34,967
Speaker 1: But I think that part of that problem with iOS even though they do have a panel approving things is Just it's impossible to search and organize.

123
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:40,508
Speaker 0: right Because categories and things are arbitrary and usually way too broad.

124
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:47,828
Speaker 1: exactly I think this is actually you know the real problem is why don't they just let every game on steam?

125
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,309
Speaker 1: that isn't Sarah for example viruses and malware and games that don't work.

126
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:59,035
Speaker 1: I think what they should do is they should let almost everything on steam and Then have the voting.

127
00:07:59,296 --> 00:07:59,978
Speaker 1: so if a game.

128
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,470
Speaker 1: It's on steam you could buy it right, but it's never gonna be on sale.

129
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:04,630
Speaker 1: It's never gonna be on the home page.

130
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,850
Speaker 1: It's never gonna be promoted, but it's there if you dig way.

131
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,393
Speaker 0: But Maintaining this vote.

132
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:15,970
Speaker 1: know the but the users are voting which games are gonna be on the steam home page.

133
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:24,356
Speaker 1: Right control it that that's a separate thing because main main still have the user voting But have the voting after the game is in Maintaining the games on steam.

134
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:28,290
Speaker 0: if you let everything in adds a lot of kind of back-end work and grooming and mate.

135
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,194
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the thing.

136
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:29,456
Speaker 1: is you?

137
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:32,390
Speaker 1: they need to give the game developer more control?

138
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,429
Speaker 0: No, no because then it's too easy for malware and bullshit to slip in.

139
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,221
Speaker 1: Obviously you know you would approve the people individually.

140
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:40,683
Speaker 1: I don't know.

141
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:41,706
Speaker 1: yeah, that's maybe.

142
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:42,509
Speaker 1: I don't know.

143
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,350
Speaker 1: I improve the people as opposed to the game.

144
00:08:45,631 --> 00:09:01,786
Speaker 0: I do not want that to happen because well one I don't want to make more work for them and two I don't care because I Already have too much information available in all senses on the internet at all times, so I need Good gatekeepers and valve is really good at being a gatekeeper of gaming right now.

145
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:02,990
Speaker 1: Maybe I should make that.

146
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,029
Speaker 1: I'll just make generic download stuff store.

147
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,549
Speaker 1: Anyone can sign up and oh, but you're just curate it.

148
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,036
Speaker 1: No I don't curate at all.

149
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:13,370
Speaker 1: anyone who wants to can upload things into the store.

150
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,905
Speaker 0: There's gonna be child porn porn spam and viruses and sell them for money.

151
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:18,150
Speaker 0: child porn spam viruses.

152
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,639
Speaker 0: And then you use nothing, but child porn spam viruses.

153
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,790
Speaker 1: the users will vote and report spam and viruses.

154
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,610
Speaker 0: And then what are you gonna?

155
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,159
Speaker 0: Do go manually delete the thousands of.

156
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,303
Speaker 1: no it'll work the same way.

157
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:34,469
Speaker 1: that like you know red and all those other things work so full of garbage except for the.

158
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:36,533
Speaker 0: It won't work.

159
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,078
Speaker 1: nobody why read it works.

160
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:42,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's no overhead to hosting some text that no one up votes.

161
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:43,213
Speaker 1: That's right.

162
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,404
Speaker 0: There's a little bit more overhead to hosting 100 megabyte files.

163
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,976
Speaker 1: I'm not hosting your files for you I'm just writing the store part.

164
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,484
Speaker 1: all right so and the listing part.

165
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:57,770
Speaker 1: you have to host the file somewhere And then when someone buys it takes the link that you gave and gives it to the person.

166
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,696
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any money in that.

167
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:03,830
Speaker 1: I take the cut in between because everyone's gonna be coming to my site to buy stuff.

168
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:04,494
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

169
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,910
Speaker 0: they're gonna be going to the more curated walled gardens.

170
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:11,804
Speaker 0: Even my stupid x230 has this Lenovo like marketplace.

171
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,068
Speaker 0: I had to uninstall internal.

172
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:13,931
Speaker 0: Oh god They're like.

173
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,258
Speaker 0: hey you want to buy apps for your laptop.

174
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:16,920
Speaker 1: Well.

175
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:17,502
Speaker 0: I'm like.

176
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,350
Speaker 0: yeah, it's called software on a computer.

177
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:22,993
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's.

178
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:28,830
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for Monday to really talk about that, but you don't reminded me of it reminded me of Packard Bell Navigator.

179
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:44,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the other thing about this green light is I'm kind of wondering You're gonna get into a situation Eventually where there's like some indie game studio, and they make a game and maybe people like it But it doesn't get enough support And it doesn't get in.

180
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,546
Speaker 1: and then like you made a game And now you can't get it on Steam because no one likes it even before it's been out.

181
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,674
Speaker 1: It's like oh That'll be drama.

182
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,625
Speaker 0: I think the bigger drama there will also be drama.

183
00:10:54,645 --> 00:11:01,490
Speaker 0: be drama because if no one likes it No one will notice or care Like it, but not enough yeah, so there won't be drama.

184
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:09,870
Speaker 0: Drama if there is a game that enough people want in that is offensive to the vast majority of people.

185
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,650
Speaker 1: What about a situation where you get a game?

186
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:27,410
Speaker 1: That's like pretty big and it's in there But like no one wants it in there like rail the train simulator right something like that comes along where it's high production value a lot Of money, but that train simulator imagine if green light was around before the train rail whatever rail works.

187
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,224
Speaker 1: I have a feeling you're putting green light was around before rail works.

188
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,550
Speaker 1: You think rail works that have made it in.

189
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:38,638
Speaker 0: I have a feeling you're putting a lot more power in the hands of this thing that I think is actually Doesn't have a lot of power then why is it?

190
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,341
Speaker 1: why they've been doing it.

191
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:43,898
Speaker 0: I think all it is very simply Not not just no not PR.

192
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,143
Speaker 0: I trust valve more than that.

193
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:46,810
Speaker 1: let us see what's coming on the pipeline.

194
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:58,310
Speaker 0: I think it's nothing more than a Check to make sure that valve does not miss out on a ship that is sailing because they're too busy making games to pay Attention to what's going on in the Internet?

195
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:00,373
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

196
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:05,349
Speaker 0: it would be the equivalent of if we had a thing like we'd set up a Twitter thing.

197
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,529
Speaker 1: So someone's got a hot new indie game, but valve doesn't know about it because they haven't heard about it.

198
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's got a following coming out of like left field in some community somewhere.

199
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,625
Speaker 1: So now it's easier to submit it to steam and it gets a bunch of up votes.

200
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:24,229
Speaker 0: if there's an organized community They'll get it on the radar, so it's right Goes on here and votes up like you know.

201
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:25,673
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

202
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:30,710
Speaker 0: valve has the final say apparently and you know what hello kitty game that could be good.

203
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,095
Speaker 1: I'm just saying they'll go vote up.

204
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,481
Speaker 1: some nonsense of course.

205
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,770
Speaker 0: the thing is that stuff's been going on forever.

206
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,653
Speaker 0: I mean the UF.

207
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:40,789
Speaker 1: is valve gonna put their own games in here to fear what they should work on.

208
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,457
Speaker 0: I Would do that if I was valve.

209
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:47,721
Speaker 1: I would launch green light and then half-life 3 like the first thing in there And I'd be like when it gets enough votes.

210
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:48,690
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll work on it.

211
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,450
Speaker 1: I would say that would get everyone to sign into green light.

212
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,983
Speaker 0: I would set the threshold of votes it requires to something like 95% of the world population.

213
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:56,203
Speaker 0: right.

214
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,607
Speaker 1: the other thing is that oh?

215
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:07,630
Speaker 1: Right the only people are gonna go to green light are Hardcore people or people who are sent from another community to go there specifically for a specific game.

216
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:15,510
Speaker 1: So a lot of the games that have the appeal mostly to an audience that is not green light users is going to be missed.

217
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:18,373
Speaker 1: But then again those people probably aren't steam users But some of them are.

218
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:25,166
Speaker 1: so so that's a lot of games are gonna get missed even in green light because the huge audience For those games isn't green lighting.

219
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:33,757
Speaker 0: thus I think the only real use of this in the end is to make sure that valve does not miss something that has a Dedicated following, but otherwise would be off the radar.

220
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:39,194
Speaker 0: Yes, so in much more really kind of ludicrous news Kickstarter is great.

221
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,620
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the penny arcade thing.

222
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:40,921
Speaker 0: That's it.

223
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:41,844
Speaker 0: That's Wednesday.

224
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,290
Speaker 1: There's a lot of kick-starting going on.

225
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,197
Speaker 1: Kickstarter was sort of like all right.

226
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,124
Speaker 1: it peaked and it was sort of well.

227
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:48,529
Speaker 1: No it's peaking again.

228
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,884
Speaker 1: Well keeps making new peaks it is but news wise not any other wise.

229
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:53,145
Speaker 1: yes.

230
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,375
Speaker 0: now the penny arcade Kickstarter Just to get it out here.

231
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:06,897
Speaker 0: I think is both fine and a good idea, and I'm not giving any monies - no I'm not giving money to it either probably But that's not gaming news.

232
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,442
Speaker 0: That's culture and whatever.

233
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:16,241
Speaker 0: I want to talk about a different Kickstarter that Got as it was at $500,000 when I looked at it at work, and then when I got home.

234
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,866
Speaker 0: It's at 1.3 million dollars.

235
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:18,548
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

236
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:21,137
Speaker 0: and It's nothing.

237
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,534
Speaker 0: It's I I am Our people.

238
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:24,936
Speaker 0: well.

239
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,186
Speaker 0: No I was about to ask our people this naive.

240
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:27,688
Speaker 0: Yes.

241
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:31,479
Speaker 0: Yes I we know that because of what kinds of kickstarters do?

242
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:31,941
Speaker 0: very well.

243
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:38,649
Speaker 0: This is a Kickstarter to make the A new kind of video game console.

244
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:41,015
Speaker 0: Why a like?

245
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:48,558
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, I think it's oh, yeah except I Maybe it's more like.

246
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,390
Speaker 1: you know if you look you can see the word you in there.

247
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,777
Speaker 1: So maybe it's like instead of you.

248
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:57,058
Speaker 1: uh it's oh, yeah, I think it's oh, yeah like Because it would be like you if the Y was in front.

249
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:57,761
Speaker 1: so be like ooh.

250
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:10,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, all right, so it's got 10,800. and well let me refresh Eleven thousand three hundred and ninety backers and it got another hundred thousand dollars in like the last two minutes.

251
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:13,033
Speaker 1: so it's a basically one and a half million.

252
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:25,569
Speaker 0: as of this podcast recording make what is essentially an Android phone with no data plan that plugs into your TV to play shitty Android phone games on your TV.

253
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,617
Speaker 0: That is what this is.

254
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,170
Speaker 0: I see no indication that is a game controller.

255
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:42,871
Speaker 1: Also, I guess HD output yeah up to 1080p and it can do a few other things such as I guess can it like stream video or something right Netflix or website?

256
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:52,503
Speaker 0: so far no it'll have an app store that looks suspiciously like the Xbox 360 interface and It's basically the netbook of game consoles.

257
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:55,456
Speaker 0: not even it's not even that No one's.

258
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,150
Speaker 0: this isn't powerful enough to make good games.

259
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,822
Speaker 1: No, it's just play the mobile phone games, but on your TV instead.

260
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:05,789
Speaker 0: not a lot of people are going to go for this.

261
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:12,559
Speaker 1: man I really need I really need a game controller to play anger birds on my TV And and I need to buy a whole console just for that.

262
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,590
Speaker 1: so so here's anger birds on Xbox, huh?

263
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,949
Speaker 1: you think if anger birds needed to be on TV would already be on Xbox Live.

264
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:26,606
Speaker 0: and How come there's no touch screen interface for the kinds of games?

265
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:27,509
Speaker 0: It'll probably be on it.

266
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,222
Speaker 1: I think that has a controller.

267
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:30,170
Speaker 1: so they're gonna make controller.

268
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,813
Speaker 0: you know they.

269
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:36,754
Speaker 0: they think that people are going to make dedicated games for this thing and The examples they show.

270
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,399
Speaker 1: can I just use any Android game?

271
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,684
Speaker 0: that where the inputs can be slightly modified like for they think people will Design games for it, and it'll be easy to do so because you develop in the same way.

272
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,956
Speaker 0: you develop a game for an Android phone Now or an Android tablet.

273
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,284
Speaker 0: they show Minecraft as an example of a game.

274
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:55,683
Speaker 0: They want on here, okay Yeah, minecraft with a controller would be great.

275
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:58,595
Speaker 1: minecraft is already on the Xbox I know with a controller.

276
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,025
Speaker 1: I know so it's already.

277
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:02,169
Speaker 1: you can also get it for iOS.

278
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:08,443
Speaker 0: So there's so many things wrong with this project that I don't even know where to begin.

279
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:10,047
Speaker 1: Why do you even want this?

280
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:11,030
Speaker 1: why?

281
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,657
Speaker 0: it's first off.

282
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:21,032
Speaker 0: 1.5 million dollars for a business venture like this is Not even small peanuts 1.5.

283
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:25,068
Speaker 0: Million dollars doesn't exist in terms of like real company venture capital.

284
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:27,977
Speaker 1: yeah Also, how are you gonna even though?

285
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,080
Speaker 1: This is cheap hardware?

286
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,450
Speaker 1: How many of them do you think you can make?

287
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,654
Speaker 0: Not even just that like.

288
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:38,926
Speaker 1: the controller is probably right if it's any if it's a good controller.

289
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,009
Speaker 1: It's probably 50 bucks.

290
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,665
Speaker 0: Here's what the Kickstarter gets.

291
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:52,490
Speaker 0: one They will convert their prototype into production ready models and get all the regulatory approvals to deliver developer kits.

292
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:56,269
Speaker 0: So we can have you know even though the console will include an SDK at launch.

293
00:17:56,931 --> 00:18:02,989
Speaker 0: Three place production orders to build the things and for ideally fund some first-party games.

294
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:11,210
Speaker 1: Yeah people seem to Really Latch on to these things.

295
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:14,882
Speaker 0: This is not one.

296
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:18,709
Speaker 0: if this happens There's no use for it.

297
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:22,159
Speaker 0: I can't conceive of a world where I would use this.

298
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,344
Speaker 0: my laptop is more powerful than this.

299
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,771
Speaker 0: my old laptop is more powerful than This.

300
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:27,895
Speaker 1: I think it's.

301
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:28,818
Speaker 1: you know what's weird.

302
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:37,055
Speaker 1: usually when you see these things right the projects like this Raspberry Pi Arduino type things right there always Development things right.

303
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,910
Speaker 1: it's like hey everyone buy the Raspberry Pi cheap super cheap Linux computer.

304
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,642
Speaker 1: That's barely powerful enough to do anything, but it's super open.

305
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:47,050
Speaker 1: you can buy this and develop for it.

306
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:52,030
Speaker 1: It sells a lot, but it sells to programmers and hobbyists.

307
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:56,786
Speaker 1: This is super open, but it's like why does this need to go to?

308
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,920
Speaker 1: Hobbyist do we really need this?

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,935
Speaker 1: it's called a computer Right.

310
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,944
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna read some text from this cuz it's just.

311
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,210
Speaker 0: it reeks of this.

312
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,859
Speaker 0: It doesn't reek of a scam like the Phantom console.

313
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:15,529
Speaker 0: this reeks of naive idealism hmm, but it's working.

314
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,486
Speaker 0: because One point I mean it read five again.

315
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:22,714
Speaker 0: All right it got another $50,000.

316
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,344
Speaker 0: all right in the time we were talking.

317
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:28,535
Speaker 1: kickstarter good website auto Frequently updating that number.

318
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,926
Speaker 1: unlike YouTube can't update its view number about this project.

319
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,230
Speaker 0: We love console games.

320
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,870
Speaker 0: There's something about a big HD TV and digital surround that fills up a living room.

321
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,813
Speaker 1: So I have a computer.

322
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,375
Speaker 1: platformer.

323
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:42,730
Speaker 0: sports games arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen.

324
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:46,629
Speaker 0: It's how most of us grew up gaming, but some people are missing out.

325
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:48,095
Speaker 0: We get it.

326
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:55,167
Speaker 0: smart phones and tablets are getting all the new titles Because I can care and they're what's hot.

327
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:59,314
Speaker 0: yeah The console market is pushing developers away And we're seeing a brain drain.

328
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:05,863
Speaker 0: some of the best most creative game makers are focused on mobile and social games because these platforms are more developer friendly.

329
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:10,245
Speaker 0: I Think the computer is the most developer friendly.

330
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:10,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.

331
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,116
Speaker 0: So I don't know what to say.

332
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:16,721
Speaker 0: all of you who bought into this.

333
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:17,946
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a prediction.

334
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:25,561
Speaker 0: I predict That you will not get your Within a reasonable time.

335
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:29,976
Speaker 1: I have kick-started right the hex bright estimated delivery.

336
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:37,118
Speaker 0: oh, okay, sorry estimated delivery for September was Reserving your username in their app store.

337
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:40,127
Speaker 0: Oh here's where this is extra bullshit.

338
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:40,890
Speaker 0: quote.

339
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:47,810
Speaker 0: We're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition at least some gameplay has to be freed.

340
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,730
Speaker 0: We borrowed from the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends.

341
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,096
Speaker 0: Anyway, triple town and many others.

342
00:20:55,137 --> 00:21:02,236
Speaker 0: developers can offer a free demo with a full game upgrade in-game items or powers Or ask you to subscribe.

343
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:06,090
Speaker 1: this isn't even open if they're forcing developers to do certain things.

344
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:11,209
Speaker 0: And as we've talked about on gig nights There is evidence that if you provide a demo of your game your games not gonna sell.

345
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,487
Speaker 1: Well Xbox also forces every game to have a demo.

346
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:21,498
Speaker 0: I know anyway, but Borrowed from the free-to-play This it's not even like.

347
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:25,110
Speaker 0: this is just an open console like that makes it easy to make indie games on the computer.

348
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:26,928
Speaker 0: They're basically really yeah.

349
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:30,412
Speaker 0: Getting this at the same kind of bullshit That's on phones.

350
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:35,530
Speaker 0: people only play those games because they're waiting for like their subway sandwich to get done, right?

351
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:38,296
Speaker 1: I do see a space.

352
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:46,141
Speaker 1: if someone could move in to where if you could actually get enough developers on board Beforehand pre not post to where.

353
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:57,238
Speaker 1: if you made a console for the television That was open where anyone can make a game for it That you could make a move because you'll get a bunch of games that Microsoft and Sony will not have.

354
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:08,610
Speaker 1: and if you can maybe do a steam greenlight situation You know then you could maybe you know work your way in especially since the consoles That are big now are dated and they're letting them go too long.

355
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,749
Speaker 0: Well, I if I did that it would be a software console as in it'd be software like boxy.

356
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, that run is a platform for running games a little you mean like steam a little more.

357
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:24,230
Speaker 0: I was about to say Curated and walled garden and like self-contained because steam really is launching his external applications.

358
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:25,754
Speaker 0: I'd have it all embedded.

359
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,080
Speaker 0: and yeah more like a phone app store.

360
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,186
Speaker 0: Anyway, but that's not what this is.

361
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,669
Speaker 1: No, it's not not at all.

362
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:42,623
Speaker 1: So, I don't know why you would give money to this But the point I was making before is I can't really 11,000 Started this flashlight and I why did you kick start that?

363
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,746
Speaker 0: it's not even that cool.

364
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,010
Speaker 1: It's a pretty awesome flashlight.

365
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:46,135
Speaker 1: I needed a flashlight.

366
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:49,469
Speaker 1: It's super durable and is super LED super bright.

367
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,404
Speaker 0: You can buy super durable LED flashlights for less than you kick started by now.

368
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, they still haven't received it.

369
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,383
Speaker 1: So if those guys can't even make a flashlight they do keep updating there.

370
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,870
Speaker 0: That was the hex light, right?

371
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:04,870
Speaker 1: Right hex bright, whatever you they haven't delivered the flashlight yet.

372
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:09,554
Speaker 1: Then when you think you're getting a fucking game console from these other guys now Here's my other.

373
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:11,443
Speaker 1: who even are these people that are doing this?

374
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:18,748
Speaker 0: I'm going to oh A video game project in Los Angeles by oh, yeah, so they also called themselves.

375
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:22,779
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay There's not a lot of information about them.

376
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,050
Speaker 0: They've got some quotes that are great.

377
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:28,568
Speaker 0: so they got like people in the industry to talk about them.

378
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:33,141
Speaker 0: and Here is a quote from oh they changed the quotes.

379
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:34,165
Speaker 0: I had a quote I was gonna read.

380
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,470
Speaker 0: that was there before and it's gone.

381
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,235
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a wrong quote.

382
00:23:37,495 --> 00:23:38,278
Speaker 0: No, it was a right quote.

383
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:38,819
Speaker 0: Basically.

384
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,580
Speaker 0: It was our friend who made karate ka and oh wait Here it is Jordan.

385
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,803
Speaker 0: Yes.

386
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:49,123
Speaker 0: Yes Who wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99?

387
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,030
Speaker 0: plug straight into your TV and gives you an access to?

388
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,167
Speaker 0: a huge library of games.

389
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,693
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

390
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:54,537
Speaker 0: That's a true statement.

391
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:55,139
Speaker 0: I would love that.

392
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think this is it Does that?

393
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's their library of games right now?

394
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:10,245
Speaker 1: no games I just I don't even Whatever, let's move on.

395
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:19,399
Speaker 0: Okay So anyway things of the day.

396
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:24,976
Speaker 0: so, you know in the morning, you got your wallet got your sleeves Got your I forget whatever else.

397
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,547
Speaker 0: he said heaves and I guess he meant clothes.

398
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:41,075
Speaker 0: He was holding up a tie And then you can't find your goddamn keys and you're late for work while the phone keys, yep the mantra of the everybody everybody in the whole world There are people who don't have phone.

399
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:44,325
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's or key modern society world.

400
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:48,991
Speaker 0: So anyway, not anyway this is just a kind of This.

401
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:53,083
Speaker 0: the song sounds like the kind of thing that Lonely Island would do.

402
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:55,270
Speaker 0: the animation is actually pretty good.

403
00:24:55,673 --> 00:25:05,371
Speaker 0: This is clever pretty original Pretty funny and I think what sells it is the face that the guy is making when he's looking into the places where his keys Aren't.

404
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,574
Speaker 1: yeah, I watch this.

405
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:07,537
Speaker 1: I enjoy it.

406
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:08,419
Speaker 1: We'll watch again.

407
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:08,499
Speaker 0: Yep.

408
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:12,148
Speaker 0: He just the guy has such a pissed-off face.

409
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,010
Speaker 0: It's perfect.

410
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,430
Speaker 0: Now I'll warn you this is a tangential discussion.

411
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:17,776
Speaker 0: You know, those are.

412
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:21,170
Speaker 0: there are ghettos on the internet like especially in YouTube.

413
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:31,110
Speaker 0: like once you click on like you get to certain videos and then the Recommendations like suddenly turn into a certain set of videos and they kind of all funnel you eventually toward that he-man.

414
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:36,295
Speaker 0: So, I think that's the end.

415
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,682
Speaker 0: that's that's like you'll end up there no matter what.

416
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:48,030
Speaker 0: but anyway this video You can learn on your own like it's for like a webcomic and the guy has a ton of other animations and things.

417
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:54,587
Speaker 0: But it is very close to the dog-headed girl ghetto on YouTube.

418
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:56,194
Speaker 0: Just warning.

419
00:25:56,214 --> 00:26:03,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you start clicking on videos that are related to these videos You will get into interestingly furry territory in a hurry.

420
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:05,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I'm saying.

421
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:06,343
Speaker 0: I want it.

422
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,348
Speaker 0: I want to do a show on.

423
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:11,140
Speaker 1: I guess you found this because you were browsing the furry things.

424
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:16,219
Speaker 0: actually, you know how I got to this from ponies From friendship is witchcraft stuff.

425
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,189
Speaker 0: All right, and I got to that from face cow.

426
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,524
Speaker 1: Yeah Calfery, huh?

427
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:33,706
Speaker 1: Bovine no file no furry cow fucker Highland cattle Wikipedia.

428
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:37,575
Speaker 0: Oh There's some cow furries right there.

429
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,517
Speaker 1: All right.

430
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,800
Speaker 1: Okay, go on.

431
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:47,462
Speaker 1: so check this out, you know the old D&D cartoon the incredibly old Old-old school D&D cartoon that was on Saturday morning.

432
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,550
Speaker 0: It's a shame the guy who made it died before he made it.

433
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:57,230
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway These guys took that cartoon and I think they edited a bunch and they have a 13-minute clip here.

434
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,090
Speaker 1: That is hilarious.

435
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:08,645
Speaker 1: Where what they did is they redubbed the whole thing and what they redubbed it with is their own voices and they did a pretty Good job, but it's not the voices of the characters.

436
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:12,817
Speaker 1: It's the voices of People at a D&D tables.

437
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:15,244
Speaker 1: like you hear the dice rolling whenever they get pop.

438
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:22,828
Speaker 1: whenever guys about to cast a spell or something or Attack the bill pause you'll hear a dice rolling sound effect and the guy would be like you take a ticket hit.

439
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,478
Speaker 1: And I'm like wham right and it's like it's.

440
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:27,400
Speaker 1: it's really funny.

441
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,403

00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,023
Speaker 1: this is pretty old.

447
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:39,949
Speaker 1: It was uploaded to YouTube in January 2011 but I haven't seen it before or I don't remember it.

448
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:45,937
Speaker 1: It could have even been a thing of the day before who knows but here it is again or the first time Mm-hmm.

449
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,545
Speaker 0: All right.

Speaker 1: the rest of the convention not our responsibility.

454
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:09,527

Speaker 1: And so it's like well if we're gonna go let's apply for a panel.

486
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:35,908
Speaker 1: so we did.

487
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:39,548
Speaker 0: yep We looked at the site were like oh there this seems to be only for professionals.

488
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:41,320
Speaker 0: fuck it Let's go for it anyway doesn't hurt.

489
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,904
Speaker 0: They'll fly.

490
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:45,256
Speaker 0: yeah, and now we've Presented every packs you've ever been to.

491
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:51,620
Speaker 0: but so what the after that one I emailed I was like so when are we allowed to talk about it?

492
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,270
Speaker 0: cuz you know you know some cons are dicey about that stuff.

493
00:29:54,732 --> 00:30:03,124
Speaker 0: Since then every time you get the official email it says in red You are free to tweet talk whatever you can say anything you want.

494
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,128
Speaker 0: It's totally okay.

495
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:04,890
Speaker 0: It's not a secret.

496
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:05,590
Speaker 0: Say what you want.

497
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,619
Speaker 1: This is a thing that I hate.

498
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:15,570
Speaker 1: right is like you know I'm the kind of person where if you tell me secrets like if I worked at a company that Apple I would just tell everything and I'd be fired, but I would just tell everything.

499
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:16,614
Speaker 0: I don't tell something.

500
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:20,973
Speaker 0: if it if I don't see a need to depends like if there's malfeasance I'll tell.

501
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:22,539
Speaker 1: if I owned a company like Apple.

502
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,206
Speaker 1: I wouldn't keep any secrets right.

503
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,642
Speaker 1: I just be like tell everyone I just all those secret procedures.

504
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:27,327
Speaker 1: I just get rid of them.

505
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:31,073
Speaker 0: well I think I think what I'm gonna do next year for kinetic on scheduling This is super.

506
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:36,112
Speaker 1: not that might have consequences, but that's just how you know I am scheduling next.

507
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:48,392
Speaker 0: next year is set a begin date like January for submissions and Set a final submission date of like X. But I'm gonna set a second date in like April or maybe even March or yeah March.

508
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,540
Speaker 0: and the idea is once that date comes.

509
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:54,114
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna start scheduling stuff Live.

510
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,240
Speaker 0: like I pick one panel and approve it.

511
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,290
Speaker 0: it appears on the website with its slot like right then.

512
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:04,410
Speaker 0: So the website will show live from like March through July.

513
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:07,150
Speaker 0: Every schedule change as it happens.

514
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:20,179
Speaker 1: The point is is that I get into that you get into a situation like this right where for example if I was working at Apple and I was an employee and I told secrets they'd fire me and I'm like oh whatever You know cuz like how badly do I want to keep that job?

515
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:24,661
Speaker 1: not so badly right, but if Pax tells me a secret It's like this horrible dilemma.

516
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:32,026
Speaker 1: It's like one hand Do not keep secrets other hand do not want to be banned from Pax.

517
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:39,348
Speaker 1: the way I get around Cuz I it's like you know fired from Apple and whatever banned from Pax.

518
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:44,073
Speaker 0: no I don't know what I do if I get banned from Pax, dude I should try.

519
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:47,049
Speaker 1: we should do a fake ban from Pax.

520
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,777
Speaker 1: I obviously can't do this now right But I could get so.

521
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:57,159
Speaker 1: I could go with some enforcers and they could pretend to ban you from Pax And you would be like Scott.

522
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,528
Speaker 0: if I were the enforcers I?

523
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:11,650
Speaker 0: would Actually make you think that they for real banned you for doing the banning son, maybe That's also good, but the point is I can't do that to you now.

524
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,941
Speaker 1: You can't do it to me now, but we can do it to someone else.

525
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:17,138
Speaker 0: It doesn't listen to show hey Dave Riley You're banned from Pax.

526
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:17,701
Speaker 0: He's not gonna.

527
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:18,445
Speaker 1: Is he gone to pet.

528
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:21,165
Speaker 0: I don't know Connecticut.

529
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:24,332
Speaker 0: oh Yeah You know what.

530
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:24,814
Speaker 0: next year.

531
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,099
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get my tool.

532
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,785
Speaker 0: Oh shit cuz he was.

533
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:30,310
Speaker 0: he's expressed some interest But it was too late to work it all out.

534
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,105
Speaker 0: We're gonna try to get him next year because there was a need.

535
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,150
Speaker 1: or anime content.

536
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:43,350
Speaker 0: There was a dearth of anime content submitted and Two of my biggest anime content providers both had unrelated personal problems and had to bail at the last minute.

537
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,521

00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:42,450
Speaker 1: we are gonna do a show on it.

558
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,927
Speaker 1: We just sort of been missing Thursday shows lately because of holidays and Kinetic on Thursday.

559
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,945
Speaker 1: So on is this Thursday, so no show.

560
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:54,390
Speaker 0: you guys know Generally in the winter when we do a lot of extra shows and in the summer is when we miss a lot of show.

561
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,368
Speaker 1: So probably the next Thursday show which is probably two weeks from now is gonna be Qteen84.

562
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,058
Speaker 1: Read that book is a good book.

563
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,745
Speaker 1: rim pick another book club.

564
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,200
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tell you guys right now I'm deciding between two books.

565
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:06,106
Speaker 1: What are the two books?

566
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:06,690
Speaker 1: the two books?

567
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:13,672
Speaker 0: I'm deciding between are the Great Gatsby Because I've never actually read it and the movie that's coming out looks Super good.

568
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,799
Speaker 1: I will gladly read any book.

569
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:19,007
Speaker 1: that is a famous classic that I have not read which is most of.

570
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:20,455
Speaker 0: so here's the other Option.

571
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:29,594
Speaker 0: this book was referenced Numerous times in Deus Ex so there's a nerd connection and It looks really interesting.

572
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,981
Speaker 0: It's called the man who was Thursday.

573
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:52,766
Speaker 0: never heard of it Colin a nightmare written in 1908. all right, it's about an Edwardian era London police officer who pretends to be an anarchist to infiltrate an anarchist group and Ends up taking over that group because he's more charismatic and persuasive about anarchism than anyone who runs it.

574
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,688
Speaker 0: and Shit goes crazy from there.

575
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,410
Speaker 0: Supposedly this book is famous and great in literary circles, but a lot of people otherwise haven't heard about it.

576
00:35:02,712 --> 00:35:07,674
Speaker 0: there's a BBC radio adaptation and Those are my two choices.

577
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:08,818
Speaker 0: I'm completely ambivalent.

578
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:09,400
Speaker 0: so guys.

579
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,183
Speaker 1: I'll take either one.

580
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:11,347
Speaker 0: Tell me which one.

581
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:12,230
Speaker 1: are you gonna do a vote?

582
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,040
Speaker 1: No, it's your pick so you can do whatever you want.

583
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:22,330
Speaker 0: you guys tell me you may or may not sway me I might do the great Gatsby just because the movies coming and I want to read it before that movie comes out.

584
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,841
Speaker 1: I'm considering for my next pick crime and punishment.

585
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:28,246
Speaker 1: I've already read that.

586
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:28,787
Speaker 1: I have not.

587
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:29,490
Speaker 0: I would read it again.

588
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,518
Speaker 0: I've read it like three times.

589
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,010
Speaker 1: I don't even know what it's about.

590
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:34,034
Speaker 0: You don't know what.

591
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:34,838
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what.

592
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:35,581
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

593
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,710
Speaker 1: it's about a guy who commits a crime and gets punished.

594
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:42,027
Speaker 0: Oh, so actually no It's about a guy convinced crime and doesn't get punished and as a result ends up.

595
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,855
Speaker 0: That's actually worse.

596
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,782
Speaker 1: Oh, I kind of also.

597
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:50,820
Speaker 1: I know that there's you might not know this There is an Osamu Tezuka crime and punishment manga.

598
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,823
Speaker 0: I know about that.

599
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:52,766
Speaker 0: I've not read it.

600
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,030
Speaker 0: I've never seen anything from it.

601
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:57,810
Speaker 1: I saw I saw the Japanese edition of one volume of it.

602
00:35:58,252 --> 00:36:00,804
Speaker 1: I kind of want to read that too, but it's not in English.

603
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:04,657
Speaker 0: Anyway, so anyway No, Bunga's ambition with Pokemon.

604
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,021
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the deal.

605
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:11,530
Speaker 1: You might not know about this or you might because we talked about it In Japan, they make a lot of games.

606
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,018
Speaker 1: Don't come out here and we're pissed because we don't get them.

607
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:17,450
Speaker 1: and they're usually these quirky games that are awesome on paper.

608
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:37,503
Speaker 1: for example, you know What's the game like, you know Phoenix Wright was a great example of a game That was awesome on paper and then they brought it here and oh wait It was actually awesome, but sometimes they have games over in Japan that are awesome on paper that we don't get like super robot wars Evangelion vs Voltron vs Macross vs every robot all the games not actually that fun.

609
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:39,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever haters.

610
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:39,369
Speaker 1: Okay.

611
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:41,117
Speaker 1: Yeah You know.

612
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:49,070
Speaker 1: so on the one hand We always want every game every piece of artwork period that is made to be released to the entire world.

613
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:59,209
Speaker 1: But on the other hand sometimes you're disappointed because like someone will go to the effort of translating something and we won't buy it Because it's not that good You know, so it goes both ways.

614
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:07,735
Speaker 1: So when we knew that they were making a Nobunaga's Ambitions X Pokemon mashup, we're like goddamn Awesome on paper.

615
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:09,140
Speaker 1: I must have it.

616
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:10,403
Speaker 1: and then they're like we're at.

617
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:13,353
Speaker 1: Nintendo didn't do the stupid thing They usually do.

618
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:16,950
Speaker 1: I actually translated to English and brought it out in the US.

619
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,050
Speaker 1: Hallelujah, praise be Nintendo for getting something right once in a while.

620
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:22,543
Speaker 1: So, of course, I even went to the.

621
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:23,370
Speaker 1: I didn't go on Amazon.

622
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,923
Speaker 1: I went to the Nintendo store and just bought it with cash.

623
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,690
Speaker 1: I was like it sold out on Amazon.

624
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:31,524
Speaker 1: I know here is your reward for doing the right thing.

625
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:32,087
Speaker 1: Nintendo.

626
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:33,031
Speaker 1: do it again And you'll.

627
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,175
Speaker 1: I'll be back in this store.

628
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:37,886
Speaker 0: So sometime soon now we geek-bited it and you know before.

629
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,170
Speaker 0: so we said it was pretty fun.

630
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,118
Speaker 0: We hadn't played it a lot yet.

631
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,209
Speaker 0: We still haven't beaten it.

632
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,547
Speaker 0: We haven't beaten it yet either but I played it a lot like nine hours.

633
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:46,352
Speaker 0: I'm almost Almost halfway.

634
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,118
Speaker 0: Yep, and we try the multiplayer.

635
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:49,703
Speaker 0: So now we can actually properly review it.

636
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:51,468
Speaker 0: You know what still pretty fun.

637
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,090
Speaker 0: It's okay.

638
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:53,836
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

639
00:37:53,856 --> 00:38:00,784
Speaker 0: It is a Babies-first Nobunaga's ambition which it makes me want to play.

640
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,750
Speaker 1: non babies Nobunaga's ambition.

641
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,379
Speaker 0: You may or may not like it.

642
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,430
Speaker 1: I know that but it still makes me want to try.

643
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:08,796
Speaker 0: Well, no, I'm gonna put it this way.

644
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:14,481
Speaker 0: It's more like baby's first gemfire Gemfires baby's first Nobunaga's ambition.

645
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:20,785
Speaker 0: Nobunaga's ambition is Not for babies not for babies, but also not what you might expect.

646
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,279
Speaker 1: in terms of how I played it I think I might have it on my Mac Plus.

647
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:28,615
Speaker 0: I should turn my Mac Plus on and I'm a big fan of those Koushibusawa kind of games.

648
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:29,860
Speaker 1: Well, those are your arrow biz.

649
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,604
Speaker 1: That's your jam.

650
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:31,990
Speaker 0: Yeah arrow biz gemfire.

651
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:34,441
Speaker 0: Then all these games are Koushibusawa.

652
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,225
Speaker 1: That's your favorite guy.

653
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:36,189
Speaker 0: It is my favorite guy.

654
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,803
Speaker 0: Those games are my jam to say what you just said.

655
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:40,365
Speaker 0: That's right.

656
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:45,883
Speaker 0: So anyway But it's it's really babies first like your options.

657
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:54,750
Speaker 0: You know, you have all these towns are basically Dump guys into like a mine to get some money, but money doesn't do fucking anything.

658
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:55,997
Speaker 1: You could buy items with money.

659
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:56,782
Speaker 0: gives a shit.

660
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,230
Speaker 1: I give items to your pokemons.

661
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,093
Speaker 1: I don't do so.

662
00:38:59,113 --> 00:38:59,575
Speaker 1: they can you.

663
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:02,084
Speaker 1: they have an extra option per Pokemon in battle.

664
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,430
Speaker 0: I've never used an item.

665
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,790
Speaker 0: Trivial he's the post never used a potion never used anything.

666
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,619
Speaker 1: I used one potion cuz I wanted like hey, oh an item use.

667
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:11,605
Speaker 0: I've never used an item.

668
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:19,110
Speaker 0: Okay, and You can't like level up a place in a way that matters like in other Koushibusawa kind of games.

669
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:32,959
Speaker 0: Your options every round for each province are things like recruit more troops Buy a third unit like especially, you know a fifth unit, I guess develop my agriculture Develop my defenses, you know stuff like that.

670
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,589
Speaker 0: Here are your options are basically fucking nothing.

671
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:38,824
Speaker 0: or Play the real game in a real city with real generals.

672
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:39,347
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

673
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm actually more fan of the might.

674
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:54,119
Speaker 1: here is a might and magic style with the towns and the battling, you know That is more real time ish and less of the turn-based grid like it I guess the except for when you get into a real battle.

675
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,021
Speaker 0: My trouble is that the overland part of this game is Extremely fiddly and difficult to use.

676
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,170
Speaker 0: like you get a new trainer who's awesome.

677
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:16,710
Speaker 0: Well, you're full the mechanics of moving that trainer to another place and then you're forced to move them back because you wanted in the first Place originally, it's really easy to accidentally delete your guys Like Scott did and it just sucks and it's super fiddly and it doesn't even matter.

678
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,481
Speaker 0: None of that shit matters.

679
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,689
Speaker 0: Just ignore it.

680
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:24,150
Speaker 1: The biggest problem I have with the game is that it has a lot actually has even though it's babies first.

681
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:27,004
Speaker 1: There's actually kind of a lot of stuff going on, right?

682
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,230
Speaker 1: Yes, and none of it matters.

683
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,870
Speaker 1: Well, none of it matters, but they also don't explain any of it, right?

684
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:38,470
Speaker 1: It's like they don't even explain to you At least maybe I'd skipped it in the tutorial that the the facing of the Pokemon matters.

685
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,013
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

686
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,020
Speaker 0: well that was obvious.

687
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,570
Speaker 0: any game where you can face it matters.

688
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:41,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

689
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,909
Speaker 1: But even realize that I was facing until someone pointed it out and then it's like you didn't even tell you.

690
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,034
Speaker 1: well How much does it matter?

691
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:50,824
Speaker 1: how much damage do I take from the side versus the back?

692
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:52,470
Speaker 1: What is the exact penalty?

693
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:59,758
Speaker 1: You know You'll go into a new arena to fight and they'll be like some water or something and they don't even tell you how the map Works like it's like.

694
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,450
Speaker 1: oh, I didn't know if I walk, you know There's like you go into a map of these balls.

695
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:08,440
Speaker 1: They don't even tell you that you can that if you hit the balls They bounce straight in a straight line and attack.

696
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:10,709
Speaker 1: they don't tell you that you started to figure it out.

697
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:12,155
Speaker 1: There's other stuff like.

698
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:18,880
Speaker 1: they're like, okay your Pokemon they increase link percentage when they level up But it's like well, what does link percentage exactly mean?

699
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,924
Speaker 0: It just makes them better.

700
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:25,748
Speaker 1: But yeah, they don't tell you that It's like a lot of the items are very poorly or not explained.

701
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,598
Speaker 1: my first What your guys abilities are.

702
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,441
Speaker 0: evolution starts?

703
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,950
Speaker 0: I'm like what the fuck and I hit a and then it cancels it.

704
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,100
Speaker 0: There's no way to start it up again.

705
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:37,690
Speaker 1: Like ah, oh Yeah, how did I even know that that you know kind of thing was going on?

706
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,617
Speaker 1: It's like they have all this stuff going.

707
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:46,390
Speaker 1: you go into a town and there's this energy thing with like pony geary And you're why isn't pony geary a thing in my little pony?

708
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,056
Speaker 0: I don't know.

709
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:53,570
Speaker 1: but like next to each Pokemon They'll be like this arrow that's pointing up or down showing you like whether the Pokemon is currently high energy or low.

710
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,690
Speaker 1: I think they do more damage and I guess it's better to go into a battle when the arrows are pointing up then down.

711
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,970
Speaker 1: So you want to sort of play this mini game of keeping the arrows of your army in sync.

712
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:16,244
Speaker 1: So they're all pointing up together and you attack and then they're pointing down and you wait until they're all pointing up again using pony gearies to synchronize them right here and then you attack again and it's like They don't explain that really at all.

713
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:19,181
Speaker 1: So that's my biggest complaint What exactly did the arrows do?

714
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:20,430
Speaker 1: how much effect do they have?

715
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:27,050
Speaker 0: The game is full like the places in towns seem to be able to level up but nothing explains what that means.

716
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:29,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it doesn't seem to matter.

717
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:37,384
Speaker 0: Anyway, thus my only like my primary complaint with the game is this It's extremely fiddly on the overland map and all the management stuff yet.

718
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:41,956
Speaker 0: None of that stuff matters for a good god Damn, no, they the enemy.

719
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:43,981
Speaker 0: It's like ever attacks you know.

720
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:47,330
Speaker 1: never have they tell you like yeah the enemy might attack you.

721
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:48,346
Speaker 1: It's never attacked me.

722
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:53,690
Speaker 0: yet I put all this effort in like making sure I had like a B team like on my border ready to like to fan and defend.

723
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,476
Speaker 0: It doesn't fucking matter doesn't mean shit?

724
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:56,519
Speaker 0: and winning battles.

725
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,964
Speaker 0: The AI is so derpy.

726
00:42:57,984 --> 00:42:59,669
Speaker 0: You'll win every battle no matter what?

727
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:06,450
Speaker 1: The battle has something like take all the banners and you can just sort of trick the bad guys into messing up.

728
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:17,489
Speaker 0: You can only lose a battle if you go into it like doubly overpowered in terms of levels and Pokemon or like All geodudes can't lose.

729
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:24,143
Speaker 0: It's just the overland stuff is boring pointless bullshit, but that's fine.

730
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:28,554
Speaker 0: the actual combat single-player Be.

731
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:38,750
Speaker 0: it's like one pinky's worth of the tactics of Final Fantasy tactics, which itself is a pinky's worth of the tactics of advanced wars.

732
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's a little there's a lot.

733
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:42,790
Speaker 1: There's a lot of rock versus going on as is Pokemon.

734
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:53,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually surprising how much the combat resembles at Pokemon even though it's a turn-based thing where you move around a grid Because it's the same things that matter.

735
00:43:53,479 --> 00:44:02,998
Speaker 1: It's like I'm higher level than you I win my I have water you have fire I win right as a. and where you move the guys Really doesn't matter all that much or it's more.

736
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,024
Speaker 0: It's not about guys moving like you.

737
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:05,966
Speaker 0: think of an advanced wars.

738
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:07,270
Speaker 0: It's more like formations.

739
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,170
Speaker 0: Like you'll have six Pokemon.

740
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:11,697
Speaker 0: What are the formation or formations?

741
00:44:11,737 --> 00:44:15,870
Speaker 1: you put them in based on their ability because every guy attacks in a different pattern of hex of?

742
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:16,452
Speaker 1: Squares.

743
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:23,445
Speaker 1: so if like a guy has a ranged attack you keep them in the back And you put the strong guy who can only attack one space in front of him up front.

744
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:26,095
Speaker 0: so basically well let's just talk about multiplayer combat.

745
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:27,058
Speaker 0: then because here's the deal.

746
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:36,264
Speaker 0: the way the multiplayer combat works is you pick a link limit and It let all the Pokemon you pick no matter what are raised or lowered to that link limit.

747
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:45,149
Speaker 0: the only limitation on that is if You set it very high and a trainer has a link limit with a particular Pokemon They only go up to that limit.

748
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:49,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said it to a hundred and a guy's derpy and can only link with like 30% on one Pokemon.

749
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:52,289
Speaker 0: Well that Pokemon is 30% don't use them.

750
00:44:52,559 --> 00:45:02,644
Speaker 1: Yeah so the problem is if you set it to a hundred and you only have like one Pokemon that could be at limit a Hundred and the other guy has six Pokemon that could be limited 100.

751
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:04,230
Speaker 1: He's gonna win cuz higher level than you.

752
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:10,150
Speaker 1: So you want to set it to a lower limit where everyone is basically maxed out across the board.

753
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:12,446
Speaker 1: But even that is still a problem.

754
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:20,090
Speaker 1: because okay Let's say I go in with a maxed out 30% draw teeny and rim has a dragonite that gets limited down.

755
00:45:20,913 --> 00:45:21,876
Speaker 0: That's basically what happens.

756
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:26,293
Speaker 0: Scott came in with his you know first and maybe a few second evolution Pokemon cuz

757
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:27,982
Speaker 1: I'm all I'm not as far through the game as and

758
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:29,289
Speaker 0: I'm like hey rapier

759
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:36,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like even though my guy gets boosted up to 40% and his guy gets brought down to 40.

760
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, your pichu is no match for my Pikachu.

761
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:44,360
Speaker 1: exactly his guys have better stronger abilities, right and have you know?

762
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:51,640
Speaker 1: Hit point whatever my Pokemon could one hit all of your Pokemon and it wasn't even like a type situation really.

763
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,312
Speaker 0: Oh, I did a not very effective one hit kill.

764
00:45:54,372 --> 00:46:00,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know Even though that level even though you're limiting right exactly.

765
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:01,198
Speaker 1: I mean you're limiting the level.

766
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:01,780
Speaker 1: level matters.

767
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:04,180
Speaker 0: I mean some Pokemon are just better than others.

768
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,816
Speaker 1: So you right you really want to only battle someone who's beating the game and you've also beaten the game.

769
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:13,060
Speaker 1: then the battles will be Less stupid but still really simple and not well, you know what?

770
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,063
Speaker 0: They're fun though.

771
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:15,849
Speaker 1: Despite being stupid a little bit fun.

772
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:19,160
Speaker 0: I have fun with it in the same way that I don't like leveling up.

773
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,720
Speaker 0: I can't play like single-player Pokemon games anymore unless it were an MMO.

774
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,457
Speaker 0: But there's a separate thing.

775
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:30,232
Speaker 0: But the combat in this or combat in Pokemon like playing Pokemon battle with a friend It's actually really fun.

776
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:32,687
Speaker 0: Even though it's kind of random It tickles a lot of the same itches that.

777
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:35,380
Speaker 0: well, it's sort of land to me bullshitty kind of war games.

778
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,545
Speaker 1: It's like playing Yomi.

779
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,020
Speaker 1: you get like rock-paper-scissors going on, but also some other stuff.

780
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:45,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I actually I think this will be a fun game to play with other people at PAX when we're hanging out.

781
00:46:45,992 --> 00:46:47,243
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think I can see.

782
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:59,055
Speaker 1: the problem is is that if you're hanging out with people and you're going to play portable multiple-layer DS games the winners still are Tetris Tetris Mario Kart Bomberman.

783
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:03,092
Speaker 1: Do we need any other ones sometimes advance or so?

784
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:04,980
Speaker 0: No, no one will play advance wars with me.

785
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,606
Speaker 1: The point is there's a whole lot of.

786
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:13,028
Speaker 1: it's actually quite a bunch of DS games that have some sort of multiplayer going on But most of them is you know, there's no reason to play them.

787
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,420
Speaker 0: And yeah, so this is an okay game.

788
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,624
Speaker 0: But um, I would only buy it if you're a Pokemon like hardcore, dude And you want more.

789
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:35,403
Speaker 1: you want this you want this kind of Pokemon or if you really want to give your money to send a message Nintendo to yes bring over the next weird Japanese game because that one will be better than this one Maybe.

790
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:42,580
Speaker 0: so if you don't already own this game Wait for it to be cheaper and then pick it up and even then you buy you copy.

791
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:44,257
Speaker 0: Don't also don't get it.

792
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:51,235
Speaker 0: If you really like advance wars or Final Fantasy Tactics and are good at those games You do not want to play this game.

793
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,932
Speaker 1: Yeah this game You got to like Pokemon.

794
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:56,771
Speaker 1: if you like Pokemon You're more likely to like this game than if you like Nova Naga's ambition.

795
00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:03,800
Speaker 0: now if you like Pokemon and you don't like games Like advanced wars and Nova Naga's ambition final fantasy tactics by all means get this game.

796
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,880
Speaker 0: And if you have fun with what's going on and level up you should level up to the other games, right?

797
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,454
Speaker 1: I also just want to say it's kind of awesome that in this game.

798
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:15,020
Speaker 1: You're like a Pokemon trainer.

799
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,326
Speaker 1: You got Pokemon you're battling and doing all this stuff.

800
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:20,595
Speaker 1: The bad guy is Nova Naga straight up.

801
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:21,478
Speaker 0: He's like yo dog.

802
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:22,340
Speaker 0: I'm Nova Naga.

803
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:24,928
Speaker 0: I'm trying to wake up the Pokemon that'll destroy the world.

804
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:27,355
Speaker 1: That is pretty awesome.

805
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:29,462
Speaker 0: His generals got like you There's.

806
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:30,224
Speaker 0: it has.

807
00:48:30,485 --> 00:48:37,632
Speaker 0: what the fun of the early advanced wars games that disappeared in days of ruin of The characters saying dumb stuff to each other before battle.

808
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:44,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look at the facts online There's actually a bunch of side quests involving characters that you can sort of get going on if you do the right.

809
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

810
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:47,705
Speaker 0: I Literally in my life.

811
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:50,113
Speaker 1: I read look at all the fucks I give.

812
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:52,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can see them all through this podcast.

813
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:54,285
Speaker 0: No problem I read the.

814
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:59,954
Speaker 0: I have the fact that tells you exactly how to get those things and I couldn't be asked To get to do what.

815
00:48:59,994 --> 00:49:05,180
Speaker 1: the facts, you know What that reminds me of that bullshit and fire emblem where you have to get the characters to stand next to each other.

816
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,871
Speaker 0: Hey, advanced wars one to unlock certain things.

817
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:14,826
Speaker 0: You had to use the right person in the right map at the right time That's true but this isn't fire emblem like it'd be like.

818
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:27,679
Speaker 1: okay make the girl on the Pegasus stand next to the guy with the horse and have them talk and Then you'll get some plot and advanced wars - if you put Eagle and Sammy in the final battle together They they confess their love to each other.

819
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:31,338
Speaker 0: Yeah That was a big deal.

820
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:35,460
Speaker 0: Okay, what else can I say about this game?

821
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,260
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty fun to play with someone else as a like, you know dick around fight, but it's Pokemon.

822
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:45,836
Speaker 0: So if I've got all spirit tombs, you've got all Eevees.

823
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:46,720
Speaker 0: Well, guess who's gonna win?

824
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,883
Speaker 1: Yeah Six year dudes.

825
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,733
Speaker 0: The thing is it's because it's so fiddly.

826
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:55,423
Speaker 0: It's hard to get the Pokemon you want I know.

827
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:58,116
Speaker 0: so my team is like half cuz I play.

828
00:49:58,136 --> 00:49:58,880
Speaker 0: you know what I did play.

829
00:50:00,382 --> 00:50:12,540
Speaker 1: If there's a Pokemon you want good luck finding a trainer that it goes with right because the way it works is every train you Get these trainers and every trainer can have one active Pokemon at a time and they have a link percentage with that Pokemon.

830
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,053
Speaker 1: So like for example Scott, I have my main guy has dratini and Eevee.

831
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,606
Speaker 1: his link percentage of the Eevee is way high And dratini is kind of low.

832
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:23,640
Speaker 1: So it's like well no reason to use dratini there.

833
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,260
Speaker 1: I just stick with the Eevee the and he also has a max percentage.

834
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,601
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know Eevee on Eevee the Eevee Scott combo can go up to 100%.

835
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:34,613
Speaker 1: the dratini Scott combo can only go to 70%.

836
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:42,082
Speaker 1: so There's no reason to use the dratini Scott combo because it only goes to 70% unless you play with the cap of 70% That's true.

837
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:43,347
Speaker 1: So you got it.

838
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:46,480
Speaker 1: want to mix the dratini with somebody who will be a hundred percent.

839
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,960
Speaker 0: Well, that's why what you do is you watch for that symbol.

840
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,117
Speaker 0: That means there's a trainer who's with his best Pokemon already and capture him exactly You know.

841
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:00,980
Speaker 1: So it's like you to figure out who which Pokemon is go with which trainers and you can switch Pokemon on trainers.

842
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,800
Speaker 1: So it's too much effort to deal with that too much effort to do So.

843
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,708
Speaker 1: it's like you I was when I was playing.

844
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:14,460
Speaker 1: I would be like, alright, my guy is in a fire town So he should be a water guy so he can kill the things in the town easily doesn't fucking matter doesn't matter.

845
00:51:14,701 --> 00:51:16,790
Speaker 1: I'm also thinking like okay, my guy is there.

846
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,388
Speaker 1: he's next to a fighting town So I don't want to put any normal guys in this town.

847
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:24,299
Speaker 1: in case they attack right doesn't fucking matter.

848
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:25,137
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

849
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,973
Speaker 1: So don't worry about like type matching or any bullshit.

850
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,639
Speaker 1: worry about that in the battle more.

851
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:37,079
Speaker 1: So right if there's a water guy in the battle Don't put your fire guy in range of his attack and you'll be okay.

852
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:45,768
Speaker 1: There ain't no reason to bring him out of the battle because you know There's probably gonna be something that's weak against water that you'll need your water guy in there and you shouldn't keep them out Just as a fire guy.

853
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:51,220
Speaker 0: now the only passwords I put in Where you can get guys to appear and then you have to go catch him in game.

854
00:51:51,985 --> 00:52:05,270
Speaker 0: and so I typed in the password for Gyarados and the password for Sneasel because I really like sneasel like I always have I always use sneasel and there's like 30 or 40 more that I just don't give a fuck.

855
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,193
Speaker 0: type in like mr.

856
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:06,474
Speaker 0: Eavis.

857
00:52:06,534 --> 00:52:08,380
Speaker 0: I could get but whatever it just doesn't.

858
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, the password thing is kind of weird.

859
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:13,300
Speaker 1: It's basically you type in a password and then it'll be like on the next turn.

860
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,700
Speaker 1: It'll be like the Pokemon has appeared in this town.

861
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,846
Speaker 1: So you had to go to that town and capture that.

862
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:21,497
Speaker 0: you can type that password in once per like reset your cartridge.

863
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,829
Speaker 0: Yeah whatever, yeah, but I got my.

864
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,706
Speaker 0: so I got like five sneezles and They suck cuz.

865
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,236
Speaker 0: I didn't have any trainer who could 100% with them.

866
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:35,736
Speaker 1: So you got to look up online like which trainers go with which Pokemon?

867
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:36,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck that noise.

868
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:38,705
Speaker 0: The thing is I in real Pokemon.

869
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:39,166
Speaker 0: I like.

870
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:45,992
Speaker 0: I like to play dark like dark Pokemon ground metal psychic And grass.

871
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:49,539
Speaker 1: I like evil ghosty Pokemon like spirit - I like psychic ground.

872
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:52,147
Speaker 0: on our team I've won for a while.

873
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:55,820
Speaker 0: I had a team that was all dark and metal and also dragons.

874
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:58,370
Speaker 1: And then I hang tonight is the only one that's a real dragon.

875
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,073
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
