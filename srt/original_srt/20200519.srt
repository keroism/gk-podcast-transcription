1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,790
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:09,991
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:12,397
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,209
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,740
Speaker 1: Tonight, we go further.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,260
Speaker 1: We're talking about Rolling Stock.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,360
Speaker 1: A card game about stock and company trading.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,239
Speaker 1: Orthogonally adjacent to train games.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,096
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:36,079
Speaker 1: So traditionally, during normal times, Geek Nights, like the beginning of the show, tends to turn into Bike Nights because we bike a lot in the summer.

11
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,231
Speaker 1: And here we go again.

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,160
Speaker 1: I was biking over the weekend.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,600
Speaker 1: I actually finally went up to that South County Trail and wanted to see sort of just riding on it.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,400
Speaker 0: It looked to me like you went on the Croton Aqueduct Trail and not on the County Trail.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,420
Speaker 1: I mean the Croton Aqueduct Trail is really short and we used that to get to the South County Trail.

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:01:02,079
Speaker 0: No, I looked at your Strava and you went onto the Croton Aqueduct Trail, which is quite long and continues very far north.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,882
Speaker 1: Yep.

18
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,319
Speaker 1: Paved the whole way we were riding on.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,419
Speaker 1: There's only one tiny segment that was not paved.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, no, the County Trailway, I saw on your Strava you turned left, which is Croton Aqueduct.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,280
Speaker 0: If the County Trailway goes only north and more east, you made the sharp left turn.

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,160
Speaker 0: But either way, yeah, there's all kinds of awesome trails up there.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, we followed it all the way north.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,237
Speaker 1: We were going to go all the way to Tarrytown, but then we just headed back because we didn't start early enough for having enough food on us.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's always the problem, right?

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:43,320
Speaker 0: It's like I used to be able to just go all the way up to Brewster and take the train home and stop and eat food at places on the way and pee at places on the way, but now without all those places and, you know, train, questionable, right?

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,099
Speaker 1: Well, just bring your own food and pee in the woods.

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then the problem is it's still, even if I do that, let's say I get to Brewster, 60 miles north.

29
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,699
Speaker 1: And bike 60 more miles back south?

30
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:55,395
Speaker 0: Yeah.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,740
Speaker 1: Or just stick a tent in your panniers and just pop the tent up and sleep tonight.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,238
Speaker 0: There's nowhere to put a tent in Brewster, first of all.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,840
Speaker 1: Just put it on the trail, side of the road.

34
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like that, side of the road.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,217
Speaker 1: Just put it in a Walmart parking lot.

36
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,280
Speaker 1: Sure.

37
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,299
Speaker 1: I doubt anyone will hassle you.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,959
Speaker 0: I don't even think there's a Walmart up there.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
Speaker 0: It's such a sad place.

40
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:24,160
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like getting home, even if I can physically get home, which I probably could, it's not, you know, it takes way long to get home, right?

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 0: It's like that's two days of biking almost in one day.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:35,160
Speaker 1: But the funniest thing is there's that section of the trail that's not finished yet, like it's not paved, so there's no way, like there's no good way to get across it.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,060
Speaker 1: Like there's a route around it and it's a fine road route.

44
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,500
Speaker 1: Or there's a really direct way, which is a wooded trail.

45
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:55,500
Speaker 1: We passed two road bikers who were clearly trying to get to the nice paved bike trail and clearly could not ride their road bikes on the non-paved dirt trail and were basically just walking their bikes along it until they got to the end about a mile and a half.

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:11,620
Speaker 0: Right, well in Van Cortlandt Park, there is the old Putnam Trail, which as soon as you exit Van Cortlandt Park to the north becomes the county trailway, and then it's also the Croton whatever which sort of splits off to the left somewhere and, you know, the golf course is further north.

47
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:21,780
Speaker 0: But yeah, the old Putnam Trail in the park is basically mud and they're currently repaving it, but obviously that repaving I think is now behind schedule.

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,380
Speaker 0: Well the repaving is now-- Last I heard, it was not open yet.

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,365
Speaker 1: Well it's not rideable.

50
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:32,640
Speaker 1: It's basically they've put the packed rock and foundation down but they haven't paved anything, so it's worse than just mud or dirt.

51
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:33,919
Speaker 1: It's not rideable at all.

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've ridden through it on a road bike in the mud, which is already unpleasant.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,299
Speaker 0: But yeah, right now I would just take the route around the park and enter the--.

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,500
Speaker 0: There's a spot you can enter the trailway this north of the park, like in Yonkers, at this cul-de-sac-y, dead-end-y kind of spot.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of entries to that whole trail system, just like at a random dead-end street in a suburban-looking town.

56
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, once you start getting like further north, it's like the trail just goes straight through.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,888
Speaker 0: I think it's Yorktown Heights.

58
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:09,280
Speaker 0: It basically goes right through the middle of the town, like right next to the playground and people's houses.

59
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:18,100
Speaker 0: And then I think even further north, it's like the way it sort of goes is like you'll be in the woods and then you'll pop out and you'll have to like cross some street.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,380
Speaker 0: That's like some street.

61
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:26,480
Speaker 0: It's like it's not necessarily all 100% in the woods, even though you're clearly on a trail.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,580
Speaker 0: It's like on one side of the street, it's like there's a stick in the middle.

63
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,538
Speaker 0: It's like one of those kind of situations to prevent cars from getting in.

64
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,980
Speaker 1: On the other side, just in the Bronx, there's a lot of-- And it's like Sprain Brook, there's all these good bikeways.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Speaker 1: But even then, you'll go for a while and then it's all right.

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,100
Speaker 1: You just have to brave running across the freeway really quick and then you can continue on the trail.

67
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,505
Speaker 0: There's only one spot.

68
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:55,000
Speaker 0: I know if you take the county trail way correctly that you have to run across the freeway-ish.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,940
Speaker 1: That's if you go more east like toward Pelham Bay Park and then you head north from there.

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,652
Speaker 0: Oh, you're talking about over there.

71
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:11,940
Speaker 0: I'm saying-- I'm talking about like in the Bronx-- On the county trail way, there's a point at which you're on Route 100 and you're supposed to be biking in the shoulder of Route 100, which is fine, right?

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,619
Speaker 0: It's not a super much used highway, but it is definitely a highway, right?

73
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,999
Speaker 0: And there's one spot where you got to cross it.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,477
Speaker 0: And the way you cross it is sort of across--.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,799
Speaker 0: No, there's a crosswalk, kind of.

76
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,020
Speaker 0: And then there's a ramp, so like you're standing on the edge of this highway, the ramp, and you're waiting.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,940
Speaker 0: And it's like you sort of look, and as long as no cars are coming around, you go for it.

78
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,340
Speaker 0: And now you're on the opposite shoulder.

79
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:40,419
Speaker 0: That's how you're supposed to use it.

80
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,739
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's a little sketchy.

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,879
Speaker 1: Tuesday, we talk about things other than biking.

82
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,399
Speaker 1: We actually are doing stuff, so you got any news?

83
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,100
Speaker 1: I got a ton.

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,580
Speaker 0: There's a ton of news, but I sent you all the newses, and now I forget which ones we sent.

85
00:05:53,921 --> 00:06:02,440
Speaker 1: All right, what I'll start with is, obviously since cons are shutting down and everything's trouble, Evo 2020 is going to be Evo Online 2020.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,032
Speaker 1: Not Evo Online, but Evo.

87
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:05,020
Speaker 1: Biting games.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fighting game, you know, effectively fighting game world championships, which I think is what Evo counts as now, basically.

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,520
Speaker 1: Basically, this is like the Super Bowl World Series of fighting games.

90
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 0: Right, and every year they have the Evo tournament, and it includes many different fighting games.

91
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,000
Speaker 0: And there's a different slate of fighting games every time.

92
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,717
Speaker 1: And if you win any one of these tournaments, that's real.

93
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,719
Speaker 1: You are a world champion, no one's going to dispute that.

94
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:30,751
Speaker 0: No.

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:43,580
Speaker 0: The thing is, this year, because it's going online, they had to remove some games that could not be played online, and they added some games that could be played online.

96
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:54,220
Speaker 0: Of course, even the best fighting games, their online netcode, the latency matters a lot in a fighting game, down to the fractions of a second.

97
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Speaker 0: So there is some questionable things with regards to how legit is this.

98
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,040
Speaker 0: Would the result have been the same if they played in person?

99
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:13,820
Speaker 0: But the results are still fair, because everyone's playing online with the same conditions, as though some people may have better internet than others, and that's just sort of a shame.

100
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:23,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, that's very similar to if someone in lower tier sports has better equipment, better bike, better skis, that happens.

101
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:25,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

102
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,579
Speaker 1: But yeah, so they've added a bunch of games, they've changed some stuff around, some stuff like Samurai Showdown, Soulcalibur 6, that's all in there.

103
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:44,799
Speaker 1: But they added some open tournaments for games that were not originally going to be part of the lineup, Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat 11, which I'm hearing good things about, I should try it.

104
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, go ahead, do that.

105
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,239
Speaker 1: I mean, it looks fun, people are liking it.

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:08:00,979
Speaker 1: Skullgirls 2nd Encore, and Bems Fightin' Herds, the bootleg pony game that got shut down for copyright, and then Lauren Faust actually helped them change the character designs so they could still make the game, because the game was good.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

108
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:09,920
Speaker 1: But, in all our discussion, the thing we're beating around the bush, the buried lead, notice I didn't say anything about Smash Brothers.

109
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,960
Speaker 0: No, so Smash Brothers, you know, is a pretty new Smash Brothers game out these days.

110
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hear the community around Smash Brothers is very fervent, very dedicated, very serious.

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't say.

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,300
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is, Smash Brothers, right, online, everyone knows it sucks.

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,620
Speaker 1: But it sucks for like ten different reasons.

114
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,559
Speaker 0: No, it sucks for pretty much one reason, is that Nintendo Online sucks.

115
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:42,520
Speaker 1: Yes, but the two reasons are, the netcode is bad, like it doesn't work, even if you get it to work and play online, like, lag is a weird problem, but secondarily...

116
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,600
Speaker 0: That's just Nintendo Online sucks, okay, what else?

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:55,420
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm saying that the technology of Nintendo Online sucks, and independently of that, the interface and structure of Nintendo Online sucks, like how it works from the user experience, even if the netcode were perfect.

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,800
Speaker 1: Really hard to like... I just read, there's a big article talking about all the problems of doing online Smash tournaments, like it's really hard.

119
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:07,760
Speaker 0: If there wasn't any weird, you know, netcode problems, you could hold a Smash tournament online.

120
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,740
Speaker 1: Apparently people who try have said that it's actually a big problem, it's hard to get the right players to join the matches at the right times, things like notifications just don't go out, things are inconsistent.

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Speaker 0: Why are notifications, notifications should be sent outside the game?

122
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,600
Speaker 1: Because they're trying to invite someone to, like, the match to make it happen, and it just doesn't work.

123
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,920
Speaker 1: I've never tried to play it online, because I never had Nintendo Online, nor would I ever, ever play Smash Brothers online with anyone.

124
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:37,260
Speaker 0: No, I would not play Smash Brothers online, but yeah, I'm pretty sure that all those problems are just under the umbrella of Nintendo Online sucks.

125
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:49,879
Speaker 0: You have to pay $20 a year for it, or in our case, cheat and get a family plan, and get a ton of people into it to pay way less than, because it's not worth even really that much money at all.

126
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:56,160
Speaker 1: In fact, once the Animal Crossing train dies down, I'd probably stop even paying for the family plan, because that's literally the only gain.

127
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,539
Speaker 0: You didn't even pay me for the family plan.

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I guess I should.

129
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,218
Speaker 0: But you get, you know, you do get your Tetris 99, you should try that out.

130
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,700
Speaker 0: And you get some NES and SNES games you can play.

131
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,840
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean the SNES and NES games that I already have on a really good emulator?

132
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,360
Speaker 0: You do, but you can play them on the Switch.

133
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,480
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, maybe if I had to go somewhere and needed to play that, and I didn't have access to my laptop, or I couldn't even go anywhere.

134
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:27,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can play Super Metroid, like, on a plane, within your hands, without a laptop on the little table, you know, slightly more convenient.

135
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:27,451
Speaker 1: Yeah?

136
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:31,500
Speaker 1: Or I could just put my little laptop on there and have the emulator, and it'll just work.

137
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,420
Speaker 0: Slightly, slightly less convenient.

138
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm bringing my laptop anyway.

139
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,513
Speaker 0: Bring a Switch anyway.

140
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:38,980
Speaker 0: Anyway.

141
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:50,900
Speaker 1: But the funniest thing about all this is, the Smash Brothers fandom is pretty known for pretending Smash has zero problems, and being mad when people call those problems out.

142
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,806
Speaker 0: You say this, but I haven't seen any people saying that.

143
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:59,860
Speaker 0: Most of the people I've seen talking about this are pretty much just like, "Yes, we all know that Nintendo Online sucks, serves Nintendo

144
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Speaker 0: right.".

145
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,720
Speaker 1: Did you look at the Twitter thread that followed from the announcement of Evo Online?

146
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,076
Speaker 1: Because it starts with people being excited, like, "Yay, something's gonna

147
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:10,378
Speaker 1: happen!".

148
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,919
Speaker 1: And then there's this long string of people who are talking about their excitement for the Smash Tournament part of it.

149
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:27,860
Speaker 1: People didn't notice for a while that Smash wasn't removed from the lineup, because Evo didn't make a big deal about removing Smash, nor will they give any official reason as to why they removed it.

150
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,360
Speaker 0: They won't say, they're just- Why don't they make the official- why don't they do- come on, that's cowardly.

151
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,540
Speaker 0: They specifically have not- They are specifically not including Smash because this internet sucks.

152
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:47,059
Speaker 1: Yep, they pointedly- Did not say anything about it, and refused to say anything about it, at least as of, like, Dateline 6pm Eastern Time on the 19th.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,977
Speaker 0: Cowards boo.

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:01,980
Speaker 1: Now, what's funny is that every single article about this on every single site I found says the same thing, which says, basically, they didn't say why, but we're assuming it's because of the terrible netcode, and the fact that Nintendo Online basically doesn't work.

155
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,458
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

156
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:26,300
Speaker 1: But, at the same time, there is a sort of broader problem that fighting games in particular, just by the nature of how they tend to be, have a lot more problems with netcode than, like, FPSs, because as precise as FPSs need to be, there's a lot of reasons why they're actually pretty tolerant of high lag and non-deterministic latency in a way that a lot of fighting games just really aren't.

157
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,718
Speaker 0: No, because a fighting game is literally about speed, right?

158
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,639
Speaker 0: Yup, frame timing.

159
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Speaker 0: And the games are fast, and even the lag introduced by, like, an LCD TV is a problem, and they have to often play with CRTs to get, you know, no lag and high enough frame rates.

160
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,880
Speaker 1: And, like, pros are reacting to near-frame perfect timing cues to then make near-frame perfect inputs.

161
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,906
Speaker 0: Games also, you know, demand frame perfect inputs.

162
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,590
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, you want to block that attack?

163
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,179
Speaker 0: You better push this button on this exact frame of this animation, otherwise it won't block, you'll get

164
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:58,340
Speaker 0: hit.".

165
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,520
Speaker 0: And the pros, they're the pros because they can do it, right?

166
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:01,954
Speaker 0: Yup.

167
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:10,220
Speaker 0: So then they need to be in a situation where, yeah, they can do it, but to do it, there has to be no lag, otherwise they're going to push the button too early or too late.

168
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:29,420
Speaker 1: Yup, but I'm just wondering in the long run, as there's more and more online tournaments, like, I feel like the requirement of physical proximity for most people to consider fighting game tournaments to be legit will sort of put a ceiling on how big fighting games can be as esports compared to almost any other kind of game.

169
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:42,360
Speaker 0: I think it actually, in a way, helps fighting games in that you aren't going to be, like, much like in the real world, right, sports-wise, right?

170
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,855
Speaker 0: You think about fighting sports, right?

171
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:45,480
Speaker 0: Boxing, right?

172
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,480
Speaker 0: You know, you don't have boxing every day like you have baseball, right?

173
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,379
Speaker 0: Boxing is, like, you know, at least disregarding its brutality and the fact that we should not have it anymore.

174
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,004
Speaker 0: You know, boxing is like a big event.

175
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,547
Speaker 0: that's rare, right?

176
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,011
Speaker 0: It's like there's going to be a big fight, right?

177
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,195
Speaker 0: Pay-per-view, big deal, right?

178
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,860
Speaker 0: They're coming together, people are actually going to hurt each other, oh my god.

179
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,940
Speaker 0: And even people who are fans of other sports, it's like, alright, it's time for the boxing, here it comes, once a few times a year, maybe, if you're lucky, right?

180
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,875
Speaker 0: So, fighting games are not going to be the ones that the sport that's, like, there every day, like baseball, right?

181
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,260
Speaker 0: The way that, like, your Overwatch might be, right?

182
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:36,256
Speaker 0: The fighting game is going to be the EVO once a year, here we go, fighting game time, let's go, right?

183
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,940
Speaker 0: And then you forget about it until it comes back.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Speaker 0: Yep,

185
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:55,580
Speaker 1: but at the same time, there's definitely a ceiling on the interest in things like boxing and MMA, like, there's a fervent community and most people don't care that much, or only care when they hear buzz, like it breaks into their mainstream media bubble and they hear buzz, like that Ronda Rousey fight, everyone's like, ooh, there's going to be this fight.

186
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure, that's fine, but, you know, if you box, you can still make a ton of money, right?

187
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,093
Speaker 0: So people will still do it.

188
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,860
Speaker 0: People still do, I mean, yeah, but people still do the same.

189
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,780
Speaker 1: It seems like it's on a long decline.

190
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,071
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely, especially right now.

191
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,820
Speaker 0: It's not being helped.

192
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't really distance that unless you're Charlie Chaplin.

193
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can, it's called the marathon, that's distance boxing, run away.

194
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,324
Speaker 1: That's my go-to fighting strategy.

195
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:30,420
Speaker 1: So, a game that you may never have heard of called Crucible is launching tomorrow.

196
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:45,780
Speaker 0: Right, so, people might not know the whole story here, so Amazon had been trying to get in the games business for quite a while, and there was a game they were working on called Breakaway, and I was following that game because the concept of the game seemed really cool.

197
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Speaker 0: What it was was a game designed to be an esport, which was some sort of combination of, like, it was actually a ball and, like, some MOBA-ish actiony gaming going on, right?

198
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,739
Speaker 0: So, you'd be fighting the other people, but really, you'd be trying to get the ball to the other end.

199
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,450
Speaker 0: And, you know, it seemed like the concept was good, but the game never launched.

200
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:12,799
Speaker 0: It was, like, an alpha or something that I didn't get into, and then that was sort of it.

201
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:16,720
Speaker 0: Or maybe I did play, like, once in the alpha, and then whatever, anyway.

202
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of just ignored it, and every now and then you'd mention, like, that it existed, and I'd just promptly forget.

203
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,929
Speaker 0: It was unique and an interesting concept, but it didn't happen.

204
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:30,440
Speaker 0: I actually met someone at MAGFest who really wanted to tell me what kind of a fiasco it was.

205
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,005
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah!

206
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:31,955
Speaker 1: We gotta talk to that guy!

207
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,000
Speaker 0: They were close to it, or they worked on it or something, but yeah, so that was a thing.

208
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,104
Speaker 0: Amazon now is trying again.

209
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:43,252
Speaker 0: They are publishing this game called Crucible.

210
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,716
Speaker 0: The developer is someone else.

211
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,060
Speaker 0: The game's just on Steam.

212
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:51,590
Speaker 0: It'll be free to play starting tomorrow at May 20th, 2020.

213
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,574
Speaker 0: So, for most of you, that's now.

214
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:57,100
Speaker 0: I imagine, you know, the live watchers, not so much, right?

215
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,151
Speaker 0: But this game is actually another idea that I did have conceptually.

216
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:06,655
Speaker 0: And since it's free to play, I'll give it a shot.

217
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,679
Speaker 0: Worst case, I delete it immediately, right?

218
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,119
Speaker 0: No big deal.

219
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:23,599
Speaker 0: And it has a few different play modes, but the play mode that's most interesting is the obvious idea, I don't know why, I think only one company tried it before and didn't succeed with it, which is to take a MOBA, but instead of having an RTS, it'd be an FPS, right?

220
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,807
Speaker 0: So, you have a map, you go around, right?

221
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,211
Speaker 0: There's NPCs coming at you.

222
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,576
Speaker 0: You got NPCs going at the other team, right?

223
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,060
Speaker 0: You shoot the NPCs and level up.

224
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:33,562
Speaker 0: You capture points.

225
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:40,533
Speaker 0: When you capture the points on the map for your team, they generate XP for your team, like a fountain, right?

226
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:45,300
Speaker 0: You have a few abilities that, you know, regen on cooldowns, just like a MOBA, right?

227
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 0: You get higher XP, you unlock, you upgrade your characters, your team gets stronger, and eventually you take the whole map and destroy the other team's base or whatever it is, right?

228
00:17:55,544 --> 00:18:03,259
Speaker 1: I'm leery for the sole reason of, I've never found multiplayer team versus games where there's like local XP within a match to be worth it.

229
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, it just-

230
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:16,620
Speaker 1: 'Cause it tends to be a snowball of, like, the game will usually just come down to an optimization of that XP advancement compared to the rate the other team is doing it, and that tends-

231
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,556
Speaker 0: That is true, but, you know, you have the also, right, the situations where it's like you're fighting the other team directly, right?

232
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,440
Speaker 0: You can do that immediately, right?

233
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,100
Speaker 0: So, you know, it depends on how they do it, but the fact that it's an FPS and a MOBA I think is still- Well, it's a third person shooter.

234
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,242
Speaker 0: Right, but that is still vastly more appealing than RTS controls of a little dude, like it's fucking- That is true.

235
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:45,140
Speaker 1: I feel like if we're gonna like something that's like Dota adjacent, it would be something like this.

236
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:53,548
Speaker 0: Right, I still think that these, you know, the MOBA concept, right, at its core is juicy fun.

237
00:18:54,008 --> 00:19:01,296
Speaker 0: It's just that every single implementation of it so far gets, like, these details wrong, at least in my opinion, right?

238
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:11,380
Speaker 1: Not for- they're making tons of money, so not wrong and everything, but, you know- Like, they tend to focus on, like, the leveling up aspects, they tend to focus on, like, these background things.

239
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:20,118
Speaker 1: I hate these- I hate the concept of fighting, like, random goons that are weak on one of the lanes, like in the forest, just to level up.

240
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 0: Like, it seems like- Well, you're probably gonna be doing that in this game, but actually that's only one of the modes, so it has some other modes that could be interesting.

241
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:32,560
Speaker 0: I think there was a Battle Royale-ish mode that involved two player teams and, you know, shrinking circles.

242
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 0: So it seems like they're doing a little bit of a shotgun approach with this game, where they got their 10 characters or however many, and they're trying to not do what the other FP- they're not trying to be Counter Strike, like the Valorant is, they're not trying to do what Overwatch is doing, right?

243
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,072
Speaker 0: They got different game modes.

244
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:49,839
Speaker 0: they're gonna try.

245
00:19:50,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Speaker 1: And that's the part, actually, I'm excited about, because you can still trace all the popular multiplayer FPSs, trace from, like, five lineages, and all the popular esport games in this space between MOBAs, FPSs, everything, they still trace from, like, less than 10 lineages.

246
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:16,500
Speaker 0: Right, so they're gonna- they're trying new game modes that we haven't seen before, necessarily, at least this- not, you know, I guess they're not 100% unique, but you get the idea.

247
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,300
Speaker 0: So, free to play, I'll give this a shot tomorrow.

248
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give it a shot, it doesn't look like it has any malware in it.

249
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,079
Speaker 0: Eh, not yet.

250
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:25,405
Speaker 1: Yep.

251
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,880
Speaker 0: So, speaking of- So you talked about EVO being cancelled.

252
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Speaker 1: Yep, oh yes, I guess we should talk about how Gen Con- Well, it's not cancelled, but yeah, right, so EVO is not cancelled, it's going online.

253
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,120
Speaker 1: Gen Con can't go online, 'cause you're not- what are you gonna do, put everyone in TTS and Discord?

254
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,940
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna try, but they're not gonna succeed.

255
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,280
Speaker 0: Yeah,

256
00:20:42,521 --> 00:21:02,840
Speaker 1: I think there's a sidebar there, or that, well, maybe we'll do another show on, 'cause I feel like we're gonna be in this boat for a while, but, uh, if you haven't noticed, a lot of conventions are trying to do online formats, and honestly, they're all kind of boring, or bad, or, like, not really worth engaging with, or, more importantly, not actually different from how cons already are.

257
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:08,056
Speaker 1: Like, if you, like, most cons, when they try to go online, they're just like, "Okay, we'll have a panel track,

258
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:08,799
Speaker 1: online.".

259
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,820
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, PAX already streams a bunch of the panel rooms, MagFest puts all the panels up on YouTube, like, it's not like they're taking questions from the stream.

260
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:28,260
Speaker 1: And in fact, they end up being worse, because as bad as the video recording is at most cons, the only thing worse than that is the average convention panelist attempting to record themselves at home.

261
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:35,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, they're usually all streaming themselves to a central location, which is then putting together a multi-person stream.

262
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:50,040
Speaker 1: Yep, which then runs into weird lag issues, they tend to have all the same, like, it's basically all the awkwardness of the kind of poorly run, poorly moderated panels that typify a lot of conventions, coupled with the extra awkwardness of talking lag and online streaming difficulties.

263
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,620
Speaker 0: Well, I see what a lot, one technique a lot of people actually use is to run a Zoom call, right, or use whatever kind of app like that.

264
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,800
Speaker 1: Just record that, basically.

265
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:07,280
Speaker 0: Right, the person doing the streaming opens up OBS, and basically is capturing different parts of the screen and inserting those into the OBS in different sections.

266
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,420
Speaker 0: So it's like, yeah, it's actually Zoom, and they're just inserting each of the squares into their streaming layout, right?

267
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:18,380
Speaker 0: So you don't realize it's Zoom, or whatever other app they're using, Google Meet or whatever.

268
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:21,199
Speaker 0: So that's how they do.

269
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:30,320
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's interesting that basically no one's been able to come up with a format that works, because there already is an online convention format, and people just don't engage with it that much.

270
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,242
Speaker 0: No.

271
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:37,373
Speaker 0: But yeah, so that convention is not happening.

272
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,480
Speaker 0: The Essen spiel is not happening.

273
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,689
Speaker 0: They're trying to try to do something digital as well.

274
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,600
Speaker 0: Every convention that's cancelled is trying to do something digital, right?

275
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:54,300
Speaker 1: The Animicons are the worst hit, because almost any content any panelist would have in an Animicon is going to get copyrighted immediately.

276
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,581
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:22:55,761 --> 00:23:00,593
Speaker 0: Annacy, the French animation film festival, is going online.

278
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,460
Speaker 0: This is not Tuesday News, but whatever.

279
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,505
Speaker 0: They're charging, I think, the equivalent of, what, $15?

280
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:15,160
Speaker 0: So you buy a digital ticket, and then you can watch the film festival films online on their site between times and dates.

281
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,330
Speaker 0: And this is only interesting news for nerds, because it includes that C.G.

282
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,593
Speaker 0: Lupin movie.

283
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:23,740
Speaker 0: We don't know yet if it includes English subtitles.

284
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,320
Speaker 0: But we do know someone made a little Twitter thread telling you how to navigate and get signed up, because it's all in French.

285
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:40,280
Speaker 0: But yeah, whatever convention it is that you're interested in, it's pretty much just, if it hasn't been cancelled or we didn't mention it's cancelled, pretend it is.

286
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,959
Speaker 1: I mean, considering that Gen Con is in the beginning of August, pretty sure that there's no PAX West at this point, because PAX West is not that long after that.

287
00:23:49,460 --> 00:24:04,057
Speaker 1: Also, PAX West still, by now, on a normal year, we'd have already submitted our panels, we'd already have a hotel somewhere, we'd probably already have our flights booked, and since none of that's happened yet, they're not even taking panel submissions, odds are pretty low.

288
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,860
Speaker 1: there's going to be a PAX West, or really any PAX's this year, I think.

289
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,260
Speaker 1: I still think PAX Australia has the best chance of happening.

290
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:12,623
Speaker 0: Maybe.

291
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:13,253
Speaker 0: We got any news?

292
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:16,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, so another news, speaking of malware.

293
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,680
Speaker 0: How many news is we gonna do here?

294
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,644
Speaker 1: Doom Eternal, the last news, I guess.

295
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:26,320
Speaker 1: So Doom Eternal, I played a little bit of it, looked pretty fun, Scott beat it, just gonna review it, and an update came down.

296
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,100
Speaker 1: Did we review it already or no?

297
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,019
Speaker 1: No, because I didn't finish it.

298
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:30,450
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

299
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,019
Speaker 0: How far did you get?

300
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,184
Speaker 1: A few hours in.

301
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,039
Speaker 1: I ended up getting a refund from Steam, so I can't finish it now.

302
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:39,431
Speaker 1: Because, so Doom Eternal came out, it was a pretty good game.

303
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,500
Speaker 1: from what everyone has said, you seem to like it, everyone had good things to say about it.

304
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:51,080
Speaker 1: And then, they added in an update, a Denuvo anti-cheat, the same kind of bullshit that makes Valorant an unplayable, dangerous game.

305
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,528
Speaker 0: Right, so there used to be, it used to be.

306
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:58,140
Speaker 0: the problem was a lot of these games would include these DRM packages.

307
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,360
Speaker 1: Ubisoft would do that, I remember.

308
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,159
Speaker 0: I think Denuvo actually even made one of them, I don't remember.

309
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,720
Speaker 1: Are you surprised?

310
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,303
Speaker 0: That's right, the name sounds familiar.

311
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:17,960
Speaker 0: The point is, these DRM packages would be all sorts of, you know, in order to prevent you from pirating the game, they would take elevated privileges on your computer and do shady biz to make sure you weren't pirating the game.

312
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,920
Speaker 0: Because otherwise, you know, you have administrator access over your own computer, you could obviously fool any program running with a lower privilege.

313
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:35,300
Speaker 0: So it's hard to make a DRM that's not running at an elevated privilege level, which also means there's any security vulnerabilities or shady biz, it might, I don't know, spy on your keyboard, right?

314
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,520
Speaker 0: Because it has such elevated privileges on your computer.

315
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 0: So, anti-cheat software runs into the same problem, right, in order to make sure that you're not cheating, right, because I could run a cheat program at elevated privileges that could manipulate the game running at a regular privilege level.

316
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:57,779
Speaker 0: The game can't know or do anything about that because that's how computers work and that's not going to change ever and it shouldn't.

317
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,380
Speaker 0: So the result, there's a loud noise outside.

318
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:03,599
Speaker 1: Uh oh, uh oh.

319
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, anyway, the result is that, you know, you get a game like Doom Eternal that got some multiplayer, they don't want you cheating, and they include this anti-cheat package in there, and what do you know?

320
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,019
Speaker 0: The anti-cheat package is basically malware, you can't trust it.

321
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:31,700
Speaker 1: Yep, it runs at kernel level, we talked about this on a Geek Nights episode a long time ago, we were talking about like ring zero and like what all that terminology means, but basically as mega god super admin access to your PC.

322
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:41,740
Speaker 0: Yep, so yeah, I uninstalled, after I beat, I didn't even have to like find out this news and then uninstall, I basically uninstalled Doom Eternal after I beat it.

323
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:57,980
Speaker 0: So, but yeah, Doom Eternal never got that update, but you know, usually what happens historically is that all of the programs out there that have the DRM, they eventually remove it from their game.

324
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
Speaker 1: Yep, they might not necessarily remove it from your PC though.

325
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,223
Speaker 0: Well no no no, they remove it from their game and there's an update.

326
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:18,800
Speaker 0: because once the game is old enough and it's being sold at a low price, right, they're not making that much money off the game anymore, and I believe, not 100% sure, that the game developer/publisher still has to pay the DRM company for the license ongoing, right?

327
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,520
Speaker 0: So there comes a point at which it's not worth it for them to pay for the DRM and their game anymore and that's why it gets removed from a lot of games somewhere down the line.

328
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:33,980
Speaker 0: And then you'd save to install the game again because DRM's gone, or buy it at the stupor's Steam sale for five bucks.

329
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:44,919
Speaker 0: Anti-cheat however, right, is gonna be interesting because, well, cheating doesn't go away, right, but there is a license fee, presuming that it's the same model, right?

330
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:55,080
Speaker 0: So, is it gonna be like when Doom Eternal multiplayer is no longer popular and no one cares about it, they'll stop paying and then put out a release that doesn't have this in it?

331
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,200
Speaker 1: I mean, we don't actually know if they're paying or not.

332
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:59,340
Speaker 0: I'm just guessing, right?

333
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:10,020
Speaker 1: Because it wouldn't be super shocking if this kernel-level stuff, they'd happily let you run it without any license fees because there's maybe other ways to monetize it in the future.

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:23,260
Speaker 0: The point is, if you are playing Doom Eternal on PC, which is where you should play it if you're gonna play it, and it is a good game, you should take care to sandbox it, run it on a PC that you don't care about, uninstall the shit right away, et cetera, be aware.

335
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,237
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a good way to sandbox it.

336
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
Speaker 0: Try to play it with an old update.

337
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:36,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the only way to be safe was if you bought it and played it and are still playing it but did not let it update and never let it update again.

338
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, see if you can prevent Steam from updating it and then play the game anyway, because as long as you don't want to do the online multiplayer, right, which I don't see any reason why you'd want to.

339
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,263
Speaker 1: It looked like an okay mode.

340
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:53,180
Speaker 1: Well, the funniest thing was multiple people said they didn't even know it had multiplayer, which was kind of funny.

341
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,748
Speaker 0: I knew it had it because the other one had it, but it's like, who cares about it?

342
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,133
Speaker 0: It's a single-player game first and foremost, right?

343
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,817
Speaker 0: It's like, who gives a shit about the multiplayer?

344
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,240
Speaker 0: Why did they even bother to include it?

345
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,720
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I feel like Doom is ripe for good multiplayer in general.

346
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:22,260
Speaker 0: It is, but I feel like the reason, the only guess I can have, right, is that when you play the single-player, you unlock stuff like skins and things like that, but skins have no meaning in a single-player game where you can't see yourself, really, right?

347
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,146
Speaker 0: So I feel like the multiplayer almost was serving the single-player.

348
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:36,820
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, here's the incentive to find secrets in the single-player that give you useless stuff like skins and badges or whatever, is to play this multiplayer we made.

349
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:42,240
Speaker 0: To make you want the things, otherwise it's like, alright, I got skins, what are we doing for?

350
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:47,312
Speaker 1: But the sad thing is, if you let it update, you wouldn't even know that this was added.

351
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:48,676
Speaker 1: There's no notification or anything.

352
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:50,060
Speaker 1: It just auto-deploys.

353
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:01,800
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, you should definitely keep in mind, all games once you install from Steam or anywhere else, any kind of Epic stores or whatever, you need to be aware of what other things those games are installing.

354
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,848
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's just Visual C++ redistributable, which is fine.

355
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,371
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's DirectX.

356
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, DirectX, that's fine, right?

357
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,000
Speaker 0: .net something, that's fine.

358
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,249
Speaker 0: But sometimes it's de nouveau anti-cheat, and that's not fine.

359
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,896
Speaker 0: I'm not saying you want to cheat either, right?

360
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,420
Speaker 0: Cheating is also a problem.

361
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,231
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, cheating has ruined a lot of games permanently.

362
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,540
Speaker 1: Cheating just destroys an online game.

363
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:30,370
Speaker 0: But how do you, there's this battle here, it's like, to stop cheating, right?

364
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,820
Speaker 0: This anti-cheat, despite all its evil, does seem to be somewhat effective, right?

365
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,100
Speaker 1: Well, you'd say that, but at the same time, other games don't have kernel-level cheat detection like Overwatch.

366
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:41,360
Speaker 0: Those games have more cheating.

367
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,264
Speaker 1: Overwatch does not have a cheating problem.

368
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:47,934
Speaker 1: Like, no one, there are not good, verified reports of cheating, really.

369
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:50,520
Speaker 1: People get caught and banned pretty quick.

370
00:30:53,881 --> 00:31:02,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I also don't think that, you know, the Doom company or whatever is putting as much effort into community management and their multiplayer.

371
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,380
Speaker 0: Because it's not a big multiplayer thing, it's just like a side story.

372
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't have like a squad.

373
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:10,160
Speaker 1: that's like looking through reported data to figure out if someone's cheating.

374
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Speaker 0: There isn't a Doom multiplayer league with big followers and a whole thing going on.

375
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,386
Speaker 1: But it is like, I just like, many of you might be too young to remember.

376
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:24,460
Speaker 1: I remember as a kid, like, play a game of Quake 2, go to a random server, like half the people there are running aimbots.

377
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,609
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,849
Speaker 1: Like, just straight up, every Counter-Strike game was full of hackers.

379
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,360
Speaker 1: Like, I remember once I was playing Counter-Strike and the match- It's definitely less bad than in those days.

380
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Speaker 1: Yep, the match started and a dude instantly appeared in our spawn, knifed us all to death at hyper speed, and then proceeded to start screaming in the voice chat until everyone disconnected.

381
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,186
Speaker 1: Like, I just remember that moment.

382
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:51,078
Speaker 1: You just have to know, like, the IP addresses of the good servers where no one cheats.

383
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,020
Speaker 1: So yeah, the problem is, long term, like, you know, to do the Geek Nights thing, let's go to the far future.

384
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,380
Speaker 1: There is a certain kind of cheating that literally could not ever be stopped by any software solution.

385
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:04,860
Speaker 0: Like Robot Arm?

386
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:05,723
Speaker 1: Robot Arm.

387
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:11,580
Speaker 1: You could have a computer that controls a robot arm on a mouse with a USB that pretends to be a keyboard.

388
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,240
Speaker 1: Or even just, it's two USBs, one pretends to be a keyboard, one pretends to be a mouse, and has a camera pointed at the screen.

389
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:24,615
Speaker 1: Or it just takes in an HDMI input and reads that visual field, and that's enough.

390
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,460
Speaker 1: You could make an aimbot with that and that alone.

391
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, this is a real thing.

392
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,240
Speaker 0: I've definitely seen demos of it in the past.

393
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:40,020
Speaker 0: They literally, they had a camera looking at the screen, and a robot arm on a mouse, and, you know, hitting the buttons on the keyboard, and it was playing quick, right?

394
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,080
Speaker 0: So it's like, no software on the computer could detect that.

395
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:51,460
Speaker 0: All that's happening is inputs on a mouse and keyboard that are, for the computer's perspective, are no different than inputs from a human being with their hands on a mouse and keyboard.

396
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:58,820
Speaker 0: It's just, there's another computer that is looking at a screen and perfectly aiming a mouse and getting headshots.

397
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,915
Speaker 0: So it's like, no anti-cheat software can stop that.

398
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:03,959
Speaker 0: We need a different way.

399
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,339
Speaker 1: I actually just now came up with a way that would kind of work.

400
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,980
Speaker 0: The point is, the true path to stopping all cheating in online games must stop that kind of cheating.

401
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:15,542
Speaker 1: Yep.

402
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:20,175
Speaker 1: Of course, then you get to the point of, what if it's just a human cyborg playing the game?

403
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:21,740
Speaker 1: Is that cheating?

404
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,860
Speaker 0: No, that's just, you have to play in a different league.

405
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,863
Speaker 1: Ah, but how do you know?

406
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:31,039
Speaker 1: How do you make some rando use a credit card to buy Doom as a cyborg or a regular human?

407
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,516
Speaker 0: It's the same reason you have weight classes in boxing again, right?

408
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:36,520
Speaker 0: It's the same deal.

409
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,814
Speaker 0: If I got cyborg arm, I gotta play in the cyborg baseball league.

410
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,240
Speaker 0: I can't play in the human baseball league.

411
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,420
Speaker 0: Yep.

412
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:51,640
Speaker 1: The one interesting thing is, the games that have a well-structured tournament scene, there's almost this like, cheating can't really do anything for you because if you get ranked too high, people pay attention to you and figure out you're cheating.

413
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:56,360
Speaker 1: And it's like, now that you can show up to a tournament, you get invited to a tournament, you're fucked.

414
00:33:58,615 --> 00:33:58,989
Speaker 0: That's true.

415
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,610
Speaker 1: But I did come up with a way, and then we can move on to the rest of the show, a way to solve the robot arm problem.

416
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:13,130
Speaker 1: You require people who play, kind of like how certain team games, like, you almost need to require people to at least use the voice chat or at least listen in there.

417
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,888
Speaker 0: There's too many problems with that.

418
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:22,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could require that players have a webcam pointed at their hands to be able to play the game.

419
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,507
Speaker 0: What if someone doesn't have hands?

420
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,250
Speaker 1: Ah, then you have an, it has to be pointed at whatever adaptive device they're using to play the game.

421
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,610
Speaker 0: What if they're using some like, mouth control thing because they're like, disabled?

422
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,629
Speaker 1: Then you gotta have a webcam pointed at that.

423
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,610
Speaker 0: What if they don't want to show you their face?

424
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,469
Speaker 1: Well, then they can't play in the guaranteed no cheating league.

425
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,290
Speaker 0: What if that's not very accessible now, is it?

426
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,384
Speaker 0: It's an ableist league.

427
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:48,829
Speaker 0: you got there.

428
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,772
Speaker 1: Well, but is it?

429
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:54,830
Speaker 1: you're requiring someone to prove that they're playing the game as opposed to a robot playing the game for them?

430
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:56,252
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

431
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,730
Speaker 0: Also, that video could also be fake too.

432
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,833
Speaker 1: That would be hard to say.

433
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:06,690
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that's difficult to fake because post hoc analysis could show if the keystrokes don't line up.

434
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:13,310
Speaker 1: I mean, piano players freak out if they see like one wrong note watching a movie where someone happens to touch a piano for a second.

435
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:20,470
Speaker 0: I could say that I'm using my, you know, my tongue controller because I'm a paraplegic when I'm not.

436
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,210
Speaker 0: And someone off to the side has their hands on their mouse and keyboard because your league's not ableist, you're not going to kick me out.

437
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then in a post hoc review, if somebody keeps you cheating- You're going to kick me out of your league because I don't have a webcam?

438
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,313
Speaker 1: You know what?

439
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,267
Speaker 1: You provide a webcam to anyone who can't afford one.

440
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:35,802
Speaker 0: Buy this video game.

441
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,388
Speaker 0: Get a free webcam.

442
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you buy the video game, it comes with the webcam that prevents cheating.

443
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:47,430
Speaker 1: The webcam also has a spike in it and the spike is deployed to finish and prevent future cheating once you are detected cheating.

444
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:49,549
Speaker 0: Way too many problems with your plan here.

445
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,290
Speaker 1: It's better than your plan of 100% server side, which also isn't really feasible for a lot of reasons.

446
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:55,430
Speaker 0: I definitely think it is.

447
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:01,050
Speaker 0: That doesn't stop robot arm, nor does it stop cyborg, nor does it- Oh no, it doesn't stop robot- no, it doesn't stop those.

448
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:03,188
Speaker 0: Not at all.

449
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,530
Speaker 1: I remember even at RIT we wouldn't let- we had a tournament at an anime club night.

450
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:15,490
Speaker 1: We wouldn't let that one Rando use his control- he brought his own controller and he got really butter when we wouldn't let him use it because he might have programmed macros into it.

451
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,668
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's time for Things of the Day.

452
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:25,230
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

453
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:42,689
Speaker 0: So, uh, most people- I don't know how to guess not most people, but a lot of people, when they get a pen in their hand and they're doodlin', there is some sort of, like, innate thing that are- I don't think it's, um, you know, biological.

454
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:43,670
Speaker 0: I definitely think it's societal.

455
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,509
Speaker 1: It's definitely cultural.

456
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,232
Speaker 0: Right, cultural.

457
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:52,910
Speaker 0: It's just this, like, subconscious, like, thing that will move your hand and draw a penis.

458
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,353
Speaker 0: And I've seen this infect a lot of people.

459
00:36:56,994 --> 00:37:13,610
Speaker 0: And the thing is, it might not actually happen, but as soon as you, like, suggest to someone, draw a penis or don't draw a penis or phallus or- you mention anything phallic in any way while someone's drawing.

460
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:17,820
Speaker 0: And, you know, you play, like, TKO or whatever, it's like penises come out.

461
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,303
Speaker 0: You play draw a phallus, penises come out.

462
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,968
Speaker 0: It just happens with any group you play with.

463
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:21,890
Speaker 0: It's just a thing.

464
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:24,412
Speaker 0: Right?

465
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:30,384
Speaker 0: Uh, so someone made this website and it has machine learning that looks at what you're drawing.

466
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:33,009
Speaker 0: It's just a big surface in your web browser that you can draw on.

467
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:40,690
Speaker 0: And it used machine learning to look at what you're drawing and it comments on what you're drawing and it's quite shockingly good at recognizing what you're drawing.

468
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:43,296
Speaker 0: As long as you don't draw anything too complicated.

469
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,043
Speaker 0: Like, I drew a fire and it said, "Is that a

470
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:46,625
Speaker 0: fireplace?"

471
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,108
Speaker 0: And I drew some logs and it's like, "Oh, a

472
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:48,570
Speaker 0: campfire.".

473
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:49,912
Speaker 0: I drew a palm tree.

474
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,753
Speaker 0: It knew a palm tree.

475
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:51,674
Speaker 0: It knew a fish.

476
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,477
Speaker 0: It knew a basketball.

477
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,899
Speaker 0: It knew all kinds of stuff.

478
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,721
Speaker 0: I drew a car, person.

479
00:37:56,801 --> 00:38:02,970
Speaker 0: It just knew what I was drawing and made funny comments on it in a portal, GLaDOS kind of way.

480
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:08,901
Speaker 0: But the website is, I believe, don'tdrawpenis.com.

481
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,830
Speaker 0: And you try to draw a penis on this website and see what happens.

482
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,597
Speaker 1: So I was able to and I've replicated it a few times.

483
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:20,150
Speaker 1: It was pretty easy to draw a penis as long as I drew it attached to a stick figure.

484
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,950
Speaker 0: But yeah, it mostly detects if you're drawing a standalone penis.

485
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,233
Speaker 1: I also enjoy playing it.

486
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,258
Speaker 1: The voice reminds me of the Zombicon voice.

487
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,148
Speaker 1: It's this calm voice that's just like, "Ah, you have drawn a

488
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:33,389
Speaker 1: tooth.".

489
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:38,458
Speaker 1: Some drawings may be artistic in nature.

490
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,610
Speaker 1: It's a vaguely surreal, fun experience just to doodle around on this thing.

491
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:46,416
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day, pretty brief.

492
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,080
Speaker 1: You're probably all familiar with SimCity.

493
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:52,370
Speaker 1: But that technology was used, and there's a whole article here.

494
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,058
Speaker 1: I'm not going to explain the whole article.

495
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:54,902
Speaker 1: You can just read this.

496
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:56,590
Speaker 1: This person did all the research.

497
00:38:57,011 --> 00:39:07,910
Speaker 1: But it talks about how SimCity was used as sort of the blueprint to make serious games to train people in real-world things other than just building fake, simplistic cities.

498
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:14,388
Speaker 0: Well, I imagine there were many jobs that basically amount to being a SimCity boss, mayor, right?

499
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:24,430
Speaker 1: Well, the example is SimRefinery, of which very few screenshots remain, that was in this category of games that most people are not really familiar with, like serious games.

500
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:37,250
Speaker 1: But these are games or entertainment software or interactive software of some kind that is used primarily to train people or to simulate things for various serious purposes.

501
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,857
Speaker 1: This tradition goes back a long time.

502
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:41,222
Speaker 1: War games were basically that.

503
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:43,190
Speaker 1: And things like that still exist today.

504
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:54,710
Speaker 1: Like the military, spy organizations, manufacturers, all sorts of organizations around the world will either make, get other people to make, or otherwise use games for these purposes.

505
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:06,010
Speaker 1: And this is an article talking about the lineage of how SimCity ended up evolving into being one of these games when some of the people from the company split off to make serious games.

506
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,973
Speaker 1: And sort of just a long history of that.

507
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:17,850
Speaker 1: The craziest thing is, there are only like two images known on Earth of SimRefinery.

508
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,590
Speaker 1: Like no one has the code, no one has an emulated version of it, like it's just gone as far as I can tell.

509
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,710
Speaker 1: Granted, I didn't do any research, I'm purely basing it on this article, but this is just an interesting, fascinating space.

510
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:37,730
Speaker 1: And this is also a space where there are jobs and like you could work in this place, like this kind of thing.

511
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:49,510
Speaker 1: You could literally, your job could be game designer for the government or game designer for a giant tech company for internal games that will never be released to the outside world to solve very specific problems.

512
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:58,110
Speaker 0: I don't know why you wouldn't release your game to the outside world, because if it's true that your game does train people to do the job, right?

513
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:06,790
Speaker 0: Then you could, it's like if you need employees, which a lot of people do for specialized things, it's like you put that out there, someone might play it for fun.

514
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,000
Speaker 0: And then you'll be like, "Oh, who's the best at this

515
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,342
Speaker 0: game?".

516
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,106
Speaker 0: And you'll be like, "Boom, you're

517
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:10,408
Speaker 0: hired."

518
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:10,690
Speaker 0: Right?

519
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:17,250
Speaker 1: Well, some of them include specifically secret or sensitive information.

520
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:19,930
Speaker 0: Maybe that shouldn't be in the training?

521
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,289
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what if you're trained in a spy?

522
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,210
Speaker 0: Use fake secret information.

523
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,697
Speaker 1: But what if the secret information is like operational tactics?

524
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:33,690
Speaker 1: You're training someone in operational tactics that are not public for a reason.

525
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:35,670
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, the tactics themselves are not public.

526
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the thing, the techniques they're teaching you are themselves things that normal people are not supposed to know.

527
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,190
Speaker 0: You could put the game out there with some other tactics that are fine to share.

528
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,944
Speaker 1: Or you get into the situation like SWAT, Police Quest SWAT, which kind of was just a, "Here's how to be a SWAT officer.

529
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,968
Speaker 1: This is how a SWAT team actually busts into your

530
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:55,249
Speaker 1: house.".

531
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:56,548
Speaker 0: Yep.

532
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,757
Speaker 1: So this is just a cool article you should read.

533
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,030
Speaker 1: You might learn a lot of things you didn't know about serious gaming.

534
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,358
Speaker 1: And how to run an oil refinery?

535
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we can find that game.

536
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:09,190
Speaker 1: I want to see an AGDQ of Sim Refinery.

537
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:20,010
Speaker 1: But the point that makes this the most interesting and is something that we kind of talk about a lot when we review games is the idea of your working or mental model of a system.

538
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:29,930
Speaker 1: Like, when I play a board game, I develop a mental model or a series of heuristics around the game that help me understand it because I can't fully understand the state of the game.

539
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:34,980
Speaker 1: And these games don't try to be a totally realistic simulation.

540
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:53,210
Speaker 1: Their primary goal, at least in the types of serious games this article talks about, the primary goal is specifically to help the players start to build their own mental model of a complex system, if not necessarily getting to the point of them having a model that's accurate to the real system.

541
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,810
Speaker 1: It'll get them further along or more ready to start to model the real system.

542
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:05,730
Speaker 1: Like, you play SimCity, you start to build a mental model of how cities work, it's not that accurate, but it's not that inaccurate.

543
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:16,610
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm at a moment, we're stuck at home, doing vague livestreams as we can, trying to make content, gonna work on some stuff as we keep saying, join our forum.

544
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, this weekend is like a big weekend for everyone.

545
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:22,750
Speaker 0: So not only, I guess I don't have to work Friday, I don't know about other people.

546
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,410
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, most people have to work Friday.

547
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:29,738
Speaker 0: In the United States, there's not gonna be work for a lot of people on Monday either.

548
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:36,410
Speaker 0: So even though you're working at home, now you can be at home and not have to even think about whatever your job is if you're working from home.

549
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,628
Speaker 0: If you're lucky enough.

550
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,090
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do some more tests with that teleprompter and set up some more of my streaming infrastructure.

551
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,359
Speaker 0: Right, so that gives us time to keep working on content making because you don't gotta do anything else.

552
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:52,670
Speaker 0: All the time that I used to spend making a panel at a convention, it's like, well, maybe I'll just, you know, do something else.

553
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, at some point I'm gonna start writing new panels and just videoing them, but that'll be in a little bit.

554
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,570
Speaker 1: That'll be a lot easier when Scott and I can visit each other and then we can at least do a normal Geek Nights panel together.

555
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:04,490
Speaker 0: You could do a one-person panel.

556
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got some one-person panels.

557
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,929
Speaker 1: I'm actually thinking about doing something that I...

558
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,604
Speaker 0: I'll do a one-person panel.

559
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:10,330
Speaker 0: We'll see who's better.

560
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,613
Speaker 1: Oh, we could definitely do that.

561
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:18,650
Speaker 1: I mean, the only one I've ever done is I made that Five Nights at Freddy's one that I'm still pretty proud of and actually seems to still get a lot of views.

562
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,529
Speaker 0: Oh, it's probably people just searching for Five Nights at Freddy's.

563
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:23,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was a video...

564
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:25,948
Speaker 0: What's really hot right now?

565
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,501
Speaker 1: Not train games.

566
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:28,009
Speaker 1: That's just us.

567
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:29,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, do the Valorant thing.

568
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:30,530
Speaker 0: Do a Valorant panel.

569
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,690
Speaker 1: I can't because I don't want to play it.

570
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,815
Speaker 0: Well, you don't have to play it to do a panel.

571
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:35,958
Speaker 1: Make a YouTube video.

572
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:38,564
Speaker 0: If you just make a YouTube video, this is Valorant in the title.

573
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:40,930
Speaker 0: It'll show up in a Valorant search and then say some stuff.

574
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not into that.

575
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,650
Speaker 1: It has to be a good panel.

576
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:44,008
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

577
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:50,550
Speaker 1: I feel like what I want to do is that thing that I keep talking about a lot in panels, but I've never done a panel about it specifically.

578
00:44:51,430 --> 00:45:10,430
Speaker 1: I always talk about how Overwatch did a lot of what Team Fortress 2 did, but somehow Team Fortress 2 just collapsed and yet Overwatch succeeded in the game design of two very similar games and how these tiny, tiny differences between the two ended up having radical consequences for how they actually played.

579
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,082
Speaker 1: That'd probably take a few weeks to get all the data together to put that up.

580
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:15,824
Speaker 0: We'll see.

581
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:16,828
Speaker 1: We'll see what we do.

582
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,652
Speaker 1: Anything else?

583
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,730
Speaker 1: We're not really reading through the tale of Hanzo at the moment.

584
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:27,508
Speaker 0: We are not reading the tale of Genji, which is our current book club book selection, though I might soon.

585
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:28,250
Speaker 0: Who knows?

586
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, got a long weekend.

587
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:41,930
Speaker 0: If it gets warmer, I'll bike, obviously, but if I'm not biking, I can't go to the beach, so I guess the beach sitting time will be replaced with more biking and sitting on the balcony reading, maybe?

588
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:46,943
Speaker 1: I might bike up on those trails and then just stop and read for a while before I bike home.

589
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:49,189
Speaker 1: I might just bike to the park and read a little bit.

590
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:49,470
Speaker 1: We'll see.

591
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,610
Speaker 0: We can go read in the middle of Yorktown, huh?

592
00:45:53,852 --> 00:46:00,050
Speaker 1: All right, so the games we've been reviewing lately are the games that we can easily play semi-asynchronously online.

593
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:07,290
Speaker 0: Asynchronously games online are difficult because you need to get a lot of people together with technology and such and such.

594
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,493
Speaker 0: Asynchronous games are on websites.

595
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:11,636
Speaker 0: You take your turn whenever you've got time.

596
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,318
Speaker 0: You can do it while you're at work, right?

597
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,549
Speaker 0: Perfect game for stuck at home.

598
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:25,450
Speaker 1: Yep.

599
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:30,506
Speaker 1: So we've been playing these train games and now we've moved on to a game that I've known about for a long time.

600
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:31,710
Speaker 1: Like I kind of knew the deal.

601
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:33,330
Speaker 0: I've heard the name of it before.

602
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,255
Speaker 1: I'd seen it, but I just hadn't played it.

603
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,723
Speaker 1: And because of all the things we said about 1889 and 1846 and 2038, those three reviews you can read or listen to.

604
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:46,940
Speaker 1: There are transcriptions on YouTube, it looks like.

605
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:48,909
Speaker 1: I didn't check how good they are, but I saw them there.

606
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,194
Speaker 1: But you can check those reviews out.

607
00:46:52,274 --> 00:47:01,870
Speaker 1: But one of our complaints about the train games is around how we really like the stock stuff more so than the operating round is almost just like bookkeeping.

608
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:11,030
Speaker 1: So now we played rolling stock where the bookkeeping and the so-called operating round is abstracted away to almost nothing.

609
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,790
Speaker 1: And this game is basically just about the companies and the stock shenanigans.

610
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:17,072
Speaker 0: Right.

611
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:22,970
Speaker 0: So in most of the 18X train games, you start the game with some sort of auction for private companies.

612
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:28,387
Speaker 0: And as the game goes on, those private companies are folded into public companies and they disappear.

613
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:29,150
Speaker 0: That's the end of them.

614
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:40,210
Speaker 0: Their purpose is that in a non-random game, because these games have no randomness whatsoever, to sort of start the game in an asymmetric way.

615
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:52,810
Speaker 0: Not just the turn order already provides some asymmetry, but the fact that you have to start by auctioning off these unique private companies and everyone gets however many they end up buying.

616
00:47:53,891 --> 00:48:01,950
Speaker 0: It means that everyone starts in an asymmetric position, which sort of is then the spark that sets off the asymmetric non-random game.

617
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,510
Speaker 1: Like the grain of sand inside of a pearl.

618
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,091
Speaker 0: Exactly.

619
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:20,330
Speaker 0: So in rolling stock, the way this game works is much like the 18XX games, it starts off with an auction for private companies, but that auction for private companies continues throughout the game.

620
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:33,790
Speaker 0: There is a stack of private companies and they keep turning out new ones and each turn, one of the phases, the important phase where most of the game happens, is an auction for the currently available private companies between all of the players.

621
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,594
Speaker 0: The players can use their money in this auction.

622
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:38,197
Speaker 0: The money in your personal wallet.

623
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:45,270
Speaker 0: The public corporations that absorb the private companies cannot bid in this auction.

624
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:57,910
Speaker 0: So what happens is the flow of the game is people start with money, there's no public companies whatsoever, you participate in these auctions to acquire private companies.

625
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:11,790
Speaker 0: The private companies spit out money, but much like these private companies, while also serving the purpose of the private companies in other 18XX games, they also serve as abstractions of the trains.

626
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:20,030
Speaker 1: They have just an income and they have synergies with other companies, like every company will have synergies with some of the other companies.

627
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,015
Speaker 0: Well, hold on, you're getting ahead of yourself here, right?

628
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:27,704
Speaker 0: So the private companies spit out money and they rust, like the trains do.

629
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,410
Speaker 0: Over time, the amount of money they spit out goes down.

630
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:31,985
Speaker 1: And you have to get rid of them.

631
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,475
Speaker 1: It'll give you income, like $3.

632
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,800
Speaker 1: every turn, you just get $3, awesome, that's cool.

633
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,190
Speaker 1: But then, as the game goes on, their income drops and drops and eventually becomes negative.

634
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you want to dump them.

635
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:45,876
Speaker 0: Much like the trains in an 18XX game.

636
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:54,790
Speaker 0: You get a train, the train that you bought, that a company bought generates revenues that turn into dividends, and then the train rusts and it goes out of the game and you have to buy new trains.

637
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,155
Speaker 0: Also, in an 18XX game, you usually have tracks, right?

638
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:08,390
Speaker 0: And what the tracks do is, you know, based on your position on the board, sort of determines how much money different trains can get, right?

639
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:15,190
Speaker 0: Two companies might have the same trains, but one with a better board position might be spitting out more money because it's better aligned on the map.

640
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,610
Speaker 0: Rolling stock, the private companies, again, abstract away the map because they have the synergies that Rym mentioned.

641
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:30,210
Speaker 1: Yup, so Company A, if you own both Company A and Company B together in a corporation, they get like a little bonus to how much income they generate.

642
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,337
Speaker 0: Right, so Company A, if you just hold onto it privately to yourself, will spit out X dollars.

643
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:38,101
Speaker 0: Company B might also just spit out X dollars.

644
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:43,588
Speaker 0: You hold onto them yourself and you just get the income that they spit out until they rust and you get rid of them.

645
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:44,630
Speaker 0: No big deal, right?

646
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:52,448
Speaker 0: If that was the whole game, then the whole game would just be bid for the best private companies, the end, and hold on, right?

647
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:53,410
Speaker 0: There would be no public companies.

648
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,490
Speaker 1: It would basically just be Pizarro or it would just be the auctions in Power Grid and nothing else.

649
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,976
Speaker 0: Right, so what you do is you form public companies.

650
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,421
Speaker 0: You can form them just whenever arbitrarily.

651
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,423
Speaker 0: I kind of like that.

652
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:06,728
Speaker 0: There's not like these specified ones like 18XX says.

653
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:10,421
Speaker 0: You're just like, "Oh, I'll start the bear company.

654
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:11,424
Speaker 0: I'll start the wheel

655
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:11,866
Speaker 0: company."

656
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:12,870
Speaker 0: Whatever, right?

657
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,474
Speaker 0: And when you start those companies, you have a stock price, right?

658
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:18,215
Speaker 0: Because now they're public.

659
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:19,096
Speaker 0: People can buy shares.

660
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:19,977
Speaker 0: You issue shares.

661
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:21,699
Speaker 0: Money goes into the company.

662
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:22,640
Speaker 0: It has its own wallet.

663
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,751
Speaker 0: And the corporation, this public, can absorb the private corporations.

664
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:31,940
Speaker 0: And in fact, to form one, you must start by putting a private company into it.

665
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:39,368
Speaker 0: And then that income that the private company was spitting out now goes into the public company's wallet.

666
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:48,900
Speaker 0: But if private companies that synergize with each other because they are abstractly in good positions together on the map that doesn't exist, right?

667
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,964
Speaker 0: They go well together.

668
00:51:50,547 --> 00:51:53,700
Speaker 0: They will spit out bonus dollars that add up to a lot of dollars.

669
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,731
Speaker 1: And the fiction is like these two railways interconnect with each other or like this airline would actually overlap with like these rail routes that complete.

670
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:04,555
Speaker 1: But honestly, the theme literally does not matter at all.

671
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,420
Speaker 1: These are just acronyms that synergize with other acronyms and they all have colors.

672
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:09,601
Speaker 0: Right.

673
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:13,247
Speaker 0: But if the right acronyms get into the same company together, more money comes out.

674
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:21,760
Speaker 0: So by starting the public company, you can get more value from those synergies than just holding on to money fountains for your personal gain.

675
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,948
Speaker 1: Now, starting a company like starting a corporation is pretty cool because it's a real IPO.

676
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:34,140
Speaker 1: Like if you do it, you put the company that you own personally into this corporation, you pick one like bear or wheel.

677
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,023
Speaker 0: It goes it goes public.

678
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:48,600
Speaker 1: And the other way the IPO works is basically you get a share and the bank gets a share and you pay your money to the company for that share and the bank pays its money to the company for that share.

679
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,486
Speaker 1: So by IPO, you basically get other investors in.

680
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:55,852
Speaker 1: Now, the company has more cash than just what you put into it.

681
00:52:55,892 --> 00:52:58,276
Speaker 1: The whole point of an IPO is to raise capital.

682
00:52:58,636 --> 00:52:58,957
Speaker 1: It does.

683
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:00,379
Speaker 1: It's a pretty elegant mechanism.

684
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:00,900
Speaker 1: how it works.

685
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,328
Speaker 0: And then what you can also do is, you know, you started this, you know, I took one of my companies that I won at auction.

686
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,749
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,191
Speaker 0: I put it into the company.

688
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:10,733
Speaker 0: It went public.

689
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:11,414
Speaker 0: Right.

690
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,240
Speaker 0: And in exchange, because I gave up a private company, it's no longer under my control.

691
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:17,265
Speaker 0: I'm given a share in that company.

692
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:23,020
Speaker 0: So I didn't really lose anything because that share has the value is the is the exchange I get for the company.

693
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,545
Speaker 1: You also pick the price.

694
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:25,951
Speaker 1: The company opens ad.

695
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:27,860
Speaker 1: What is the starting price of this stock?

696
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

697
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:31,705
Speaker 0: Well, if you're the president, yeah, you can issue more shares, all this stuff.

698
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:42,640
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that now that the public company has one private company in it, the way it gets more private, because in order to have the synergies, it has to have more than one private company in it.

699
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:53,580
Speaker 0: The way it gets more than one is that you can, if you're the president, right, you can decide which private companies that public company will buy with its money, just acquisition.

700
00:53:53,660 --> 00:54:05,458
Speaker 1: You can buy them from other corporations, or you can buy them from players, which means if you're the president of a company, you can buy a corporation that you, the player, own directly and just agree to it.

701
00:54:05,498 --> 00:54:06,580
Speaker 1: You just be corrupt as hell.

702
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,440
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,283
Speaker 0: That is basically the flow of the game.

704
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:14,769
Speaker 0: is you buy private companies in this auction, corporations, public ones cannot participate in the auction.

705
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:23,300
Speaker 0: Therefore, you take your money, you buy companies, you put some of them into, they go public together, create synergy to create more value.

706
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,183
Speaker 0: You then get money out, right?

707
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:41,280
Speaker 0: This is the important part because you have to make sure because the only way you can participate in the auctions for more companies is if you personally have money in your wallet, right, owning shares, you can't use that money in an auction unless you sell the share and you can't sell your last share in a corporation.

708
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:52,236
Speaker 0: You know, money that's in the company's wallet, right, because it got a, because the bank bought some shares, right, which gave the company money that you can't use that to buy companies at the auction.

709
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:55,200
Speaker 0: You need money in your personal wallet to participate in the auction.

710
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,190
Speaker 0: And then you buy companies in the auction and now, well, now you'd have enough money to buy another company, right?

711
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:08,940
Speaker 0: You sell the company you bought to the corporation to get the money out of the corporate wallet into your personal wallet for the next auction.

712
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,766
Speaker 1: There's only four ways to get money into your personal wallet.

713
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:14,170
Speaker 1: Like there's not a lot of ways to get money back in this game.

714
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:18,820
Speaker 1: You either own a company that's just spitting out revenue, which is not going to help you in the long run.

715
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,864
Speaker 0: It helps some, depends.

716
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:29,097
Speaker 0: If a company isn't really doing any synergy, then there's really, I don't see much reason to have it be in a public company.

717
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 0: You might as well just keep it on your own.

718
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:37,580
Speaker 1: I guess unless you use the IPO to have more money than you could have otherwise to acquire something somewhere else.

719
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

720
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:45,920
Speaker 0: If you, you might want to use a low synergy company as the IPO company, but yeah, otherwise you're going to get the better value just by holding it, right?

721
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,053
Speaker 1: You can, uh, like Scott said, you can buy companies, your corporation can buy companies from you or other players.

722
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:54,960
Speaker 1: Corporations might buy a company from you if that's the one they want.

723
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,869
Speaker 0: You can buy any which way.

724
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:56,476
Speaker 0: Always.

725
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,126
Speaker 1: Number three, every round, one of the things you do is decide how many dividends to issue.

726
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:14,600
Speaker 1: So if you say the dividend is $4, the corporation pays $4 to each shareholder on record, which as you might recall, since the bank gets half the shares, unless other people have bought shares, you own a share and a bank owes the share.

727
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:21,981
Speaker 1: If you do a dividend of $4, you get $4, the bank gets $4, the company loses $8.

728
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:22,102
Speaker 0: Right.

729
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:25,032
Speaker 0: The other way is obviously it's a stock game.

730
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,480
Speaker 0: You could own shares that increase in value and then sell.

731
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,860
Speaker 1: Now this is where the game is.

732
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,457
Speaker 0: That is hard.

733
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:39,020
Speaker 1: 18XX games have a abstracted and like it's so abstracted that it's realistic, but only in an obtuse way stock market.

734
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:41,866
Speaker 1: Most games have just completely fake stock markets.

735
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:47,880
Speaker 1: The stock market, the way stock prices work in this game is shockingly realistic.

736
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,066
Speaker 0: It's pretty real.

737
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,880
Speaker 0: It's not a hundred percent real because it's still an abstract.

738
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,433
Speaker 1: But it's real close to the real world because basically there's a lot of parts.

739
00:56:56,473 --> 00:56:58,320
Speaker 0: There's a lot of parts of it that are very real.

740
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,473
Speaker 1: I'll describe it vaguely because you can read the rules.

741
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:01,439
Speaker 1: Like we'll link to a PDF.

742
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,109
Speaker 0: If someone buys, there's a, there's a line of prices.

743
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,640
Speaker 0: No two stocks can have the same price, right?

744
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:15,140
Speaker 0: If someone buys a share, you go up to the next available price, which might mean jumping over other companies if they have the prices that are right in front of you, right?

745
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:19,028
Speaker 0: When you sell a share, it moves down in price to the next available price.

746
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:25,220
Speaker 0: However, if when you buy a share, right, it moves up, but you pay where it moved to.

747
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:29,654
Speaker 0: And when you sell, you get the money of where it moved to.

748
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:31,260
Speaker 0: You don't get the money of where it moved from.

749
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,705
Speaker 1: Just like the real stock market, the price.

750
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:37,140
Speaker 1: you see, if you look at what's the price of a stock, that's just the last price it traded at effectively.

751
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,466
Speaker 1: So say star corporation is sitting at $28.

752
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:41,588
Speaker 1: I want to buy a share.

753
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,752
Speaker 1: The next price up on the chart is 31.

754
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:48,800
Speaker 1: So it costs $31 to buy a share and then the price becomes 31.

755
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,805
Speaker 1: Want to buy another share?

756
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:55,062
Speaker 1: I got to pay 34 more dollars and the price moves up to 34.

757
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:55,342
Speaker 0: Yep.

758
00:57:55,803 --> 00:58:00,331
Speaker 0: Whereas in 18XX, it's like you can sell five shares all at once.

759
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:05,700
Speaker 0: You get the list price for all those shares and then the price moves down a whole bunch.

760
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,161
Speaker 0: Which I guess.

761
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:10,126
Speaker 1: in olden times and shitty early stock markets, you could do stuff like that.

762
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:20,660
Speaker 1: I sell Scott a share and then before Scott can tell anyone, I send a rider on a horse to sell Joey Jojo a share and I sell them both the shares at the same price.

763
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,540
Speaker 1: And until they talk to each other, they have no idea they got screwed.

764
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:24,741
Speaker 0: Right.

765
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:30,652
Speaker 0: But in 18XX, if the price of a company is 100 and you got four shares, you can sell all four and get $400.

766
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:34,980
Speaker 0: In this game, it's like, no, you go around buying or selling one share at a time.

767
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:40,491
Speaker 0: The only annoying rule is you can't sell the final share of a company if no one else has a share in it.

768
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:44,880
Speaker 0: And then, yeah, you can just buy one, sell one, buy one, sell one.

769
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,795
Speaker 0: But obviously if you buy, sell, buy, sell, you're just losing hemorrhage.

770
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,660
Speaker 0: You're just hemorrhaging money.

771
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,210
Speaker 1: Just like in the real stock market, the whole idea of a bid ask.

772
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,660
Speaker 1: You know, the spread, there's a bid price and an ask price.

773
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,441
Speaker 0: Right.

774
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:55,624
Speaker 0: The price is 20.

775
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:56,306
Speaker 0: I'll buy a share.

776
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:56,927
Speaker 0: Well, you paid 21.

777
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:57,348
Speaker 0: All right.

778
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,892
Speaker 0: Well, now I'll sell that share.

779
00:58:58,912 --> 00:58:59,694
Speaker 0: Here's $20.

780
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:00,476
Speaker 0: You lost a dollar.

781
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:00,957
Speaker 0: Right?

782
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:01,699
Speaker 0: The price is 20 again.

783
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,505
Speaker 0: It's like, uh, so yeah, that's how that works.

784
00:59:05,765 --> 00:59:16,300
Speaker 0: So in order to make, in order to make money in stocks, you need to buy several shares of a company, issue more of them, then issue dividends over a long period of time.

785
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:17,181
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:25,340
Speaker 0: And you have to make sure though, that the total value of the company itself, there's these little charts on each of the stock prices cards, right?

787
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,242
Speaker 0: That's why they're unique.

788
00:59:26,783 --> 00:59:33,919
Speaker 0: And it will tell you if your company is this much value at the end of the turn, it will move up one, up two, down one or down two, right?

789
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,708
Speaker 0: So the value, the total value of the company's holdings.

790
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,520
Speaker 1: Which is its cash on hand plus the value of all the companies it owns.

791
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:42,881
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:50,720
Speaker 0: The total value of what the company has going on determines relative to its stock price, whether it's undervalued or overvalued and that will move.

793
00:59:50,860 --> 01:00:02,040
Speaker 1: If your company has a ton of cash, but not a lot of companies, you can pay out big dividends and that stock price is going to tank because the investors know that you just have a bunch of cash and you're squandering it.

794
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,185
Speaker 0: But if the company has like super low cash, right?

795
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:14,120
Speaker 0: But has a ton of companies in it, then it's, first of all, those companies are generating probably a lot of synergistic income every turn that you can pay out in dividends.

796
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:24,540
Speaker 0: But whether they do or not, those companies have value and thus the stock price will move according to that value to the right position regardless of where it started.

797
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,906
Speaker 0: It'll slowly get to where it belongs relative to how much it's worth.

798
01:00:29,367 --> 01:00:37,600
Speaker 0: So if you can buy low and sell high, you can make money by selling shares at the right time as long as you were able to issue enough shares.

799
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,364
Speaker 0: I made the mistake in the first game.

800
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:40,426
Speaker 0: I opened a company.

801
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,751
Speaker 0: It had two shares, one for me, one for the bank.

802
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:44,835
Speaker 0: No one else bought a share.

803
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:45,918
Speaker 0: I didn't issue more.

804
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:46,920
Speaker 0: I couldn't buy more.

805
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,180
Speaker 0: So my price went way up, but I could never sell my only share of the company, even though it was very valuable.

806
01:00:53,641 --> 01:00:54,417
Speaker 1: Even worse, if you issue...

807
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,880
Speaker 0: And I couldn't make any money and I couldn't participate in the auction and then I was done.

808
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,409
Speaker 1: If you issue new shares, that drives the price down and it dilutes your dividends.

809
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,156
Speaker 1: So if I issue another share, now there's three shares.

810
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:05,660
Speaker 1: Issue another share, now there's four shares.

811
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:09,633
Speaker 1: Every time you issue a share, the bank gives the share price to the company.

812
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:11,138
Speaker 1: like you issued another share.

813
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:11,680
Speaker 1: It's out there.

814
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:20,180
Speaker 1: But now if I pay a dividend, if there's five shares out there, a $1 dividend cost me $5 and if I only own one share, I only get one of those dollars.

815
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:21,562
Speaker 0: Right.

816
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:26,080
Speaker 0: So the things about this game... There's more rules, but that's pretty much the game.

817
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:35,260
Speaker 0: Well, the one key thing is that those private companies that come out in the auction are set up in a deck and they're set up into different sections of different colors.

818
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:39,351
Speaker 0: And as you get to the... each color is like the next phase of the game, right?

819
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,340
Speaker 0: As the colors are... you get through each set of colors.

820
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:47,149
Speaker 0: And while each little set is shuffled, the colors are in a certain order.

821
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,077
Speaker 0: So the companies just get more expensive as the game goes on.

822
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:52,500
Speaker 0: The price keeps going up.

823
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:52,901
Speaker 0: And it's huge.

824
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:57,389
Speaker 1: Like early companies have an income of like $2 and it costs like $8.

825
01:01:57,389 --> 01:02:02,878
Speaker 1: The later companies have an income... like an income of like $12 and they cost like $60 to buy.

826
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,718
Speaker 0: There are big, big jumps between the colors, right?

827
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:08,240
Speaker 0: Big jumps.

828
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:16,016
Speaker 0: So the result of that is that even if you're competing well with the other players in the game, right?

829
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:18,080
Speaker 0: The game can beat you, right?

830
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:41,000
Speaker 0: If you don't keep enough money in your wallet, if you don't have a way to get money into your personal coffers, and they get to like the next color, the prices on those companies in the next color might be so high that you have no conceivable, no possible route, literally no possible route to ever be able to buy one of those, even if nobody was competing with you in the auctions.

831
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,728
Speaker 0: Because you just... it's just like, well, that costs $40 minimum.

832
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:48,397
Speaker 0: There is no way for me to ever get $40 ever in this game.

833
01:02:48,577 --> 01:02:49,580
Speaker 0: I'm just done, right?

834
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:55,752
Speaker 0: You have to play this game in such a way that you stay afloat, right?

835
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:59,880
Speaker 0: It's like you're not fighting with the other people so much, right?

836
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:17,000
Speaker 0: You're trying to tread water and after you successfully continue to tread water as the seas continuously rise and never stop rising, if you can continue treading water and stay alive in the game, then you can fight with the other people and try to dunk their heads up.

837
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:21,580
Speaker 0: But, if I just, the first game I played, I just drowned on my own.

838
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,362
Speaker 1: We both drowned.

839
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:27,800
Speaker 1: Scott and I just, damn, we both hit a point where, well, there's literally no way for us to ever buy anything for the rest of this game.

840
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:29,201
Speaker 0: Yep.

841
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:35,100
Speaker 0: So, I think that the problems I see in this game, because it does have a lot of fun parts, right?

842
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,982
Speaker 0: I enjoyed this game.

843
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:36,943
Speaker 1: I would play it again.

844
01:03:37,023 --> 01:03:37,965
Speaker 1: I want to play it again.

845
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:46,140
Speaker 1: However, I think it is deeply and fatally flawed in a number of ways that some people may be tolerant of, but I'm definitely not.

846
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:47,582
Speaker 1: You know in Power Grid?

847
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:48,844
Speaker 1: We talked about this a long time ago.

848
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:57,218
Speaker 1: Power Grid's a really fun game, but once you get good at it, like really good at it, the game literally comes down to, I spent 100% of my dollars this turn.

849
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,685
Speaker 1: Scott had one dollar left over that turn.

850
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:04,214
Speaker 1: Scott's probably losing the game now because the game becomes very dollar tight.

851
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:06,580
Speaker 1: Like, that's the level of granularity of success.

852
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:11,267
Speaker 1: This game, but Power Grid is only like that at high tiers of play.

853
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,411
Speaker 1: This game is like that no matter what.

854
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:19,200
Speaker 1: If you are off by a dollar in the first auction, you might just mathematically be eliminated from the game.

855
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,215
Speaker 0: Right, so I think that, you know, I'm not opposed to being eliminated from the game.

856
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:25,400
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people hate player elimination.

857
01:04:25,604 --> 01:04:26,033
Speaker 0: Ah, I love it.

858
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,727
Speaker 0: Right, I think this game, one of its flaws, it doesn't have player elimination.

859
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:37,360
Speaker 0: It needs it, because you could be stuck in a game where you literally cannot affect the game anymore, but you are not officially eliminated.

860
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:48,259
Speaker 0: And so, if you wanted to play to the official conclusion of the game, every game we've played of this, it has reached a point where we've just said, "Oh yes, obviously that player's won and there's nothing anyone could do about

861
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,340
Speaker 0: it.".

862
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,185
Speaker 0: Even though the game is far from officially over, and we just end it.

863
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:56,010
Speaker 0: And it's like, well that's really, that's like you play Monopoly, right?

864
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:58,353
Speaker 0: Monopoly has the exact same fatal flaw.

865
01:04:58,373 --> 01:04:59,255
Speaker 0: That's the worst thing.

866
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:02,319
Speaker 0: that is wrong with Monopoly is also wrong with this game.

867
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:03,240
Speaker 0: That is not a good thing.

868
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:15,312
Speaker 1: Secondly, around, these games definitely are very spreadsheet heavy in that the game itself is very like mathematically pure and you can calculate things, but in some games

869
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:22,800
Speaker 0: there's no randomness, except for the cards coming from the deck, what order will they appear, and you can see the future on those, so it's not very random.

870
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:30,811
Speaker 1: But the trouble is, oh lord, total aside, I'll get back to this later, people are commenting on our train game reviews on BoardGameGeek.

871
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,195
Speaker 1: I didn't know that was even a thing.

872
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,980
Speaker 1: Interesting, I'm going to skim those comments in a minute.

873
01:05:37,445 --> 01:05:38,720
Speaker 0: Have fun with that.

874
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,845
Speaker 1: Basically, some games, it's just analysis paralysis.

875
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:53,458
Speaker 1: You can calculate so far, but doing a multi-turn full calculation of all player actions and possibilities will maybe give you a 1% higher chance of winning the game.

876
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:54,920
Speaker 1: So it's not worth it socially.

877
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:09,431
Speaker 0: People talk about analysis paralysis a lot, and the usual pattern you see is exactly what Rem described, is that if you play the game and you are good at it, you have some heuristics for what's a good move, what's a bad move, you can play pretty well.

878
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:21,480
Speaker 0: You can get close to optimal play or maybe even optimal play by making a quick decision or just looking around at your options and sort of picking the best one with various methods.

879
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:41,400
Speaker 0: But if you sit there and analyze every possible option down to the last dollar, down to every cent, down to the individual victory points, and say, aha, I thought of one that got me four victory points, it only took me 30 seconds to find that move, but I spent 10 minutes, I found a move that gets me five victory points.

880
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,462
Speaker 1: Everdell has that problem to the nth degree.

881
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:55,513
Speaker 1: You literally can just fucking sit there forever, and you might actually find a path through all those unique and semi-unique cards that gets you one more victory point than the other options.

882
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:58,776
Speaker 1: But that is table stakes in this game.

883
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,340
Speaker 1: You have to do that to even be able to engage with the game.

884
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:29,240
Speaker 0: You have to do analysis, paralysis, math, math, math, math, math, spend a lot of time thinking, down to the last dollar, exactly how much am I going to spend in this auction, what's my turn order, what stock price will I open this company at, how many shares will I issue.

885
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,783
Speaker 0: There's so many options of things you can do.

886
01:07:32,624 --> 01:07:46,200
Speaker 0: You have to explore each and every one of them, you know, spreadsheet all the way out before you make your move, because a failure to do so won't mean one less victory point or one less dollar.

887
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,348
Speaker 1: It means your chance of victory literally crashes to zero that turn.

888
01:07:49,588 --> 01:07:51,514
Speaker 1: It crashes from 90% to 5% and then from 5% to 0% over two turns.

889
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:53,800
Speaker 1: Right.

890
01:07:54,121 --> 01:08:01,935
Speaker 0: It means, well, that means you're not going to have enough, you know, the next turn, the cheapest private company available will cost a minimum of $21, and you'll have $20, so you can't even participate.

891
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:13,014
Speaker 0: If you even had the, and that's the thing, if you had the $21, right, that could, you know, to buy that cheapest company, you might not buy it.

892
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:17,241
Speaker 0: Someone else with like $30 might just buy it for $22.

893
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,542
Speaker 0: But you matter.

894
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:21,265
Speaker 0: You force them to buy that company.

895
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:25,229
Speaker 0: They couldn't buy another company because that would mean letting you have that one, right?

896
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:34,680
Speaker 0: If they chose a different company for say, you know, $27 that you couldn't even afford, they got that at face value, but now they're giving you the $21 at face value helping you out a ton.

897
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,245
Speaker 0: So now they have to buy that $21 to keep you out of it, right?

898
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:51,220
Speaker 0: And when they do so, they have to buy it for $22 above face value because to not bid $22 would mean you could get it in there for $21 based on the turn order possibly, right?

899
01:08:51,700 --> 01:09:00,380
Speaker 0: So having enough money to just clear that edge every single time requires a lot of analysis just to stay in the game.

900
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:01,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

901
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:12,680
Speaker 1: But even then, even if, even once you get to that point, because the game is so dollar tight, what'll happen is even if you make a slight miscalculation, but otherwise you're staying ahead of that ledge, like you're playing the game well.

902
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,767
Speaker 1: You've learned it, you're spread sheeting it, you're doing your math, you're not going to get screwed.

903
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:19,152
Speaker 1: Like you can engage in the game meaningfully all the way to the end.

904
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:23,439
Speaker 1: You're behind by $2 of net worth by the third round.

905
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:24,502
Speaker 1: You'll never catch up.

906
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:33,236
Speaker 1: There's no way to catch up because since the game is so locked tight, while there's this, like I could make a million corporations, corporations can sell stuff between each other.

907
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:35,859
Speaker 1: There's all this stuff that can happen in the stock market.

908
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:41,760
Speaker 1: I could like unload a company that sucks on someone and then like sell all the stock and do cool stuff.

909
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:52,620
Speaker 0: Someone could be trying to start a new company and buy all the privates from their old company into the new one and you could try to buy that old company out before they're able to transfer and steal all the private companies.

910
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:59,209
Speaker 1: They issue extra shares, but in practice, and I was looking around online and it's not just our games.

911
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,330
Speaker 1: It seems like that's pretty common.

912
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:07,860
Speaker 1: Very rarely do shenanigans like that happen because they can't often happen if the players are all actually playing well.

913
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:18,780
Speaker 1: They seem to only happen in games of this where all the players are doing very badly or for whatever reason, some of the players are making very poor decisions.

914
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:28,673
Speaker 0: Yes, if you, like we said, do all that analysis, you can basically protect yourself from any sort of shenanigans that could possibly happen.

915
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:33,000
Speaker 0: There's no really like an attack someone can do that you can't defend against.

916
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:40,151
Speaker 0: The only thing that someone can do in this game is to gang up on you with some sort of politics situation.

917
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:46,400
Speaker 0: Some cooperations of people who are not in first place could unseat someone in first place.

918
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:50,047
Speaker 0: Put their monies together in some way.

919
01:10:50,348 --> 01:10:56,400
Speaker 0: Just like someone who has been mathematically eliminated from the game early could do some king making in this game.

920
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:07,340
Speaker 0: I like a king making, but I only like it personally when the king making happens and the person doing the king making still has a chance to win.

921
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:09,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see where you're going with that.

922
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,226
Speaker 0: They've chosen this political path through the game.

923
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:18,580
Speaker 0: even though they could, they themselves could still win after following that path.

924
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:28,840
Speaker 0: If somebody king makes and either a) sacrifices all their chance to win to do so or b) king makes after already having crossed the point where they could no longer win.

925
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,084
Speaker 0: Like, "Well, I can't win this game.

926
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:34,019
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put all my stuff in with rim to make him win or to make rim

927
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:34,340
Speaker 0: lose.".

928
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:38,977
Speaker 0: That just seems like a spoiler and it's like now you're not winning and losing based on your own merit.

929
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:53,760
Speaker 1: If you're behind but you've played competently, you're not just derping around in the game, then holding back winners and just trying to keep the game going gives you some chance, some avenue to sneak a win in if everyone else stalemates.

930
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,819
Speaker 1: There are still more plausible paths to victory than in games like this.

931
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:03,280
Speaker 1: But there's also this problem that I see where there's all these shenanigans that seem really fun.

932
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:12,720
Speaker 1: Like in 18 XX games, the most fun thing in the world to do is to fuck someone over and force them to buy a train or force someone to own a company they don't want to own.

933
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:18,320
Speaker 1: But if the players are even remotely careful, you really can't pull that off.

934
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:19,980
Speaker 0: Nope.

935
01:12:20,563 --> 01:12:23,820
Speaker 0: It only happens to people who are new at the game or don't know what's up.

936
01:12:24,865 --> 01:12:28,000
Speaker 0: Once I learned that, it took me quite a while to figure out how that worked.

937
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,011
Speaker 0: But basically that doesn't happen to me anymore.

938
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,200
Speaker 0: I'm like perfectly protected.

939
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,930
Speaker 1: You can't throw a shitty company at me in 1889.

940
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:34,640
Speaker 1: Like it just can't happen.

941
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,903
Speaker 0: Nope.

942
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:41,280
Speaker 0: I know how it works now and now it never happens and I can't do it to anyone else because they know better.

943
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:48,619
Speaker 1: But then we get into a situation where I like the train game, but the most fun of the table is when the turn starts and someone says, "Oh shit, I see what's about to

944
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:48,940
Speaker 1: happen.".

945
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,120
Speaker 1: And then someone gets screwed by that, but you never see that happen when everyone's good.

946
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:54,900
Speaker 1: Again, unless people are making mistakes.

947
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:03,320
Speaker 1: So we have this broader problem of there are fun systems and levers in these games, much like Sellers of Catan where trading is really fun.

948
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,691
Speaker 1: Where if you get good at the game, you'd never pull that lever again.

949
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:08,155
Speaker 1: Like you know that lever is just poison.

950
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,158
Speaker 1: There's no reason to ever touch it.

951
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,400
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, you know, I think baseball actually is an example of a game that has a lot of the same things going on.

952
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:28,820
Speaker 0: If you ever watch a Little League Baseball game, something that happens a lot in not the lowest level of Little League, which is just kids who aren't, but like the middle school kids who like could be really good high school players might be-

953
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,880
Speaker 1: Like they're trying, but they can't hit home runs yet because they're tiny, tiny kids.

954
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:35,365
Speaker 0: Well, they can in the little tiny field.

955
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:41,640
Speaker 0: But the point is some things that you'll see happen, for example, are like successful steals of home, right?

956
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:45,068
Speaker 0: Some things else that you'll see is that kids will get a walk, right?

957
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,491
Speaker 0: So the pitcher will walk the batter.

958
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:50,500
Speaker 0: The kid will run to first base, even though they just got walked.

959
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:54,286
Speaker 0: And they'll just keep running to second, like without stopping.

960
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,314
Speaker 0: And this will often fool a pitcher, right?

961
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:01,600
Speaker 0: Who is not, you know, who's just a kid who isn't aware of that.

962
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:13,000
Speaker 1: In high school, my go-to move was I would walk casually toward first when I got walked, and then I'd walk a little bit past it, and then I would just suddenly sprint to second and no one ever was able to stop me.

963
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,521
Speaker 0: Right.

964
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:16,407
Speaker 0: In Major League Baseball, you see that never.

965
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:27,260
Speaker 1: You haven't seen stealing home in like, it's super, super rare, but it hasn't been common since- Like if a pickle happens in a professional baseball game, that is the highlight of the fucking month.

966
01:14:28,662 --> 01:14:29,405
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

967
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:30,571
Speaker 0: It happens pretty rarely.

968
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,400
Speaker 0: Pickles happen a little bit, but they're still pretty rare these days.

969
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,340
Speaker 1: But even not that often, pickles are one of the most fun parts of baseball, but they really can't happen unless you make a mistake.

970
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,762
Speaker 0: Right, so that's what I'm saying.

971
01:14:41,802 --> 01:14:46,669
Speaker 0: is that rolling stock, even if your players aren't pro, right?

972
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,514
Speaker 0: Because the bar to just stay in.

973
01:14:49,554 --> 01:14:53,300
Speaker 0: the game is high, anyone who's not pro can't do anything in this game.

974
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:59,534
Speaker 0: So as a result, you only get the game where everyone's pro and only boring stuff happens, right?

975
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:00,236
Speaker 0: The exciting stuff.

976
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,200
Speaker 0: I'm really curious, right?

977
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:05,480
Speaker 0: I mean, I have tons of ideas on how to sort of take the core of these games to a different game.

978
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you didn't notice, we're playing a lot of these games lately for research for an idea we have.

979
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm just thinking like, what if you just, instead of making the game money tight, right?

980
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:18,340
Speaker 0: What if everyone started the game with like a fucking thousand dollars, right?

981
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:19,824
Speaker 0: Just don't change anything else.

982
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:21,970
Speaker 0: Just make everyone a fucking tycoon.

983
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,632
Speaker 0: Like you're rich.

984
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:23,454
Speaker 0: Money's not tight.

985
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,500
Speaker 0: Alright, now bid on these companies, right?

986
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:29,580
Speaker 0: It's like if you don't do, it doesn't matter how much money you start with as long as everyone starts the same.

987
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:36,100
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, you can't just sit on your thousand dollars because if you want to win, you have to increase your money somehow.

988
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:42,680
Speaker 1: But also it means now there's a lot more dynamics around issuing more shares and buying shares and fucking other people's shares over.

989
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,442
Speaker 0: Everyone's rich.

990
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:47,450
Speaker 0: You can't kick anyone out of the game because they're all fucking rich.

991
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:50,820
Speaker 0: You just have to work the system to make more money than someone else.

992
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,245
Speaker 0: Despite being more rich, right?

993
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:55,629
Speaker 0: That you can't kick anyone out.

994
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:56,752
Speaker 0: They're not going to go bankrupt.

995
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:57,614
Speaker 0: They're a zillionaire.

996
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:58,577
Speaker 0: Everyone's a zillionaire.

997
01:15:58,597 --> 01:15:59,840
Speaker 0: You're feuding tycoons.

998
01:16:00,441 --> 01:16:04,740
Speaker 0: But you still have to play the game because you still have to make, get to a thousand and one dollars somehow.

999
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,740
Speaker 0: Like what did- You're not going to get it by sitting.

1000
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,560
Speaker 0: But instead- Unless you hope everyone else loses money and you'll just sit.

1001
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,440
Speaker 1: Which is what disappoints me the most is we can form all these companies, but there's almost never a reason to form more of them.

1002
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:21,279
Speaker 0: You're like, you can't- Later in the game there is, but there isn't a reason to form like a whole bunch.

1003
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:27,280
Speaker 0: It's like you could legally form like five companies right away, but like that won't do anything except make you lose.

1004
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,580
Speaker 1: And in fact, in the last game we played, I formed a big company that's actually doing really well late game.

1005
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,125
Speaker 1: Only because why not?

1006
01:16:33,225 --> 01:16:36,780
Speaker 1: I mean, I was already guaranteed losing the game and it was just a system I could interact with.

1007
01:16:37,142 --> 01:16:39,719
Speaker 1: Starcorp doesn't matter or mean anything to anyone.

1008
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:47,240
Speaker 0: The first game I played, I started the company and I followed the basic heuristic of trying to make a stock price go up.

1009
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,781
Speaker 0: So I did.

1010
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:50,448
Speaker 0: I got a company and it made its stock price go way, way up.

1011
01:16:50,509 --> 01:16:53,798
Speaker 0: I was trying to roleplay a responsible corporate executive.

1012
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,120
Speaker 1: Now you got to roleplay a jerk.

1013
01:16:57,524 --> 01:17:00,500
Speaker 0: And that absolutely did not work and I just got completely screwed.

1014
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:10,480
Speaker 0: So it's like the, not only do you have to spreadsheet the whole game to stay in it, but your basic, you know, real world heuristics of own a company and make the stock price go up.

1015
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,086
Speaker 0: That's good.

1016
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,500
Speaker 0: It's like, no, it's not, right?

1017
01:17:12,881 --> 01:17:16,460
Speaker 0: You have to do, non-intuitive things are the way forward, right?

1018
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,600
Speaker 1: Of course, Chris points out in the chat that I kind of agree with.

1019
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:29,600
Speaker 1: If you started people with too much money in this game, I feel like never investing and never doing anything except maybe buying a couple of companies would actually be an optimal strategy because of the math.

1020
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:39,800
Speaker 1: Cause I remember this happened when I was a kid in middle school, this one random day, it was in like the eighth grade advanced math class and they busted out monopoly.

1021
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:42,720
Speaker 1: They made us break into groups and they were like, everyone play monopoly.

1022
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:49,480
Speaker 1: And, uh, the winner from each table will like get a lottery ticket to get a thing.

1023
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,840
Speaker 1: Like there was a prize, like there's a real prize that people wanted, like a serious prize.

1024
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:55,238
Speaker 1: I don't remember what the prize was.

1025
01:17:55,782 --> 01:17:59,900
Speaker 1: It was like, it was, it was like the equivalent of like, don't have to do homework for a couple of weeks.

1026
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,059
Speaker 1: Like it was some big deal thing.

1027
01:18:01,501 --> 01:18:05,740
Speaker 1: So everyone starts trying to play monopoly and at our table, I'm like, guys, monopoly sucks.

1028
01:18:06,202 --> 01:18:07,054
Speaker 1: We don't want to play it.

1029
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:10,640
Speaker 1: Uh, let's show, and there was a secondary prize.

1030
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,319
Speaker 1: Here's the other piece.

1031
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:18,760
Speaker 1: The secondary prize was whatever player had the most money among all the winners would win some other prize in addition.

1032
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:24,780
Speaker 1: So I just said, let's all just agree that we never take any actions in this game.

1033
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:26,940
Speaker 1: There's a guaranteed five way tie for first.

1034
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:32,338
Speaker 1: And all we do is go around collecting the $200 from go over and over and over again.

1035
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,223
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1036
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:43,660
Speaker 1: And uh, yeah, we made sure there was a five way tie at our table and we had an order of magnitude more money than anyone else.

1037
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:45,080
Speaker 1: And the prize was canceled.

1038
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,554
Speaker 1: Everything was called off and we all got in trouble.

1039
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:50,397
Speaker 0: Well, they should have thought about what they were doing.

1040
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:56,500
Speaker 0: I would have, I would, if I saw kids doing that, I would be like, you got you guys, I'm getting you five prizes.

1041
01:18:57,661 --> 01:18:57,842
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1042
01:18:57,862 --> 01:19:01,900
Speaker 1: That if I were a teacher, I would definitely reward the kids who were subversive in clever ways.

1043
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:11,019
Speaker 0: I mean, we could, that's, I think our show is over, but definitely there is, you know, they think one of the great injustices of that.

1044
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:14,307
Speaker 0: I think a lot of Pete nerds, especially right.

1045
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:20,020
Speaker 0: I've experienced in American school is adults punishing children for children being smarter.

1046
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,065
Speaker 0: It's like, you're there to learn.

1047
01:19:21,286 --> 01:19:23,740
Speaker 0: And then they punish you for knowing more than adults do right.

1048
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:30,080
Speaker 0: A good adults will reward children who are smart, outsmart adults and say, good job.

1049
01:19:30,503 --> 01:19:32,960
Speaker 0: As long as the kids didn't cause harm that much.

1050
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,480
Speaker 1: The reward could be like the teacher aside being like, yo kid, you don't have to do homework for the next two weeks.

1051
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,466
Speaker 1: Don't tell anyone that would have been enough.

1052
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:44,800
Speaker 1: I would have stopped causing trouble, but yeah, rolling stock.

1053
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:50,320
Speaker 1: If you want to play this game, rolling stock.net has an online implementation because the game is so abstract.

1054
01:19:51,181 --> 01:19:52,949
Speaker 1: It's you don't need anything.

1055
01:19:52,969 --> 01:19:54,255
Speaker 1: The fiction of this game is meeting.

1056
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:54,637
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

1057
01:19:55,601 --> 01:19:55,782
Speaker 0: Yes.

1058
01:19:55,822 --> 01:20:00,700
Speaker 0: You can read a PDF to get the complete, the sever as a few PDFs that are available to read the whole rules.

1059
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,486
Speaker 0: And then you can play online for free.

1060
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:06,779
Speaker 0: If you want to play this online for free, contact us and we'll play, I'll play with you.

1061
01:20:07,662 --> 01:20:13,320
Speaker 0: Uh, well we can chat and we can talk to you and I'll give you tips based on my two or three plays of it.

1062
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:18,509
Speaker 0: But I think the game is only much like the 18XX games.

1063
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:25,040
Speaker 1: I like it, but I think it is fatally and deeply flawed in specific and profound ways.

1064
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:30,880
Speaker 1: While I enjoy it and it's interesting, it is more instructive than it is enjoyable.

1065
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:34,672
Speaker 1: Like I am learning things about game design playing these games.

1066
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:37,020
Speaker 1: I'm also seeing the flaws in them.

1067
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:48,600
Speaker 1: And I still feel like doing 18XX games and this, there is a game that can be made that is good in the traditional sense, not just good in the "I want to bang my head against the spreadsheet and see what happens" sense.

1068
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:49,820
Speaker 0: Right.

1069
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:58,240
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's because all these games have in common some core mechanics that do not exist at all in other genres of games.

1070
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,461
Speaker 0: Period.

1071
01:20:59,702 --> 01:20:59,962
Speaker 0: Right?

1072
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:10,280
Speaker 0: And so if we can extract those and just fix all the stuff around them and get rid of the problems, then you can make a truly unique, amazing, popular game.

1073
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,586
Speaker 1: Which I still think comes down to, you can't actually be a tabletop game.

1074
01:21:14,606 --> 01:21:25,720
Speaker 1: It needs to have primarily tabletop sensibility, but real-time markets or slightly more complex stock markets that don't have fiddly rules, like no two companies can be the same price at the same time.

1075
01:21:26,402 --> 01:21:29,109
Speaker 1: That would go a long way toward making this better.

1076
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:32,318
Speaker 0: I think there are ways to do it, but anyway, let's go find something.

1077
01:21:32,358 --> 01:21:32,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm getting hungry.

1078
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,446
Speaker 1: So yeah, stay safe out there, enjoy some rolling stock.

1079
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:42,820
Speaker 1: If you guys want to play, we will play a game and we can all be in misery together as literally no one can afford the last companies.

1080
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,176
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1081

01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:09,290
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1086
01:22:14,078 --> 01:22:17,164
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1087
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:20,250
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1088
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:54,720
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... And a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their name.

1089
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,346
Speaker 1: You may notice I stutter in these from time to time.

1090
01:22:58,426 --> 01:23:04,260
Speaker 1: The new interface actually only shows the first, like, 10 or 11 characters of your names.

1091
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,769
Speaker 1: And I actually have to hover over each one to get a tooltip to see the full name.

1092
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:11,220
Speaker 1: Or I have to export a CSV, which I am far too lazy to do.

1093
01:23:12,441 --> 01:23:17,740
Speaker 1: We're going to try some new stuff with the stream to get the sync a little bit better and maybe up the quality a little bit.

1094
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,407
Speaker 1: We're working on some ways to do live panels.

1095
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:25,080
Speaker 1: As you might have heard a little bit of, Scott and I are thinking about doing a dueling panels contest.

1096
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:32,440
Speaker 1: Where each of us is going to put together a solo video panel or video essay and then we'll just fight to see which one of us did a better one.

1097
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,326
Speaker 1: But all that's in the future.

1098
01:23:34,688 --> 01:23:36,476
Speaker 1: For now, I leave you with...
