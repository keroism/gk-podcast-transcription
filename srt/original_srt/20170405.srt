1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,632
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 5th 2017.

2
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:14,194
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:17,466
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,715
Speaker 0: penny arcades Lookouts comic.

5
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,749
Speaker 0: may we die in the forest and such.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,087
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,398
Speaker 0: So I yeah a couple nights ago.

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,130
Speaker 0: We did the show and he might notice that I only uploaded that show yesterday.

9
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:35,750
Speaker 0: So actually the people who are watching the live stream were the only people who got to listen to that show right away.

10
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:38,515
Speaker 0: We did all the recording.

11
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:43,730
Speaker 0: Scott left and I was dicking around and I went back to actually upload the show and I was watching.

12
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:53,350
Speaker 0: It's always sunny in Philadelphia at the time And then I go to the geek night's website and it's down and then I look and my internet's not working.

13
00:00:53,873 --> 00:01:00,770
Speaker 0: So I'm troubleshooting this but it didn't quite Sink in right away that my internet was actually down because websites weren't working.

14
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:13,620
Speaker 0: But I was watching a TV show that was still playing and it actually kept playing because of Netflix caching for like 15 minutes until it finally petered out.

15
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:24,709
Speaker 0: the internet had been down for at least 15 minutes at that point But I basically had to reboot the FiOS thing in my wall Okay to make it work again.

16
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:32,030
Speaker 0: But the cool thing is the way that works is you log into this Verizon website and you can kind of control that thing remotely.

17
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,830
Speaker 0: So I logged into the Verizon website.

18
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:38,610
Speaker 1: How did you log into the Verizon website if it wasn't working and you couldn't get any internet?

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,103
Speaker 0: So that I could have done it from my phone just by going downstairs to get LTE signal.

20
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:46,637
Speaker 0: good idea, but uh I was too lazy for that.

21
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,969
Speaker 0: So I waited till I got to work and I did it from computer the next day.

22
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,505
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so you couldn't.

23
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:53,140
Speaker 1: No, wait, it doesn't have its own web service.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,701
Speaker 1: You can't just visit like one nine two one six eight No, because it present basically the router.

25
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,170
Speaker 0: my computers all connect to a switch.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,836
Speaker 0: the switch Connects to other switches and the router.

27
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:09,990
Speaker 0: the router connects to via a coax line the FiOS box.

28
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:21,577
Speaker 0: So it treats the the coax line Kind of like the upstream slash ISP layer and then so it connects to it and then the FiOS box Connects to Verizon.

29
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,150
Speaker 0: so the link between the FiOS box and Verizon work.

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,946
Speaker 0: But for whatever reason the FiOS box just wouldn't respond to my router anymore.

31
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,250
Speaker 0: So I had to reboot it.

32
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:38,043
Speaker 0: I think I could have just powered it off and powered it back on But I don't like messing around in the physicality of that box.

33
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:39,388
Speaker 0: So I did it through the interface.

34
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:46,250
Speaker 1: shockingly You know since I got whatever the last time they changed my cable box itself the physical cable box.

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, time Warner for me has been effectively perfect.

36
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:54,487
Speaker 0: The only problems with it is that oh This is my third FiOS outage in the entire time.

37
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:54,990
Speaker 0: We've lived here.

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that I'm still obviously paying too much for too little.

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got like a hundred down and like 50 up.

40
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:04,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a hundred down and only ten up.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,247
Speaker 0: remember how I used to sometimes pay for more ups.

42
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:11,730
Speaker 0: more than once I wasn't paying attention and I'm careful about this now.

43
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:19,090
Speaker 0: I uploaded the WAV file instead of the mp3 to our website Which causes a whole bunch of problems for a lot of reasons?

44
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:23,249
Speaker 0: But it uploads so fast that I wouldn't notice so.

45
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,523
Speaker 1: But I mean even that it's still even the hunt.

46
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,167
Speaker 1: even a hundred.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,035
Speaker 1: a hundred is Slower than the RIT days.

48
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:31,159
Speaker 1: Yeah.

49
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,504
Speaker 0: Well, that's kind of cheating cuz one.

50
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 0: the internet was way different back then.

51
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:35,267
Speaker 1: That's true, too.

52
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,453
Speaker 0: We were on.

53
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:44,442
Speaker 0: we had an OC 3 connected to the internet and we had an OC 3 a separate one connected to Another internet that most of you do not have access to.

54
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:45,686
Speaker 1: I don't have access to.

55
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,610
Speaker 0: I don't have it anymore.

56
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,059
Speaker 0: I wish I did.

57
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:58,398
Speaker 0: I don't think it works quite the same way, but Back then internet 2 was basically just software and media piracy Mm-hmm invisible to the RIAA.

58
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:07,393
Speaker 1: it might still be it might still be but those are what the status of internet 2 is Actually Is it using IP?

59
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,259
Speaker 1: I bet it's using IPv6 like for reals.

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,530
Speaker 0: internet 2 isn't exceptional yet still exists as far as I can tell.

61
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:14,614
Speaker 0: I had an account.

62
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,921
Speaker 0: we were at RIT on the six bone.

63
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,709
Speaker 0: That was the IPv6 like testing network.

64
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,016
Speaker 0: I had a whole.

65
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:29,230
Speaker 0: I got my personal allocation of I of IP addresses on it For a project that I was supposed to do for a class that I then bailed on before the date.

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,705
Speaker 0: You know the six weeks in because I didn't care and the class was too much work.

67
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:33,609
Speaker 0: So I just bailed on it.

68
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,574
Speaker 0: I don't know whatever happened.

69
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,340
Speaker 0: I assume that allocation went away.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,306
Speaker 0: I assume the six bone is gone.

71
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:39,948
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,496
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah, it's when.

73
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:44,582
Speaker 0: yet six bone was the test bits gone.

74
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:45,846
Speaker 0: so my thing is gone.

75
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:46,468
Speaker 1: that's a shame.

76
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:46,889
Speaker 0: Yeah.

77
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,540
Speaker 0: So, uh, there's a bunch of news.

78
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,744
Speaker 0: actually Wednesday shows, you know Anime manga comics pretty easy to do these days.

79
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:54,730
Speaker 0: a lot of stuff is happening.

80
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,845
Speaker 0: So we used to make a much bigger deal about mocha fest.

81
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:58,950
Speaker 0: I mean we would go every year.

82
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,623
Speaker 0: We would like interview all the people with tables.

83
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,410
Speaker 1: Okay fast used to be a much bigger deal.

84
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:14,260
Speaker 0: Yep, it used to be a kind of different deal - it's morphed a lot in the years since the Society of illustrators Gracefully took it over which not to knock them.

85
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,946
Speaker 0: I'm thankful they haven't destroyed it.

86
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:22,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, because The museum that mocha fest supported went under right?

87
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:39,329
Speaker 1: So mocha fest was a indie comics mostly indie comics festival that Existed in order to be the fundraiser for the Museum of comic and cartoon art Which is a mocha is and that museum was very tiny and didn't have a lot of money But they were able to survive with the funds from this one festival per year.

88
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,730
Speaker 1: The festival started out in the puck building.

89
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,060
Speaker 1: It may have been somewhere else before that but we didn't go then.

90
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:48,530
Speaker 1: and then it moved to the armory Which is and it was basically this big-ass festival.

91
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:51,430
Speaker 1: You would go there for like a day and look at all the tables.

92
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,420
Speaker 1: They're only a handful of panels, but they get a lot of creators.

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,423
Speaker 1: They're big names.

94
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,430
Speaker 1: You know, it was a big deal is crowded.

95
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:07,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we used to dedicate entire episodes of geek nights just to what we saw at mocha because there would be so much stuff there That you had to see enough stuff to fill a whole geek nights episode and maybe even more.

96
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:14,410
Speaker 1: But then the Society of the mocha couldn't stay afloat anymore and the Society of illustrators took it over.

97
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:24,630
Speaker 1: So like the museum is now inside the Society of illustrators They rescued their stuff and they still have the festival every year and I'm sure they still make some amount of money on it.

98
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,420
Speaker 1: But it is much much smaller.

99
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,970
Speaker 1: It only cost us five bucks to get in.

100
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,230
Speaker 1: So I guess they're keeping the price reasonable.

101
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:35,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it still has some big name type people there, but it's not the mega thing It used to be like.

102
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,903
Speaker 1: we took instead of taking like multiple hours.

103
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:44,180
Speaker 0: We saw every table in like an hour Yeah, but I like spent time at every table.

104
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:48,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, like looking at like in two hours, you'd be like, all right I seen everything there is to see here.

105
00:06:48,876 --> 00:07:00,175
Speaker 0: I also bought less and part of that is that there's a lot more Zines that even if they have a good cover they are just a bunch of unrelated illustrations, which I guess Society illustrator.

106
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff there.

107
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:05,710
Speaker 1: That is like way awesome to look at but I don't know a lot of stuff.

108
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,066
Speaker 1: That's way awesome to buy and take home and like a mini stapled together comic.

109
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:12,510
Speaker 0: That's like a 10 page tiny comic.

110
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:22,356
Speaker 0: I'm all about Mm-hmm, but I have a lot of them in a box a mini stapled together series of ten illustrations by ten artists nine of which I haven't Heard of even if they're fantastic illustrations.

111
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,190
Speaker 1: I buy them and then what?

112
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

113
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:30,950
Speaker 1: So I only the only things I usually when I see something like that I'll take someone's card and go to their website.

114
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,616
Speaker 1: Also a lot or if I was in the market to hire an illustrator I got a whole bunch of cards.

115
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:41,519
Speaker 0: I can go look at a lot of New York comic artists that I know Who are big were not there.

116
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,406
Speaker 0: Yep, and it was very small was there.

117
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's always there.

118
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:45,915
Speaker 0: I talked to him for a little bit.

119
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:46,719
Speaker 0: He was losing his voice.

120
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:49,250
Speaker 0: I was like, dude, let's talk when you're not like dying here.

121
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:54,844
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna ruin what little of your voice is left But yeah, like a lot of the big names.

122
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:56,347
Speaker 0: I know who live in New York We're not there.

123
00:07:56,611 --> 00:08:00,046
Speaker 1: It used to be a thing that was big enough that was worth traveling to New York to go.

124
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,795
Speaker 0: do not come to New York To go to mocha fest.

125
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,770
Speaker 0: go to mocha fest if you already are in New York, right?

126
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,922
Speaker 1: However, they we now have both SPX and t-caf.

127
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,950
Speaker 1: So if you want the I've been to SPX.

128
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,070
Speaker 0: It's a lot more like what mocha fest used to be and Emily has been to t-caf, right?

129
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:20,150
Speaker 1: so if you want to go to a Indie comics festival and not you know a wizard world or a New York comic-con or what?

130
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:26,069
Speaker 1: That is the places you should go to in the Northeast US Canada technically Toronto area.

131
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,281
Speaker 0: Yep The thing is even they're like traveling to those things like.

132
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,119
Speaker 0: the problem is if you traveled to mocha fest back in the day At least you're in New York.

133
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,407
Speaker 0: There's more to do than just it.

134
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,977
Speaker 1: But some things to do in Toronto.

135
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,702
Speaker 1: the snakes and latte.

136
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:39,667
Speaker 0: is there stuff to do?

137
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,090
Speaker 1: SPX is not the as nothing to do is literally nothing there.

138
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,142
Speaker 0: Like if you don't bring a car there's nowhere to even walk to eat food.

139
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:52,110
Speaker 0: Nope, like you're just in this hotel and Imagine going to an anime con.

140
00:08:52,150 --> 00:09:01,970
Speaker 0: That's just an artist alley and the con stops at like six and unless you know the artists and go to their private hotel room Parties you're just alone in a hotel for the rest of your trip.

141
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,272
Speaker 1: Like that's the kind of thing that you would go to if you could drive there do it and drive home Yeah or you know.

142
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:18,104
Speaker 0: if you know people and you go to one of the hotel parties and like it's like it's a con if you're in That culture and know those poor if you are an artist Yeah, or if you like I did.

143
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:29,396
Speaker 0: the one time I went to SPX I got the presidential suite and threw a giant ass party and invited everybody to it by accident And that was when Caldwell came with us and slept in that giant room with all the statuary Mm-hmm.

144
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:30,810
Speaker 0: That was a weird convention.

145
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:40,111
Speaker 0: But yeah the only significant thing I bought because remember I did we did that podcast where me and Andrew and Scott talked about the Weimar Republic and like the rise of Nazi Germany and All that.

146
00:09:40,492 --> 00:10:00,783
Speaker 0: there was a compilation of all these cute newspaper comics from the Weimar Republic and this dude like in 1934. these comics are just like a dad who's kind of mischievous and his son who's kind of mischievous and they're like short wordless newspaper comics and They give me a little bit of a Calvin and Hobbes vibe and they're really really great.

147
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:05,279
Speaker 0: and it's extra tragic Knowing the story around the people who made it.

148
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,109
Speaker 0: Well the person who made it, you know rise of Nazis, etc.

149
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,148
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was a really interesting book that I would not have run into had I not been at mocha fest.

150
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,565
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, there's a lot of stuff I see at mocha fest.

151
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:17,916
Speaker 1: that's like stuff I'm gonna buy too cuz like there's all.

152
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:20,767
Speaker 1: there's a few big publishers there right like Fanta graphics is.

153
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:21,610
Speaker 1: they are running, you know.

154
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,899
Speaker 1: But it's like the books they got.

155
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:24,622
Speaker 1: there are books.

156
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,650
Speaker 1: I could buy on Amazon cuz they're real publishers.

157
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're like that you already bought on Amazon and I'm gonna borrow from you.

158
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,347
Speaker 1: and really it's like so this.

159
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,609
Speaker 1: so I'm not Gonna buy those at mocha fest.

160
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,521
Speaker 1: So the only books I'm gonna buy there are books like that.

161
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,830
Speaker 1: I know I could not ever find anywhere else ever.

162
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,459
Speaker 0: Also in the old mocha fest there was more stuff like.

163
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,387
Speaker 0: there were big panels and there were.

164
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:45,250
Speaker 1: there are panels.

165
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,636
Speaker 1: The panels are in another building.

166
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's only like there are.

167
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,570
Speaker 1: they have the same number of panels They used to which is like six per day in two rooms.

168
00:10:52,717 --> 00:11:01,870
Speaker 1: Yeah which isn't many but those panels actually have huge names on them because like it used to be they got a ton of huge names and Some of them would be on the panels and some of them just at their tables all the time.

169
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:08,093
Speaker 1: But now it's like they bring in some huge names and those are the people on the panels and not really a lot of other Names come.

170
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:08,554
Speaker 0: Yep.

171
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,946
Speaker 0: So in other news that goes to the shell movie.

172
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:12,930
Speaker 0: That was terrible.

173
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,356
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

174
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:17,747
Speaker 1: Yep, but I don't plan to see it.

175
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:25,149
Speaker 0: I There is a scenario had I not known things that I knew about it where I might have considered going to see it.

176
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:31,949
Speaker 0: But knowing the things that I know I'm definitely not gonna go see it and it was a huge box-office disaster so far.

177
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,598
Speaker 0: Now make money domestically.

178
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:38,129
Speaker 0: it is not looking like it's gonna make its money internationally, right?

179
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:42,770
Speaker 1: So, you know, I've heard a lot of things about it But since I haven't seen it, I can't confirm or deny them.

180
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:55,130
Speaker 1: but the one thing I did see that I do want to comment on is I think like someone from the studio that Produced it was like, uh, you know, he was basically complaining like yeah because these fanboys made a thing.

181
00:11:56,371 --> 00:12:01,010
Speaker 1: It didn't you know, he's busy blaming the fanboys in whole or in part for the failure of the movie.

182
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,890
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's like maybe if you had, you know, and the sort of discussion that happens from that is like, you know.

183
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:10,779
Speaker 1: It's like hey, you know, it's not.

184
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,963
Speaker 1: maybe your movie just sucked.

185
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:13,990
Speaker 1: Maybe just no one cared about it, right?

186
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,629
Speaker 1: That's sort of thing.

187
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:27,908
Speaker 1: but the thing I'm he's basically the guy was presenting this sort of scenario where it's like They had to change it to make in a way that made fun boys upset To appeal to the mainstream to make enough money to pay for it.

188
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:40,002
Speaker 1: But the argument that I'm presenting that no one else seems to present is that like you are vastly Underestimating the number of people that are fanboys By pissing them off is why you made no money.

189
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,309
Speaker 1: if you would just appeal to them.

190
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:48,510
Speaker 1: There actually are the mainstream and so also there's a so total side There is that you have no idea how many fanboys there are.

191
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,814
Speaker 0: What does he mean by fanboys?

192
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,278
Speaker 0: because there there's the fanboy of.

193
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:55,730
Speaker 0: it must be exactly like a shiro's comic in every detail.

194
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,304
Speaker 1: You made it crazy shiro style.

195
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,350
Speaker 1: it would have done crazy.

196
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,142
Speaker 0: Well, there's the people who do who think they're fanboys But don't know who shiro is and want it to be exactly like.

197
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,630
Speaker 0: oh, she's stuff for Kamehameha stuff.

198
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,108
Speaker 1: I would have been great would have made money, too.

199
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:19,986
Speaker 0: But there's the other set of people who independent of if they are fanboys or would have cared about Adaptation because standalone complex is a hugely Deviant adaptation of the comics.

200
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,650
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The movies also are pretty deviant from a lot of what the comics would do.

201
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,607
Speaker 0: They're already all these adaptations the superfans of ghosts in the shell pretty okay.

202
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,450
Speaker 0: with adaptation.

203
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:44,010
Speaker 0: the people who were mad and vocal were mostly the people who are mad about all the whitewashing nonsense and The fact that the whitewashing nonsense was once we learned what the plot was Way worse than like anyone could have expected.

204
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:47,201
Speaker 0: Like the plot was she got whitewashed.

205
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:47,904
Speaker 1: the point.

206
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,570
Speaker 1: someone pointed out something on Twitter today.

207
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,089
Speaker 1: I forget the exact details, but they were like look this kimono friends thing.

208
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:59,054
Speaker 1: Kimono something like that Gets an average of like 75,000 retweets right.

209
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:07,464
Speaker 1: yep the president of the United States Matt is like ceilinging at around 25k.

210
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:14,452
Speaker 1: read Okay, so if you had just made something with nerd appeal You can.

211
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:19,891
Speaker 1: it doesn't have to be exactly like the original any of the existing ghost in the shell universes because they don't match each Other.

212
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:24,906
Speaker 1: it just has to be a non whitewashed real ghost in the shell things.

213
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:27,274
Speaker 0: the thing if they're gonna blame the fanboys I saw.

214
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:28,940
Speaker 1: oh there are tons of it.

215
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,370
Speaker 1: There are more fanboys are the mainstream.

216
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,133
Speaker 1: He's the.

217
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:39,798
Speaker 1: don't believe in this sort of false dichotomy between like oh you have to sell to the mainstream Versus nerds like no nerds of the majority.

218
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,810
Speaker 1: That's why you're investing in ghosts in the shell because there's a lot of nerds out there.

219
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:50,570
Speaker 0: Also We're not complaining about deviations from the canon of ghost in the shell.

220
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:53,641
Speaker 0: I saw almost no one credible complaining about that.

221
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:56,310
Speaker 0: the people were complaining about all the racist nonsense.

222
00:14:56,498 --> 00:15:03,330
Speaker 0: Yep That was the pre-release Controversy the fact that the movie appears to be kind of bland and the plot was kind of dumb.

223
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,629
Speaker 0: That didn't come out until the movie came out.

224
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,680
Speaker 0: Like I did not see anyone talk about that until after the movie was out.

225
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:13,230
Speaker 0: the damage was done by the racist stuff way in advance.

226
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,543
Speaker 0: And you know that controversy I mean that started what when they cast it?

227
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:18,627
Speaker 0: that was a long time ago.

228
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:23,984
Speaker 1: point is Maybe all you keep trying to do the same thing and he's failing.

229
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,361
Speaker 0: and you remember that Dragon Ball movie They may be.

230
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:26,969
Speaker 1: we're right.

231
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:33,007
Speaker 1: You know nerds aren't nerds who complain about things are usually often wrong like Counter-Strike players complaining about.

232
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:38,339
Speaker 0: you know the AWP But I know a lot of non-nerds Shit out of Akira to this day.

233
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,710
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean that they always wrong.

234
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,750
Speaker 1: This was a time when the nerds are right and you should have done what the nerds said and you make a lot of money.

235
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:59,874
Speaker 0: If you did, yep The problem is I worry that Hollywood is gonna learn the wrong lesson and they're gonna believe that it was negative pre-hype Coupled with some like dumb crap about maybe can't have a female protagonist Or maybe they'll learn.

236
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:05,499
Speaker 1: maybe the lesson they'll learn is huh turning an anime into a live-action movie doesn't sell which is a fine Lesson for them to learn.

237
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,448
Speaker 1: stop doing it.

238
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:11,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, stop doing it and maybe in the future someone will do it, right But I don't think it's ever happened.

239
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,241
Speaker 1: Has there ever been a good one?

240
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:20,219
Speaker 0: has there ever been a Western live-action adaptation of an anime?

241
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:32,601
Speaker 1: not direct but there have been many sort of you know indirect for example, yeah, right, uh you know you have Like the matrix right?

242
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:40,070
Speaker 0: It's not directly Adapting anything borrowed from things but I'm talking adaptation kind of like how people say video game movies are bad.

243
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:41,681
Speaker 1: I'm like magnificent.

244
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:42,286
Speaker 1: magnificent.

245
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:50,350
Speaker 1: seven is Not as good as seven samurai, but it is an adaptation of seven samurai and it's good and it's not bad.

246
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good movie, but I don't think that has ever happened with anime.

247
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,430
Speaker 0: I Mean well, I'm also as though she ever made a lot a good live-action movie.

248
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:01,762
Speaker 1: But I mean seven samurai is a Japanese movie.

249
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:08,516
Speaker 1: that's better than any anime movie Also all Japanese but Best Japanese movie there is.

250
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:09,278
Speaker 0: I can't.

251
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,630
Speaker 0: you can successfully adapt that any live-action anime anything in the West ever.

252
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,858
Speaker 0: That's been good or even watchable.

253
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,546
Speaker 0: Mmm.

254
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,490
Speaker 0: I am really hard-pressed.

255
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,746
Speaker 0: No, no listeners got nothing.

256
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,053
Speaker 1: people don't hate That.

257
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:30,823
Speaker 1: the thing with the robots the thing with the robots What's it called Pacific Rim?

258
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:38,950
Speaker 0: Yes, that is So like it borrowed from Evangelion, but it is so far removed from Evangelion.

259
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,792
Speaker 1: I'm not saying like.

260
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:45,087
Speaker 1: I've seen part of it most half ish of it and it is not like.

261
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,837
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say it's good But it's not bad.

262
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,490
Speaker 1: It's it's gotta be better than what I'm hearing about this ghost in the show.

263
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:50,973
Speaker 1: I don't get.

264
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:53,550
Speaker 0: that doesn't count though because it's not in any way related.

265
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:58,648
Speaker 1: But the point is you can go down that road at least some of the way and not completely fail.

266
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:09,770
Speaker 1: So there are plenty of other cyberpunk robot people Movies that have come out from Hollywood that are quite excellent.

267
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:14,317
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I also read a review that said that even if you forget And Terminator.

268
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,570
Speaker 0: Yeah forget any other problem with this movie.

269
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:24,326
Speaker 0: they said the plot was like really simplistic and boring and Doesn't really go anywhere and barely seems to have anything to do with ghost in the show.

270
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:32,790
Speaker 0: Mmm also, apparently Characters will speak Japanese, but then all the other characters will speak to them in English.

271
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,560
Speaker 1: I mean that makes sense in cyber land where everyone has translators in their brain.

272
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:47,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if the movie is set in Japan But you're not used like either have the whole thing be in Japanese or have the whole thing just be in English and do That is weird.

273
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:53,230
Speaker 1: If someone is pretend it's all in Japanese like but it's really who's talking in Japanese and who's talking in English.

274
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:59,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently there's things where character Aramaki will say stuff in Japanese and everyone responds to him in English.

275
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:04,689
Speaker 1: My responding to him in English, uh other Japanese like Toga said who's a Japanese person.

276
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:08,514
Speaker 0: They had some tweet where he was like I think was my tool.

277
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:17,189
Speaker 0: someone in my Twitter feed was like I gotta replace our maki's Speech and treat him like Chewbacca because that's basically what they do with Japanese in this movie.

278
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:23,170
Speaker 1: I mean it makes sense if say like, you know an American agent came to visit or something.

279
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:28,690
Speaker 1: They spoke English because they knew there was mega translators because everyone is so high-tech.

280
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:31,709
Speaker 1: but if you're it would be weird if that person came.

281
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,625
Speaker 0: and When you're making a movie, you generally have everyone speaking English.

282
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:41,101
Speaker 1: also in a site, you know If you're releasing it in America, the other thing is inside something.

283
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,346
Speaker 1: it goes in the shell period.

284
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:44,550
Speaker 1: in cyber world You don't really need language.

285
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:50,338
Speaker 1: Everyone can just transfer bits between their brains doesn't need to actually communicate with a written human language Spoken one.

286
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,730
Speaker 0: even in the Ghost in the Shell manga Most people communicate was effectively spoken thought language, right?

287
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,708
Speaker 1: That always bothered me because I'm like a in cyber land where everyone communicate with just brain-touching.

288
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:05,281
Speaker 0: That's a plot point of all of Ghost in the Shell.

289
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:13,930
Speaker 1: the idea that you can't just send the direct data Anyway, that's they talk to each other over the great distance with what's effectively telepathy.

290
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:20,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they still send symbols as opposed to raw data because those symbols are still interpreted by parts of their brain.

291
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,430
Speaker 0: It's not a complete.

292
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:28,810
Speaker 0: There are very few beings in the Ghost in the Shell universe who communicate Directly on that low level because it's arguable that they're not even human anymore.

293
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:35,994
Speaker 1: The point is if and we had that story with me on this I'd be communicating in at least see And at least see.

294
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,479
Speaker 0: yeah, I got different libraries now.

295
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:38,923
Speaker 0: I'm little Indian.

296
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:40,207
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

297
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:40,990
Speaker 1: Don't be little?

298
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:42,729
Speaker 1: Internet is big Indian.

299
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:47,570
Speaker 0: The network is little Indian anyway.

300
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:52,084
Speaker 0: So there was some news that there's going to be a.

301
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:52,546
Speaker 1: I don't know.

302
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,294
Speaker 1: by the way This is a Monday topic.

303
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:58,063
Speaker 1: I don't know whose decision it was to make the internet big Indian.

304
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:02,560
Speaker 1: when x86 processors are little Indian X 86 came first.

305
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:03,647
Speaker 1: No way.

306
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,090
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.

307
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:06,138
Speaker 1: Internet came first.

308
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,350
Speaker 1: Internet's from 1969.

309
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,036
Speaker 1: O86 didn't even exist then right?

310
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:13,307
Speaker 1: Whoever decided to make x86 little ideas at a big Indian.

311
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:14,210
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

312
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,821
Speaker 0: Should that be our next Monday show?

313
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,049
Speaker 1: No, there's nothing else to say.

314
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:25,530
Speaker 0: Every computer should just say doubt that Most of the people who are listening to this have any idea what we're talking about.

315
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,132
Speaker 0: That's fine.

316
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:28,559
Speaker 0: In fact, because I am NOT a computer scientist.

317
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,410
Speaker 0: I have only a conceptual understanding of this Oh, I can tell you it's really so well.

318
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:41,357
Speaker 0: The problem is you say you can say that the fact that you don't know why network stuff is the way it is Means that complete.

319
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:43,450
Speaker 1: as far as I know it's a completely arbitrary decision.

320
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you send bytes sequentially over the internet.

321
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,030
Speaker 0: which bytes are more important, especially in a network where performance might matter?

322
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,669
Speaker 1: You're really gonna start routing when you've seen half the bits.

323
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:56,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about that anyway.

324
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,630
Speaker 0: So there was an announcement that I saw all over the place that there's gonna be a squirrel girl TV show.

325
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:05,923
Speaker 1: That's I mean, first of all, that's great.

326
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:09,362
Speaker 1: cuz squirrel girl is the best Yeah, but I'm not gonna watch it.

327
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:10,790
Speaker 1: cuz not watching any TV shows.

328
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,918
Speaker 1: But how is that gonna be?

329
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,163
Speaker 0: don't watch any TV shows?

330
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:14,865
Speaker 0: What about anime?

331
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:16,130
Speaker 0: you watch anime, right?

332
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,247
Speaker 1: I'm not watching a you know superhero garbage, but nothing.

333
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:24,130
Speaker 1: I Can't imagine that this would actually be good unless right is Ryan North writing it.

334
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,828
Speaker 0: So I was a little bit interested but apparently no the actual news was freeform.

335
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:31,614
Speaker 0: We'll get back to what the fuck that?

336
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,421
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell that is ordered.

337
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:36,190
Speaker 0: not squirrel girl, but new warriors.

338
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,989
Speaker 0: They're making a new

339
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:53,790
Speaker 1: Right, so I saw this headline and I thought that what the headline was saying was that there's gonna be a new new warriors comic because I don't think there's been a new warriors comic since like maybe the 90s or I don't even remember when the last Time there was a new warriors comic and squirrel girl was gonna be on the team which makes perfect sense

340
00:22:54,151 --> 00:23:00,250
Speaker 0: Yep, but no it's a new warriors show that may or may not actually have squirrel girl in it.

341
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:09,250
Speaker 1: Okay, and by the way, it's girl girl had never had anything as far as I know never had anything to do with the new Warriors, yeah, but the new warriors is just like what teenagers right?

342
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,850
Speaker 1: I think she was like into speedball and maybe speedball was a new warrior.

343
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:16,944
Speaker 0: I think speed I don't know all the new I so I've never read new warriors.

344
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:18,870
Speaker 1: new warriors is basically some buyers.

345
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,599
Speaker 0: Yes, people speedball is totally one of them.

346
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,914
Speaker 1: Yeah new warriors is a Marvel boy.

347
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,614
Speaker 0: Namorita the hell's namorita the Morita it's namorita.

348
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:29,975
Speaker 1: Okay.

349
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,380
Speaker 0: I don't know that is now.

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,162
Speaker 1: more is the.

351
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:34,128
Speaker 0: basically they're fighting the juggernaut.

352
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,096
Speaker 0: now more I don't know other than speedball.

353
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:37,824
Speaker 0: I have no idea who any of these people are.

354
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:40,175
Speaker 1: Okay, so night Thrasher I don't know who that is.

355
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:41,523
Speaker 0: I've seen fire star.

356
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:42,630
Speaker 1: Yeah fire start.

357
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:47,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've run into fire star before but anyway namorita, you know namor the prince of the sea.

358
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:48,310
Speaker 1: He's the Aquaman.

359
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:49,896
Speaker 1: He's the Aquaman of Marvel.

360
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:53,891
Speaker 1: Okay only he's way more badass and actually serious and not a joke Like.

361
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:54,434
Speaker 1: I'll come in.

362
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:58,818
Speaker 1: Okay now Morita is basically Teenage girl.

363
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,110
Speaker 1: now more store doing here.

364
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:03,558
Speaker 1: Thor That might be Thor.

365
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:04,786
Speaker 1: I think that's Thor.

366
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:07,195
Speaker 1: I don't know But Nova's cool.

367
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:07,697
Speaker 1: I like Nova.

368
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:08,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

369
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:08,782
Speaker 1: Okay.

370
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,670
Speaker 1: Nova's good when he's doing space anyway.

371
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:17,670
Speaker 0: So people kept saying freeform ordered it freeform ordered it and I literally didn't know what freeform.

372
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,340
Speaker 1: I never heard of freeform before today.

373
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:20,225
Speaker 0: So I looked it up.

374
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:31,530
Speaker 0: a Freeform is the name of the television network that has Continued to evolve since the last time I knew about it when it was the family channel.

375
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,424
Speaker 1: So why would there be a Marvel superhero TV show on the family channel?

376
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:37,708
Speaker 1: Wouldn't this be on like it says?

377
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:38,390
Speaker 1: Disney owns it?

378
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,421
Speaker 1: All right, so wouldn't it just be on ABC or would it be?

379
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,650
Speaker 0: Oh, this is so complicated.

380
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:48,731
Speaker 0: So the history of freeform goes back to 1977.

381
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:51,400
Speaker 0: All right, holy shit is this cable?

382
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,611
Speaker 1: there was cable in 77 so there was TV in 1977.

383
00:24:54,611 --> 00:25:01,650
Speaker 0: all right, but what is freeform today was actually one of the first satellite distributed television networks.

384
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:11,479
Speaker 0: It was one of the first cable channels Mm-hmm, but it was originally Originally as far as most people would know The family channel.

385
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,576
Speaker 0: most people who watch TV and grew up in my era Was the family.

386
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:16,910
Speaker 1: you heard of the family channel and I've never watched anything.

387
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:22,948
Speaker 0: The family channel was a channel that if you were a kid and you're as old as we are We got it on cable, but we didn't watch it.

388
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,910
Speaker 0: Well, because it was as old as us in the early 80s the family channel came to existence.

389
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:34,826
Speaker 0: It was a standard cable package channel So anyone who had cable that was just one of the channels I get at other people's houses.

390
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:36,795
Speaker 1: some other kids watched it But we didn't watch it.

391
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, she was Nickelodeon and MTV.

392
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:41,378
Speaker 1: We watched Viacom channels in our house.

393
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,148
Speaker 0: the boring kids who came from families that wouldn't let them watch good TV Like super Christian families tended to watch the family channel because it was inoffensive.

394
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:49,530
Speaker 0: pablum.

395
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watched Viacom channels in our house.

396
00:25:51,718 --> 00:26:01,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I did not know this until I was looking into this but the family channel spun off from CBN.

397
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,723
Speaker 0: Alright had Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network.

398
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:06,586
Speaker 1: I mean that makes sense.

399
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:17,810
Speaker 0: That was like Televangelical scams, but I don't remember there being any Overt, you know Christian stuff on the family chair was but they played in the hours that you probably weren't watching.

400
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:20,050
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean I was watching it either.

401
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,411
Speaker 0: They.

402
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:27,099
Speaker 0: basically it evolved into being the channel that like ultra Christian families would force their kids to watch because they locked out all the good channels.

403
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:34,630
Speaker 0: Mmm This is like old-school TV network stuff, which is difficult to put into useful context quickly.

404
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:45,726
Speaker 0: But basically this channel got bought and bought and moved and sold and moved and moved and moving forever And I think Disney and ABC both own a chunk of it.

405
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:46,730
Speaker 1: Disney owns ABC.

406
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,330
Speaker 0: So Disney, but I don't know if Disney owns it directly or if Disney owning ABC causes them to own it indirectly.

407
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:54,636
Speaker 0: I can't.

408
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:55,721
Speaker 0: it's all the same company.

409
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:58,796
Speaker 1: Disney Marvel Star Wars Muppets ABC.

410
00:26:58,836 --> 00:26:59,681
Speaker 1: they're all the same company.

411
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,030
Speaker 1: ESPN all the same company.

412
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,635
Speaker 1: It's all just Disney.

413
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:03,698
Speaker 1: Disney is all that.

414
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:10,528
Speaker 0: so if best I can tell did Marvel was taking bids for who would get this show?

415
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:14,803
Speaker 0: and Free form like the thing that they were taking bids for?

416
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,647
Speaker 1: who would get the show.

417
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:16,390
Speaker 1: How does that work?

418
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,593
Speaker 0: Fuck if I know.

419
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:18,115
Speaker 1: why would you?

420
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:23,013
Speaker 1: why would you're auctioning off what you're making a TV show and auctioning it off Like I don't.

421
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:23,897
Speaker 1: how does work?

422
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,348
Speaker 0: I barely knew how does this TV business work?

423
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:26,790
Speaker 1: What's those God?

424
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,478
Speaker 0: I barely knew how this works.

425
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,986
Speaker 1: How do you make money with that?

426
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:30,509
Speaker 0: back in the well?

427
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,560
Speaker 0: Back in the old day because this network has made other shows before.

428
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,790
Speaker 0: you might have heard of baby daddy or no teachers.

429
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,736
Speaker 1: No, they have shows.

430
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,723
Speaker 0: All right, and I guess freeform.

431
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:43,830
Speaker 1: How do they make money by making shows if no one?

432
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,982
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not getting into that.

433
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:58,409
Speaker 0: There's way Longer topic that we get into but gay freeform as far as I can tell has never made anything That I would care about and thus I have very little confidence that this show is going to be good.

434
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,931
Speaker 1: Well, how would it be good?

435
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,193
Speaker 0: and that is my opinion on that.

436
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:10,160
Speaker 0: okay things of the day.

437
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:26,324
Speaker 0: so, uh, I am NOT a member of this community, but I am a member of a similarly important community because Internet culture as you know it today is driven way more than you realize by the combination of FARC 4chan in the early

438
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:26,726
Speaker 1: days

439
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:32,619
Speaker 0: and something fucking awful something awful If you have no idea what that is.

440
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:44,820
Speaker 0: it was basically just a form of people in the like in the early days of the modern internet like after the original Doc and it was a really typical forum like a V bullet in PHP VB style kind of thing.

441
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,339
Speaker 1: It wasn't a fancy forum at all.

442
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:51,159
Speaker 0: But it just for a lot of reasons that uh, you should read this because you might learn a thing or two.

443
00:28:51,522 --> 00:29:00,876
Speaker 0: But if you were if you don't know anything about something awful This is a sort of interview oral history of what something awful was and why it was the way it was.

444
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:04,447
Speaker 1: the interviewing low-tax is the Basically every big name.

445
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is low-tax is the guy.

446
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's other guys.

447
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:16,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure But something awful is way important to the internet and and unlike other things that are way important Well the way not terrible.

448
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not some horrible.

449
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:24,494
Speaker 0: It doesn't have any ickiness on it As well, it has the same level of ickiness that everything on the internet does right.

450
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,480
Speaker 1: but the people running it weren't pieces of shit.

451
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not like scumbags.

452
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,037
Speaker 1: They need to be.

453
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:41,908
Speaker 1: you know Not saying that side has not had its share of problems, but by and large you have a big internet community of shitty people in it, but the the the Governance and such the people running the show are not bad now.

454
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:49,526
Speaker 0: I'm a member of the fart community, which was parallel to this and Similarly strong and probably similarly important.

455
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:50,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, Drew Curtis isn't bad guy.

456
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:51,794
Speaker 0: No, he's actually.

457
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:54,186
Speaker 0: he's been doing a newsletter kind of like your newsletter For geek nights.

458
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:54,509
Speaker 0: Hmm.

459
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:55,760
Speaker 0: It's real good.

460
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,280
Speaker 1: I haven't done my newsletter only because I usually do it at work and even busy at work.

461
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:03,475
Speaker 1: I've been doing other stuff instead.

462
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:08,040
Speaker 1: So I'm you know, I don't have like a whole day at work of doing nothing to write a newsletter.

463
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:11,366
Speaker 0: I've actually been really busy at work lately, too Which is what you might.

464
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:17,977
Speaker 1: I've been tweeting you last which a lot of you I keep like every day I look at my to-do list is like newsletter But then I get to work and it's like can I do nothing today except newsletter?

465
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:20,412
Speaker 1: No Yeah, I have to do a thing today.

466
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:26,111
Speaker 0: Also, honestly Breath of the Wild Killed all my discretionary hours.

467
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:33,420
Speaker 0: Well, I wasn't gonna write a newsletter when I'm at home Yeah, but I play Breath of the Wild in lieu of a lot of other things, but this is so fascinating.

468
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:34,505
Speaker 0: You have to read this.

469
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,252
Speaker 0: Okay, it's real long too.

470
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:43,614
Speaker 1: So my thing today is Maybe is fascinating but very short is a little tiny video of us of a nice Nick.

471
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:44,436
Speaker 1: Let's Nick.

472
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:48,119
Speaker 1: I like snakes like snakes So this snake is not too bright.

473
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:56,414
Speaker 1: We don't see what actually happened which would have made this video like an all-time great video But we get to see an aftermath in this video.

474
00:30:56,515 --> 00:31:00,230
Speaker 1: It's even in the thumbnail I don't even see to watch the video, but I think I'm sad.

475
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,254
Speaker 1: I think it's in Brazil.

476
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:07,032
Speaker 1: this stupid snack Attacked a pork you pine and he got.

477
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,080
Speaker 1: what happens when you attack a porcupine?

478
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,960
Speaker 1: And it got me thinking I was talking to rim before the show.

479
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,296
Speaker 1: like you think of the biggest baddest animals that are still existing and not extinct on earth.

480
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:27,740
Speaker 1: you think of like gorilla and human and great white shark and Elephant right or lion right and you don't think about porcupine.

481
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,016
Speaker 1: It's not as something you think about too often like you know about porcupines.

482
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:38,920
Speaker 1: You've heard of them You've seen them, but it's not an animal you think about too often unless you're like a big porcupine fan Or that's your zoologist in the porcupine part of the zoo.

483
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,620
Speaker 0: I mean if you're if you're deep into evangelical, and you think a lot about hedgehog hedge is not a porcupine.

484
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,705
Speaker 1: No, I'd even related.

485
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,700
Speaker 1: I think they're just similar with their defensive functions.

486
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:54,100
Speaker 1: But the point is porcupine fucks up lion porcupine fucks up elephant porcupine fucks up shark porcupine fucks up gorilla.

487
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,390
Speaker 0: What is the difference between a hedgehog and a porcupine?

488
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:00,219
Speaker 0: right porcupine answer they're very different species WTF?

489
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have nothing to do with each other.

490
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,360
Speaker 1: porcupines fuck up humans, right?

491
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,231
Speaker 1: So all the biggest baddest animals that you normally think of.

492
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:10,297
Speaker 1: maybe an elephant could just stomp one But I bet its foot would get fucked up.

493
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:15,699
Speaker 1: Maybe a lion could just sort of like squat one real good to send it flying You know.

494
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,872
Speaker 1: But it's like that lines gonna get some thorns in the paw.

495
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:19,454
Speaker 0: look at this.

496
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,080
Speaker 0: pork is a fable about that.

497
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,108
Speaker 0: Three lines are looking at this porcupine.

498
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:25,317
Speaker 0: the porcupine is like I give zero fucks.

499
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:26,140
Speaker 0: I'm just hanging out.

500
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, four lines.

501
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:30,837
Speaker 1: Oh for lion and porcupine clearly beats neck right.

502
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:31,800
Speaker 1: the snake just got owned.

503
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's a. snakes are pretty dangerous too, especially if they're poison.

504
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 1: so well if they're venomous porcupine The most dangerous animal on earth is it like the king of all?

505
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,846
Speaker 1: Species that really exist?

506
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:52,640
Speaker 0: no because they have a super high defense stat But they do not have the highest like attack stat.

507
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,042
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

508
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:54,728
Speaker 1: it puts its spikes out and comes at you.

509
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:57,760
Speaker 0: you're gonna run the spikes mostly run in those spikes.

510
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,860
Speaker 1: How is that not offense?

511
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,459
Speaker 0: So if he's coming at me you have to stop and turn around like butt into me.

512
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,445
Speaker 0: I can run faster than a poor.

513
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:06,551
Speaker 1: He's got spikes in all directions.

514
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,720
Speaker 0: I can run away faster than a porcupine.

515
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:15,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get away, but if he gets you yeah, he can do aerial deny.

516
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,088
Speaker 1: He can make you go anywhere.

517
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,387
Speaker 1: He wants you to go or he can make you not go anywhere He doesn't want you to.

518
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:26,300
Speaker 0: he can definitely do area denial But he could not like he could not displace me from my small shack home.

519
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,330
Speaker 1: It's some of them like shoot their quills like pee pee pee.

520
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:32,386
Speaker 0: I know that is not a thing Spiders, it's only a video.

521
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:33,471
Speaker 0: spiders can do that.

522
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 1: It's only a video game like tarantulas.

523
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:41,190
Speaker 0: Fun fact if you have if you ever meet a tarantula Don't put your face right up in his biz because he doesn't like you.

524
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,402
Speaker 0: he can shoot his tiny spines into your eyeball and guess What.

525
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:46,534
Speaker 0: there's basically no way to fix that.

526
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:47,580
Speaker 1: You'll just be blind forever.

527
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:49,387
Speaker 0: Well, there's very.

528
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:55,448
Speaker 0: it's very difficult to remove these thousands of tiny spines from your eye So they'll have to just work their way out on their own.

529
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,017
Speaker 0: and if that doesn't sound fun, guess what?

530
00:33:58,057 --> 00:33:58,840
Speaker 0: It's really not fun.

531
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,131
Speaker 1: Why are you putting your face close to a tarantula case?

532
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:01,614
Speaker 0: You don't know.

533
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:02,579
Speaker 0: like maybe you might not know.

534
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,813
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess you could do it if it's in an aquarium or something.

535
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,469
Speaker 0: tarantulas are pretty cute and cool I guess terrarium.

536
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:09,760
Speaker 1: It's not full of water.

537
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,909
Speaker 1: They would drown the spider in the meta moment.

538
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:19,253
Speaker 0: The book club book is Frank Gerberts Doon Doon with the spice and the Arrakis we're gonna be at.

539
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:22,425
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be a Zenkai con doing some panels at the end of this Month, I'm not.

00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:27,004
Speaker 0: I'm also gonna be in London and Paris around the end of this month I'm not.

541
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:31,458

Speaker 0: He ignites is gonna be at all three of these motherfuckers.

546
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,880
Speaker 1: Hopefully they could decide to start rejecting us.

547
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:58,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, if my panel gets rejected the packs awesome, probably not gonna go you don't say but we've never been rejected.

548
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,883
Speaker 1: I can't.

549
00:34:58,983 --> 00:34:59,827
Speaker 1: I'm very kind.

550
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,495
Speaker 1: I'm like 99% confident.

551
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:02,460
Speaker 1: We're in packs unplugged.

552
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:07,375
Speaker 1: You know prime they gave me giving us the one every time.

553
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,942
Speaker 0: sometimes do still I'm.

554
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:12,000
Speaker 0: it's not like the old days where we do like four at paxi.

555
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:13,427
Speaker 1: I'm still worried about.

556
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:17,671
Speaker 1: you know, maybe prime will say no cuz it's so big I'm always worried but I'm going to prime no matter what.

557
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:20,666
Speaker 0: even if packs told us never come back I would keep coming back to prime.

558
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

559
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:21,812
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't I?

560
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I got a dev - it's a whole week.

561
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:25,460
Speaker 1: Might have normal bum badges.

562
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:27,026
Speaker 0: I don't know what I would do.

563
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:28,270
Speaker 0: that would be the end of an era.

564
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:37,116
Speaker 0: but packs unplugged is a thing and I feel like You need to bring it up and call attention to it because a lot of people are asking me about it Like I know anything more than the internet does.

565
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,960
Speaker 0: well We do know you kind of know a little bit more than the internet.

566
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,400
Speaker 1: I think that packs does not expect packs unplugged to be super popular.

567
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:53,500
Speaker 1: They have announced that the tickets will go on sale on May 3rd, May 3rd Which means they're not expecting a scalping because they thought scalping was gonna happen.

568
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,685
Speaker 1: They wouldn't reveal such guys.

569
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,192
Speaker 0: The Philly Convention Center is big.

570
00:35:56,212 --> 00:36:04,580
Speaker 0: It ain't that big Yeah, and also Philly is a like day trip train ride away from New York City from a lot of places.

571
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,072
Speaker 1: So a lot of people are in range of those bags.

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,273
Speaker 1: And also it's gonna be midnight while hotels will be opened up.

579
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:40,260
Speaker 1: wider hotels are open up now.

580
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,032
Speaker 0: Well, they're not fully open as we got.

581
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:43,120
Speaker 1: we got a room already.

582
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:45,129
Speaker 0: I got another room just in case.

583
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:50,140
Speaker 0: that's good because you got a room because way back We were planning on me not going and I got a room with Tracy.

584
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:52,470
Speaker 0: But now it's very likely that I'll be going.

585
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,715
Speaker 0: so I got a room just in case.

586
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:54,438
Speaker 1: where'd you get your room?

587
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:54,920
Speaker 1: in a loft?

588
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,649
Speaker 0: I went the a loft.

589
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,035
Speaker 1: we got the.

590
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:59,454
Speaker 0: a loft Is connected to the Convention Center.

591
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:08,820
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell that's good But the the other hotel the Marriott is like one block away Mm-hmm, but supposedly more rooms will open up in these blocks once the badges go live.

592
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:14,493
Speaker 0: That makes sense, but you can totally book rooms right now If you think you're gonna go to this, I highly recommend you do so.

593
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,920
Speaker 0: one of them is already sold out.

594
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,485
Speaker 1: I also recommend going to this.

595
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:19,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is gonna be a good packs.

596
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:20,414
Speaker 0: It's gonna be.

597
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:26,517
Speaker 1: it's gonna be so much dice and RPG and wooden cube action like.

598
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:32,998
Speaker 1: yeah You're gonna not want to even see a wooden cube or a dice ever again For like a week after you go to this, but it is going to be.

599
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,989
Speaker 0: Don't even started on the number of cards.

600
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:35,592
Speaker 1: You're gonna see.

601
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:37,140
Speaker 1: you're gonna see so many cards.

602
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:44,132
Speaker 1: Like if you see another card, you guys like burn it, but seriously guys This is going to be a real magic show and just walk out.

603
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:45,096
Speaker 1: cuz too many cards.

604
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:45,276
Speaker 0: like.

605
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,244
Speaker 0: they're narrowing the focus But they've made it very clear.

606
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:48,789
Speaker 0: This will count as a packs.

607
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:55,739
Speaker 1: Like it is a packs the things you expect panels Omegathons keynotes, we don't get to have all we we don't know for sure.

608
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:03,725
Speaker 1: We expect it to have all of the usual packs things except for video games except for video games that are digital Implementations of board games.

609
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:04,026
Speaker 1: Nope.

610
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:07,017
Speaker 0: I could see I could see like Hearthstone being here.

611
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,444
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, absolutely Cuz.

612
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:12,125
Speaker 1: that's the fact that's a tabletop game Virtual table table.

613
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:15,260
Speaker 1: up by the way Hearthstone major expansion comes out tomorrow.

614
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:23,107
Speaker 1: Un'goro dinosaur cards All right, so let's talk about some lookouts.

615
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:33,400
Speaker 1: so way back in the day, you know the penny arcade the hulkins and krahulik team You know, they've made a lot of other properties besides, you know, just penny arcade itself.

616
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,454
Speaker 0: A lot of them have been like concepts or like short ideas.

617
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:43,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got the Automata now is a real thing and the sand one with the desert whatnots, right?

618
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,525
Speaker 1: But lookouts was one.

619
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:52,169
Speaker 1: it's sort of in this sort of Ironwood universe that also includes the thorn watch and you know The daughters and whatever.

620
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:59,488
Speaker 1: but you know, the lookouts is basically like Boy Scouts Except fantasy world full of fantasy stuff.

621
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:05,709
Speaker 1: Plus it's super dangerous and for real and not a joke, but like real Boy Scouts May we die in the forest.

622
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:13,120
Speaker 0: and definitely from those early comics you got this vibe of Every time every time an adventure happens somebody doesn't come home, right?

623
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:24,647
Speaker 1: So these were comics that were originally posted on you know, the actual penny arcade website, you know Like they would do a whole a few weeks or a couple weeks in a row and they would tell a little tiny story Right.

624
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:30,052
Speaker 1: And yeah, you definitely got the idea That's like oh they're Boy Scouts and fantasy land and shit happens to them.

625
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:32,460
Speaker 1: Like they get turned to stone or eaten by a monster.

626
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,948
Speaker 0: Great concept and it was.

627
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:35,772
Speaker 0: it was a concept.

628
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,320
Speaker 0: It was like an X like a pilot almost.

629
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,783
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was.

630
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:40,700
Speaker 1: and because you know, they did I think they did more than just that.

631
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,351
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's tons of material they've made that I've never even looked at.

632
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:46,986
Speaker 1: also especially like in their game everyone at PAX Always trying to play the throne watch game.

633
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:50,039
Speaker 1: I never even bother putting in any effort into that, right?

634
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,549
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I don't.

635
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,762
Speaker 0: I have not played Fine.

636
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,758
Speaker 0: I've not played more than 5% of the library of indie RPGs.

637
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:56,979
Speaker 0: I've.

638
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:05,394
Speaker 1: The point is this this universe that they thorn watch universe They've created and this lookouts property in particular is very popular.

639
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:07,080
Speaker 1: people really weigh into it.

640
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:10,102
Speaker 1: I remember being way into it when it was a thing I was like.

641
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:13,937
Speaker 1: I was waiting every day for that new comic to be posted to see that right?

642
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,124
Speaker 1: It was good stuff Very good stuff.

643
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,869
Speaker 1: people are asking for more.

644
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:26,240
Speaker 1: So what they made at some point, I don't know exactly when is A an actual comic book you could buy in the store called lookouts.

645
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,106
Speaker 1: It came out in multiple issues and now you can just buy the whole thing in one hardcover And I'm sure they'll be a trade.

646
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:35,320
Speaker 1: if you wait and you don't want to pay I'm sure you can get it digitally also.

647
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:47,911
Speaker 1: so the deal here is that I'm not sure exactly how much involvement Kraulik and Hawkins Mike and Jerry Had with the creation of this comic because they have their credited.

648
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:49,176
Speaker 0: what with created by right?

649
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:57,119
Speaker 1: if you look at the credits It says it was created by them and under story It lists four people Ben McCool Corey Jones and them.

650
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:59,914
Speaker 1: But they are not listed as they're not the writer.

651
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,059
Speaker 1: the writer is Ben McCool.

652
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,480
Speaker 1: They are not the artists.

653
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,099
Speaker 1: You're right.

654
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,991
Speaker 1: The pencils are done by Rob Momertz and the inks are done by Mike Norton who I know is really good.

655
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:11,097
Speaker 1: the colors by two other people.

656
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:12,943
Speaker 1: letters Tom All right, they didn't do.

657
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:18,360
Speaker 1: but the art Mike did do one variant cover artwork this one right here.

658
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,272
Speaker 1: But the main cover artist is the same guy Rob Momertz, right?

659
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,358
Speaker 1: Someone else did variant cover.

660
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,088
Speaker 1: So They you know how.

661
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:28,720
Speaker 0: here's the here's the Rob cover, right?

662
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,168
Speaker 0: It's like well, you know what.

663
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:37,380
Speaker 0: if I had to guess if I just looked at those two I might have guessed that the opposite the people who drew which one I would have gotten it wrong, right?

664
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,852
Speaker 1: So their involvement with this how much is questionable?

665
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:44,850
Speaker 1: obviously more than nothing, but you know They were not the primary creative.

666
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,243
Speaker 0: I would assume they have significant Creative direction.

667
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:51,638
Speaker 1: I'm sure they reviewed it right and we're like, oh you should change this change that right?

668
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:52,020
Speaker 1: Who knows?

669
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:57,858
Speaker 1: We could ask them they test tell us probably yeah, this was published by of all people.

670
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,445
Speaker 1: you think Oh What comic company did?

671
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:00,590
Speaker 1: this was IDW?

672
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,579
Speaker 0: is our car right now like that?

673
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:13,739
Speaker 1: Cryptozoic the people who publish lots of crappy board games based on intellectual properties publish this comic book And they did a good job.

674
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,747
Speaker 1: Apparently I learned from the credits here.

675
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:19,500
Speaker 1: the president and chief creative officer of cryptozoic is Corey Jones.

676
00:42:19,901 --> 00:42:22,030
Speaker 0: He wrote a pretty nice little forward in the book.

677
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,440
Speaker 1: He's one of those four people in the story credits.

678
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's also the editor of this book.

679
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,473
Speaker 1: So there you go.

680
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,760
Speaker 1: Corey Jones had a ton of creative input on this thing.

681
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:40,161
Speaker 0: I think the moral is that it's such a solid concept that Penny arcade put together the right team of people to make this happen because it's great Like.

682
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:43,112
Speaker 0: I really like this comic so look forward to more.

683
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,280
Speaker 1: how many issues did they make they made?

684
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:47,607
Speaker 0: Because we read a hardcover trade.

685
00:42:47,808 --> 00:42:48,811
Speaker 1: you read the hardcover.

686
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:53,382
Speaker 1: so I'm not sure exactly how many issues there are total Let's see.

687
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:55,710
Speaker 1: One, two, three four.

688
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,966
Speaker 1: It might be six seven eight issues something along those lines But anyway, it's a comic book.

689
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:07,545
Speaker 1: It tells us a continuous self-contained story about a group of lookouts In the thorn watch.

690
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:08,789
Speaker 1: I would universe.

691
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,928
Speaker 1: it also contains little pages from like the lookouts Handbook and like how to earn different merit badges.

692
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:15,389
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:24,960
Speaker 1: It also contains lots of concept arts and bonus junk Around and you know extra illustrations all the covers all kinds of other good stuff.

694
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:31,099
Speaker 1: So it's like you buy this hardcover or the softcover that eventually is gonna come out and you will get the whole picture.

695
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,900
Speaker 1: So What is the first thing I say about this comic the artwork?

696
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,027
Speaker 1: Mike didn't draw this yet.

697
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,119
Speaker 1: You could show it to someone and maybe believe he drew it.

698
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you can sort of tell it's not exactly on.

699
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,320
Speaker 1: it's like you look at it and it's like it's totally in his style.

700
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:57,488
Speaker 1: You know, like the way the skin is drawn on the people is the way he tends to color skin on Noses in particular, you know The line work is very similar to his.

701
00:43:57,508 --> 00:43:57,910
Speaker 1: a lot of the.

702
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:03,294
Speaker 1: the way the mouths are drawn with like the one big tooth Block, you know that he does right?

703
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:04,178
Speaker 1: It's like it really is.

704
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,952
Speaker 1: They were definitely trying to keep it in his style, but they're not him.

705
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:14,674
Speaker 1: so you can see that it's slightly off But it's still great because people are still great artists and also like the.

706
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:15,957
Speaker 0: it's definitely set up the work.

707
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:28,883
Speaker 0: because if you get the world of lookouts was interesting because from the pilots like what I knew coming into this comic was What you could know if you just are a fan of penny arcade and listen to what they have to say and have read their Comics.

708
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:29,930
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

709
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:40,265
Speaker 0: So it's a very Loosely defined setting where there's obviously a lot of stuff out there and you're seeing these tiny views into it and this comic Definitely keeps that going.

710
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:44,740
Speaker 0: The only thing you know about this world is that this forest is real dangerous.

711
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:51,420
Speaker 0: There's weird shit out there that maybe some of its good some of its bad, but mostly it's just the cruelty of nature.

712
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:55,038
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like it's just out there like this Sphinx is just it's a thing.

713
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:57,739
Speaker 0: It's there It's the force of nature and we deal with it.

714
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:00,369
Speaker 1: The main thing that tips you off that is not Mike.

715
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:08,679
Speaker 1: doing the art is like how much stuff there is in the background Detailing filling out the world which you kind of need in a fantasy world and you're telling a story like this.

716
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:11,031
Speaker 1: You need to really fill that environment in.

717
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:14,999
Speaker 1: you can't just leave sort of like a blank Background all the time to tell your joke in the front.

718
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:17,531
Speaker 1: So that's one key.

719
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:18,720
Speaker 1: that sort of tips you off.

720
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:28,322
Speaker 1: The other thing is that I actually say like the coloring is Actually, usually way sort of more detailed and maybe in some ways better than what he usually does Like.

721
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:32,520
Speaker 1: it doesn't stand out and sort of pop off the page as much as penny arcade does.

722
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,546
Speaker 0: It's more like shadery comic-y.

723
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it's it's like it's.

724
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:39,120
Speaker 1: it's definitely highly advanced, right?

725
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:47,180
Speaker 1: Someone put a lot of work into this thing for you know However many issues it is more work than you see usually from a little comic miniseries definitely.

726
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,970
Speaker 0: Well, the Sphinx is great.

727
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,558
Speaker 0: Like I really like the Sphinx.

728
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:57,532
Speaker 0: I'm very happy that I mean won't spoil it because you can just read this thing, but It all got resolved in an interesting way.

729
00:45:57,894 --> 00:46:01,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like the story was good Yeah, so the story here is.

730
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:09,079
Speaker 1: you got these kids who are lookouts in some town and You know, they sort of have a lookout scout leader guy who you know helps them out and tells us what to do.

731
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:12,099
Speaker 1: But there's also the town elder who I don't trust at all.

732
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,019
Speaker 0: Yeah anymore like I do not trust that guy.

733
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,778
Speaker 1: No, and it's something up with him and you know the town elder I guess is where they get their missions from.

734
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,300
Speaker 1: and the town Elders like yo, there's a Sphinx nearby terrorizing people.

735
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,654
Speaker 1: No one can trade with these other town because the Sphinx is guarding that path.

736
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,119
Speaker 1: No one can get past it.

737
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:29,551
Speaker 1: You know, you guys are lookouts.

738
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:30,799
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you deal with.

739
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:31,984
Speaker 1: It's a Sphinx you.

740
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:33,972
Speaker 1: all you're gonna have to do is solve its riddle or whatever.

741
00:46:33,993 --> 00:46:34,836
Speaker 1: So go do that.

742
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:37,412
Speaker 1: so they go to do that.

743
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:46,855
Speaker 0: and And it's structured a lot like an RPG Which makes sense because this setting is basically become the setting of an RPG.

744
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:48,480
Speaker 0: sure because there's the game.

745
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:58,843
Speaker 1: I think the game is from what I've heard is become slightly more board game and slightly less RPG But it still is structured in the in the fashion of a gimme RPG.

746
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:00,307
Speaker 1: indeed there is there's a sort of.

747
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:04,560
Speaker 1: there's an encounter along the way with a troll before they go to the real encounter.

748
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:10,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know this, you know, there's fighting versus parlaying decisions to be made.

749
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:15,780
Speaker 1: There's different characters in the party that you get to learn about and each have their own different quirks and backstories.

750
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:23,342
Speaker 0: and the quirks and backstories are interesting because this world and on a surface the world looks like There are humans.

751
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,986
Speaker 0: It's a lot like the torchbearer setting.

752
00:47:25,026 --> 00:47:30,100
Speaker 0: humans are in their isolated communities fearful of the crazy nonsense that exists everywhere else.

753
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:50,860
Speaker 0: but yet at the same time the backstory of almost every one of these characters is no humans are actually just as crazy and Fit into this world very well because every one of these characters or most of them have some sort of supernatural connection to the natural order of this magical crazy world.

754
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:53,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you look as you go through each issue.

755
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,544
Speaker 1: It's like you learn about.

756
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:58,940
Speaker 1: you know one of the lookouts and what their deal is and each one has a crazy cool deal.

757
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,665
Speaker 1: That's pretty unique and interesting.

758
00:48:00,685 --> 00:48:01,688
Speaker 1: It's like it's like.

759
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,213
Speaker 1: none of them were like.

760
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,280
Speaker 1: super strong characters are like that's my guy.

761
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:06,419
Speaker 1: I'm down with that one.

762
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:09,123
Speaker 1: You know that person But they were.

763
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:14,936
Speaker 1: each of them were so interesting that I still wanted to know like even more about what their deal was and see What happened to them?

764
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,291
Speaker 1: Because None of them had like a typical story that you would expect.

765
00:48:19,652 --> 00:48:26,692
Speaker 0: but the plot at least so far and if it continues in this style Seems to not focus on any of them in terms of their motivation.

766
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:29,500
Speaker 0: so much as how does that eclectic group of people?

767
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:46,553
Speaker 1: Solve a problem in a very gamey sense Yeah, but also each issue sort of you know goes even if not in the story itself But in in the little handbook page Gives you like a really sort of not super deep but deep enough.

768
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:52,180
Speaker 1: dive into some aspect of this world Like there's a part that talks to you about like the two moons.

769
00:48:52,283 --> 00:49:00,420
Speaker 1: Yeah The world has two moons and here's the deal with that and if you learn too much about them it messes you up and then It's like oh by the way the world has vampires in it.

770
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:07,800
Speaker 1: There's no vampires in this story, but you sort of learn about oh this world does have vampires, and it's like okay What's up with those right?

771
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:15,120
Speaker 1: You know it's like whoo there's this stuff going on here, right You know what's a and you know the Sphinx is a Sphinx in this world.

772
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,394
Speaker 1: That's supposed to be a Greek thing, but now the Sphinx is.

773
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:18,179
Speaker 1: what's their deal?

774
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,017
Speaker 0: Yep, and what little I know about their deal based on this trade that we read.

775
00:49:23,157 --> 00:49:23,840
Speaker 0: It's pretty good deal.

776
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is dry ads and shit in this world.

777
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:32,300
Speaker 0: frankly that Sphinx is totally within his rights Oh sure, but it's a kind of dicks to him.

778
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,339
Speaker 1: I think the thing with this world that makes it so cool is that it has all this stuff from typical expected fantasy worlds.

779
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,540
Speaker 1: right.

780
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:44,822
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's minotaurs and dragons and all the things you'd expect but none of them are exact They don't.

781
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:47,860
Speaker 1: they're not the expected D&D stereotype.

782
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:57,800
Speaker 1: They have some kind of eh some kind of twerky twist that makes them different than all the other fantasy worlds And they sort of putting those all together in the same basket.

783
00:49:58,242 --> 00:49:59,651
Speaker 1: You know everything normal.

784
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:10,260
Speaker 1: each thing gets one twist But that's a lot of twists piled on top of each other when you mix them all together in the same bag Which for a game side or for a story is really good compared to say fuck out to the round, right?

785
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,406
Speaker 1: You have all the familiarity like.

786
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:13,630
Speaker 1: I know what a Sphinx does.

787
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,720
Speaker 0: it blocks you with it, but you don't know it's full deal, right?

788
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,268
Speaker 1: It's like I've seen a vampire before.

789
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,680
Speaker 1: I've seen Dracula, but you don't know it's full deal.

790
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:27,353
Speaker 0: So yeah, but like any D&D ish setting in the world I know pretty much the full deal of when to use cold steel on somebody.

791
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:37,463
Speaker 1: and of course that one thing that or a few Things that you're missing from the full deal Interact with the story in a way that makes it way interesting like whoa Shit, son.

792
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:37,805
Speaker 1: Yep.

793
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:38,969
Speaker 1: How's that gonna go down?

794
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,480
Speaker 1: plus the the fundamental?

795
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,040
Speaker 1: Emotional thing that ties the whole thing together is basically kids being in danger gonna die.

796
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:54,416
Speaker 1: Yep, right and like that holds everything together because it's like oh my god These are still kids who even if they're badasses don't die.

797
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:57,630
Speaker 1: Oh my god I wasn't little and they can and do.

798
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:12,379
Speaker 0: I'll admit that was a little disappointed in How neatly they wrapped it all up in the sense that from the original comics the pilots I really had this idea that the way to make this super interesting was that like somebody always doesn't come home.

799
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:14,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does it almost.

800
00:51:14,748 --> 00:51:16,012
Speaker 1: it's like it definitely goes there.

801
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it doesn't go bokurano, right?

802
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:21,470
Speaker 1: And I feel like it was originally.

803
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:33,418
Speaker 1: they sort of pulled it back from the bokurano ledge a bit You know to publish this which I guess, you know I guess they have their reasons, but it's still there enough that you don't feel like they're going too easy.

804
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:34,462
Speaker 0: true Right.

805
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:38,879
Speaker 1: It's a dangerous world and it didn't cover everything with squishy pillows.

806
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:43,880
Speaker 0: I mean look those kids are in danger from whatever these rules are that the town elder has.

807
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever the rules are of the lookouts.

808
00:51:46,372 --> 00:51:47,879
Speaker 0: Yep, the forest itself.

809
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,576
Speaker 0: And there are two challenges both the ogre or that the troll is.

810
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:55,307
Speaker 1: a troll is gonna bridge He's a troll and that dark wizard.

811
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:58,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, we learn about along the way just out there.

812
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,700
Speaker 1: So like, you know, you can just read this and it's done and I haven't heard of any more being made.

813
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,168
Speaker 1: It doesn't say volume one on it.

814
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:07,200
Speaker 0: I would just read any more of this that came out.

815
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm kind of disappointed that there isn't a volume - it's like Cryptozoic.

816
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:11,760
Speaker 1: You're bad at making games.

817
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,240
Speaker 1: Stop making games just publish, you know, but you're fine at publishing things, right?

818
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,379
Speaker 1: You never you know, you can make stuff.

819
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:24,160
Speaker 0: I've heard good tell that you're good at arts and stories for this is good at being what it is intended to be.

820
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:25,184
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is.

821
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:25,888
Speaker 1: I've never played it.

822
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:26,531
Speaker 1: So who knows?

823
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've read through some of the rules.

824
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:37,367
Speaker 1: It's not bad But if you are a person who's a fan of fantasy Comics penny arcade stuff if you're one of those people who always goes to PAX and is like Where do I sign up to play thorn watch?

825
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:39,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you haven't and you haven't read this.

826
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:43,335
Speaker 0: This is like a great example of that adjacent output to of.

827
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:46,520
Speaker 0: you know Dave and Tycho can't do everything on their own.

828
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:59,640
Speaker 0: they have a lot of cool ideas and the fact that they have made an organization and a group of friends and all these like all these structures are in place to where they've taken a bunch of their cool ideas like this and made separate works that can sustain.

829
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:01,503
Speaker 1: Make this.

830
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:04,996
Speaker 1: someone else made this right their input to some degree.

831
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:05,960
Speaker 1: That is unknown, right?

832
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,733
Speaker 1: People are always at you know asking questions Like when are you gonna make this when you're gonna make more stuff there?

833
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,080
Speaker 1: keep asking them to make more stuff.

834
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,939
Speaker 1: They made a thing or someone else made a thing with their IP.

835
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, and is good and worth your time and money.

836
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:24,438
Speaker 0: why you know, you know why you know and everything else I have to say about this.

837
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,047
Speaker 1: I mean I could if you buy digital.

838
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:26,731
Speaker 1: that makes sense.

839
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:28,620
Speaker 1: if you wait for the trade, I can't make sense.

840
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:30,600
Speaker 1: I can't expect people to buy a hardcover.

841
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,014
Speaker 1: I actually think I mistakenly thought it was gonna be a trade and got a hardcover.

842
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:36,418
Speaker 0: hardcover is really high quality.

843
00:53:36,498 --> 00:53:36,940
Speaker 0: It's fine.

844
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:38,440
Speaker 1: I mean, I just don't like hardcovers.

845
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,515
Speaker 0: If you take off its book jacket though, it's got a really nice like golden boss.

846
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:43,900
Speaker 1: They just take up too much space.

847
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:44,908
Speaker 1: Oh that does look nice.

848
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like really tasteful.

849
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:48,069
Speaker 0: Anyway, really good-looking book.

850
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:51,306
Speaker 0: Like if you're the kind of person who wants the bookshelf of these things It's a really good-looking book.

851
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:53,115
Speaker 1: Yeah hardcover is good comic.

852
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:55,488
Speaker 0: you read my only Critique at all.

853
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:56,500
Speaker 0: It's not a masterpiece.

854
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:02,881
Speaker 0: My only my primary critique is simply that I don't want I don't want to say the dialogue is over raw Cuz.

855
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:04,850
Speaker 0: that's kind of a crappy critique to give.

856
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:11,657
Speaker 0: the dialogue is a little Stilted in the way that people who are role-playing speak.

857
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:14,086
Speaker 1: sure But that is definitely not.

858
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:16,232
Speaker 1: it's definitely not natural dialogue, right?

859
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:18,680
Speaker 0: It's like Jeff Lemire did not write the dialogue.

860
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,102
Speaker 1: No, it's.

861
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:19,383
Speaker 1: it's.

862
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:28,460
Speaker 1: it's more along the lines of like, you know, the kind of dialogue you get in like a superhero comic You know with less less crazy words for things because it's a fantasy world.

863
00:54:31,203 --> 00:54:33,279
Speaker 1: It's not the way normal people talk to each other.

864
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,309
Speaker 1: and The other thing I'd say is like.

865
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:43,580
Speaker 1: actually, you know, I think it's a little bit rushed You know, you know the story-wise the pacing and the pacing is still just fine.

866
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,303
Speaker 1: It's like you don't?

867
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:48,439
Speaker 1: you're not gonna feel like it's going too slow or too fast when you're reading it.

868
00:54:49,002 --> 00:55:00,240
Speaker 1: But it's like I read the whole thing pretty quickly Yep, and subway rides and I felt like you know It didn't feel like it was going fast when I was reading it, but it also when I was done.

869
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:02,460
Speaker 1: It's like man, they could have fit more in there.

870
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,580
Speaker 1: I would have liked to see more, you know, slow it down a little bit and but you know and fill it in.

871
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,699
Speaker 1: Don't slow it down.

872
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:14,458
Speaker 1: And so I wonder because they're like you take the same material and drag it out over more pages.

873
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:15,220
Speaker 1: That's not gonna work.

874
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,136
Speaker 1: That's gonna be too slow because associated with it could have put in more stuff.

875
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:31,723
Speaker 1: that would happen You know like add another encounter on the adventure add more Interactions, you know, but I can see an angle that the things I'm most interested in Like.

876
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:33,570
Speaker 0: I want to know what the village elders deal is.

877
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the kind of stuff you could have fit in right?

878
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,271
Speaker 0: You know girls why death penalty right violated.

879
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:52,020
Speaker 0: you could you could add a scene with the village elder You could add a scene telling us Answers to the questions that I am asking are the kinds of things that are supposed to remain central mysteries of the setting.

880
00:55:52,040 --> 00:56:00,620
Speaker 1: you Can but I feel like when you have central mysteries of a setting like that You have to answer or partially answer one of them per product that you put out.

881
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:12,616
Speaker 0: the alternative is to have some of them be present in every single story and Cause tension and problems so that it's always this ever-present like.

882
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:13,740
Speaker 0: but what the fuck's the deal with that?

883
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,777
Speaker 1: Well, you can eventually Tell the backstory of what the fuck the deal with it is.

884
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you try to forgotten realms where everything has this overwrought forever back story.

885
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:28,640
Speaker 1: But you could still while telling the backstory of why things are the way they are still not resolve them.

886
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that they continue to be there.

887
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,915
Speaker 1: you just know why they're there.

888
00:56:32,996 --> 00:56:37,840
Speaker 0: now in my head I feel like this is literally the exact same world as torchbearer.

889
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:40,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it fits real.

890

895
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:09,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, the torchbearer people are trying to go out and get loot.

896
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:12,534
