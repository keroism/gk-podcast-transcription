00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,606
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Wednesday March 17th.

2
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:12,368
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,894
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:15,696
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

Speaker 1: It's Wolverine.

6
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:22,168
Speaker 1: Oh shit Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:38,004
Speaker 0: So I bought a bike yesterday, and I bought a bike yeah And today was the very first day that my office building would allow bikes to be brought up the service elevator as is the law The new law.

8
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,900
Speaker 1: so I am assuming that you rode this bike to work and had a wonderful time.

9
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:47,724
Speaker 0: No in fact I didn't and the reason I didn't you know is because Number one.

10
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:55,040
Speaker 0: well, no actually I'm going to talk about the bike stuff later But the reason I didn't basically is because I didn't know how long it would take and I wanted to get to work on time.

11
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:55,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to try that.

12
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:03,367
Speaker 0: on like a week on the weekend I'm gonna ride to work and back and time it with the stopwatch and such and then next week I'll be able to ride to work.

13
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:13,222
Speaker 0: You know and leave at the appropriate time, but anyway I am glad I did not ride like to work today because I did not realize today was Everyone.

14
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,451
Speaker 0: get the fuck off the street before I kill you day.

15
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:16,394
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

16
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,117
Speaker 1: I forgot to.

17
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:17,900
Speaker 1: you know I get to work.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,632
Speaker 1: I'm sitting there, and I look on FARC and someone says blah blah blah st.

19
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:28,820
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day, and I'm like oh crap I Better not go anywhere for lunch today cuz I'm in Midtown like right by where the stupid parade is.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,913
Speaker 0: I think the thing is I'm like oh, but the parade isn't today right.

21
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:33,400
Speaker 0: It's like Sunday, right?

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh shit praise today fuck.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,306
Speaker 1: so you know I got to lunch because of course three hours later I totally forget about this.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,713
Speaker 1: so I go to lunch.

25
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:53,600
Speaker 1: It's like 1130 and There's just a crowd of people in green surrounding my building outside of grounds just Staggering around yelling at each other throwing shit.

26
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,870
Speaker 0: There aren't even any sports teams doing well.

27
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,315
Speaker 0: I mean if a sports team just won Then I can justify some whoo.

28
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:15,510
Speaker 1: the best part is that cops like last year were lined up on 42nd Street between Grand Central And the parade and they were just stopping Anyone who looked like they were either underage or had open containers of alcohol Giving them tickets right there, and then there was a booth.

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,944
Speaker 1: They could go pay the ticket, so I wouldn't get mailed home to their mom.

30
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:23,490
Speaker 1: very excellent It was like 25 bucks was one of the tickets because I saw a whole group of kids getting it at the same time.

31
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,532
Speaker 1: I'm very good, but you know I went to a Starbucks Figuring.

32
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:31,089
Speaker 1: you know there's a long line, but all those people are in line for the bathroom not for coffee.

33
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,959
Speaker 1: So I go get my coffee and as I'm walking out.

34
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,448
Speaker 1: I trip over something you don't.

35
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:42,007
Speaker 1: I tripped over Dude passed out in front of the door of the Starbucks and vomited all over himself.

36
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:42,890
Speaker 0: That's about right.

37
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:50,782
Speaker 1: I literally tripped over the guy, and I kind of surround like are you okay, and he's wearing green and vomit And he's like vomit.

38
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:51,630
Speaker 1: It's covered.

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,677
Speaker 1: It was kind of a pinkish vomit.

40
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:59,518
Speaker 0: could have been green vomit if he had drinking green beer or some green coffee Or ate a green muffin, but you know what he does.

41
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,605
Speaker 1: He gives me the classic thumbs up.

42
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:02,407
Speaker 1: I'm okay.

43
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:07,527
Speaker 1: Yeah He did not look okay, and I waved to a cop and he's like yeah, I saw him.

44
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,189
Speaker 1: I'll deal with it.

45
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:09,798
Speaker 0: Spray him with the hose.

46
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:10,888
Speaker 0: you need to wave at the fireman.

47
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,079
Speaker 1: I did see something cool though.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,170
Speaker 1: go into the parade route because I went across it.

49
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,617
Speaker 0: Oh shit is it.

50
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:18,566
Speaker 1: pray didn't start yet, and I wanted to go to the pen.

51
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:19,249
Speaker 1: go to the end.

52
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:22,029
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna screw up my lunch plans for this BS.

53
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,756
Speaker 1: Okay, and you know the cops have.

54
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:27,649
Speaker 1: now they have you know they're like command center vehicles where they can set it up.

55
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:39,030
Speaker 1: One of those vehicles now has this Gigantic tower on a lift that comes out of the top and there's a little glass enclosed pod up there And there's one cop sitting in there watching the crowd controlling all the cameras.

56
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,835
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool-looking.

57
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:45,010
Speaker 0: hmm anyway, so yeah, so I basically had a similar situation where I was in work.

58
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,261
Speaker 0: I didn't realize it was st.

59
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:46,927
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day.

60
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:52,544
Speaker 0: I Didn't need to eat lunch out You know because I ate my peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but it was.

61
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:53,770
Speaker 0: but it was so nice out.

62
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:54,957
Speaker 0: I looked out the window.

63
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,326
Speaker 0: I didn't look stupidly.

64
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:56,990
Speaker 0: I didn't look down.

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,795
Speaker 0: I only look straight out the window at the Barclays building formerly the Lehman Brothers building you know and When you would never know you didn't.

66
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:08,329
Speaker 0: it was never the Barclays building the way they the way they you know have it going.

67
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,910
Speaker 0: But I didn't look down, so I didn't realize.

68
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:17,446
Speaker 0: So I went down You know just to go for a walk during lunch and as soon as I walked out the door.

69
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,844
Speaker 1: I was like ah fuck There's really nothing you can do at that point though.

70
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:24,119
Speaker 0: You're already out Mm-hmm, but anyway.

71
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:25,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I get out.

72
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,156
Speaker 0: I just start walking around.

73
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:27,960
Speaker 0: you know I went to.

74
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:33,830
Speaker 0: I was look basically I was looking for a plate because We the office usually stocks disposable plates, but they ran out.

75
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,410
Speaker 0: So I wanted to get like a you know a reusable plate to eat lunch with and they didn't have one of the Duane Reade.

76
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,158
Speaker 0: so I just came back, but it was like I had.

77
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:50,390
Speaker 0: all these streets are closed off and the cops weren't letting you in and Unless you had like you know a ticket to Radio City because it was like right next to it

78
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:50,651
Speaker 1: Ah,

79
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:56,067
Speaker 0: and then so I had to like wait, and I had to tell the cop look I'm going to the Duane Reade, and he was like all right all

80
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,277
Speaker 1: right Yeah How I got around cuz I couldn't get back.

81
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:02,194
Speaker 0: the parade BS was getting in my way serious like and he's like you're probably going To the parade and I'm like.

82
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:02,656
Speaker 0: no really.

83
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:03,480
Speaker 0: I'm going to Duane Reade.

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,389
Speaker 0: Do you see an inch of green on my body?

85
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,981
Speaker 1: I accidentally wore green at this tiny little thing.

86
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:11,185
Speaker 1: smell alcohols on me You know, but I couldn't get back.

87
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:11,790
Speaker 1: so you know what I did.

88
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,764
Speaker 1: I went into the subway station at Bryant Park, and you cut under.

89
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:18,741
Speaker 1: yeah very good I had to pay, but you know unlimited metro car.

90
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,484
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, right?

91
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:23,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah good call I'm using that tunnel a lot more now that it's basically free.

92
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:38,508
Speaker 0: so what was worse is I finally got back to the office through all the drunken black people fuckers right and I leave work and I before I left work I looked out the window at the street to make sure and I saw a few green here and there but it didn't look crazy from up above.

93
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:45,870
Speaker 0: I Walk out of the building and there is this like Red Bull truck thing parked directly in front of my building.

94
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,370
Speaker 0: That's bad news with like a sound system playing at the front.

95
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:52,668
Speaker 0: See I'm on the seventh floor so I didn't hear it and I was looking out the other window, so I didn't see it.

96
00:05:53,291 --> 00:06:04,577
Speaker 0: Hey, and like there is a drunken mob in front of it dancing and drinking and partying it up I just draw that's right next to my building and so I basically Ducked into the subway real quick like huh?

97
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,122
Speaker 0: Oh, and then I came home.

98
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,085
Speaker 1: really what I wonder?

99
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:08,149
Speaker 1: remember beacon.

100
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,590
Speaker 1: every year We had the the opening bit of the pub crawl.

101
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:15,405
Speaker 1: But remember last year the last pub crawl we had to deal with they were gonna ban it.

102
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:15,807
Speaker 0: Yep.

103
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:16,390
Speaker 0: Did they ban it?

104
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,110
Speaker 1: I don't know what's happening.

105
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:26,273
Speaker 0: Yeah I have to ask Alex and Jess the one thing that sort of you know saved the day from being just a drunken mess hating Everybody was.

106
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:33,655
Speaker 0: I was on the subway over here just now and I'm standing on the subway like you do Waiting to get to Queensborough Plaza.

107
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:34,417
Speaker 0: I'm in the tunnel.

108
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:35,560
Speaker 0: I look behind.

109
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,064
Speaker 0: me is a dude.

110
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,130
Speaker 0: He's reading some Scott Pilgrim.

111
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:45,010
Speaker 0: What's up, dude, and you know seeing out social currency in action?

112
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:46,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked a little bit.

113
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:48,750
Speaker 0: I told him the mocha was in a few weeks.

114
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,235
Speaker 0: He's like, oh he knew what it was.

115
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:59,276
Speaker 0: You know, he just kept missing it, but he because it's earlier this year he said he'd probably see me there and He likes that pilgrim.

116
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:00,141
Speaker 0: he likes walking dead.

117
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:03,898
Speaker 0: he just doesn't have a lot of monies Like most comic fans.

118
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,588
Speaker 0: He doesn't buy too many but you know.

119
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:10,285
Speaker 0: So I was like, hey, not everyone on this horrible day is horrible.

120
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,610
Speaker 0: and he was reading volume 4.

121
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,361
Speaker 0: So, you know, it wasn't like, you know, it was the real deal.

122
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,688
Speaker 1: So what someone who's reading volume 2?

123
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,250
Speaker 1: they don't cut it.

124
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:23,650
Speaker 0: Well, you know if they're reading volume 1 that means they might just be trying it out.

125
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,029
Speaker 0: But if they're reading volume 4 then they're definitely the fan.

126
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:35,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least in my perception the people, you know that when you try to get someone who's not into geeky stuff Or you know, they're the kind of person who says oh, I wouldn't like Scott Pilgrim I don't read comic books.

127
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:38,649
Speaker 1: the same people who say things like I don't like robot shows.

128
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,095
Speaker 1: They wouldn't even try it.

129
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:46,797
Speaker 1: they were like they'd have the first volume they'd read two pages of and be like, this is crap It's just video game BS and they wouldn't even bother.

130
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:54,218
Speaker 1: if you're holding it for more than five minutes and it's open You probably already like it Mm-hmm Alrighty.

131
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:59,020
Speaker 0: Yeah So, oh, so for once right?

132
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,748
Speaker 0: This is a rare event, right?

133
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:01,230
Speaker 0: Very rare.

134
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:09,800
Speaker 0: I think we should make it less rare because I think the fact that it's sort of a one of those self-fulfilling Prophecies, you know because it is so rare that we do this.

135
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:10,904
Speaker 0: It is so rare.

136
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,979
Speaker 0: They mean, you know, it's it's that kind of thing Yeah, but basically I go into a geek bag.

137
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,650
Speaker 1: Oh shit, then what like a year and a half?

138
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:24,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, people forget this that you know, I think it's the podcast is the thing I philosophically I don't want geek nights.

139
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,426
Speaker 0: There are a lot of podcasts out there that become they respond to their users in the podcast.

140
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:30,048
Speaker 0: listeners.

141
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,428
Speaker 0: users Tell them a programmer, right?

142
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,764
Speaker 0: You know, they respond to the show listeners in the show.

143
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:45,519
Speaker 0: so much Right that it becomes a community show where it's about the community and it's not accessible to people who aren't in the community anymore Right, so I wanted to avoid that.

144
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:56,949
Speaker 0: but at the same time you I like getting feedback But you the way to encourage feedback is to include the feedback in the show, you know And that that brings you to closer to being a community podcast, which I don't want to be.

145
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,712
Speaker 1: so you To achieve the fine balance I would say there are two secondary weird complications.

146
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:12,004
Speaker 1: we have that a lot of times people will say something really interesting and I argue with them or I have a response and I either just email them back or it's in the forum and I just post exactly.

147
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:17,227
Speaker 0: but anyway the I have a geek back for reals that is not you know.

148
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:25,350
Speaker 0: inside Basically, if you remember there is a listener named Chase Gordon who has moved up the ranks and the listener ranking scale.

149
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:29,350
Speaker 1: Isn't he pretty much like number one listener who isn't already a member of our crew?

150
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:30,674
Speaker 0: I don't know.

151
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:30,915
Speaker 0: He's.

152
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,022
Speaker 0: he has moved up the ranks significantly.

153
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,290
Speaker 0: Isn't he perhaps the top five listeners now?

154
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,296
Speaker 0: yeah, not bad and basically, he right.

155
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:49,750
Speaker 0: number one thing I think he's one of those guys that we always meet at the the The the concerts at PAX, you know, he's one of those guys, you know, which one.

156
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:54,090
Speaker 0: I think he might be the animating one that Emily talked to but I can't remember.

157
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,134
Speaker 0: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

158
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:58,830
Speaker 1: we kind of made friends with them by accident because we happen to stand near them.

159
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,502
Speaker 0: Number two, he is definitely the guy.

160
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:02,507
Speaker 0: I'm almost 100% positive.

161
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,610
Speaker 0: He is the dude who did Riven Scott's old Rochester whiskey in that comic.

162
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,057
Speaker 0: He is also definitely 100%.

163
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,624
Speaker 0: no, you know question at all.

164
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,750
Speaker 0: He is the guy who won the geek nights ad contests somewhat recently.

165
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:22,070
Speaker 0: So I sent him all six volumes of Akira which was the prize for said contest.

166
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:22,793
Speaker 1: I forget.

167
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,904
Speaker 1: Did you send the remastered new one?

168
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:27,876
Speaker 0: I said I said in the old one They're basically the exactly the same 100%.

169
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:28,960
Speaker 0: there you go.

170
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,269
Speaker 0: So there was no point and you know even deciding about it.

171
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:36,890
Speaker 0: So because I sent him this prize he sent back some other stuff, right?

172
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,274
Speaker 0: He sent me some emails and such.

173
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:44,310
Speaker 0: but then he sent me this book and this book is called the devil in the white city.

174
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:45,874
Speaker 0: Hold on.

175
00:10:45,934 --> 00:11:01,686
Speaker 0: The full title is not displaying devil in the white city Murder magic and madness at the fair that changed America and It is a is that the World's Fair is the Chicago era 1893 World's Fair perhaps the best World's Fair.

176
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:07,185
Speaker 0: No the 1960s ish New York Queens World's Fair.

177
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:08,170
Speaker 1: Why is that one better?

178
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,182
Speaker 0: Because that's my World's Fair and had Belgian waffles.

179
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,889
Speaker 1: because you were there I wasn't there.

180
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,985
Speaker 0: But Belgian waffles can't lose, you know, I can make Belgian waffles.

181
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,510
Speaker 1: the diner has Belgian waffles.

182
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,859
Speaker 0: Do you not know about the World's Fair Belgian waffle?

183
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,542
Speaker 1: I know all about.

184
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:23,968
Speaker 1: we actually talked about this on the show.

185
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:29,669
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure You will not make that building, you know, find someone who ate one and you will.

186
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,391
Speaker 0: you know You will not.

187
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,639
Speaker 0: I mean my mom who had that Belgian waffle.

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:45,009
Speaker 0: She was at the pan cut to the end and she ate that waffle and That's not a Belgian waffle though at Le Pen cote dien Is that the the World's Fair waffle was still better than that waffle and that's a pretty good waffle.

189
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,952
Speaker 1: so Tinted glasses.

190
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,095
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

191
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,582
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is is you're not gonna duplicate that waffle.

192
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,632
Speaker 0: All right, secondly, so he sent me this book All right.

193
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:55,844
Speaker 0: It's like okay awesome listener sends me a book.

194
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:56,870
Speaker 0: cuz he wants me to read it.

195
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,450
Speaker 0: He's a big fan of it and it sounds I haven't read it yet, but it sounds like it's up my alley.

196
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,501
Speaker 0: I like World's Fairs a whole lot.

197
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:12,362
Speaker 0: if I was the mayor of any place my first thing would be to get the World's Fair to be in that place and The thing that makes him so high up in the rankings.

198
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,350
Speaker 0: cuz I mean, you know people have sent us stuff before.

199
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:15,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, sending me a book.

200
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:16,561
Speaker 0: It's like okay send a book.

201
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,110
Speaker 1: I'll remember the the cornucopia.

202
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:21,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone's in a boo cornucopia just as good as sending a book.

203
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,225
Speaker 0: I've got my pit boy inside the box with the book and he was smart.

204
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:33,050
Speaker 0: He used a $5 You know USPS flat rate box, right inside the book was a letter on paper, right?

205
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:42,018
Speaker 0: But it wasn't just a scrolling on paper It was a prepared paper perhaps the letter in itself a work of art that he created Right.

206
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,363
Speaker 0: It was all colored You know all brown to look all old and he typed on it with.

207
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:57,269
Speaker 0: it appears to look like he typed on it with an Actual typewriter if not some sort of really awesome looks like a typewriter font and somehow gets the printer ink to look like typewriting

208
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,092
Speaker 1: Trick

209
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:08,890
Speaker 0: right and the contents of his letter were incredibly Steampunk And to awesome and I wish I would have remembered to bring it over here.

210
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:15,770
Speaker 0: Perhaps I will put this letter on the internet's for people to read rather than waste time on the show reading this letter.

211
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:22,430
Speaker 0: But it is a high quality letter and the high quality ness of this letter is it makes Chase Gordon the high quality?

212
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,412
Speaker 0: Geek nights listener.

213
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:26,623
Speaker 1: wait, so your geek back is basically this one guy's awesome.

214
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:28,709
Speaker 1: all the rest of you step up the game.

215
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:30,858
Speaker 0: Not that you're not awesome.

216
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,810
Speaker 0: Is that you have not yet displayed?

217
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:35,604
Speaker 1: Your awesome is giving us stuff.

218
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:36,590

219
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:43,155
Speaker 0: We're giving you free stuff entertainment right now Therefore and we don't ask for money.

220
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:48,590
Speaker 0: We are so generous you people who decide and and you think we're awesome because you're listening to us.

221
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,358
Speaker 0: Therefore right.

222
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,404
Speaker 0: Why do you think we're awesome?

223
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:52,530
Speaker 0: cuz we're generous.

224
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,359
Speaker 0: So if you want to be awesome, you must also be generous.

225
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,703
Speaker 0: generous equals awesomeness.

226
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,170
Speaker 0: That's that is bad rationalization.

227
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:00,778
Speaker 0: How the internet works right.

228
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:03,230
Speaker 0: someone makes a funny video puts it on YouTube for free.

229
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,263
Speaker 0: They're great generosity and everyone says oh my god, you are so awesome.

230
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:12,169
Speaker 1: That is how the world works now Unless that YouTube video is of you, but not created by you.

231
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,876
Speaker 0: If it's of you that is also awesome in a way Yeah, you can achieve internet.

232
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,310
Speaker 1: you're by making a really sweet ramp trying to jump it and hurting yourself.

233
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,222
Speaker 0: There are many ways to display awesomeness.

234
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:25,869
Speaker 0: giving us stuff is one of them.

235
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,766
Speaker 1: I like the way peacocks do it with their feathers like check me out.

236
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,510
Speaker 0: That's what you got to do.

237
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,651
Speaker 0: I'm.

238
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:31,075
Speaker 0: what do you think?

239
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:32,086
Speaker 0: I'm peacocking right now.

240
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,175
Speaker 1: See we'll know we've gone too far.

241
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:43,059
Speaker 1: if we ever have a panel that is basically watch your strut and peacock We should.

242
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,390
Speaker 0: we should get some peacock costumes.

243
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,117
Speaker 0: I'm sure they make them.

244
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,809
Speaker 1: I'm sure we can find one.

245
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:52,670
Speaker 1: So has to exist in some actual newsy kind of stuff.

246
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,958
Speaker 1: Emily sent me this the traditional wisdom.

247
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:01,429
Speaker 1: Everyone knows if you're an anime fan that by and large Animators in Japan get played pretty much crap.

248
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:06,427
Speaker 0: It doesn't pretty much anyone in any sort of awesome job in Japan get paid crap.

249
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:09,619
Speaker 1: Not all of them I mean like sumo wrestlers get pretty good money.

250
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,698
Speaker 1: Well, that's a you know, once they get up in the ranks They don't get paid anything in the beginning.

251
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know anyone who is low ranking gets paid.

252
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,236
Speaker 1: But it's not just I mean.

253
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:18,884
Speaker 1: look at America to like in America.

254
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,150
Speaker 1: You won't be a video game programmer.

255
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:21,482
Speaker 1: You're not gonna make any money.

256
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:25,040
Speaker 0: in most cases It depends what kind y'all testing?

257
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's different from being a. you know Any time.

258
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,763
Speaker 1: we have an industry where a lot of people are dedicated to it.

259
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,490
Speaker 1: They want to be in the industry.

260
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:42,210
Speaker 1: They're willing to sacrifice other aspects of careers just in order to be working in the industry And there's a very small number of actual good positions in said industry.

261
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:46,026
Speaker 1: Mmm, you get a lot of low wages exploitation and generally crap.

262
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:46,729
Speaker 0: That is true.

263
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:51,102
Speaker 1: So Emily pointed out this article that kind of takes all of that.

264
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:57,641
Speaker 1: talk about how bad it is in Japan with both video game programming and Animating and give some also manga.

265
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:58,465
Speaker 0: don't forget the manga.

266
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,570
Speaker 1: Oh my god manga people.

267
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,850
Speaker 0: I guess they're not giving numbers for manga right now.

268
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,310
Speaker 1: Basically, they asked a bunch of people in 2chan.

269
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:15,989
Speaker 1: They got a whole bunch of responses that are all catalogued on this Japanese site that I can't read but I'm linking to an English site talking about it and People who do these jobs are saying yeah, here's how much I make and here's what it's like.

270
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:22,309
Speaker 1: Some of these animators about a quarter of them in Japan make maybe the equivalent of ten grand a year.

271
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,699
Speaker 0: So how isn't Japan really expensive to live in?

272
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,706
Speaker 1: well Tokyo is really expensive to live in.

273
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,788
Speaker 0: Oh, okay So we're hands also live in Tokyo or do they?

274
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:36,590
Speaker 1: yeah I mean where's the stereotype of the animator who can barely afford ramen and this all they can afford to eat is not a stereotype.

275
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,019
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty much true.

276
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,630
Speaker 1: In fact, they're lucky to get ramen sometimes.

277
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:48,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is why you know you look at things in Japan, right people live in really tiny apartments, you know, totally true People have a kotatsu because they're not gonna pay for heat.

278
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,386
Speaker 0: totally true.

279
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,250
Speaker 1: Except look at us.

280
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, we want a kotatsu just because they're cool.

281
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't that so weird?

282
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know people eating ramen because it's really cheap and they can't afford, you know, sushi or meats.

283
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,050
Speaker 0: It's because meats are wicked expensive.

284
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:06,109
Speaker 1: Of someone in the Midwest saying you know what I have this dishwasher, but I'd rather not have it.

285
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,482
Speaker 1: I want a sink that I have to manually wash dishes in because it's cool.

286
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,489
Speaker 1: I see people out in other places doing that.

287
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,839
Speaker 0: I think the thing with the kotatsu is that it's it's like.

288
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:16,943
Speaker 0: it's also a table.

289
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also really efficient heating.

290
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,121
Speaker 1: I remember a lot of Japanese homes don't have central heating or cooling.

291
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:24,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I still think is kind of a problem.

292
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:30,354
Speaker 1: But all that aside the numbers here are pretty Soul crushing.

293
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:33,286
Speaker 1: if you're one of those people who thinks like I'll make it over there.

294
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:34,998
Speaker 1: and in America It's kind of the same way.

295
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:36,070
Speaker 1: you think I'll make it in the video.

296
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,150
Speaker 0: Does this supply numbers about like what you know, the high-level anime people's make like what does Miyazaki make?

297
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,471
Speaker 0: You know, I'm sure me is like, yeah well it talk it's.

298
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:47,685
Speaker 1: it breaks it down into groups like 33 percent 10 percent something like that.

299
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:51,069
Speaker 1: and obviously the hot like Hideo is making a lot of money.

300
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the thing is like he might.

301
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,785
Speaker 0: he's obviously much richer than we are.

302
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:56,950
Speaker 0: There's no question about that.

303
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:09,290
Speaker 0: You know, he's probably wealthy, but I question whether like, you know is Kojima really as rich as say like rock band dude in the US, you know or rock band dude in Japan?

304
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:12,140
Speaker 0: That's true too, but you know rock band isn't from Japan.

305
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a. it's harmonics Activision.

306
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:17,050
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you meant like a guy in a rock band.

307
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,678
Speaker 1: Oh the guy just our rock band.

308
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:26,296
Speaker 1: hearing game developers to game developers here, you know I don't think that like here's where I think a big difference is in Japan And I think this is primarily cultural.

309
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:38,232
Speaker 1: more people are more willing to put up with more salaryman bullshit Mmm, I think a lot of people who anime do it out of passion and basically that is why the industry gets away with paying So little.

310
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:49,033
Speaker 1: but a lot of people, you know the argument they make in Japan and this is probably true Is that well if we paid the animators more we couldn't make nearly as much anime and almost all of it would be completely Outsourced overseas.

311
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,478
Speaker 1: no more animation in Japan.

312
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:50,860
Speaker 0: Yep.

313
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,124
Speaker 1: I mean probably true.

314
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,930
Speaker 0: think about someone like Satoshi khan, right?

315
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,270
Speaker 0: He makes amazing movies, you know from madhouse and such.

316
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

317
00:18:57,772 --> 00:19:04,075
Speaker 0: or think about someone like Murayama who is the head of madhouse the studio which you know makes Stokes econ's movies, right?

318
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,179
Speaker 0: He's got money.

319
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:05,801
Speaker 0: We saw him.

320
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,085
Speaker 0: He came to the u.s.

321
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:08,470
Speaker 0: He wore had nice clothes.

322
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,670
Speaker 0: He had a high expensive, you know DSLR camera.

323
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:29,675
Speaker 0: He's probably making six figures and the first digit is probably not a one I would guess Right, but he's probably not making like millions Whereas I'm pretty sure right someone with a similar position if they were making like movies in the u.s Like someone at like DreamWorks making you know Animated movies.

324
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,311
Speaker 0: a director of those is maybe a millionaire, you know It's.

325
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,759
Speaker 0: I don't have any like numbers for this but it's sort of like.

326
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:44,159
Speaker 0: my feeling is that you know in America the same job Even in the higher levels is getting more money, you know, yeah Well, I mean it's not like.

327
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:44,522
Speaker 0: it's.

328
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:50,810
Speaker 0: what I'm trying to say Is that the the director the higher level people in Japan aren't exploiting the lower ones?

329
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,385
Speaker 0: It's like they're also not making as much as they would.

330
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:57,922
Speaker 0: and you know the u.s Everyone is making more than doing the whole.

331
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:11,789
Speaker 1: I think a secondary part of it Is that a large number of people become fans of something specific like animation and basically want that to be their life No matter what, like I'm willing to do whatever it takes to be an animator.

332
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:19,150
Speaker 1: hmm and I think for a lot of things in America video games are one of the and video games and Sports are some of the only careers that are like that.

333
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,808
Speaker 1: I mean thing well that people who make it to professional sports and even you know The amateurs make a lot of money.

334
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:31,297
Speaker 0: The thing is the exploitation in American sports is in the college sports college football in college basketball.

335
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:35,980
Speaker 0: It doesn't happen in Baseball and hockey because those are primarily.

336
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:38,790
Speaker 0: they have minor leagues as opposed to college.

337
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,043
Speaker 0: Which is why I really think if I was in charge, I don't think there should be College basketball college football.

338
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,050
Speaker 0: I know there's like blasphemy.

339
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,478
Speaker 0: It should be minor leagues if you want to.

340
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:55,090
Speaker 0: if your career is going to be basketball or you're gonna try for it You shouldn't be going to college taking up someone's spot.

341
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,509
Speaker 1: Well, you should be going to college because only 1% of those people are gonna miss you.

342
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,159
Speaker 0: But it's like don't you know this college?

343
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,970
Speaker 0: the basketball helps schools in that it brings in money.

344
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:12,760
Speaker 0: But at the same time we could just you know simulate that by taking money from the minor league Basketball and giving it to the schools, you know by other means.

345
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:18,830
Speaker 0: but if you just go to minor league basketball You know get hired by a team and if you're not good enough then go to college.

346
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:21,830
Speaker 1: There's some really interesting quotes from this article to our one guy.

347
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,990
Speaker 1: He's a video game programmer said my only take-home pay is the smiles of our customers.

348
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:34,430
Speaker 1: Mmm, and I think this guy has the completely wrong idea about a business model because as River City ransom taught me smiles are free.

349
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,892
Speaker 0: That's right It's just.

350
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:43,170
Speaker 1: it's an interesting read and if you read Japanese you can look at the actual article that talks about this a lot more.

351
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:46,189
Speaker 1: but I Think there's a really bigger root issue.

352
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:49,696
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about it a lot on this show But think about the argument they're making.

353
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:59,494
Speaker 1: in Japan at least if we paid these people a living wage Then we could not do the job here at all and it would just be overseas and there'd be almost no animation made in this country.

354
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:06,621
Speaker 0: and That is true despite like the collapse, you know There's a lot less fans a lot less people watching a lot less people buying.

355
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,873
Speaker 0: they are able to put out an incredibly large amount of Content.

356
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:15,178
Speaker 1: that is, you know, it's not the highest Though basically on the backs of the work.

357
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:15,800
Speaker 0: That's true.

358
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,090
Speaker 0: That's basically what it is because these people are paid almost nothing.

359
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,270
Speaker 0: They are able to make all this anime and it's at the quality level that it's at.

360
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,896
Speaker 1: But think about what's going on in the world right now.

361
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,489
Speaker 1: many industrialized nations, especially the US and Japan.

362
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:38,809
Speaker 1: Much of the money they make much of their economy is based on intellectual property Mmm, and that's why there's so all these fights about you know, protecting intellectual property as opposed to physical property.

363
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:49,209
Speaker 1: But and their worry is that you know the third world or countries that aren't number one that aren't the US and Japan are going to Steal their intellectual property and just copy it and not pay us back.

364
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:51,602
Speaker 1: That shouldn't be the thing they're worried about.

365
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:59,407
Speaker 1: what they should be worried about Is that if things continue eventually the third world countries are just going to manufacture intellectual property.

366
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,169
Speaker 1: That's just as good.

367
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:07,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is that Not happened, you know You know, there's this slow rise of like.

368
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:14,321
Speaker 1: the Korean animation is getting better and better and better as time goes on because that's where They were outsourcing a lot of the low-level animation stuff.

369
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:16,810
Speaker 0: The thing is they're able to animate things that look really great.

370
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,899
Speaker 0: They can't tell a story for crap.

371
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,361
Speaker 1: So yeah, I mean it's gonna happen though I mean all these.

372
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:25,783
Speaker 1: the more they fight Outsourcing like this the more it's gonna happen.

373
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:36,992
Speaker 1: Anyway in the long run We got to figure out more fundamental ways to deal with the economy of the fact that it's not viable to make the things that people expect in the industrialized world IP or not Internally.

374
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,021
Speaker 1: and if we do it externally we kind of set up.

375
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,170
Speaker 1: so we set ourselves up for a fall regardless.

376
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:52,470
Speaker 0: The thing is the US and Japan Pretty much more than any other country in all of history Have been the only ones that have really been able to majorly export culture their own culture worldwide.

377
00:23:54,992 --> 00:24:08,510
Speaker 0: Movie that's made in the US is gonna play Avatar right plays around the world Whereas even like the hottest movie in France that might play around the world But that's just one whereas pretty much every blockbuster movie, you know in the US plays around the world.

378
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:18,090
Speaker 1: you know and look at just compare the population of Japan as a Percentage of the world population and then consider the mind share that Japanese pop culture has worldwide.

379
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,400
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

380
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:35,130
Speaker 1: I want to use this as a thing of the day Just because we haven't talked about it in a while and it is a surprisingly solid webcomic.

381
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,413
Speaker 1: but anime news Nina has the 100th comic up and It's pretty great.

382
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:54,875
Speaker 1: And I realize now really why I like anime news Nina so much independently the fact that it's kind of Surprisingly biting and harsh on anime culture, which is not what you would expect for the kind of semi official webcomic for something Like the anime news network.

383
00:24:54,955 --> 00:25:01,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually when you have say like, you know a movie magazine or you know Like it's all it's gonna be rah rah rah movies, right?

384
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,030
Speaker 0: Whereas anime news network is not always rah rah rah anime.

385
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,557
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's like hey anime.

386
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:09,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's really, you know, that's kind of good.

387
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:18,604
Speaker 0: I think that helps out the anime industry a lot and I think it'd be better if you know some other industries had similar News outlets and anime news network anime news.

388
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:32,542
Speaker 1: Nina is definitely a part of that Yep, but I realized something else because the in the 100th comic She kind of breaks the wall by having a nerd call her out in a way that made me realize that We do the exact same freaking thing.

389
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:33,950
Speaker 1: Look at all the references in anime news.

390
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:39,990
Speaker 1: It's to anime that I care about and then Scott cared about stuff that was popular as we were getting into anime.

391
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,630
Speaker 1: I mean she does the whole thing about Shiki Yugi and all that.

392
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:49,690
Speaker 1: It's all like 90s anime and OAVs and I don't know she's cut from the same anime fan stripe that we are.

393
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,118
Speaker 0: No, she's probably our age.

394
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:53,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just found that interesting.

395
00:25:53,371 --> 00:26:01,970
Speaker 1: So if you guys aren't reading it and you're an anime fan, you probably should be yeah And if you feel offended by it at all, you're probably one of those people.

396
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:14,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh so what this is website I found today called code Oregon calm and you go to it and you get a picture of an organ and you think oh It's a PN organ.

397
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,009
Speaker 0: Let me play and you start clicking on the keys and nothing happens and you go Oh, what the hell is this organ that doesn't even play?

398
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,010
Speaker 0: The way it works is you type in a website like a URL like google.com or something like that And then you push the button.

399
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:32,410
Speaker 0: This is play this website and what will happen is it will take the code of that website?

400
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,929
Speaker 0: I guess it doesn't explain exactly how it works or at least I haven't read it yet.

401
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:41,669
Speaker 0: It takes you know, the HTML JavaScript whatever from that website and somehow converts that into.

402
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:48,803
Speaker 0: You know music that is in the key of whatever, you know It gives it a synth loop and a drum loop and whatever.

403
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,165
Speaker 0: and it see.

404
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:49,949
Speaker 1: now how did it?

405
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:59,462
Speaker 1: It almost sounded from the music sample you played at least that it just uses the HTML to seed some sort of set of existing Nice sounds that will all mesh together no matter what.

406
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:01,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how exactly how it works.

407
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,216
Speaker 0: I'm gonna figure it out.

408
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:09,789
Speaker 0: But regardless it's pretty cool and You know, you can go and type in different sites to see what they sound like and it's fun.

409
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:16,518
Speaker 1: hmm, see though what you should do is make sites that are literally just things like H1 h1 h1 to see what it does with it.

410
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,442
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

411
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,285
Speaker 0: It's figured out.

412
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,530
Speaker 0: reverse engineer how it works.

413
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:24,170
Speaker 0: Yeah thing is I think it'd be easier to just go and look at the code of code organ to figure out how it works.

414
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,235
Speaker 1: Oh is the code available?

415
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:28,312
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it might probably like JavaScript or something I could.

416
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:30,990
Speaker 1: probably JavaScript might just be calling stuff on a server.

417
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:31,993
Speaker 0: Let me see.

418
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:34,882
Speaker 0: It's using some jQuery stuff.

419
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:36,588
Speaker 0: I could probably figure out how this works.

420
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:37,250
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

421
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,830
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a cool concept, but people have done things like this a million times before.

422
00:27:41,315 --> 00:27:54,690
Speaker 1: It's a flash thing, I guess what they usually do is basically set it up to where it'll sound good no matter what and the source input is kind of just a Like random seed as opposed to it actually kind of making the music of the website.

423
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:59,730
Speaker 1: It just makes a song that the idea of that song happens to be the entirety of the text of the website.

424

440
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:34,636
Speaker 1: Always awesome always relevant to Wednesday.

441
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:36,060
Speaker 0: You'll be doing zero panels.

442
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,030
Speaker 0: We will be walking around as schmucks just like everyone else.

443
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:43,100
Speaker 1: Well, we will also be buying more comics than we should we'll be.

444
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,224
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have a new.

445
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:48,329
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about doing this Right, and here's what my policy is gonna be at mocha, right?

446
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,898
Speaker 0: Basically, it is the Scott's mocha challenge.

447
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,010
Speaker 0: the way this works is you go up to me, right?

448
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,846
Speaker 0: Or I come up to you and I say I will.

449
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,979
Speaker 0: you know I will buy X that you want me to buy.

450
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,609
Speaker 0: if you buy X that I want you to buy, huh?

451
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,913
Speaker 0: And that's how.

452
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:08,310
Speaker 0: and the thing is you can't you know, they gotta be relatively equal in price.

453
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,329
Speaker 0: I can't be like I'll buy that $1 mini comic if you buy that $50 slip case unless you agree to.

454
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,370
Speaker 0: you know I like this idea as long you know, the prices are pretty close.

455
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,929
Speaker 0: So that way, you know, basically it'll sell more shit and you'll be able to.

456
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:21,230
Speaker 0: you know.

457
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,089
Speaker 0: It's like hey that guy says this is good.

458
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:26,169
Speaker 0: I will trust you but only if you also trust me.

459
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:31,047
Speaker 1: Well now that we live in the city one thing I'm gonna do differently is if anything is cool.

460
00:30:31,187 --> 00:30:31,729
Speaker 1: I'm just buying it.

461
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,469
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not even gonna look before I would not buy things cuz I didn't want to carry him around.

462
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:39,241
Speaker 0: the rest I'm bringing a bag to carry stuff around in bringing a rolly bag.

463
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:44,660
Speaker 1: No big bag like, you know, I have a rolly bag That's basically dedicated to carrying board games to events.

464
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:44,881
Speaker 1: Now.

465
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:47,110
Speaker 0: Do you want to bring that to carry comics home?

466
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,494
Speaker 1: I don't want to be that guy Of course.

467
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,670
Speaker 1: the thing is that guy has a rolly thing already full that he brings to the car.

468
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:58,850
Speaker 0: Exactly those guys who bring their rolly things full of comics usually bring a long box full of comics.

469
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:07,621
Speaker 0: They're trying to sell and or get graded and instead I'll bring autographs and or all three together They'll get them autographed and they'll get them graded.

470
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:11,402
Speaker 1: then they'll sell them at the same at the cut I'll bring an empty one and then I'll leave with it full.

471
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's nothing wrong with that.

472
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:17,260
Speaker 0: So anyway, so Wolverine oh shit.

473
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,104
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

474
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:18,908
Speaker 0: It's Wolverine.

475
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:21,093
Speaker 0: So Recently, right?

476
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:23,059
Speaker 0: I don't know if people know this Marvel.

477
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,706
Speaker 0: has you know some comics that are the ultimate comics right?

478
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:40,898
Speaker 0: ultimate spider-man ultimate x-men Whatever and the original idea this started like a decade ago or over a decade ago and the idea was like hey Reading spider-man is kind of hard because it's unlike issue bajillion and if you haven't been reading spider-man since the 60s It's hard to figure out.

479
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,349
Speaker 0: learn everything that's going on.

480
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:45,350
Speaker 0: If all you've ever done is watch some spider-man movies, right?

481
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,618
Speaker 0: so they made ultimate spider-man.

482
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:55,961
Speaker 0: it was number one and you could just start reading it from the beginning and You would know everything and you wouldn't need to you know Know all this stuff to understand spider-man.

483
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,830
Speaker 0: and they did this for a bunch of different comics.

484
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,690
Speaker 0: So you could just start reading all the ultimate comics and you'd be set.

485
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:03,139
Speaker 0: The problem is is 10 years ago.

486
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,419
Speaker 0: So if you want to start reading ultimate comics today You've got 10 years of comics you have to read.

487
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:11,029
Speaker 0: so it's like oh my god, right?

488
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,676
Speaker 0: They totally defeated the purpose.

489
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,830
Speaker 0: So it's like well if we want someone to start reading comics now, what do they do?

490
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,734
Speaker 0: I don't know.

491
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:24,811
Speaker 0: So they came out with ultimate spider-man number one again, you know, they reset and I think it's still the same universe, but it's you know It's.

492
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:27,605
Speaker 0: it's reset to a point at which you don't need to know anything.

493
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:31,169
Speaker 0: and you know They made an entry point and everything is now number one again.

494
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,024
Speaker 0: So these are all super cheap and discounted.

495
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:41,574
Speaker 0: because you know I buy my comics on the pre-order internets and one of the comics I got was ultimate X number one and I knew That.

496
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,810
Speaker 0: okay, the letter X is the title.

497
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,450
Speaker 0: This is gonna have something to do with mutants perhaps x-men.

498
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:52,550
Speaker 0: But I didn't really know for sure what it was until I read it and I got it and I read it.

499
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,457
Speaker 0: I'm basically much to my surprise.

500
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,423
Speaker 0: It was son of Wolverine.

501
00:32:57,463 --> 00:32:59,590
Speaker 0: I don't know why that is didn't title it son of Wolverine.

502
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,990
Speaker 0: I guess cuz I probably would never have bought it if it was not all the sons because I'm sure he has like a thousand kids.

503
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,349
Speaker 0: Hello no, it's it's just.

504
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:08,432
Speaker 0: It's.

505
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:15,137
Speaker 0: basically this comic is son of Wolverine and I started reading it and after the first few pages I sort of realized oh, it's son of Wolverine.

506
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:18,950
Speaker 0: and I was like do I really care about son of Wolverine right?

507
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:27,244
Speaker 0: You know this I was sort of lukewarm, but by the time I got to the end I was like, wow I guess I do kind of care about son of Wolverine.

508
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:27,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,930
Speaker 1: Well, he's just you know pulls up with fists.

510
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,204
Speaker 1: He's and she's like have you ever tried, you know.

511
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:34,155
Speaker 1: with the claws he goes And claws pop out.

512
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:34,697
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

513
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:37,226
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, huh Wow, and then it was weird.

514
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,410
Speaker 0: the adamantium came out.

515
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,374
Speaker 0: It was like whoa.

516
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:43,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I worry that the the answer to that is gonna be some bullshit comic book crap.

517
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:44,740
Speaker 0: I don't know.

518
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,649
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

519
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:48,819
Speaker 1: They didn't really react to that strongly enough.

520
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,542
Speaker 1: They're like, huh?

521
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:56,806
Speaker 1: And he's like, yeah, they're not adamantium She's like, yeah Well, you know they put that on after the fact and then they turned adamantium and he's like, huh?

522
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:57,668
Speaker 1: And she's like.

523
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,362
Speaker 1: that's weird That's weird.

524
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:12,857
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think what was interesting though is that at least the people in the comic they weren't Because normally in a comic the people just be retarded, you know, whereas in this the parents were like, okay come clean You know, it wasn't.

525
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:16,253
Speaker 0: there wasn't like this excessive Moronic drama.

526
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,743
Speaker 0: It was just sort of normal comic book shadow cat.

527
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:21,708
Speaker 1: just come she's like, yeah, you're Wolverine's kid.

528
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:26,590
Speaker 0: Here's a video Yep, and then well, it was not a video is more like a Princess Leia message.

529
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,581
Speaker 1: That's basically just a video from from.

530
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,750
Speaker 0: I guess Wolverine is dead in the ultimate universe.

531
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,338
Speaker 0: So it was a really be dead.

532
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:35,402
Speaker 0: No, he's probably alive.

533
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:40,558
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, so yeah, you know The art also was like freakin crazy.

534
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,020
Speaker 0: Awesome.

535
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:44,230
Speaker 0: Did you notice like during the opening of the comic with the drag race?

536
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,830
Speaker 0: I couldn't really tell what was up, you know, I knew that these were probably important characters, but that's all I knew.

537
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,074
Speaker 1: I expected it to be.

538
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:54,830
Speaker 1: you know punk is racing and then they run into the son of Wolverine or some crap like that.

539
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,650
Speaker 0: And you saw on the cover there was a guy with claws.

540
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,995
Speaker 0: So, you know which is?

541
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:03,210
Speaker 0: he is the son of Wolverine obviously, but I didn't you know know really what it was about.

542
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:06,070
Speaker 0: I just thought okay, it's high school x-men something.

543
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:16,490
Speaker 0: But then it is the part where you know kitty pride shows up at the house and there's that panel in the bottom Right where the lights coming over and he's on top of the roof and he has like the Wolverine hair.

544
00:35:16,972 --> 00:35:20,770
Speaker 0: But he draws it in like such a way that it's like it's not obvious the Wolverine hair.

545
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:27,797
Speaker 0: But then in the one panel and then it makes sense when you look at the way he draws it in the other panels It's sort of like almost Wolverine hair.

546
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:28,479
Speaker 0: He's got.

547
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:42,370
Speaker 0: no one can pull off that Wolverine hair except Wolverine Mmm, and maybe son of Wolverine Yeah, but yeah, you know if you like Wolverine, you know, I would wait for the trade and get ultimate X trade number one.

548
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:51,630
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy it and I'll see if trade number two or well if the rest of trade one is good Then I'll get trade too, but maybe at least issue number one was cool.

549
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:56,589
Speaker 1: Maybe think a lot about Wolverine as a character in general because the you know recently Wolverines been up in.

550
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:59,561
Speaker 1: you know My FRC culture again at Wildwood last year.

551
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:01,087
Speaker 1: We all watched everyone but Scott.

552
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:01,629
Speaker 1: He wasn't around.

553
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:11,470
Speaker 1: We watched the Wolverine and the x-men like the new x-men cartoon Which gets a million bonus points for the fact that it knows what made the original?

554
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,883
Speaker 1: X-men cartoon popular and does enough of that to you know.

555
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:23,469
Speaker 1: say hey look we know here we go Even in the opening song that the theme is the original theme just kind of redone.

556
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,782
Speaker 1: It's like it's there in the opening of this.

557
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:30,050
Speaker 0: I'll have to go check that opener.

558
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:36,493
Speaker 1: But it's weird because it's Wolverine in the x-men is kind of Wolverine ends up being the leader and everyone else is trying to run Away from the x-men.

559
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:41,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the thing is like most people don't like Cyclops, but like Cyclops is my guy But he's I don't.

560
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:42,619
Speaker 1: he's deterred.

561
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,985
Speaker 1: I mean depending on where you're reading.

562
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:47,362
Speaker 1: He's either just Saccharine or a wuss.

563
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,498
Speaker 0: that's the easy I think that's you know.

564
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,956
Speaker 0: the problem is how he's written in the way They made his character, but how.

565
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,846
Speaker 1: the problem with the characters how they made the character like.

566
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:56,870
Speaker 0: you know the like.

567
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,000
Speaker 0: You know if he's he should be the awesome leader guy.

568
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,525
Speaker 1: You know he was in the cartoon.

569
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:04,557
Speaker 1: Yeah the original cartoon He was just awesome all the time.

570
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:04,939
Speaker 1: Yep.

571
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:06,527
Speaker 0: That's the that's the Cyclops Wolverine.

572
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:13,106
Speaker 1: in the x-men though I like him cuz he's basically you know gene is gone And he's just kind of like he's unshaven drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels.

573
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:14,050
Speaker 1: He tries to kill Wolverine.

574
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,078
Speaker 1: He's living like this Kelsey apartment.

575
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,106
Speaker 0: No, but Wolverine is sorta.

576
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:19,930
Speaker 0: It's it's strange.

577
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:33,395
Speaker 0: It's like Wolverine You know originally was like this side character in like some Hulk comic And then he like when the x-men went to Canada they like bumped into him along the way, and he's like okay There's this freaky guy You know and he wasn't really.

578
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:49,090
Speaker 0: you know the Wolverine that we have today is like incredibly different mostly because of Frank Miller You know and that Frank Miller Wolverine just became so crazy popular That they sort of now Wolverine is like you know the most important thing and they just stick him all over the place.

579
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:58,370
Speaker 1: That's why he's on every team's like team a will be Cyclops storm and Wolverine team B. Will be the Hulk and Wolverine Team C. Just Wolverine.

580
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:00,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's got his own comic book.

581
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:01,401
Speaker 0: He's got.

582
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:02,265
Speaker 0: he's on the Avengers.

583
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,008
Speaker 0: He's on the x-men.

584
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,295
Speaker 0: He's on the Like everything.

585
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:14,462
Speaker 0: there is not a comic book you can buy from Marvel almost that doesn't have Wolverine or a mention of Wolverine in it And it's like are there like a hundred Wolverines or something?

586
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,610
Speaker 1: he also has the backstory of everything.

587
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:18,417
Speaker 1: He was everywhere involved in everything.

588
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:19,501
Speaker 0: It's also.

589
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,829
Speaker 0: You know he's sort of invincible to who at the.

590
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,879
Speaker 0: yeah The healing power used to just be.

591
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,608
Speaker 0: originally it was just healing power.

592
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:34,024
Speaker 0: now It's like yeah, you could like you know blow him up with a nuke Skin cell left and eventually he'll just you know eventually oh shit.

593
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:34,746
Speaker 1: It's Wolverine.

594
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:35,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was pissed.

595
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:38,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but apparently he's dead.

596
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:41,563
Speaker 0: for reals in Wolverine he's dead.

597
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like at that America.

598
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:45,315
Speaker 0: So what's everyone else?

599
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,199
Speaker 0: It's interesting how.

600
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:49,130
Speaker 1: think about it's everything that you would normally hate in a character.

601
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:55,470
Speaker 1: He's the invincible badass Who is basically he's all-powerful effectively and can't be killed and will always win.

602
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:59,003
Speaker 1: And he has a cool mysterious past and he's rugged and everything.

603
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:00,690
Speaker 1: and yet it kind of works.

604
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:01,733
Speaker 1: But he's kind of it's.

605
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:14,330
Speaker 1: maybe it's just because he's an amalgamation of every individual thing that in the 80s and 90s people thought would Be cool in a character, and he also did a lot of stuff that you know was done in manga that you didn't really see in American comics, but then again, that's just Frank Miller.

606
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:20,870
Speaker 0: Well, I think a lot of what the problem is with Wolverine is that you know Wolverine was just sort of superhero guy.

607
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:29,244
Speaker 0: You know he's just a fun guy with claws who was you know slightly more You know down-to-earth and rugged and angrier than the other.

608
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:32,662
Speaker 0: you know sort of Tight-swearing superheroes around him.

609
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,050
Speaker 0: you know he was a nice contrast.

610
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:39,430
Speaker 0: And then Frank Miller came and you know pulled him all the way down into the dark Wolverine.

611
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:53,170
Speaker 0: But then after you know after Frank Miller a lot of the people doing like the dark rugged angry Wolverine character What they actually ended up doing was more like a stereotype of Frank Miller's Wolverine.

612
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,863
Speaker 0: He would just be sort of like this angry guy who said bub a lot.

613
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:56,727
Speaker 0: You know he wasn't.

614
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:59,380
Speaker 0: actually It wasn't the real deal.

615
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,914
Speaker 0: It was like you know this Caricature of the real.

616
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:09,937
Speaker 1: it's the same as and I might get some flack for this the modern like the recent Batman movies where Batman Is basically just a guy who smoked too much.

617
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:13,430
Speaker 1: as I'm Batman like that's all the character is now mmm.

618
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,381
Speaker 1: But we know we were talking about the origin story before and how it like.

619
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,714
Speaker 1: it was a mystery like he's just the guy with no Origin.

620
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:20,970
Speaker 1: then they kind of explained the origin.

621
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,153
Speaker 1: But look at what they did.

622
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:24,881
Speaker 1: every time they explained his origin in any capacity.

623
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:27,890
Speaker 1: it always has this element of but what was he?

624
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,868
Speaker 1: doing before that?

625
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, where was he?

626
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:31,394
Speaker 0: never.

627
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:32,438
Speaker 0: where was he born?

628
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:33,361
Speaker 0: Who's his mom?

629
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:34,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

630
00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:35,750
Speaker 0: There is a comic Wolverine origins.

631
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:41,090
Speaker 0: I've never read it, but supposedly like that has his origin in it for real, so I don't know how far back it goes.

632
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I know there's like fighting.

633
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,019
Speaker 1: You know Louisiana stuff.

634
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,188
Speaker 1: There's Japan which is basically just lone wolf.

635
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:47,690
Speaker 1: that is true.

636
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,598
Speaker 0: It's like he's all over the world.

637
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:52,972
Speaker 0: You know he's got the Canada parts right because he's from Canada Where that's.

638
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,755
Speaker 0: we're all like the.

639
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:58,050
Speaker 0: you know the weapon x project was but he's also got all this stuff that goes on in Japan.

640
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,203
Speaker 0: He's got all this stuff that goes on now.

641
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:01,310
Speaker 1: the end stuff is weird.

642
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:03,410
Speaker 0: He's got all the stuff that goes on in the south.

643
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:08,590
Speaker 0: He's got all this stuff that goes on with like the Avengers and like the superhero world level stuff.

644
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,459
Speaker 0: It's like how can one guy have all these things in his life?

645
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:16,657
Speaker 1: by making him the consummate badass dark and brooding Especially in the Japanese stuff.

646
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:19,089
Speaker 1: you know ancient history that he's all through history.

647
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:20,215
Speaker 1: Wolverine is there.

648
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:22,810
Speaker 1: He's just an anri's vampire.

649
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,514
Speaker 0: You think so that?

650
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:25,738
Speaker 1: no at least character-wise.

651
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:29,330
Speaker 1: That's what his character functions as in a lot of those stories.

652
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,628
Speaker 1: Mmm, and I think that comes kind of to the root.

653
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:39,729
Speaker 1: weird Stuff of Wolverine is that American comic books tend to be very static and they tend to not like.

654
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,315
Speaker 1: They basically kept.

655
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:45,108
Speaker 1: every time they had a cool idea like what if we had a character who was like this?

656
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:50,210
Speaker 1: they basically just said Well, let's just make that part of Wolverines backstory when they should have made a new character.

657
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,466
Speaker 0: Well the thing is making new characters right is?

658
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:58,427
Speaker 0: they don't sell comics You know if you go to the store, and it says you know guy from Japan.

659
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:02,633
Speaker 0: right you know They have guys from Japan and they those guys Superheroes.

660
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,090
Speaker 0: if you put them on the front cover of the comic and name the comic after them it won't sell.

661
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:14,527
Speaker 0: But if you call it Wolverine like if I've gone to comic book stores And you go on Wednesday everyone whether you buy comics or not find your local comic store.

662
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:20,203
Speaker 0: go there on Wednesday right after work and watch what the people who are regulars just watch them.

663
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,630
Speaker 0: buy their comics right you will see these guys.

664
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:29,290
Speaker 0: They'll go to the shelf and they'll just buy every comic that has the word spider-man or a picture of spider-man on the cover.

665
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:29,908
Speaker 0: There are other guys.

666
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:37,804
Speaker 0: They'll go and they'll buy every comic that is a picture of Wolverine or Wolverine's name or X you know and they'll just buy every single one that goes together.

667
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,867
Speaker 0: and This is how certain people you know they're guys to go to buy every Superman every.

668
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,550
Speaker 0: that's all they do.

669
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,744
Speaker 0: They don't think they don't look at any other comics.

670
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:49,865
Speaker 0: They don't explore They don't do anything just by every Superman every flash every.

671
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:50,147
Speaker 0: you know.

672
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:50,750
Speaker 0: they have a thing.

673
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:51,920
Speaker 0: That's their thing.

674
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:53,712
Speaker 0: they buy every one of them And that's all they do.

675
00:42:54,174 --> 00:43:03,001
Speaker 0: so if you were to say come up with this great idea for a comic story And you include Wolverine in that story or make Wolverine the focus.

676
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:16,877
Speaker 0: your sales are gonna be ha ha ha even if your story is Poorly written or drawn whereas maybe your story would have been better if you used like some character No one ever heard of or a new character, but your sales are gonna be right Even if your comic is actually higher quality

677
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:17,520
Speaker 1: result at least

678
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,370
Speaker 0: in the superhero marketplace as opposed to the mocha marketplace.

679
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,853
Speaker 1: We have Wolverine who has possibly the most crowded back story of any character in American comics ever You know.

680
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:27,970
Speaker 0: that's why the cut that the cartoon you watched.

681
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,937
Speaker 0: Why is it called Wolverine and the x-men?

682
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:34,695
Speaker 0: because we're gonna make a comic that was just called X a cartoon That was just called x-men.

683
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:38,430
Speaker 0: would not you know get as much viewers right?

684
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:42,524
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a. there's a DC cartoon that a lot of superhero people like.

685
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:43,587
Speaker 0: that's on TV right now.

686
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:44,250
Speaker 0: I've never seen it.

687
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:46,097
Speaker 0: It's called Batman brave in the bold.

688
00:43:46,138 --> 00:43:46,358
Speaker 0: right.

689
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,070
Speaker 0: the original comic book was just called brave in the bold.

690
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:51,440
Speaker 0: Why do they call it Batman brave in the bold?

691
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,610
Speaker 0: because if they just made a cartoon called brave in the bold?

692
00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:00,138
Speaker 0: Maybe a fraction of the people would watch it or care about it as opposed to if you call it Batman brave in the bold And Batman's in every episode.

693
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,929
Speaker 0: a lot more people are gonna watch it.

694
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:08,110
Speaker 1: But there's still some sort of mystique about Wolverine specifically because look at you know when they made the new x-men movies, right?

695
00:44:08,753 --> 00:44:09,437
Speaker 1: They were okay movies.

696
00:44:09,457 --> 00:44:09,899
Speaker 1: the first one.

697
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:10,543
Speaker 1: I thought was good.

698
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:12,795
Speaker 0: I yeah the first one I was not a fan of.

699
00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:14,323
Speaker 0: I didn't see these or three second.

700
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,212
Speaker 1: the second third one were just Terrible.

701
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:17,898
Speaker 1: the third one was was a joke.

702
00:44:18,118 --> 00:44:18,700
Speaker 0: I didn't see it.

703
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,234
Speaker 1: second or third remember the third one was the one where you know Every.

704
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:25,230
Speaker 1: that was back when ah she's the juggernaut.

705
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:36,210
Speaker 1: When the juggernaut was popular they changed the movie and added a scene where the juggernaut said I'm the juggernaut bitch.

706
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,968
Speaker 1: Right yeah, yeah, and the movie was just a joke.

707
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:47,309
Speaker 1: but Wolverine was very popular as a character among normal people who went to see these x-men movies But otherwise never read the comics didn't care about him.

708
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:53,890
Speaker 1: Hmm the movies were really popular among normal people, and there's something about Wolverine's character to where everyone always likes Wolverine.

709
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:58,999
Speaker 1: But maybe that's just I want to call this Blue cat syndrome.

710
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,750
Speaker 1: Emily and I were talking about this a lot last night.

711
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:05,230
Speaker 1: Oh, I found an article of someone who clearly I gotta find the article.

712
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,567
Speaker 1: yet He clearly does not know about the internet and furries.

713
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:13,909
Speaker 1: all right I think he has no idea about this and probably doesn't know about anime and cat girls either.

714
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:23,290
Speaker 1: But he said something along the lines of ever since avatar came out I'm seeing more and more like cat people and things like that.

715
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:31,554
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and how there are people who would like a certain kind of thing like maybe there's someone who was born to be a going Guy fan.

716
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:34,729
Speaker 1: they just never encountered that in the wild in their entire life.

717
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:40,930
Speaker 1: But there are people who would be a furry or would like anthropomorphic art But they never encountered any furries.

718
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,987
Speaker 0: And that's why there are more furries because they're on the internet, and then they find out about furriness.

719
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:51,990
Speaker 0: so suddenly They would have been a furry, but because if there was no internet, or if they didn't have internet They never would have actually found out they were a fur.

720
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,988
Speaker 1: But suddenly you know they just go to see avatar with their mom, and they're like blue cat people.

721
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:10,735
Speaker 1: whoa whoa Hmm, and I think that's what happened with Wolverine in that he's the dark brooding awesome Antihero bad guy on the surface But actually a good guy at heart.

722
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:20,630
Speaker 1: conflict like he has every element that makes a good character that you often don't get in American movies and as a result the people who saw these movies just there they want to see a summer blockbuster.

723
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:25,268
Speaker 1: They really like Wolverine because if there were more movies with characters like that they'd love them.

724
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:31,705
Speaker 1: Hmm, so I think that Wolverine is kind of the the Jack of all trades.

725
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,690
Speaker 1: that is the character that almost anyone will like.

726
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:40,250
Speaker 1: But because they put every kind of character in him yeah, well the thing is it's like.

727
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,298
Speaker 0: It's not just they put every kind of character in him.

728
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:45,130
Speaker 0: It's that he's a different character each time.

729
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:47,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like what it's not like.

730
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,864
Speaker 0: he's not like an everyman.

731
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:50,290
Speaker 0: It's depending on which book you read.

732
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,215
Speaker 0: He's a different man.

733
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:52,542
Speaker 0: You know in one comic.

734
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:53,728
Speaker 0: He's like.

735
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:55,762
Speaker 0: you know He's actually just sort of.

736
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:56,930
Speaker 0: he's mostly responsible.

737
00:46:57,131 --> 00:47:02,493
Speaker 0: He's just sort of snarky and angry and doesn't like people, but he's a good guy And he does the good thing.

738
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:03,637
Speaker 0: and another comic.

739
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:05,804
Speaker 0: He'll actually do some wrong things.

740
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,096
Speaker 0: Just because he's that kind of guy He's like fuck you right.

741
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:12,830
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do the bad thing you know or in some other comic.

742
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,345
Speaker 0: You know it's different every time, but whatever I remember.

743
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:18,930
Speaker 1: I was a huge fan of Wolverine.

744
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,090
Speaker 1: I didn't even like comics that much, but I collected the Wolverine cards.

745
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,070
Speaker 1: Remember there was like x-men cards like series one series.

746
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:36,612
Speaker 0: That was something that I felt really right is when I was a kid You know I came into comics and such in the 90s right and Wolverine You know the first Wolverine I saw was was sort of had the brown Costume.

747
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:37,635
Speaker 0: there's orange and brown.

748
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:39,882
Speaker 0: and then I saw the blue and yellow.

749
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:42,350
Speaker 1: one see blue and yellow was my first Wolverine, right?

750
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,899
Speaker 0: But then so I thought oh they changed it.

751
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:51,529
Speaker 0: then they did change it from you know the brown to the blue and yellow But apparently the original was blue and yellow Which I didn't find out until more recently.

752
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:55,430
Speaker 0: Then they actually change it from blue and yellow to brown back to blue and yellow.

753
00:47:55,811 --> 00:48:01,410
Speaker 0: And then of course the more recent x-men they have all those x-many movie like costumes that are all different.

754
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,944
Speaker 0: I don't even know anymore, but you know.

755
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,013
Speaker 0: Regardless it was just.

756
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:07,401
Speaker 0: you know when I was a kid Wolverine was like.

757
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:09,850
Speaker 0: I didn't read like those Frank Miller ones.

758
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:13,402
Speaker 0: So I only got you know the x-men Wolverine like I was.

759
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,292
Speaker 0: I was reading the comic where I get his metal ripped out Everything.

760
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:16,975
Speaker 1: I remember that.

761
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:18,983
Speaker 0: I remember that oh my god.

762
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:20,067
Speaker 0: He had bone claws.

763
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:23,261
Speaker 0: Oh shit I still have those comics in the closet.

764
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:23,844
Speaker 1: I got him some.

765
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:24,669
Speaker 0: I can go dig him out.

766
00:48:25,312 --> 00:48:28,907
Speaker 1: That's the very brief era where I even got issues of comics.

767
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:39,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, right But actually I'm thinking you know maybe I should go back and find like the original Frank Miller Wolverines like those the ones that you know Transformed Wolverine from.

768
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:43,898
Speaker 0: you know the Canadian just you know Superhero guy into.

769
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,006
Speaker 0: you know the dark and angry Wolverine.

770
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:46,870
Speaker 1: here's something interesting.

771
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:53,170
Speaker 0: So I only knew the blue and yellow, but you know of course was heavily inspired by like lone wolf and cub and such and such.

772
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:59,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's basically lone wolf, but there's no cub right, but I read you know the comic the 90s comics.

773
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:00,829
Speaker 1: It was just like kind of Wolverines there.

774
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:10,890
Speaker 1: But because I I saw you know in the store I'd see like x-men cards and then next to those Wolverine cards, and I was like why does Wolverine have cards just for himself?

775
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:16,450
Speaker 1: So I bought him and I started collecting him and each one had a little bit of backstory on it.

776
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:18,296
Speaker 0: And yeah, I learned a lot about.

777
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:22,710
Speaker 0: you know most of what I know about superheroes because I collected freaking Marvel superheroes cards.

778
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:24,400
Speaker 0: You know I didn't actually comics.

779
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,757
Speaker 0: I read were x-men and Spider-man 2099.

780
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:36,090
Speaker 1: I read a little bit of x-factor in x-force But only because that was the end of comics for me when I followed the executioner song Yeah, so I was like I gotta buy other comics.

781
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:37,310
Speaker 1: Oh, and I sorted it all out.

782
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:42,353
Speaker 1: I read the whole thing and I felt really accomplished And then I decided that was never worth the effort again And I stopped.

783
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:47,578
Speaker 1: so much yeah so much work to get all the different freaking issues Yeah and most of it I didn't care about like you'd be like.

784
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:52,143
Speaker 1: oh now you have to read x-factor whatever and I'd read it and it Didn't have anything to do with what I cared about.

785
00:49:52,183 --> 00:49:57,148
Speaker 0: I could have just skipped it Yeah, but it said part three of five, and you were trying to read all five parts.

786
00:49:57,309 --> 00:50:01,086
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, but I learned so much about Wolverine from these cards.

787
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:02,110
Speaker 1: I still have a bunch of the foils.

788
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:06,387
Speaker 1: I didn't get all of them though, but I remember thinking someday these will make me rich.

789
00:50:06,748 --> 00:50:11,950
Speaker 0: nope Unless you know you find everyone else who has that exact same card and destroy it.

790
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I could work on that.

791
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:24,130
Speaker 0: yeah thing is there's so much Wolverine shit now like I don't understand like it's The one thing that puzzles me right is that you would think when something's rare right like think about baseball cards, right?

792
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,115
Speaker 0: You know you can understand that.

793
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:37,190
Speaker 0: say for example a Babe Ruth baseball card be worth more right and probably because this you know Not only are there less of them right, but it's because that's the famous guy right.

794
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,903
Speaker 0: But you look at something like a Wolverine card or Wolverine comic.

795
00:50:41,184 --> 00:50:44,133
Speaker 0: well there aren't less of them in fact There's more of them.

796
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:48,127
Speaker 0: He's the guy, but there's so many more of them wouldn't be?

797
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:48,789
Speaker 0: you know?

798
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:54,295
Speaker 0: non Wolverine comic be more that is you know in such a lower supply Be in much.

799
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:58,208
Speaker 0: You know greater demand and price and such you know.

800
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:05,500
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever so I just randomly pull up the Wikipedia and It's kind of poorly written, but I have to read this.

801
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,870
Speaker 0: it's got to be gigantic right it is.

802
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:13,550
Speaker 1: But I have to read this excerpt under skills and personality because this is just too funny And I think I know who Wolverine really is all right.

803
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:26,410
Speaker 1: During his time in Japan and other countries Wolverine becomes proficient or becomes an expert in Virtually all forms of martial arts and is familiar with and experienced in virtually every fighting style on earth.

804
00:51:26,932 --> 00:51:29,403
Speaker 1: He's proficient with all weaponry including firearms.

805
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:34,530
Speaker 1: There is partial to bladed weapons Defeated Captain America and Shang Chi and single combat.

806
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:39,269
Speaker 1: He has a wide knowledge of the body and fresher points.

807
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,280
Speaker 1: He's the successor Hokuto no Ken.

808
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,330
Speaker 1: That's the only way to explain it, but he doesn't make anyone explode.

809
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:48,010
Speaker 1: He punched himself to give himself the healing factor.

810
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:51,718
Speaker 0: The thing is right.

811
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:56,839
Speaker 0: if you think about this like it doesn't really Make total sense that he would beat Captain America.

812
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:02,432
Speaker 0: right because Captain America is basically like the perfect human who is also the master of Human.

813
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,798
Speaker 1: Wolverine is the perfect mutant oh shit.

814
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,683
Speaker 0: I guess that's how that goes.

815
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:07,826
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean healing factor.

816
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:08,848
Speaker 1: He's basically God.

817
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:10,834
Speaker 0: yeah But it's like.

818
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:12,058
Speaker 0: it's like oh, he's basically God.

819
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:13,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, except in Marvel Comics.

820
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:18,254
Speaker 0: This guy's like you know Galactus or whatever Thor.

821
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:20,997
Speaker 1: Thor is a superhero.

822
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:21,881
Speaker 1: It's Thor.

823
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:23,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Thor could beat Captain America.

824
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, could Thor be Wolverine though?

825
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:26,941
Speaker 0: or here.

826
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,570
Speaker 0: Let's see here's Captain America powers and abilities.

827
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:31,779
Speaker 0: He has no superhuman powers.

828
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,139
Speaker 0: as a result of the super soldier serum and Vita Ray treatment He is transformed.

829
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,070
Speaker 0: from a frail young man.

830
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,141
Speaker 0: Is he the perfect specimen of human development conditioning so Wolverine could just kill him.

831
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:47,261
Speaker 0: his strength endurance agility speed reflex durability healer the highest Limits of human of natural human potential has been said.

832
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:49,708
Speaker 0: his body regularly replenishes the serum.

833
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:50,550
Speaker 0: It does not wear off.

834
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,020
Speaker 1: Uh-huh There's more to blah blah blah during his.

835
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:04,755
Speaker 1: due to his increased lifespan he Speaks almost all languages and understands almost all cultures English Japanese.

836
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:09,930
Speaker 1: really Wolverine really speaks all Japanese Russian Chinese cayenne Spanish Arabic and Lakota.

837
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:14,550
Speaker 1: He's also known for knowledge of French Thai Vietnamese German Italian Portuguese Korean and Hindi.

838
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:28,969
Speaker 1: When Forge monitors Wolverine's vitals during a danger room training session He calls Logan's physical and mental states quote Equivalent of an Olympic level gymnast performing a gold medal routine while same simultaneously beating for chess computers in his head.

839
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:33,420
Speaker 1: He's basically just a Mary Sue who kicks everybody's ass.

840
00:53:33,741 --> 00:53:36,289
Speaker 0: I didn't really you know, they've really up to Wolverine's power.

841
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:44,050
Speaker 0: originally He was just strong dude with claws But he's a grown a healing power as in if you cut him, it'll grow back.

842
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:48,270
Speaker 1: He's a gruff loner often taking leave from the x-men to deal with personal issues.

843
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:57,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, except in Wolverine in the x-men where everyone else does that yeah, and he also totally makes out with well Yeah, yeah.

844
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:09,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically that that whole thing is just him desperately wanting to bone Jean Grey And then she desperately wanting to bone him and then she dies and then she doesn't comes back and then she dies and then she comes Back.

845
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,720
Speaker 1: actually, there's this cool thing that's currently dead.

846
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,966
Speaker 0: I think she's gonna come back soon though.

847
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:13,227
Speaker 0: Of course.

848
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,890
Speaker 1: She's gonna come back.

849
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:23,117
Speaker 1: And But in case anyone, you know Wolverine in the x-men the reason we keep saying oh shit, it's Wolverine We were stinking drunk everyone.

850
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:28,583
Speaker 1: but Scott watching Wolverine in the x-men and the MRD, you know The mutant risk whatever responds something.

851
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:29,610
Speaker 1: there people are as mutants.

852
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:34,748
Speaker 1: They have a little heads-up display and every time they look at a mute It's always like his power level is over.

853
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:37,078
Speaker 0: now No shit law.

854
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:47,879
Speaker 1: and they're all these scenes Where like they'll be looking at some other mutants and be about to like fight him or arrest him and suddenly Wolverine jumps down And I feel like based on Wolverine's power.

855
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,125
Speaker 1: It should be like mutant mutant mutant.

856
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:50,806
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

857
00:54:50,847 --> 00:55:00,709
Speaker 1: It's Wolverine in red And that became kind of like the FRC catchphrase, all right, I Think we've done all about we can on the show.

858
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:06,919
Speaker 1: Wolverine is I don't know either really like the character or really hate it But I think I actually just really like.

859
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:09,450
Speaker 0: it depends on like which little Wolverine is there at the time.

860
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,442
Speaker 0: You know, it's like some Wolverines are great and some are not so great?

861
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:14,510
Speaker 0: because this is what happens when you have a character.

862
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,336
Speaker 0: You know, look at someone like Harry Potter, right?

863
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:20,750
Speaker 0: Harry Potter is pretty much in completely controlled by JK Rowling, you know.

864
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,881
Speaker 0: I mean there are fan fictions, but those don't you know count right?

865
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:29,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Wolverine the real Wolverine He's in movies is in cartoons is in comic books.

866
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:32,010
Speaker 0: all different writers all different directors all different, right?

867
00:55:32,892 --> 00:55:40,902
Speaker 0: It's always the same, you know, there's some things that are always the same, you know the hair, you know, he's a dude He's never a female, you know, he's strong.

868
00:55:40,983 --> 00:55:45,930
Speaker 0: He's got some sort of healing power He's got claws, but everything else is different every single time.

869
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:48,902
Speaker 0: So, you know is Wolverine really a single character?

870
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:50,569
Speaker 0: same for Batman and super, you know.

871
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:54,345
Speaker 0: And so sometimes he's good and sometimes he's not so good.

872
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:58,360
Speaker 1: due to high-level Psionic shields implanted by Professor Xavier.

873
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:06,471
Speaker 1: Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault Mmm, he also possesses psychic scar tissue Uh-huh.

874
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:09,041
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually you see that news article.

875
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:10,707
Speaker 1: I'm slashed out about the Wolverine factor.

876
00:56:11,128 --> 00:56:11,490
Speaker 0: What is it?

877
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:17,500
Speaker 1: They basically found a gene that if you turn it off in mice They don't scar and they basically just regrow damaged tissue.

878
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,583
Speaker 0: Oh, it's like a starfish.

879
00:56:18,844 --> 00:56:19,085
Speaker 1: Yeah.

880
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:20,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, turn that on in mammals.

881
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, the starfish is not like.

882
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:26,382
Speaker 0: I would be cool if I had that power But it's not Wolverine level power.

883
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,630
Speaker 0: if you stabbed me I would die.

884
00:56:27,771 --> 00:56:29,790
Speaker 0: I wouldn't like grow a new heart and come back to life.

885
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like cut off a finger you could theoretically grow the finger back.

886
00:56:32,683 --> 00:56:33,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a starfish.

887
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:35,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing wrong with that That's completely great.

888
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:36,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would be great.

889
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:40,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, buddy, but at the same time I would still not want my finger to get cut off.

890
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:44,650
Speaker 1: No, but I would like to have the the regeneration as long as it doesn't just cause cancer.

891
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:46,313
Speaker 0: That's also true.

892
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,757
Speaker 0: You might you know grow you.

893
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:51,590
Speaker 0: they might remove a cancer and then like a starfish you would grow back the cancer.

894
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:53,208
Speaker 0: That would be bad.

895
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:56,144
Speaker 1: All right, I think we're done here.
