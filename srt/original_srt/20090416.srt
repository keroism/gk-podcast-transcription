1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,866
Speaker 1: -Warm today.

2
00:00:00,887 --> 00:00:02,700
Speaker 0: -It wasn't that warm today.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,689
Speaker 1: -It was pretty warm.

4
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,214
Speaker 0: -No, it wasn't.

5
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:04,880
Speaker 0: It was a little bit cold.

6
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,880
Speaker 0: I had to open the window, then I had to close the window.

7
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,710
Speaker 0: When did you open the window?

8
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,520
Speaker 1: It was cold in the morning.

9
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,400
Speaker 0: I opened the window at various times in the day.

10
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,699
Speaker 0: I tried to reopen it, but I always had to close it again.

11
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:14,751
Speaker 1: I think you're a wuss.

12
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,700
Speaker 1: It was real warm.

13
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:16,740
Speaker 0: It wasn't warm enough.

14
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,440
Speaker 1: It wasn't as warm yesterday.

15
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,928
Speaker 0: -That's for sure.

16
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:22,040
Speaker 1: -But it was warmer today.

17
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,550
Speaker 0: I'm wearing shorts, but it's still... it's not... I mean, it's warm.

18
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,178
Speaker 0: It's not cold.

19
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,860
Speaker 0: It's definitely not cold, but it's not... it's not warm enough.

20
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,092
Speaker 0: It's not... we're not quite to where I can go outside and be like,

21
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:34,172
Speaker 0: "Yes!".

22
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:37,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good feeling.

23
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,700
Speaker 1: But for anyone who's new to this whole Geek Nights thing, you know, maybe you found the website or something.

24
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,460
Speaker 0: Like yesterday.

25
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,880
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're one of those people who was in the Ustream doing your thing.

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:49,829
Speaker 0: Lol.

27
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:59,419
Speaker 1: But this... what you're about to hear is not a normal episode of Geek Nights, so if you're looking to find out what this is all about, I recommend you just pick any other episode.

28
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,958
Speaker 1: Except for any other episode that starts like this.

29
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,640
Speaker 0: Yeah.

30
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, when was this supposed to go online, Aaron?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,080
Speaker 1: Well, originally we were gonna do it, Rob, on the Thursday.

32
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,537
Speaker 1: Two weeks ago?

33
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,767
Speaker 1: -Yeah, and you know what?

34
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,240
Speaker 0: -Yeah, what took two weeks?

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,044
Speaker 1: You know what?

36
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,320
Speaker 1: One, originally, we were gonna do it right away.

37
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:18,240
Speaker 1: And then, you know, we're hurting for Thursdays, so we're gonna save it for a Thursday.

38
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,358
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no, no.

39
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,280
Speaker 0: We were gonna do it right away, and then you didn't get it done.

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,180
Speaker 0: Just like, there are still promises we made in this very episode that you did not fulfill.

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,802
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

42
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:32,180
Speaker 1: Unlike someone in this room, I have a job that I'm working at.

43
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even if you had the job, you should not have made the promise that you could not keep.

44
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,064
Speaker 1: Well, which promises?

45
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:40,079
Speaker 1: All I said on the e-commerce was, "I'll try to get it

46
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,179
Speaker 1: done.".

47
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,791
Speaker 0: No, you said you would get it done.

48
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,477
Speaker 0: You said, "I got

49
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:42,739
Speaker 0: that.".

50
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,878
Speaker 1: I said, "I got that," as in, "I'll handle

51
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:44,979
Speaker 1: it.".

52
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,544
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

53
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,775
Speaker 1: -And, "I'll

54
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,159
Speaker 1: try.".

55
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,995
Speaker 0: -Uh-huh.

56
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:48,118
Speaker 0: -Yeah?

57
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:49,174
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

58
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,308
Speaker 0: Cop here.

59
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,179
Speaker 0: Cop it out there.

60
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:51,823
Speaker 1: Yeah?

61
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:54,579
Speaker 1: Plus, this was actually done a week and a half ago.

62
00:01:56,142 --> 00:02:01,740
Speaker 1: We just didn't put it up because I'm gonna be gone all next week, so we were trying to spread stuff out and have extra episodes.

63
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,700
Speaker 0: That's your post-hoc excuse.

64
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,332
Speaker 1: It was done a week and a half ago.

65
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,160
Speaker 1: We just didn't put it up.

66
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,076
Speaker 0: It still was not in time to be... Anyway.

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,740
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this is a live show that we recorded and you streamed a couple weeks ago.

68
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Speaker 1: I gotta say, it's not that interesting to listen to without the video.

69
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,846
Speaker 0: -Really?

70
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:18,940
Speaker 1: -Nah, it's no good.

71
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,339
Speaker 0: Did we even do anything in the video?

72
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,520
Speaker 0: I mean, it was mostly just us sitting, looking at laptops, right?

73
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the video still adds a lot.

74
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,000
Speaker 1: The audio just doesn't have the same snap or pizzazz.

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,236
Speaker 0: Well, even so, in this audio...

76
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,767
Speaker 1: -Ah.

77
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:33,200
Speaker 1: -What?

78
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,727
Speaker 1: -Ah.

79
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:34,400
Speaker 1: -Uh.

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,461
Speaker 1: -Uh.

81
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:34,724
Speaker 1: -Uh.

82
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:47,260
Speaker 0: Even so, you can hear us share very important information about various announcements, as well as answering listener questions and things like that.

83
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:52,539
Speaker 1: It was a good time, but I'd recommend you should probably, if you want to experience this, just watch the video.

84
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,240
Speaker 0: I also think that without the context of the chat room and such, it might make less sense.

85
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one could keep up with that chat room.

86
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:01,747
Speaker 0: I couldn't keep up with it.

87
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:09,320
Speaker 0: I just looked up every now and then when I needed something new to say and, you know, used it as a little seed material.

88
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:16,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this was fun, and once I get back from Costa Rica, we'll probably do these on a semi-regular basis in some fashion.

89
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 0: Some sort of weekend fashion?

90
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, not a, you know, Wednesday night fashion.

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,138
Speaker 0: It was only Wednesday night because it was, um...

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,968
Speaker 1: -It was the day.

93
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:25,880
Speaker 0: -Yeah, that's right.

94
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,303
Speaker 0: -It was the day.

95
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:26,970
Speaker 1: those things happened.

96
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 0: -Right, yeah.

97
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,502
Speaker 1: -Yep.

98
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,220
Speaker 0: -Okay, listen to it.

99
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,802
Speaker 1: Enjoy.

100
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:39,020
Speaker 1: The audio obviously won't be as great as normal Geek Nights because we used a different kind of microphone that you could actually see in the videos sitting kind of between us on the table.

101
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, that way we could, you know, be in the living room.

102
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
Speaker 0: We wouldn't have to have microphones in our face.

103
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaker 0: We can get the video camera going, you know, the whole thing.

104
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the lavalier isn't so great, so...

105
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,610
Speaker 0: -Different setup.

106
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,877
Speaker 0: -Yep.

107
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,789
Speaker 1: That's all we really got.

108
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:51,740
Speaker 1: Just listen to this.

109
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,980
Speaker 1: No things of the day or anything.

110
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,440
Speaker 1: And, uh, again, if you've never listened to Geek Nights before, pick some other episode.

111
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, this one won't make very much sense at all.

112
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Speaker 1: This one's a lot of inside baseball.

113
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,360
Speaker 1: Do you like a baseball?

114
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,791
Speaker 0: Wait, is it actually recording?

115
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,100
Speaker 0: I pushed the start record button.

116
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:09,780
Speaker 1: I think it's recording.

117
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,372
Speaker 0: -Okay, now it's recording.

118
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,060
Speaker 1: -Now it's recording.

119
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:12,559
Speaker 1: Okay.

120
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:14,139
Speaker 1: So that's how we start our video.

121
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:15,659
Speaker 0: Yes, that's correct.

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,851
Speaker 1: No, without saying, "Oh, it's recording

123
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:18,033
Speaker 1: now.".

124
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,108
Speaker 0: That was inevitable.

125
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,579
Speaker 0: There was nothing we could do about that one.

126
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:29,340
Speaker 0: So I guess, um, we don't have intro musics with video and such.

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of weird to not have the microphone in front of my face.

128
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,277
Speaker 1: Like, I'm so used to that that I'm kind of hunched over, like, expecting it to be there, and I...

129
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:38,340
Speaker 0: I'm leaning back, but I'm gonna have to hunch over to use the computer.

130
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,906
Speaker 1: -But I can't...

131
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:39,999
Speaker 0: -You wanna try to bring this closer?

132
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should.

133
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:45,280
Speaker 1: Mainly, I can't hear my own voice coming back with a slight delay into my ears.

134
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,206
Speaker 0: -Yeah, that's true.

135
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaker 1: -That's really, like, messing with me.

136
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:51,720
Speaker 1: Am I losing the ability to talk in the real world?

137
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:53,198
Speaker 0: I don't know.

138
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 0: Uh, so the deal with this is today is April Fool's Day, and if you've listened to our show, you will know that, um, you know, over the past many years, we have sort of had a mostly hate, slightly love relationship with April Fool's Day.

139
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,535
Speaker 1: Mostly the fact that I'll go to Slashshot, and I can't believe anything on the site for 24 hours.

140
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's like, there's no way to trust any news.

141
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,775
Speaker 0: You can't communicate for 24 hours.

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,559
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, when April Fool's Day was before the internet, you could, you know, pranks were sort of, you could see them.

143
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,896
Speaker 1: -People mostly talk, walk and talk normally.

144
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:33,694
Speaker 1: -Yeah, I mean, granted, you had the situation where your, you know, father calls and says your uncle died, and you're like, "Ha ha

145
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:33,917
Speaker 1: ha!".

146
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,574
Speaker 0: Oh, uh, that could happen.

147
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,459
Speaker 0: I'm sure it has.

148
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,620
Speaker 1: But the internet is that times a million.

149
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, every blog is just all fake.

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,310
Speaker 0: You know, last year, what was it?

151
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,340
Speaker 0: Rickrolls everywhere.

152
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, everywhere I went was a Rickroll.

153
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,580
Speaker 1: I think that was the straw, was that everything was a Rickroll.

154
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,460
Speaker 1: See, at least if I were YouTube, I would have gone all the way, and I would have just turned every video into a Rickroll all day.

155
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:59,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Rickrolls broke the, uh, the camels back there.

156
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:19,980
Speaker 0: So we decided that to sort of fix April Fool's Day, right, we're gonna do is we decided, and, you know, the live part of this was to draw a lot of attention to our movement, um, was to make it April Truth Day, and we're basically going to tell you the idea is that you save up amazing but true things, right?

157
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:30,500
Speaker 0: You don't tell them to anyone, you hold on to them, the amazing but true things, and then you come out and you tell them on April Fool's Day, because no one will believe it, but it's amazing but true, right?

158
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:35,540
Speaker 0: So, we have many amazing but true things to, to tell.

159
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,138
Speaker 1: Of course, I will point out, I did, I did do my own April Fool's joke in the forum, and I got a bunch of you, which is sad, because I didn't even do it, I just replied to the thread where I did it last year.

160
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,859
Speaker 0: Actually, here, before, did you actually see any good April Fool's today?

161
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,359
Speaker 1: Uh, no, I mean, Reddit, what, looked like Digg?

162
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:53,477
Speaker 0: That's it?

163
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:53,976
Speaker 0: That's it.

164
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,300
Speaker 0: I mean, uh, Quake Live was a little bit funny, but it was in Fools.

165
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,068
Speaker 1: That's the thing, is?

166
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:05,079
Speaker 0: I hate things that don't fool, it's just, someone will put up a fake news story, but it's obviously fake, it's not fooling anyone.

167
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,119
Speaker 1: You have to fool someone.

168
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, nothing, like, last year, Fark and BoardGameGeek got us both.

169
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,759
Speaker 0: BoardGameGeek was, I think, before Fark did that.

170
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:12,196
Speaker 0: Was it?

171
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:17,808
Speaker 1: All I remember is I went to Fark one day, and I forgot it was April Fool's Day, and I'm sitting there, and I see the, you know, I'm

172
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,453
Speaker 0: chatting

173
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:21,573
Speaker 1: and responding to someone, then I see this, like, moderate button, and I'm like,

174
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:22,297
Speaker 1: "Huh?"

175
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,892
Speaker 1: And I click on it, and I see all these options, I'm like...

176
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,940
Speaker 0: And I start going to, like, action, like, I start banning people.

177
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:32,520
Speaker 1: I guess I'm one of those people who would abuse my power.

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:42,527
Speaker 0: So the one good April Fool's Day I saw was there's this Firefox, like, combo extension, and if you're, like, a family or something like that, where everyone uses the same computer, and everyone uses the same browser, doesn't have separate

179
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:42,952
Speaker 1: accounts,

180
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:51,220
Speaker 0: you know, or if you have access to someone's account because no one uses passwords and stuff, right, it's really easy to install a Firefox extension in someone else's, um, you know, Firefox.

181
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:57,780
Speaker 0: So this extension, it was actually a bunch of extensions that come in a combo pack, would, basically, it wouldn't do anything.

182
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:03,020
Speaker 0: But on April 1st, it would start doing stuff, and it would start doing more stuff as later in the day.

183
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,180
Speaker 0: So what it would do, like, it would just pick links in websites that were legitimate links, but turn them into Rick Roll links.

184
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,956
Speaker 0: So you wouldn't actually have to Rick Roll someone, right?

185
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,940
Speaker 0: And there were other extensions in there, like, one would do stuff, like, if you pushed back, it would actually go forward, you know?

186
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:26,400
Speaker 0: And as the day went on, it would do it more and more, and you wouldn't know what was causing it, because it was Firefox doing it, not, right?

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,939
Speaker 1: It's still not a fool, like, it's a prank, but it's not a fool, per se.

188
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,318
Speaker 0: It's true, it's not a fool.

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,500
Speaker 0: But I did kind of like, it was clever.

190
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,539
Speaker 0: And the fact that it only works on, um, you know, it only works on April Fool's Day, the extension actually looks at the date.

191
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,120
Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like one of the listeners installed that on someone's computer.

192
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:50,439
Speaker 0: You know, you just, uh, you know, I thought that was clever, you know, as opposed to many other things.

193
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,660
Speaker 0: Alright, so do you want to do our, um, our big announcements?

194
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,240
Speaker 1: Amazing but true, do you want to start, where do you want to start with?

195
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,679
Speaker 1: Well, we can build up, because the announcement's coming in.

196
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Speaker 1: Building up is not so bad.

197
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, we got a little thing here.

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Speaker 1: I'm sure many of you have seen these, but not everyone has, but we have the wonderful Geek Nights t-shirts.

199
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,160
Speaker 0: Yes, these t-shirts do exist, you can see them for reals, bring closer.

200
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:13,919
Speaker 0: Hold it there for a little bit.

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,860
Speaker 0: Yes, that is the real Geek Nights t-shirt, okay.

202
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:27,280
Speaker 1: Now, sadly, we sold most of them that we bought at conventions, so we have to, uh, order some more before we can really sell them to you guys over the internet.

203
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we have, like, 20-something up there.

204
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, like, only, like, seven mediums and, like, seven extra larges.

205
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Speaker 0: So, the shirts exist, you saw them there, right?

206
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,280
Speaker 1: We have a web store set up, but what, it was RIM's responsibility?

207
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,719
Speaker 1: And I didn't make it, I got all the, this is all we got left.

208
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:47,660
Speaker 0: And RIM, uh, didn't fully set up the web store.

209
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,358
Speaker 1: No, I didn't make it.

210
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:52,779
Speaker 1: So, we have an empty web store that is at shop.frontroadcrew.com.

211
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,380
Speaker 1: So, you guys know, the reason for all that is that e-commerce sucks.

212
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,938
Speaker 1: Every solution either doesn't work at all, is really crappy, or does everything but takes, like, a year to set up.

213
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:11,158
Speaker 1: So, we decided to go with the full-on solu- Well, I decided to go with the full-on solution, and I said, "Scott, I got plenty of time, I'll have this ready by April

214
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:11,219
Speaker 1: 1st.".

215
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,238
Speaker 1: And Scott said, "All right, RIM, do

216
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:13,359
Speaker 1: it.".

217
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,151
Speaker 1: And I said, "Okay,".

218
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:14,760
Speaker 1: and then I just didn't.

219
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,895
Speaker 0: I know it's a 403, it's going to be not 403 soon enough.

220
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,080
Speaker 1: Yep, because we're, uh, we got a couple other little things.

221
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,139
Speaker 1: Talk about packs.

222
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:26,398
Speaker 1: Uh, what about packs?

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,020
Speaker 0: Well, uh- We're going to, right?

224
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going, we said we're going, well, two years ago, we said, well, yeah, we said, "Next packs," which was this previous packs, "We're going no matter

225
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:35,976
Speaker 1: what.".

226
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,840
Speaker 1: So, packs, are we talking about packs 09 or packs 10?

227
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,400
Speaker 1: Packs 09.

228
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,638
Speaker 0: Well, packs, oh, packs, oh, packs.

229
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,829
Speaker 0: There's numbers in this year's, packs 09 or packs 10?

230
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:45,919
Speaker 1: Uh, the packs we went to.

231
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,240
Speaker 1: We'd said the year before, "We're going," and we went.

232
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,775
Speaker 1: There are no Geek Nights condoms, shut up.

233
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Speaker 1: Why, see, you're supposed to ignore that stupid shit.

234
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:54,518
Speaker 1: I don't know, it stood out.

235
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:56,699
Speaker 1: I'm avoiding the other things.

236
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,819
Speaker 1: But anyway, so we're like, "We're going no matter

237
00:10:58,839 --> 00:10:58,920
Speaker 1: what.".

238
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:02,538
Speaker 1: And then we decided, "All right, since we're going, let's try to get a

239
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:02,820
Speaker 1: panel.".

240
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,179
Speaker 1: Like, I didn't think we'd get one.

241
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:09,220
Speaker 1: I put in the application, they were real professional, and one thing led to another, and we did, Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

242
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:15,359
Speaker 1: And for anyone who wasn't at, uh, packs, people lined up for like an hour and a half to see this thing.

243
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,779
Speaker 1: Like, it was crazy.

244
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,019
Speaker 0: It was very strange.

245
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Speaker 1: And then the fact that afterward we got the whole crowd to come to this room, and we ran the panel with Luke Crane and, uh, Jared Sorensen and a bunch of other people for like another couple hours.

246
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,360
Speaker 1: Well, they ran it for a couple hours.

247
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
Speaker 1: We stayed for like an hour, and then we split and went to the concert.

248
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,992
Speaker 0: I wasn't gonna miss the concert.

249
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:34,799
Speaker 0: What do you think this is?

250
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,760
Speaker 1: So, uh, I was keeping in touch with the packs people, and deciding, you know, "Hey, I wanna do stuff at the next packs.

251
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,732
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll try to get another

252
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,117
Speaker 1: panel.".

253
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,680
Speaker 1: And, uh, we're already doing at least two panels at the next packs in Seattle.

254
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:48,319
Speaker 1: So, we're doing Beyond Dungeons and Dragons again.

255
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:49,520
Speaker 1: I don't know why we're doing it again.

256
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:57,019
Speaker 1: At the request of packs, we're going to do it for an hour, same as last time, in a much bigger room, since, you know, people couldn't get in.

257
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:09,900
Speaker 1: And after that, we're gonna have, I didn't confirm it with Luke yet, but we're probably gonna have Luke Crane and a bunch of other people running demos of Burning Wheel and all these games for like eight hours for the rest of the day on Friday.

258
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:15,520
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like packs keynote, Beyond D&D, demos all day until the concert.

259
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:16,794
Speaker 1: And maybe all night, too.

260
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:17,139
Speaker 1: I don't know.

261
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:19,540
Speaker 1: And then, uh, we've got another panel.

262
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:24,780
Speaker 1: I don't wanna reveal it yet, but it's something pretty cool that we're gonna be doing Saturday at some point at packs.

263
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:29,720
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say what it is yet, because it's really cool, and I think it'll be a shock and a surprise.

264
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,039
Speaker 1: It's called "How Great is WoW and Why We Should All Play

265
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:33,180
Speaker 1: It.".

266
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,780
Speaker 0: I thought we weren't doing April Fools.

267
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,579
Speaker 1: No, no, April Fools.

268
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,478
Speaker 1: It's something to do with the idea that maybe losing games should be just as fun as winning them.

269
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,119
Speaker 1: It's one of those theoretical "there are no games like this, but what if" kind of deals.

270
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:55,141
Speaker 1: And the only other PAX thing I got for you is that we're gonna be doing a ton of stuff at PAX East in 2010.

271
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,219
Speaker 1: I can't say exactly what yet, but it's gonna be big.

272
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,340
Speaker 1: Like, there's going to be a lot of Geek Night stuff going on at PAX East.

273
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,359
Speaker 1: You will be surprised.

274
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,500
Speaker 0: PAX East is going to be... They might as well just call it Geek Night's time, right?

275
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:16,399
Speaker 1: I mean... Well, we're not going to run tabletop gaming, but we're going to be running a large section of tabletop gaming, possibly with Luke Crane and his whole crew and a bunch of other people.

276
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,109
Speaker 0: Hopefully.

277
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:17,599
Speaker 0: We'll see.

278
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,180
Speaker 0: Oh, someone asked about... We already announced Anime Boston.

279
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:21,625
Speaker 0: Yes.

280
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,120
Speaker 1: Alright, fine.

281
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,460
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Anime Boston.

282
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 1: We're doing, like, eight panels there, including The Late Show.

283
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:27,559
Speaker 1: We're going to be at the New York Anime Festival.

284
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,819
Speaker 1: We're going to be at the New York Comic Con.

285
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,900
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Otacon.

286
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,918
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Kineticon if they ever email me back.

287
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:33,618
Speaker 1: And PAX's.

288
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:34,360
Speaker 1: And PAX's.

289
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,200
Speaker 1: Is that all the conventions?

290
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,047
Speaker 0: Uh... Katsu-Con?

291
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:37,438
Speaker 0: Yes, no?

292
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,900
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, next Katsu-Con, but I can't announce anything about that yet.

293
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't know about that.

294
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:44,818
Speaker 0: So that's the full convention awesomeness.

295
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

296
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,918
Speaker 1: PAX is, uh... For any of you who saw Beyond D&D, compared to all the other panels we've done, it was kind of a step up.

297
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,439
Speaker 1: And all of our panels are going to be on that level from now on.

298
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,860
Speaker 1: So we're going to do fewer, more awesome panels.

299
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,720
Speaker 1: You know, faster, more intense.

300
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,860
Speaker 0: So you want to talk about something local?

301
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:03,659
Speaker 1: Something local?

302
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,240
Speaker 0: So, you know, we live in Beacon, New York, right?

303
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,580
Speaker 0: Which is, you know, it's sort of, it's a city, but it's not, like, a big city like New York.

304
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,220
Speaker 0: You know, there aren't any tall buildings here.

305
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Speaker 0: It's just got a long, sort of busy main street, surrounded by houses.

306
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,380
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, it's in upstate New York.

307
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Speaker 0: It's not too far upstate, but it's not too far downstate.

308
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:30,000
Speaker 0: You know, it's far enough away from New York, not to cost a fortune to live in, but it's close enough that you can take the trains in New York City.

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Speaker 0: You know, it's a nice in-between kind of place.

310
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,600
Speaker 0: We got trees, we got houses, we got a main street, we got the Hudson River, it's sort of everything in one place.

311
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:45,058
Speaker 0: And we're walking down the main street, and we see a sign on the main street, and the sign says, "Retro Arcade

312
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:45,440
Speaker 0: Museum."

313
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:49,700
Speaker 0: And it has a picture of an arcade cabinet on it.

314
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,480
Speaker 1: So we look in the window, and there's nothing.

315
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,580
Speaker 1: Like, there's nothing in this door.

316
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't really have windows.

317
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,299
Speaker 0: The only window is on the front door, and the door has shades on the inside.

318
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,920
Speaker 1: So we're, like, peeking around, and we see, like, this kind of empty room.

319
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,719
Speaker 1: We can't really tell.

320
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,420
Speaker 1: There's H&R Block sharing the building.

321
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:08,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it was, you know, it was very like, "Huh, why is there a Retro Arcade Museum in our town?

322
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,757
Speaker 0: Is it, you know, where are the geeks

323
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:10,959
Speaker 0: at?".

324
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Speaker 0: Obviously, even if there's nothing in this building here, this sign exists.

325
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,320
Speaker 0: This sign was not here before.

326
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:23,559
Speaker 0: That means recent geekery has been in this place, and it is our duty as the geeks of this town to seek it out.

327
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,879
Speaker 1: So we're thinking, "All right, we gotta figure out what this

328
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:27,000
Speaker 1: is.".

329
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,460
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking, "It's probably something that failed.

330
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,238
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna buy the sign from whoever that

331
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:31,319
Speaker 1: was.".

332
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, 'cause, you know, there was what?

333
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,420
Speaker 0: There was that really bad anime store that was in the mall, in the Poughkeepsie Mall.

334
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,498
Speaker 1: Oh, the guy selling bootlegs?

335
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he bought a retail space across from the baseball stadium, but never moved into it, or moved in and moved out, but his sign is still there.

336
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,625
Speaker 0: It's still empty.

337
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:46,735
Speaker 0: I drove by it the other day.

338
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:47,320
Speaker 0: It's still empty.

339
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:55,380
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's been geekery, and there have been instances of signs for things going up, but the business is never coming to actually exist.

340
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,956
Speaker 1: Or like, last year in the summer, I was riding my bike, and I sat on a bench in Beacon, and someone had, like, carved into this thing, "I heart Naruto

341
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:03,320
Speaker 1: OMG.".

342
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,354
Speaker 0: Really?

343
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,524
Speaker 1: Wow.

344
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:06,450
Speaker 1: Anyway.

345
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,214
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I went back.

346
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 1: We were trying to eat dinner.

347
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,080
Speaker 1: Scott didn't come, but I was out, and we were walking toward a place to eat dinner, and the whole crew, like, we had the whole front row crew there almost.

348
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:18,659
Speaker 1: And we see that it's open.

349
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:20,117
Speaker 1: So we go in.

350
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Speaker 1: And there is, in fact, a retro arcade museum there, and the guy who runs it is, like, the coolest guy in the world.

351
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,460
Speaker 1: And I'm not talking retro, like, Pac-Man.

352
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not talking about... There is a Pac-Man machine is too new for this arcade, right?

353
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,720
Speaker 0: I mean, Pong is probably the newest thing he's got in there, right?

354
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,309
Speaker 0: You're thinking, "Wait a minute.

355
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,040
Speaker 0: Pong was the first arcade machine.

356
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,397
Speaker 0: How can there possibly be something older than

357
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:45,740
Speaker 0: Pong?".

358
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,940
Speaker 0: Is it just all pinball machines?

359
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,000
Speaker 1: These are, like, mechanical arcade games from the '50s and '60s made by, like, Sega.

360
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:52,761
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:58,860
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, people don't really realize that, you know, pinball, you know, is a mechanical game, right?

362
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,980
Speaker 0: Modern pinball machines are digital.

363
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,099
Speaker 0: They have a few mechanical parts, like the ball and the flippers, right?

364
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,694
Speaker 0: But, you know, old pinball machines were 100% mechanical.

365
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:17,380
Speaker 0: You know, they had solenoids and gears and chains and... Yeah, just like an odometer.

366
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:28,138
Speaker 0: So people don't remember, you know, punk kids these days, that there were other, you know, mechanical arcade machines, analog arcade machines that were not pinball.

367
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:36,460
Speaker 0: You ever seen one of those, like, you know, target practice games that actually shoots little tiny things and hits little tiny targets?

368
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,418
Speaker 0: Like, it'll look like a Wild West scene and they'll shoot, like, the barrel and then, like, a hobo will come out.

369
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, or Ninja Gun is the best one.

370
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,798
Speaker 1: You just have a rifle and you shoot ninjas.

371
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, physical ninjas flying across this thing.

372
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,960
Speaker 1: And the way these things work is, like, amazing.

373
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,500
Speaker 1: We interviewed the guy, actually.

374
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,460
Speaker 1: We interviewed him for quite some time.

375
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,699
Speaker 1: He's, like, the coolest guy in the world.

376
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,078
Speaker 1: And we're going to put that interview up for you.

377
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:02,740
Speaker 1: And we're going to make a series of videos about all these machines in this arcade.

378
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:10,400
Speaker 0: And apparently the guy has a lot more machines that are in his storage facility and not in his little arcade because the arcade is not big enough to hold them all.

379
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:10,675
Speaker 1: Yep.

380
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 0: But he also does private parties.

381
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,680
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all he does is private parties.

382
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,757
Speaker 0: You can't just walk in.

383
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:17,799
Speaker 1: And his life, he had quite a life, too.

384
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:19,280
Speaker 0: He did have quite a life.

385
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,919
Speaker 1: He had some stories, so we'll be talking to him a lot.

386
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,819
Speaker 1: But the gist is the moral of the story.

387
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Speaker 1: Suffice it to say, we're going to put up this interview and then we're going to make all these YouTube videos.

388
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,939
Speaker 1: You're going to see, one by one, a bunch of videos of all these different machines, one by one.

389
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:39,560
Speaker 1: And at the end of that series, we're going to have the first Geek Nights Con at this place.

390
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,439
Speaker 1: We're going to have a party.

391
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,460
Speaker 1: You'll be able to pre-register.

392
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,739
Speaker 0: Not too many people can come.

393
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:47,340
Speaker 1: You're going to have to pre-register through the e-commerce site that I'm building.

394
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to sell tickets.

395
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,600
Speaker 1: You'll be able to buy tickets there.

396
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,579
Speaker 1: We'll probably give away some tickets to people who want to come.

397
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,020
Speaker 1: And this place is amazing.

398
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,538
Speaker 1: I can't express to you how crazy it is.

399
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,630
Speaker 0: Not only that, but the place is... What's it called?

400
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:04,580
Speaker 1: I forgot what I was going to say.

401
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,299
Speaker 1: What were you going to say?

402
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:05,939
Speaker 1: I forget.

403
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,126
Speaker 1: It's cheap.

404
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:07,974
Speaker 1: It's small.

405
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:08,659
Speaker 1: It's cool.

406
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,019
Speaker 1: He's got that kitchen in the back with the subway doors.

407
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:12,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forget.

408
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:12,820
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

409
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:19,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, there's going to be awesome things going down at this retro arcade-y place.

410
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,799
Speaker 0: And that's pretty big, pretty big deal.

411
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,539
Speaker 0: Because you might not think it's a big deal now.

412
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,499
Speaker 0: You know, why are they announcing this, right?

413
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,920
Speaker 0: But when you see this place, it's going to be a big deal.

414
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:36,140
Speaker 0: Alright, so next up on our list of awesome but true things.

415
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:43,760
Speaker 0: Oh, so in terms of other videos we're doing, if you don't notice, since I have no job, I've been doing more video-type things.

416
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:44,940
Speaker 0: Mostly with this webcam.

417
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:52,300
Speaker 0: For some reason, I got for almost free a camcorder because of Sony points on my Sony card.

418
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:53,198
Speaker 1: It's pretty crappy.

419
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:57,900
Speaker 0: It's good for standard definition video recording.

420
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:04,120
Speaker 0: The lens is pretty good and it's got a big old hard drive in it.

421
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:09,100
Speaker 1: If I got another battery for it, I could record for hours and hours and hours with no problem.

422
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,120
Speaker 0: And I bought it because it actually has a hard drive in it.

423
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Speaker 0: Not like a lot of these other ones that have an SD card and you can barely record anything.

424
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,300
Speaker 0: So, you know, I tried to do some video with that thing.

425
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,031
Speaker 0: But the problem is, A, I was lazy.

426
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,500
Speaker 0: And B, you can't use it as a webcam.

427
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,060
Speaker 0: You can only use it to record and then drag the files off and then edit them and then put them on YouTube or whatever.

428
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,879
Speaker 0: And I started doing that a little bit, but I sort of didn't stick with it.

429
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,719
Speaker 0: Now that I have no job, I could probably do a little more.

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,999
Speaker 0: And I probably am going to.

431
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,360
Speaker 0: I have a whole bunch of Scott's Boxes in the hopper.

432
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:46,720
Speaker 1: He's been doing them.

433
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,869
Speaker 0: I just got to cut up a bunch of them.

434
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,440
Speaker 0: I could probably upload a whole bunch to YouTube tomorrow.

435
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,519
Speaker 0: But I think I got this webcam here.

436
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:59,720
Speaker 0: And since we got the webcam, we've been using it like crazy.

437
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:04,440
Speaker 0: So I think really streaming is much better for us than recording and editing.

438
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:05,398
Speaker 1: At least for now.

439
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,220
Speaker 1: I mean, we've got a lot of recording, editing things in the hopper.

440
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,520
Speaker 1: But as you know, our hopper is longer than we can ever get to as long as either of us is working.

441
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, only things that we promise are guaranteed to make it out of the hopper.

442
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,199
Speaker 0: Other things in the hopper might stay there forever.

443
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,940
Speaker 0: But I think what I'm going to do is, A, I'm going to put up a bunch of those Scott's Boxes that I've recorded already.

444
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:40,100
Speaker 0: But I'm also thinking about, like, you know, as long as I don't have a job, maybe I can, like, if I scheduled, like, Scott's Box with the webcam, maybe I could do something like that, you know, like be like, you know, at this time, every, you know, every day or two, you know, I'd have read a comic.

445
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:40,544
Speaker 0: Right.

446
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:41,920
Speaker 0: And I would, you know, I'll go.

447
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,395
Speaker 0: And not only will I, you know, tell you about it, but people will also.

448
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:47,920
Speaker 0: it'll be an interactive kind of show.

449
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:49,519
Speaker 0: You know, just like this one.

450
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:53,240
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, with the I mean, the idea here, like what we're doing here is we're doing this live.

451
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 1: But then we're going to record the video and put it up somewhere.

452
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,020
Speaker 1: And we're recording the audio.

453
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,199
Speaker 1: And tomorrow we'll just put the audio up as a show.

454
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,399
Speaker 1: Obviously edited for the get rid of long silences that inevitably will occur.

455
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,016
Speaker 0: Yep.

456
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:06,234
Speaker 0: All right.

457
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,339
Speaker 0: So what else do you want?

458
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,859
Speaker 1: Well, you have them open there.

459
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:09,252
Speaker 1: Yes.

460
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,949
Speaker 0: Do you want to talk about the?

461
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,179
Speaker 0: do you want to do this one?

462
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,357
Speaker 1: The second one?

463
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:13,795
Speaker 0: Yeah.

464
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should.

465
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,389
Speaker 1: But that's something we kind of.

466
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:18,059
Speaker 1: I don't know if we will actually get to it.

467
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:18,556
Speaker 0: I worry.

468
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:19,316
Speaker 0: You worry.

469
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:20,955
Speaker 1: I think we'll get to it.

470
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:21,580
Speaker 0: You think.

471
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,018
Speaker 1: Should we set a date now?

472
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,939
Speaker 1: That's forcing ourselves.

473
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,158
Speaker 0: You want to set a date for it?

474
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,298
Speaker 1: Or set a time frame?

475
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:28,658
Speaker 1: I don't know.

476
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,357
Speaker 1: Let's hold on.

477
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:32,239
Speaker 0: No time frame, but we can still say we're going to do it.

478
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:32,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

479
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 1: It's something that we talked about doing when we first started.

480
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,277
Speaker 1: We just never did it.

481
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:47,380
Speaker 0: So basically we thought for a long time ago, we had the idea to sort of, you know, have, I don't know, like an award or sort of an order.

482
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

483
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,920
Speaker 1: An order of knights, perhaps geek knights.

484
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:51,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

485
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,300
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the obvious joke, right?

486
00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:00,260
Speaker 0: You know, and it's the obvious pun in our show title is geek knights, but you know, nighttime, but also knights of the round table.

487
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:09,960
Speaker 0: And we're thinking there should be some sort of, you know, we should be able to label certain people like you, you are a geek knight and you, you other people are not, you know.

488
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,026
Speaker 1: And we toyed with originally.

489
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,960
Speaker 1: we thought maybe we'll have people nominate and we'll give it to famous people.

490
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,060
Speaker 1: But then we decided that's lame.

491
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,099
Speaker 1: So we gave up on that.

492
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:17,258
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:25,158
Speaker 0: So I think we should, um, you know, possibly like get an actual trophy and maybe annually or something like that.

494
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,558
Speaker 1: We'll do a bunch to start because there are four of you out there right now who deserve it already.

495
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,217
Speaker 0: And you know, so you should know who you are.

496
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:33,754
Speaker 0: Yes.

497
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,393
Speaker 0: A Kniggetz.

498
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:42,999
Speaker 0: And we, so, you know, we should give out awards to the people who are the geek knights and it's mostly, you know, it's a listener recognition kind of thing.

499
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,419
Speaker 0: So you can, uh, you can look forward to that.

500
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:50,239
Speaker 0: And, oh, we have one more.

501
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:51,600
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

502
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,980
Speaker 1: I don't know if we need to bother with that one.

503
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,820
Speaker 1: Does anyone even care?

504
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:54,952
Speaker 0: I don't know.

505
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,499
Speaker 0: We don't really need to.

506
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,279
Speaker 1: Well, we can move on then.

507
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,439
Speaker 0: No, I think we have to announce this though.

508
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:00,748
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,619
Speaker 1: Well, someone found out about it early.

510
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,378
Speaker 0: They did.

511
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,240
Speaker 0: Someone did find out about it early, but that was, that was my bad for not being diligent.

512
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,660
Speaker 0: I was sort of doing security through obscurity a little bit.

513
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:12,640
Speaker 1: Who found it by the way?

514
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:17,655
Speaker 0: I was just in this chat room streaming and someone was like, Hey, and pasted the URL in there.

515
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,719
Speaker 1: So how do you silence them?

516
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:20,317
Speaker 1: I assume.

517
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,760
Speaker 0: Well, I was like, great.

518
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,440
Speaker 0: I was like, great.

519
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,359
Speaker 1: That is when you turn that into a Rick roll.

520
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,699
Speaker 0: I could have, but instead I just did so.

521
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:31,081
Speaker 0: Oh, it was Mike 2175.

522
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:31,571
Speaker 0: Thanks a lot.

523
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:32,937
Speaker 0: Um, yeah.

524
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,640
Speaker 0: So today we must announce that we have finished the new website of front recruit.com.

525
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:40,237
Speaker 1: It's up.

526
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,178
Speaker 0: It's not up.

527
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,780
Speaker 0: I have to, I have to type a bunch of things to make it up.

528
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,158
Speaker 0: I'm going to do it right now.

529
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:45,858
Speaker 1: It's up.

530
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:46,899
Speaker 1: You just can't see it yet.

531
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,576
Speaker 1: We can see it.

532
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,139
Speaker 1: That's right.

533
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:50,018
Speaker 0: So excuse me while I type.

534
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,119
Speaker 1: Well, scout does that.

535
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,739
Speaker 1: A lot of questions have been queuing up here actually in the Twitter, almost all of them about gaming and game theory and burning wheel.

536
00:24:58,682 --> 00:24:59,040
Speaker 0: Really?

537
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

538
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:01,280
Speaker 1: Uh, Hey guys.

539
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaker 1: So you can, you cover a little bit of beyond D and D sometime soon.

540
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:06,460
Speaker 1: Heard a lot about it.

541
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,134
Speaker 1: Would like to know more.

542
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:11,100
Speaker 1: Uh, for anyone who was at packs, you saw it obviously.

543
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:12,580
Speaker 1: And we did it at Connecticut too.

544
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,320
Speaker 1: And I think we actually did it better at Connecticut because we were, uh, it was so informal.

545
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:18,380
Speaker 1: Like we'd never done it before.

546
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,097
Speaker 1: That was the test run.

547
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,620
Speaker 1: So we literally, we show up to this panel.

548
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,180
Speaker 1: We've done seven other panels that day.

549
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,020
Speaker 1: We're exhausted, utterly wrecked.

550
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,800
Speaker 1: Emily got us Chinese food.

551
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,260
Speaker 1: We set it down in front of ourselves.

552
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:31,820
Speaker 1: We just eat this Chinese food and give this panel and it was like the best thing ever.

553
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:50,740
Speaker 1: But we talk about how Dungeons and Dragons, as good as it was for learning how to play role-playing games or all of us got into role-playing with it or all those sorts of things, it's a terrible role-playing game because it doesn't really have anything to do with role-playing and it's a combat game, but there's no other sort of conflict resolution.

554
00:25:51,682 --> 00:26:01,319
Speaker 1: We, we basically talk for an hour about exactly what it is that Dungeons and Dragons is and what it isn't and what a role-playing game is and what role-playing game isn't.

555
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:09,500
Speaker 1: And then we kind of, we get the audience to agree to a definition of a role-playing game, which is basically a conflict resolution mechanism for collaborative storytelling.

556
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:14,417
Speaker 1: And then we talk about all the games that actually do that pretty well, like Burning Wheel, Inspectors.

557
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,660
Speaker 0: The games, there are a lot of games that do it very well.

558
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,880
Speaker 0: We don't know all of them.

559
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:32,395
Speaker 1: We talk about, we give like four examples in the panel and we kind of take people through them and it's like, it's our headlining panel right now and we're probably going to do it at like every con this year and then we're going to record some sort of video final version and then just can it.

560
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:35,140
Speaker 1: So that's what it's about.

561
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,418
Speaker 0: That basically it's about mechanism design and conflict resolution in tabletop role-playing games.

562
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:55,000
Speaker 1: Mechanism design, by the way, is the idea that if you think about, if you have a game, you can design the rules of a game to force someone to do something or you can design the rules of a game to encourage someone to do something without forcing them.

563
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:10,160
Speaker 1: Like mechanism design of a game like Burning Wheel is to create a story that keeps complicating itself and going in directions you wouldn't expect and always pushes people to like purposefully screw something up at the critical moment or lose as opposed to win.

564
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,399
Speaker 1: And it's just as awesome.

565
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:17,274
Speaker 1: And D&D kind of encourages this idea that you can always solve something by fighting with it.

566
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:22,389
Speaker 1: I guess we do need a geeky quilt.

567
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,049
Speaker 1: This is not a geeky quilt.

568
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:24,598
Speaker 0: No.

569
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,329
Speaker 0: Does someone want to make one for us?

570
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,369
Speaker 0: That's probably a good idea.

571
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:32,027
Speaker 0: Actually, this couch, it is called the fucker.

572
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,770
Speaker 1: Pretty much like that.

573
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,349
Speaker 1: That is the name of this couch because we moved into this house.

574
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,030
Speaker 1: This house is actually pretty big.

575
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,560
Speaker 1: We found it.

576
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,969
Speaker 1: Did we ever tell the story of like how we got this house?

577
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,350
Speaker 0: You can just keep telling stories.

578
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,190
Speaker 1: It's going to take a little bit.

579
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:43,690
Speaker 1: All right.

580
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,328
Speaker 1: So we live in a pretty big house, actually, especially considering we pay almost nothing for this thing.

581
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:50,109
Speaker 1: It's gigantic.

582
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,590
Speaker 1: But we were looking for a place to live.

583
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:57,388
Speaker 1: I'd been living in the Mid-Hudson Valley for like two and a half years working for IBM, all this stuff.

584
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,190
Speaker 1: Scott was at RIT and they lived with his parents for a while and he moved around.

585
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:06,190
Speaker 1: I was like, Scott, just move to Beacon or Poughkeepsie or somewhere in this area.

586
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:07,490
Speaker 1: We can both work in the city.

587
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:08,910
Speaker 1: We can get everyone to move out here.

588
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,368
Speaker 1: It'll be awesome.

589
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:10,588
Speaker 1: So we're doing this.

590
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,969
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get him to move out.

591
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,830
Speaker 1: I'm looking at houses and apartments and everything.

592
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,808
Speaker 1: I don't have a lot of money yet.

593
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,070
Speaker 1: IBM was paying me like 45K a year, which just wasn't enough, especially for this area.

594
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:30,729
Speaker 1: So eventually I find like these five places and I look at them all and there's two that are... Well, there's one that's a really good candidate and I'm like, all right, this is it.

595
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:33,210
Speaker 1: We're definitely going to move into this place.

596
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,829
Speaker 1: I got to get Scott to look at it and we'll just do it.

597
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,410
Speaker 1: So he takes the train up and he stays in my crappy little apartment in Fishkill.

598
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,610
Speaker 1: I believe, didn't the heat stop working that night?

599
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:43,590
Speaker 1: It was rough.

600
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,810
Speaker 1: I fall asleep and Scott's on the floor.

601
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:48,750
Speaker 1: It's like a studio apartment in this French style.

602
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,246
Speaker 1: It's this really shady building I was living in, but I was paying like 400 bucks a month.

603
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,469
Speaker 1: And well, this story is just, I keep spawning all these tangents.

604
00:28:56,951 --> 00:29:05,490
Speaker 1: So I wake up and I'm kind of chilly and I look over and I see Scott is curled into this like fetal position with the one tiny sheet I gave him, basically dead.

605
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:08,890
Speaker 1: And the room is like 35 degrees because the boiler failed overnight.

606
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,150
Speaker 1: So we go look at this apartment.

607
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,270
Speaker 1: It's in some lady's basement.

608
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:17,807
Speaker 1: It's beautiful, but it's like this basement apartment in someone's house and it's not that big.

609
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:19,849
Speaker 1: And we're like, you want to move in?

610
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:20,489
Speaker 1: Let's move in.

611
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,987
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

612
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,510
Speaker 1: We're like, all right, we just have to look at this one other house, this one other place.

613
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:25,830
Speaker 1: We're not going to move into it.

614
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,389
Speaker 1: We'll come back, sign the stuff, all set.

615
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,830
Speaker 1: I didn't even want to come see this place because I'd already found the perfect place.

616
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:38,729
Speaker 1: And this house, I tried to look at it two times before and one time like the scheduling messed up and the other time I couldn't find it.

617
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,270
Speaker 1: And like I gave up and I wasn't able to get in.

618
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,670
Speaker 0: Well, when we tried to come, we couldn't find it.

619
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:41,770
Speaker 1: Yeah.

620
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,370
Speaker 1: And then we couldn't find it again.

621
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,450
Speaker 0: So finally- That was your fault for not getting the name of the street right.

622
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,470
Speaker 1: Well, because I swore she said Coughlin Street, but it was Conklin Street.

623
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,810
Speaker 1: And there are two, both streets exist in Beacon and the same address exists on both streets.

624
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,570
Speaker 0: You thought it was like Christina Street.

625
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,589
Speaker 1: No, it was Coughlin Street.

626
00:29:59,193 --> 00:29:59,467
Speaker 0: Anyway.

627
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:03,565
Speaker 1: So we went to Coughlin Street and there's a seven Coughlin Street and it's definitely not it.

628
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:07,370
Speaker 1: So we sorted out and we go and we're like, all right, let's just look at the stupid thing.

629
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:09,629
Speaker 1: Say no, be nice to this lady and then go.

630
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:14,370
Speaker 1: And she takes us into this gigantic house and I'm looking at it and it's gigantic.

631
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,330
Speaker 1: So finally I'm like, so who lives upstairs?

632
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,249
Speaker 1: So she's like, oh, you want to see the upstairs?

633
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,730
Speaker 1: The upstairs was part of it and it costs less than the other place.

634
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:23,904
Speaker 1: So we moved into it.

635
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,570
Speaker 1: So we had to move all our stuff out of Rochester.

636
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:30,669
Speaker 1: I rented a, I think 16 foot truck.

637
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:34,029
Speaker 1: They didn't have any 16 foot trucks when I showed up.

638
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,869
Speaker 1: They gave me a 24 foot semi truck.

639
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:36,528
Speaker 0: That was fun.

640
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:38,470
Speaker 1: It was like the worst thing ever.

641
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,290
Speaker 1: So Scott took like a little bit of stuff in his car and drove here.

642
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:41,929
Speaker 1: That was the tempo.

643
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:43,110
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

644
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:43,529
Speaker 1: It was.

645
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,767
Speaker 1: You're like, it didn't, you lost the muffler, not that time, but some other time on the mid hustle bridge.

646
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:53,310
Speaker 0: So no, on the, uh, the Newberg beacon, the Hamilton fish bridge.

647
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:53,797
Speaker 0: Yes.

648
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:07,809
Speaker 1: So me and Pete in the front row crew load up this 24 foot fucking truck and we drive it through the mountains on route 17 all the way here listening to like NPR and just whatever we could find on the radio.

649
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,570
Speaker 1: It was this horrible drive.

650
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:11,330
Speaker 1: It took forever.

651
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:12,770
Speaker 1: I could barely drive this car.

652
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,289
Speaker 1: I was having so much trouble with this truck.

653
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:15,310
Speaker 0: Like I couldn't get it out.

654
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:15,910
Speaker 1: Exit ramps.

655
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,290
Speaker 1: I ran over stuff like on the sidewalk.

656
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,030
Speaker 0: It was gigantic.

657
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,768
Speaker 0: I couldn't drive it.

658
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,389
Speaker 1: Like when you drove down that residential street in Rochester trying to get it out of the place.

659
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,730
Speaker 1: Like I was running over things.

660
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:26,389
Speaker 1: It was horrible.

661
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,168
Speaker 1: Eventually I get the stupid truck here like, ah, and we start to unpack it and we thought it'd take like an hour.

662
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,828
Speaker 1: It took us like five hours.

663
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:40,889
Speaker 1: If Pete hadn't skipped work the next day and hadn't stayed and loved all this stuff for us because Pete is a beast of a man.

664
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:42,310
Speaker 1: We would have died.

665
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,290
Speaker 1: Like the police would have found me and Scott under this couch dead.

666
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,469
Speaker 1: So Pete helps us move this couch in.

667
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,063
Speaker 1: This thing weighs, I don't know, 400 pounds.

668
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:53,730
Speaker 0: That's pretty close.

669
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,729
Speaker 1: It's got a steel frame.

670
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,870
Speaker 1: There's a whole queen size bed in here, but the whole thing is the steel frame.

671
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,909
Speaker 1: We had no way.

672
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,529
Speaker 1: There was no possible way we could get this thing in.

673
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,528
Speaker 1: Pete can barely get it in.

674
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:05,689
Speaker 1: We put a hole in the wall, bringing it in.

675
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:06,810
Speaker 1: We got it here.

676
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,890
Speaker 1: That wasn't actually a hole.

677
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,529
Speaker 1: I fixed it.

678
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,190
Speaker 1: Well, it was like this.

679
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:09,970
Speaker 0: Mark on the wall.

680
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,110
Speaker 0: I think I fixed it.

681
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,764
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I fixed it.

682
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,086
Speaker 1: You don't need a license to drive a 24 foot truck.

683
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,030
Speaker 1: It is the biggest truck you can drive in New York without having a commercial license.

684
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,789
Speaker 1: So I could legally drive it.

685
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,989
Speaker 1: Plus back then I think I still had a Michigan driver's license.

686
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,930
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

687
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:26,743
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,390
Speaker 1: Remember I didn't get a New York license until relatively recently.

689
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,189
Speaker 1: Remember I got pulled over with that expired Michigan plate from like four years ago.

690
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,268
Speaker 0: All right, let's see if this works.

691
00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:36,290
Speaker 0: All right.

692
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,150
Speaker 0: This is going to be hilarious.

693
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,750
Speaker 1: Well, do we have any way to tell?

694
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,769
Speaker 1: Because I think you only allowed.

695
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:41,849
Speaker 1: But didn't you only allow.

696
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:43,308
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

697
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,090
Speaker 1: Oh, you probably got rid of the access filter.

698
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:45,350
Speaker 1: Anyway.

699
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,708
Speaker 1: Let's see.

700
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,099
Speaker 0: All right.

701
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:48,170
Speaker 0: Just go to regular.

702
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:49,909
Speaker 1: I want to go to that.

703
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,950
Speaker 0: Remember, you're testing this website right now.

704
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,969
Speaker 0: I need, I need to know, Oh, by the way, feed burners probably going to stop working.

705
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,469
Speaker 0: We're going to need to sort something out with them.

706
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,609
Speaker 1: It'll start up again.

707
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,169
Speaker 1: Probably.

708
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,869
Speaker 0: All right.

709
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,281
Speaker 1: Loading.

710
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:04,570
Speaker 1: Waiting.

711
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,380
Speaker 1: Great.

712
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:07,109
Speaker 1: Loading.

713
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:09,269
Speaker 1: Still loading.

714
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:11,009
Speaker 1: Nothing's happening.

715
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:12,329
Speaker 0: That's pretty great.

716
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,669
Speaker 0: How about the, I'll check the shop.

717
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:21,870
Speaker 1: If the shop's fine, then you know that the, uh, what'd you do?

718
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:23,549
Speaker 0: I knew it wasn't going to work.

719
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,229
Speaker 1: Well, you keep working on it, I guess.

720
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:35,309
Speaker 1: So we finally get this couch in and Pete plops down on it and he looks at us and he says, I hereby dubbed this couch, the fucker may I rest in peace.

721
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:39,549
Speaker 1: And he told us that he would never help us move again for the rest of our lives.

722
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:41,446
Speaker 0: People are seeing it.

723
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,209
Speaker 1: Oh, they're seeing the website.

724
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,129
Speaker 0: Is he going slow?

725
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:46,190
Speaker 1: I can't see it still.

726
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,070
Speaker 0: I can't see it either.

727
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:50,488
Speaker 1: Are they just lying to us?

728
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,509
Speaker 0: Could be lying.

729
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,279
Speaker 1: Wait, did you load it?

730
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,188
Speaker 1: Because you had that rule that we could only get to it from here.

731
00:33:58,694 --> 00:33:59,149
Speaker 1: Then the beta.

732
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:00,850
Speaker 0: Oh, here it goes.

733
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,566
Speaker 0: No, I changed that up.

734
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:03,848
Speaker 1: Why won't it load for me?

735
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:04,729
Speaker 0: Oh, there it goes.

736
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:08,149
Speaker 0: I think it's just slow because we're sort of DDO S-ing it now.

737
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:13,705
Speaker 1: I'm going to, I'm going to spruce it up with, if only like a thousand people are hitting it.

738
00:34:13,972 --> 00:34:14,327
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

739
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,030
Speaker 0: I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, I still can't get to it.

740
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,868
Speaker 0: I'm going to power it up.

741
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:19,089
Speaker 0: Some I, you just have to wait.

742
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:21,549
Speaker 0: Don't touch anything.

743
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:22,416
Speaker 0: Yeah.

744
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,929
Speaker 1: We didn't write all the texts.

745
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,929
Speaker 1: A lot of that's in my court.

746
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:28,329
Speaker 0: There's a, there's a lot of things that rim a, I did all the work.

747
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,123
Speaker 1: Most of it.

748
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:29,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

749
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,510
Speaker 0: The design is by our friend cat.

750
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:32,728
Speaker 0: She did all the photo shops.

751
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,489
Speaker 0: I did all the HTMLs and the CSS and all that other business.

752
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,770
Speaker 1: I worked at a job and got money unrelated to this the whole time.

753
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,810
Speaker 0: So, you know, anything that's, you know, it's not a hundred percent done.

754
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:51,732
Speaker 1: It's like 90% done, but it's, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's ready to roll because I'm sick of the fact.

755
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:56,594
Speaker 1: like what really, I hate to call out anime world order cause I love those guys, but what really like?

756
00:34:56,614 --> 00:35:02,504
Speaker 1: the impetus for me to have this website and our e-commerce and everything was that, well, what do you mean?

757
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,790
Speaker 1: it's all web 2.0?

758
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,448
Speaker 1: I hate that term.

759
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,340
Speaker 0: Hate that term.

760
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,300
Speaker 1: It's not even really that web 2.0.

761
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,820
Speaker 1: Not really.

762
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,811
Speaker 1: Web 2.0 is, is not that, web 2.0 is like D.

763
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,100
Speaker 0: Oh wow, the forum is hurting too.

764
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,214
Speaker 0: Let me, uh, is there something going on with the, uh, let me check the CPU usage on the actual server.

765
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't, we never did a stress test or a regression test.

766
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,298
Speaker 0: We didn't do any sort of test.

767
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,299
Speaker 1: Well, you check that.

768
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:27,860
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

769
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:33,842
Speaker 1: But, uh, anime world order, you keep saying it's web 2.0.

770
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,120
Speaker 1: How is it web 2.0?

771
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:52,679
Speaker 1: Whoever just said that, I want you to post what web 2.0 means and then why you think this website is somehow web 2.0. because I don't think, you know, yes, interactivity, user generated content also, uh, not just interactivity, but interlinking between multiple things or it doesn't do any of that.

772
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,519
Speaker 1: It's just a blog.

773
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:56,560
Speaker 1: It just looks different from WordPress.

774
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,659
Speaker 0: It could look, WordPress could look like that.

775
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,700
Speaker 0: You can just make a theme for WordPress that looks like that.

776
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,840
Speaker 1: The only reason we didn't use WordPress was that it sucks to make WordPress do this and it was much better to use Django.

777
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

778
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,000
Speaker 0: Plus with Django we can do lots of specialized things.

779
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,960
Speaker 0: I'll tell you a secret.

780
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,140
Speaker 0: There is a thing of the day RSS feed.

781
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,539
Speaker 0: If you go to slash feeds slash T O T D. Let me type that into the chat room there.

782
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,507
Speaker 1: Sexy font does not equal web 2.0.

783
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:29,620
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, this font is not sexy.

784
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,799
Speaker 0: All these fonts and things are from Yahoo.

785
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,718
Speaker 0: I use the Yahoo.

786
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,299
Speaker 1: Suddenly the Twitter's exploding here.

787
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,999
Speaker 0: Is it really exploding now?

788
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,256
Speaker 1: I just suddenly got a whole bunch of, let me refresh this.

789
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,339
Speaker 0: That URL will take you to a feed of things today.

790
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:47,240
Speaker 1: It's not web 2.0.

791
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,380
Speaker 1: There are no reflections or lens flares.

792
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:52,560
Speaker 1: Two people made the same joke at the same time.

793
00:36:52,580 --> 00:37:00,640
Speaker 0: I like how some people think about 2.0 is about graphic design and other people think it's about, you know, Ajax and doing HTTP requests without refreshing the page.

794
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,439
Speaker 1: I think there's the difference between people who know about the front end and people who know about the back end.

795
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:15,805
Speaker 1: I mean like you can always tell the people who don't know about the back end and I can't blame anyone for not knowing about the back ends of these things, but if someone asks you to design a website, you can tell in five seconds if they know how websites work or not.

796
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:20,315
Speaker 1: If they give you a Photoshop picture and they're like, yeah, make my website look like that, then clearly they don't know.

797
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:25,019
Speaker 0: Okay, here, let me, let me try something here.

798
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:25,600
Speaker 1: All right.

799
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:26,398
Speaker 1: Checking stuff out.

800
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:26,954
Speaker 0: Yeah.

801
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,980
Speaker 0: I think we spawned too many Apache processes.

802
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:33,243
Speaker 1: Is that?

803
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,440
Speaker 1: maybe you need to optimize the spawning of Apache processes?

804
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:37,560
Speaker 0: That's what I'm going to do.

805
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,613
Speaker 0: I'm going to turn the website off.

806
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:40,816
Speaker 0: That's off.

807
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:43,319
Speaker 0: Ah, see, there's still some there.

808
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,398
Speaker 1: They got to clean those up.

809
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,122
Speaker 1: Oh, Apache 2.0.

810
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:49,697
Speaker 0: Those are, they're getting out of control even though I turned that shit off.

811
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:53,637
Speaker 1: This dead air.

812
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:54,898
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

813
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:55,677
Speaker 0: That's fine.

814
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:57,878
Speaker 0: This is what this is for.

815
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,679
Speaker 0: They're helping us out.

816
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,698
Speaker 1: They're helping us out.

817
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,239
Speaker 1: We probably should have done some sort of stress test.

818
00:38:03,562 --> 00:38:04,052
Speaker 0: No, it's all right.

819
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:06,979
Speaker 1: All I do is write a w get script.

820
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:10,340
Speaker 1: All right, let's go through this Twitter.

821
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's start.

822
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:18,940
Speaker 0: All right, so now we're going to start taking any comments or questions from anyone while I finish this business here.

823
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,259
Speaker 1: If one of you were to die, would the show go on?

824
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,255
Speaker 1: What if one of you were to die during recording?

825
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:39,658
Speaker 1: Well, if we were to die during recording, probably you'd be called a 911 and- I'd probably leave the recording going, but I would stop editing or muting, coughing or anything.

826
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:42,460
Speaker 1: You'd probably hear a lot of scary stuff going on in the background.

827
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd hear paramedics talking and- I don't know.

828
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,538
Speaker 1: I don't have a funny answer for that.

829
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:49,959
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,519
Speaker 0: What kind of question is that?

831
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,280
Speaker 1: If one of us died, if Scott died, I would keep doing Geek Nights.

832
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:05,779
Speaker 1: I would probably stop doing Geek Nights for a month or so while I sorted out Scott's affairs vis-a-vis me, because our affairs are actually pretty entwined at this point, what with Geek Nights and everything.

833
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,660
Speaker 1: But yeah, Geek Nights would continue.

834
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,660
Speaker 1: And honestly, I think Geek Nights will continue.

835
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:22,820
Speaker 1: Even if we moved, like I moved to Costa Rica, we would probably keep doing Geek Nights and Front Room Crew and all these things in some sort of form.

836
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:26,400
Speaker 1: Our internet presence will not die until both of us are dead.

837
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:38,599
Speaker 1: And if I can, I have this impression that if this stuff is continuing to the point where we're in our 70s, we will probably pass the mantle on to someone else.

838
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:47,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, there's just, you know, by the time we, you know, that's so far in the future, things won't even be the way they are now.

839
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,160
Speaker 1: Will you sell t-shirts on the store in the website?

840
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:51,619
Speaker 1: Yes!

841
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:52,959
Speaker 1: There's an e-commerce site.

842
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,960
Speaker 0: We haven't put them in yet.

843
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, RIM failed to put them there.

844
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,280
Speaker 1: I didn't finish setting up the e-commerce yet, but yes, you will be able to buy.

845
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:00,759
Speaker 1: The impetus for all that.

846
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,479
Speaker 1: So Anime World Order, they were like, "Yeah, we got hoodies.

847
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:06,397
Speaker 1: If you want to buy one, send us an

848
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:06,860
Speaker 1: email.".

849
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:10,699
Speaker 1: And at that moment, I said, "We are never going to do something like that.

850
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:13,538
Speaker 1: So I'm making this e-commerce be totally

851
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:13,860
Speaker 1: awesome.".

852
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,980
Speaker 1: No, if Scott died, I would not have sex with his corpse.

853
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,390
Speaker 1: Thank you, you streamer83613.

854
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,400
Speaker 0: I told you not to recognize the stupid questions.

855
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:25,319
Speaker 1: It was a question.

856
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:27,139
Speaker 1: It's a stupid question.

857
00:40:27,421 --> 00:40:28,856
Speaker 1: No, there were much stupider questions.

858
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:29,240
Speaker 1: I'm skipping.

859
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:29,874
Speaker 1: Really?

860
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,720
Speaker 0: I haven't been looking.

861
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,800
Speaker 0: I'm still trying to get the website out there.

862
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,758
Speaker 1: I'm going to keep an eye on that.

863
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:41,940
Speaker 1: But seriously, this is something that the internet hasn't had to deal with yet in any big form, but some day the people who do Penny Arcade are going to die.

864
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,539
Speaker 1: Some day.

865
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:50,819
Speaker 1: All the people who do these things that we read and love are going to either stop doing them or die and thus stop doing them.

866
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,460
Speaker 1: And I have yet to see any internet thing deal with that effectively yet.

867
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,138
Speaker 1: I feel like we will deal with it.

868
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:00,519
Speaker 1: I don't know what Penny Arcade will do.

869
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,377
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

870
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:02,879
Speaker 1: I think Mega Tokyo will just stop.

871
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,959
Speaker 1: I think it will stop long before Fred Gallagher dies.

872
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:16,317
Speaker 1: Plus, 80 years from now, what was going on in the world, well, I guess 60 years ago because we're not zero, what was going on in the world 60 years ago?

873
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,159
Speaker 1: World War I was going on!

874
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:23,480
Speaker 0: The world is going to change a lot by then.

875
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,599
Speaker 0: Actually, World War I was more than 60 years ago.

876
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not that.

877
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,539
Speaker 0: Actually, World War II was more than 60 years ago.

878
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:29,718
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.

879
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:30,540
Speaker 1: I guess you're right.

880
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:31,678
Speaker 0: Yes, I am right.

881
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:32,840
Speaker 0: Mr.

882
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:36,175
Speaker 0: "Oh, you're yelling at me for not knowing histories, look who doesn't

883
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:36,396
Speaker 0: know.".

884
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:40,539
Speaker 0: I'm going to reboot the whole line node.

885
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,319
Speaker 1: Whole line node?

886
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,859
Speaker 1: Oh, snap.

887
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,299
Speaker 0: Rebooting the whole thing.

888
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,380
Speaker 1: But anyway, yes, we will try to keep, geek nights will be passed on to someone most likely.

889
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,817
Speaker 1: So it will probably go on forever and the front row crew will eventually have new people I guess.

890
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,679
Speaker 1: Maybe the children of all the people in the front row crew now.

891
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:57,992
Speaker 0: Who knows?

892
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,639
Speaker 0: There's got to be, you know.

893
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:07,872
Speaker 0: I mean, if we build a brand that has value, why would the brand ever, you know, stop being used?

894
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:08,674
Speaker 0: You know?

895
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,040
Speaker 0: If it's a valuable brand, why would people, you know?

896
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:14,919
Speaker 0: Henry Ford isn't there, but the Ford Motor Company is.

897
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,120
Speaker 0: So the only way that geek nights would go away is if the brand loses all value and no one wants to keep it around.

898
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,217
Speaker 1: So your mom just said, "Do you remember World War

899
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:23,278
Speaker 1: II?".

900
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:41,700
Speaker 1: And the Katsucon where I met Daryl Surratt, I hadn't been drunk at the time, but me and Scott Johnson and Lara and a bunch of other people got stinking drunk and we were hanging out at this con and we had one of those everyone's drunk conversations.

901
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,097
Speaker 1: And someone asked, "Do you remember World War

902
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:46,177
Speaker 1: II?".

903
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,259
Speaker 1: Like you know, that war?

904
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,680
Speaker 1: And the conversation that spawned from that was one of those, one of the most epic conversations ever, much like the Barry argument.

905
00:42:57,502 --> 00:42:59,140
Speaker 1: Sadly, we never get drunk at cons anymore.

906
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,180
Speaker 1: Well, Scott never got drunk, but I'm always busy at conventions now doing geek nights.

907
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,199
Speaker 1: I haven't gotten drunk at a con in a long time, but I guess I never will again.

908
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:16,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have a question that you actually want to get answered, you're going to have to tweet it to us because the chat room's scrolling by too fast for me to really see everything in there.

909
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:21,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, tweet to @geeknights, you know, it doesn't matter if Geek Nights is following you or not.

910
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:22,159
Speaker 0: We'll see it.

911
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,640
Speaker 0: You can also suffice to say us.

912
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,367
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea, you know, since we have suffice to say, oh wait, but it's not up.

913
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:30,472
Speaker 1: No.

914
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,460
Speaker 0: Forget about suffice to say.

915
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:33,478
Speaker 1: Forget about that.

916
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,119
Speaker 1: I guess you can send an email or a chat to geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

917
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,179
Speaker 1: I'm kind of watching that.

918
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:38,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

919
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:41,079
Speaker 0: This will be ready in a second, I think.

920
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,460
Speaker 1: So beyond D&D, great minds think alike, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the same few people keep tweeting over and over again here.

921
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,236
Speaker 1: No one else is.

922
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,859
Speaker 0: Probably because those are the Tweety people.

923
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not Tweety.

924
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,258
Speaker 1: I've never used TweetDeck until just now.

925
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,158
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of, I like it.

926
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,398
Speaker 1: I'll probably start using it.

927
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just, all right, now the website is working and fast.

928
00:43:59,002 --> 00:43:59,539
Speaker 1: Not bad.

929
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:06,132
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess people can hear the new message alert that keeps popping up every now and then.

930
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:06,557
Speaker 1: Yeah.

931
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,499
Speaker 1: You're not hearing all of them because I'm kind of suppressing a lot of these.

932
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:15,200
Speaker 1: Once I got an email like Carl Horn, blah, blah, blah, that's not a question.

933
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:16,539
Speaker 1: That's not a question.

934
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:21,100
Speaker 0: That doesn't have to be a question, it could just be a comment that elicits a response.

935
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,520
Speaker 1: That has a question mark, but it is not a question, nor is it interesting.

936
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:26,819
Speaker 1: Oh, they're starting to chat me.

937
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,439
Speaker 1: Here we go.

938
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,879
Speaker 0: Is the website starting to be slow?

939
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:29,855
Speaker 1: Rym?

940
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:31,579
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm here.

941
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,169
Speaker 1: I will respond back, in fact.

942
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,950
Speaker 1: So someone asked the question, what is strategy?

943
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,144
Speaker 1: Because apparently, you know, on the show last night, we kept talking about games we wanted.

944
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:51,648
Speaker 1: And I think we mentioned, as we always do, strategy and tactics, that we want games that have these sorts of things.

945
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:59,750
Speaker 1: Strategy has different meanings depending on whether you're looking at the colloquial meaning, the game theory meaning, the military meaning.

946
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:15,770
Speaker 1: Like I remember Bruce and I had a long conversation over New Year's about how like, in the military, strategy or strategic means the theater, like you've got a war, like say World War Two, there was the Asian theater, or the Pacific theater, and there was the European theater.

947
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:29,990
Speaker 1: So strategy is the kind of overarching plan, or you know, how you're dealing with the entire theater of war, like the strategy of World War Two in Europe was all of Europe combined, like.

948
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:37,150
Speaker 1: that is strategy, or like, now strategic often means global thermonuclear war, those sorts of things, that level of strategic thought.

949
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:41,830
Speaker 1: In game theory, strategy means you are not making decisions anymore.

950
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:53,969
Speaker 1: A strategy is you have an expert system, you have a specific plan, you know for every situation that can occur in the game, what your reaction will be, and what your reaction will be to all the reactions to that action.

951
00:45:54,951 --> 00:46:00,946
Speaker 1: So if you have a strategy in a game, that means that you don't need to be there anymore, you are no longer making decisions at this point.

952
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:04,594
Speaker 1: Colloquially,

953
00:46:04,654 --> 00:46:04,775
Speaker 0: and

954
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:20,669
Speaker 1: what most board game people will say, a strategy is simply, this is my plan going forward, like I'm thinking, here are the next ten moves I'm going to make, as opposed to, you know, someone else makes a move, how do I react to that, I'm thinking about this right now, or someone surprised me, I don't know what to do.

955
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:21,810
Speaker 1: That is tactics.

956
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:26,949
Speaker 1: I don't want to go into more detail, I don't want to talk about math, I mean.

957
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:36,070
Speaker 0: Alright, the site seems to be working for me, and is relatively fast, so.

958
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,769
Speaker 1: I like our website to be honest, so poke it, try to break it, let us know what works and what doesn't.

959
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:49,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, find if there's something wrong with it, tell me if there's something missing, tell me if there's a missing episode, you know, anything like that.

960
00:46:49,750 --> 00:47:02,269
Speaker 1: So I guess as long as Scott is not working 9-5, he can make updates to this pretty readily, so make your suggestions now, once Scott is working 9-5 again, then it's not going to happen anymore.

961
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:11,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but actually because the site isn't WordPress anymore, it's actually a lot easier to do things than it would have been, so awesomeness all around.

962
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,459
Speaker 0: So one thing, someone asked the question, I want to point out, how do you tweet someone?

963
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:27,560
Speaker 0: Go to Twitter.com, sign up, and then do @geeknights, and then whatever you want to say.

964
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:38,809
Speaker 1: I would say more honestly, it seems like there are people who use Twitter, and people who don't use Twitter.

965
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:47,709
Speaker 1: And the differentiation between these people is this crazy gulf, and I don't know which side is better to be on.

966
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:52,809
Speaker 1: But it amazes me how many people just like, I have no idea what Twitter is to this day.

967
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then there are other people who are like using it, but they don't get it.

968
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,429
Speaker 0: But then there are other people that get it and don't use it, and then there are other people that think they get it and don't use it.

969
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,749
Speaker 1: Then there are the people who just literally live on Twitter.

970
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

971
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,430
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if you want to say anything, but someone asked a really interesting question.

972
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,550
Speaker 1: Uh, considering your belief that the front row crew might continue through its children, would you call the front row crew a guild?

973
00:48:16,552 --> 00:48:20,090
Speaker 1: Because a long time ago- A guild is specifically an economic construct.

974
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,250
Speaker 1: Well, again, you know, economic definition, colloquial definition.

975
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,490
Speaker 1: But Scott actually had a good answer for this.

976
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,469
Speaker 1: Remember when someone asked, "How can I join the front row

977
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:28,650
Speaker 1: crew?"

978
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,084
Speaker 1: Didn't you say that that's like asking, "How can I join the

979
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:31,426
Speaker 1: Rubins?".

980
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:32,988
Speaker 0: Eh, something like that.

981
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,970
Speaker 1: Uh, the front row crew is a family.

982
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,170
Speaker 1: I mean, it's at the point where literally we are a family.

983
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,869
Speaker 1: Like, we are closer than a lot of families I've seen are.

984
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,070
Speaker 0: Or what did Emily's mom say?

985
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:43,690
Speaker 0: A tribe?

986
00:48:43,974 --> 00:48:44,228
Speaker 1: A tribe.

987
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,068
Speaker 1: Well, there was an article in the New Yorker about that, I think, about how there's this new-

988
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:48,871
Speaker 0: It's not

989
00:48:48,971 --> 00:49:13,790
Speaker 1: new in the scheme of humanity, but it's new in America that people seem to be forming these kind of- Instead of, like, nuclear family or extended family or friend groups, there are these tribes of, like, twenty-something people who maybe went to college together or know each other in some sort of form and decided to- Like, they have a relationship that is well beyond friendship and is definitely on the level of family.

990
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:15,870
Speaker 1: But it's a self-selected family.

991
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,729
Speaker 1: It's literally a tribe.

992
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,710
Speaker 1: And this is really occurring more and more in urban culture.

993
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:26,010
Speaker 1: Like, in cities, there are tribes of twenty-something hit people getting together.

994
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:31,030
Speaker 1: And she pointed out that the front row crew basically is straight up a tribe.

995
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,370
Speaker 1: Like, by all the definitions that they have of tribe.

996
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,390
Speaker 1: And it's- I don't know what I can say.

997
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:39,164
Speaker 1: It's- We are a tribe.

998
00:49:39,205 --> 00:49:39,870
Speaker 1: We are a family.

999
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:43,150
Speaker 1: Front row crew is almost a surname at this point.

1000
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:46,048
Speaker 1: So a lot of you ask us all the time, "How can I join the front row

1001
00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:46,290
Speaker 1: crew?"

1002
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:49,407
Speaker 1: And that is literally, like, asking, "How do I join the

1003
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:49,890
Speaker 1: decosters?".

1004
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can join the front row crew fan club.

1005
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:52,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1006
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,128
Speaker 0: You can join that.

1007
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,809
Speaker 1: But to join the front row crew, short of marrying in- And even that is not a guarantee.

1008
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,370
Speaker 1: If you marry someone in the front row crew, that's just not me.

1009
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,610
Speaker 0: There have been many, uh- You know, there's been a lot of people who have, you know, sort of come and gone, you know?

1010
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,890
Speaker 0: And some people have come and stayed for quite a long time, and they're still gone.

1011
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,749
Speaker 0: I mean, there were people that were here for, like, years.

1012
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:14,710
Speaker 1: And then they went, and we don't even talk to them anymore.

1013
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,010
Speaker 1: There's really only one person who left the front row crew, though.

1014
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:22,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there were, you know, there's people who become, you know- You know you have friends, and then you have acquaintances.

1015
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,569
Speaker 0: They're just, like, people you know, but you don't really hang out with them, right?

1016
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:27,750
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of people like that, you know?

1017
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:32,169
Speaker 0: They sort of come in, and we hang out with them a bunch, and we know who they are.

1018
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:36,730
Speaker 0: But we don't really, you know, we're not, like, you know, with them a whole bunch.

1019
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:43,010
Speaker 1: But it's interesting how the crew has- It's, like, there are people who are friends of, or acquaintances of, the crew.

1020
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:45,370
Speaker 1: As opposed to of any one of us in particular.

1021
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:45,811
Speaker 0: Yup.

1022
00:50:46,132 --> 00:50:52,610
Speaker 0: It's also interesting to see when, like, there'd be people that were both really close- You know, were really close to, like, these two people, but they've never met each other.

1023
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we had a few people like that, like, out- Or also we had- Like, on New Year's, like, we had people coming.

1024
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,230
Speaker 0: It was, like, best friend and other best friend both show up on New Year's.

1025
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:01,870
Speaker 0: They never met each other in their whole lives.

1026
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:13,610
Speaker 1: Well, part of that, for the longest time in the world, there was this kind of problem where Scott- Like, the original front row crew, the original, original, original core front row crew was, like, six or seven people.

1027
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:21,510
Speaker 1: It was, like, me and Scott, and Alex, and Pete, and Katsu, and, like, all these people at RIT who, like, became friends at this club.

1028
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:29,070
Speaker 1: And then we started spreading, and we had all these different people around, but Scott's typing someone up there, so I can't see the chat anymore, but that's fine.

1029
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:38,470
Speaker 1: So, it, the, like, the crew, I forgot where I was going with this, to be honest, but the crew, like, founded itself as one thing, and then it grew into other things.

1030
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,529
Speaker 1: I kept trying to talk, I forgot where I was going with it.

1031
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:44,310
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it, let's see what people are saying here.

1032
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to avoid becoming just the show about the front row crew.

1033
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:51,110
Speaker 0: Right here, well, you and Scott are going to split a pizza, what is on it?

1034
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,069
Speaker 1: Scott hates everything I like on pizza.

1035
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,650
Speaker 1: Well, that's 'cause you only like the really bad shit.

1036
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,997
Speaker 1: You know what, I like Hawaiian pizza.

1037
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,290
Speaker 1: I like sausage on a pizza.

1038
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:00,290
Speaker 0: I don't like sausage.

1039
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:01,890
Speaker 0: I like mushrooms, you like mushrooms?

1040
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:02,753
Speaker 1: Mushrooms are fine.

1041
00:52:02,934 --> 00:52:05,550
Speaker 0: See, I only don't like fruits.

1042
00:52:06,051 --> 00:52:06,527
Speaker 1: I like fruits.

1043
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,206
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, like, a tomato, I guess, technically a fruit, but we're talking about, you know, like, pineapple, no good.

1044
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:13,210
Speaker 1: I don't like ham.

1045
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,350
Speaker 1: Pineapple is key, I agree.

1046
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,933
Speaker 0: No, and I don't like sausage, right?

1047
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:25,090
Speaker 0: But anything else, I mean, you could put the meatball, the chicken, the pepperoni, the mushrooms, the peppers, the onion, any, you know, ten kinds of cheese, right?

1048
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:28,970
Speaker 0: As long as it's not pineapple, ham, or sausage, everything else is awesome.

1049
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,190
Speaker 0: Well, I guess anchovies are a little bit eh.

1050
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,123
Speaker 0: Honestly, I don't hate anchovies, but I don't seek them out.

1051
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:49,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, and I mean, the thing is, you know, depending, like, it's weird, because actually the sort of, like, the bad sausage actually tastes less like sausage, so it's a little more tolerable, right, for me?

1052
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:57,670
Speaker 0: And I'll eat a pizza that has, like, the bad sausage, but if it has, like, like, awesome sausage, what other people would consider to be, like, awesome sausage, like, I would not eat it because it's too sausage.

1053
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,258
Speaker 0: But then again, part of, like, you don't like ham either.

1054
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:01,730
Speaker 1: It's not like you avoid it for religious reasons.

1055
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,452
Speaker 0: No, are you kidding?

1056
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:03,577
Speaker 0: I eat mad bacons.

1057
00:53:03,858 --> 00:53:05,304
Speaker 1: I eat mad, uh, I eat pork fried rice.

1058
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:15,950
Speaker 1: You didn't grow up eating ham, so ham is a taste that, I guess, if you're not, I've noticed people who didn't eat ham when they were young don't like, like, a glazed ham.

1059
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:29,410
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I mean, it's like anyone who didn't, you know, usually you develop taste when you're young and it's like, you know, people who don't eat a lot of fish when they're young don't like fish later, even if they're, you know, open to eating it.

1060
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,519
Speaker 0: You know, they'll just like, oh, I'll try fish.

1061
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,323
Speaker 0: I'm an adult now.

1062
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:33,690
Speaker 0: I didn't eat it when I was a kid, right?

1063
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:43,430
Speaker 0: Very rarely will they like it just because the connections in their brain have lined up to where it's, these taste good, these taste bad, right?

1064
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:51,210
Speaker 0: So a new, if it's, you know, a fish taste comes in and it's lined up to bad, your brain has to rearrange to, you know, to make it taste good to you.

1065
00:53:52,392 --> 00:54:03,910
Speaker 1: Ah, but the issue we had, just so I can finish this thought before I lose it, people were, you know, with the front row crew, the problem we had was that Scott and I, because our apartment was the hangout apartment because we had furniture.

1066
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:13,230
Speaker 1: That was really the only, it's weird how these small things like become like into these bigger things later, but literally Scott and I were the only people who had furniture in our apartment for a long time.

1067
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,777
Speaker 1: So the whole front row crew would always hang out in our apartment.

1068
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:22,710
Speaker 1: So like we were the center of the front row crew, like social scene at RIT for a long time.

1069
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:28,310
Speaker 1: And then eventually James saved us because he started having parties at his place and then we had parties at Capstone.

1070
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:34,847
Speaker 1: But as a result, there were a lot of people in the crew who only knew us and didn't know anyone else in the crew for a long time.

1071
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:36,070
Speaker 0: It was really weird.

1072
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,372
Speaker 0: It was, it was kind of weird.

1073
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:40,218
Speaker 0: Someone asked if we're ever going to return or change the show.

1074
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:46,270
Speaker 0: They said, we're going to, if we're going to change the show schedule again or change the show schedule format.

1075
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:46,470
Speaker 0: Right.

1076
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,922
Speaker 0: So it's not a specific question of, are we going to go back to four shows?

1077
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:52,270
Speaker 0: Is it, is it going to be two shows forever?

1078
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,638
Speaker 0: And I think most likely it's not going to be two shows forever.

1079
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:58,926
Speaker 0: We're going to, you know, geek nights has been, you know, it's the internets.

1080
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,410
Speaker 0: We can do whatever we want.

1081
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:06,298
Speaker 0: So, you know, uh, part of the plan is, you know, it's going to keep changing forever.

1082
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:07,860
Speaker 0: It's going to change with the world.

1083
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:14,550
Speaker 0: You know, if we suddenly, you know, I mean right now, video and audio or on the internets is, is what comes along.

1084
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:26,270
Speaker 0: But you know, if people start getting like VR broadcasters or something, well, we're going to keep moving forward and changing things as our lives change and as technology change and as the world changes.

1085
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,037
Speaker 0: So most likely geek nights is not going to stay the same forever.

1086
00:55:31,238 --> 00:55:39,250
Speaker 1: There's no way, but we're, we definitely plan to keep the radio show because I feel like audio only content needs to exist forever.

1087
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:46,505
Speaker 1: And I want to, even if like it dies completely, I want to be one of those people who just like holds onto it and make sure it exists in some form forever.

1088
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:48,289
Speaker 1: But I think there are other people like that too.

1089
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:48,910
Speaker 1: I'm not too worried.

1090
00:55:49,631 --> 00:55:49,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1091
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,958
Speaker 0: So someone asks, you know, why did we change it to two shows a week?

1092
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:55,924
Speaker 0: I've noticed there've been a few questions that have come up in here.

1093
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,730
Speaker 0: that were questions that are answered in episodes.

1094
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,136
Speaker 0: And it's really strange because someone here says, why are PCFPS far superior to console FPS?

1095
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:04,718
Speaker 0: We did a whole show on that, right?

1096
00:56:04,758 --> 00:56:12,830
Speaker 0: So wait a second though, by asking that question, that means this person knows we think PCFPS are superior.

1097
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:14,874
Speaker 0: If they know that we think PCFPS are superior.

1098
00:56:14,894 --> 00:56:15,996
Speaker 1: Well it's not hard to know that.

1099
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:17,520
Speaker 1: We say that like every episode.

1100
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:17,961
Speaker 1: Right.

1101
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:20,586
Speaker 1: Like I start every episode with, wow sucks.

1102
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:22,570
Speaker 0: That means that they're, that means that they're listening.

1103
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,172
Speaker 0: So shouldn't they have listened to the one where we said why?

1104
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:29,877
Speaker 0: I mean, we said, you know, but someone over there is like, why did you change it to two episodes a week?

1105
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:33,120
Speaker 0: Did you not listen to the episode where we talked about changing it to two shows a week?

1106
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,115
Speaker 1: When we lived here, we watched like four movies a week.

1107
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,599
Speaker 1: that just stopped happening with geek nights.

1108
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,921
Speaker 1: But that wasn't the reason we switched.

1109
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:52,726
Speaker 1: The reason was I loved Penn radio.

1110
00:56:53,487 --> 00:56:54,448
Speaker 1: It was like the best thing ever.

1111
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:55,490
Speaker 0: And Scott loved Penn radio.

1112
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:56,291
Speaker 0: And radio was good.

1113
00:56:56,411 --> 00:57:08,110
Speaker 1: And after when it started repeating itself, it was, yeah, but after like you get listener fatigue and I remember it got to the point where I listened to Penn radio every day and then it got like, I started not liking it even though the content was great.

1114
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,398
Speaker 1: I just couldn't, it was like, it started grading on me.

1115
00:57:11,418 --> 00:57:14,164
Speaker 1: Kind of like if you listen to the same song over and over again, it starts grading to you.

1116
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,610
Speaker 1: Geek nights has this kind of specific format.

1117
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:25,310
Speaker 1: And if you listen to us every weeknight for a year, you're going to start getting rim and Scott fatigue and I would get rim and Scott fatigue.

1118
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,819
Speaker 1: So we wanted to keep the show high energy, wanted to keep the show good.

1119
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,490
Speaker 1: And I felt like if we kept doing four nights a week, the show was going to get tiresome and it would have died in the end.

1120
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:46,285
Speaker 0: It also really helped that, you know, when we came, you know, when we were all tired doing the show after work, the show was, we didn't feel that the show was as great as it was.

1121
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:49,710
Speaker 0: when, uh, you know, we were really excited about doing the show.

1122
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:55,830
Speaker 0: And we also, you know, we sort of used up all our ideas and we're really, we're really scratching for ideas now even.

1123
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:04,087
Speaker 1: Plus there were shows where we would be like so tired that we both had nothing and we'd argue for like an hour before the show about just stupid crap because we were so tired.

1124
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:05,630
Speaker 1: Neither one of us actually wanted to do it.

1125
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,090
Speaker 0: Yep.

1126
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:08,800
Speaker 0: So yeah, so we're getting better shows.

1127
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,490
Speaker 0: We're using up our ideas more slowly.

1128
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,784
Speaker 1: Plus the website didn't come to fruition because Scott lost his job.

1129
00:58:15,864 --> 00:58:17,530
Speaker 0: It was pretty much like we were on our way.

1130
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:22,440
Speaker 0: This website actually was designed a year ago at, uh, we, we started working on it.

1131
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,849
Speaker 0: February of oh eight is when we actually really, really started working on it.

1132
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:36,749
Speaker 0: So, you know, I just sort of had it done for quite a, you know, mostly done for quite a while and it still needs a little bit more polishing, you know?

1133
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,150
Speaker 1: Yep.

1134
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,653
Speaker 0: But a theory shadow, someone's a spamming in there.

1135
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:40,034
Speaker 1: Check that out.

1136
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,015
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people spamming.

1137
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:52,910
Speaker 1: I've been, I've been not saying anything about it, but I'm, I'm proud that enough people have decided that they, they not only know about geek nights, but they want to come in and like just shit cock all over this.

1138
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,615
Speaker 1: I'm kind of, I don't know, I'm more flattered by that than I am angry.

1139
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:56,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1140
00:58:56,935 --> 00:58:59,219
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't care if they spam this stupid chat room.

1141
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:05,670
Speaker 1: It doesn't bother me, but it's, it's sort of interesting that this is so important that it's, I want to give some props to a theory shadow in the forum.

1142
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:14,342
Speaker 1: Because when I, you know, I moved out of colony at RIT for like six months to work at IBM and I just kept paying right at that time and Scott kind of lived there alone.

1143
00:59:14,362 --> 00:59:16,445
Speaker 1: And then I moved back and went to school for a year.

1144
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:19,630
Speaker 1: Then I moved out for good and I lived out here working for IBM.

1145
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,338
Speaker 0: But I was still at school for a few more, two more semesters, I think.

1146
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,943
Speaker 1: Oh, geek nights live is apparently on the front page of Ustream right now.

1147
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:26,745
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1148
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:27,627
Speaker 0: Way to go.

1149
00:59:27,827 --> 00:59:28,769
Speaker 0: Let's get some attention people.

1150
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:29,471
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1151
00:59:29,491 --> 00:59:34,281
Speaker 1: But anyway, so we had our friend Kevin who was like, he was one of the friends of the front row crew.

1152
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,363
Speaker 1: Like we got with him a lot.

1153
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:39,030
Speaker 1: He was, we met all these freshmen at RIT one year and they were all awesome.

1154
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,275
Speaker 1: So we had like this cadre of awesome freshmen we were hanging out with.

1155
00:59:42,736 --> 00:59:44,099
Speaker 1: We were playing like D and D with them.

1156
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:45,661
Speaker 1: We ran this awful D and D game.

1157
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:46,463
Speaker 0: Remember that?

1158
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,005
Speaker 0: That was like the worst D and D game.

1159
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:49,027
Speaker 0: Which one was the awful one?

1160
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:50,590
Speaker 1: The one where it was a pirate game.

1161
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,934
Speaker 0: Oh, see that one, see that one could have actually been good.

1162
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:55,819
Speaker 0: The problem is, is that we, we had so many players, right.

1163
00:59:55,999 --> 01:00:01,528
Speaker 0: That we sort of split up the GMing and like I would plan a little bit, but you were just sort of like, eh, off the cut, whatever.

1164
01:00:01,628 --> 01:00:02,830
Speaker 1: And it was totally conflicting.

1165
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:07,118
Speaker 0: And when like, it was just like, uh, at a certain point and they're just like, oh, fuck.

1166
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:10,023
Speaker 1: Plus we're always distracted by like Carla and all the people at our WAG.

1167
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:13,870
Speaker 1: And we all, it was crazy, but Kevin was this cool guy and we lived with him.

1168
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,212
Speaker 1: Well, Scott lived with him in a colony.

1169
01:00:16,252 --> 01:00:20,977
Speaker 1: He basically moved in with Scott, left all the furniture there and I moved away.

1170
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:27,183
Speaker 1: And he pointed out that we, we have the loveseat from when we lived there.

1171
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:29,686
Speaker 1: We left the couch because it was disgusting.

1172
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,287
Speaker 1: It was white when we bought it.

1173
01:00:31,387 --> 01:00:33,750
Speaker 1: It was not white by the time we moved out.

1174
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:39,678
Speaker 0: Kevin pointed out, there's the, so I can't, I'm going to move the camera cause it'll take a while to get it back in position.

1175
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:44,766
Speaker 1: Kevin pointed out that they totally destroyed that couch with fire.

1176
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:45,387
Speaker 1: And you know what?

1177
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:47,530
Speaker 1: That was the only solution to that couch.

1178
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,793
Speaker 0: That was really, it was the only solution to that couch.

1179
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,895
Speaker 0: That couch was awful.

1180
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:55,039
Speaker 0: Oh, there's actually a somewhat serious question.

1181
01:00:55,099 --> 01:01:00,306
Speaker 0: He said with Easter fast approaching many atheists have families which celebrate it religiously.

1182
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:03,070
Speaker 0: Would it be hypocritical for an atheist to join the festivities?

1183
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,411
Speaker 0: I celebrate Christmas.

1184
01:01:04,692 --> 01:01:05,692
Speaker 1: I celebrate Hanukkah.

1185
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:09,556
Speaker 0: I celebrate, you know, what's wrong with celebrating a holiday?

1186
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:22,629
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just, you know, what's, I mean, are you Catholic if you celebrate, uh, St Patrick's day by, you know, I mean, what if someone is Irish and atheist and on St Patrick's day, they get drunk and eat the corn beef and cabbage and a green bagel.

1187
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,030
Speaker 0: Is there something wrong with that?

1188
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:27,854
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, that doesn't imply any irrational beliefs.

1189
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,135
Speaker 0: It's not hurting anyone.

1190
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:43,328
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's nothing wrong with, you know, ritualistic behavior as long as you recognize what you're doing and you know, you don't, uh, you know, let it become dogmatic and such, you know, I mean, it's, it's fun to do a lot of these things.

1191
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:45,050
Speaker 0: That's why people do them, you know?

1192
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,692
Speaker 1: Well, like Loganator pointed out, it's like being a Jew in culture only.

1193
01:01:47,732 --> 01:01:56,538
Speaker 1: I mean, you look at a lot of surveys and a lot of people who are Jewish ethnically or culturally, a lot of the younger ones at least, are not religiously Jewish, but they still keep the culture.

1194
01:01:56,698 --> 01:02:02,542
Speaker 1: And I know a lot of people who are atheists, but they keep the Catholic culture and they still are active in the church because they have friends there.

1195
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:18,498
Speaker 0: And making share ornaments and you can all share and have a good time putting presents under the tree.

1196
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:19,560
Speaker 0: Does that hurt anyone?

1197
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,630
Speaker 0: Does that have any, you know, I mean, it's tied to a religious thing originally kind of, but who gets it?

1198
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:33,521
Speaker 1: I guess the only as an atheist, you know, just the only thing that ever bothers me, the only thing hypocritical one is if you say you believe when you really don't.

1199
01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:37,327
Speaker 1: And I, that's the only thing that's hypocritical.

1200
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:38,008
Speaker 1: What else can I say?

1201
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,610
Speaker 0: Celebrate whatever holidays you want.

1202
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:40,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1203
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,091
Speaker 0: Do you make up your own?

1204
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:54,223
Speaker 1: You can celebrate, you know, I mean, I've been, I've been to church several times in my life and the only thing I do is I don't kneel and stand and sit and pray because I don't believe any of that stuff, but I still attend and I'm polite.

1205
01:02:54,243 --> 01:02:57,386
Speaker 1: and I do, you know, actually I kind of like Catholic masses.

1206
01:02:57,466 --> 01:02:59,989
Speaker 1: I think they're cool because one, I went to a parochial school.

1207
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:01,250
Speaker 1: It was all Latin mass.

1208
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:08,548
Speaker 0: I mean, go to like a Reform Jewish temple, not an Orthodox one, go to Reform one.

1209
01:03:08,848 --> 01:03:09,510
Speaker 0: You going somewhere?

1210
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,307
Speaker 1: I need a little more wine.

1211
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,873
Speaker 0: And it's a fun time.

1212
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:17,400
Speaker 0: They sing fun songs and do fun dances and all that sort of stuff.

1213
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,323
Speaker 0: You know, it's good times.

1214
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:22,929
Speaker 0: All right, let's, let's look for something else for people to talk to.

1215
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:26,019
Speaker 1: You can handle this for a bit.

1216
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,450
Speaker 1: I've been staring at these chats for a while.

1217
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:27,954
Speaker 0: Wow.

1218
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:29,310
Speaker 0: People are basically saying nothing.

1219
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:32,049
Speaker 1: Well, there's been a lot of shit cockery going on in that forum.

1220
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,996
Speaker 0: Oh, the stream is down.

1221
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:35,041
Speaker 0: Internet's broke.

1222
01:03:35,162 --> 01:03:36,810
Speaker 0: Something, something people are saying.

1223
01:03:37,092 --> 01:03:37,809
Speaker 0: How is the stream down?

1224
01:03:38,171 --> 01:03:38,537
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1225
01:03:38,578 --> 01:03:39,269
Speaker 0: I'm going to take a look.

1226
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,268
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything.

1227
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,795
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything either.

1228
01:03:41,816 --> 01:03:43,885
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess it is down.

1229
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:44,207
Speaker 0: Wow.

1230
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:44,910
Speaker 0: Something happened.

1231
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,838
Speaker 1: We'll bring it back up momentarily, even if we have to start a new one.

1232
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like a lot of people dropped the chat as soon as Easter came up.

1233
01:03:57,586 --> 01:03:58,430
Speaker 1: That's really interesting.

1234
01:04:00,071 --> 01:04:01,168
Speaker 0: Oh, I think it's working again.

1235
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:03,957
Speaker 1: Might have been an internet blip on our end.

1236
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:07,770
Speaker 1: I don't think it was on our end because we have a pretty sophisticated network in this house, actually.

1237
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,366
Speaker 1: So how's it going?

1238
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:15,252
Speaker 1: Is it working?

1239
01:04:15,453 --> 01:04:16,440
Speaker 1: No, no, it's not updating.

1240
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:17,604
Speaker 0: It's not.

1241
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:18,580
Speaker 1: Oh, now it's updating.

1242
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:23,848
Speaker 0: OK, it's working again.

1243
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:24,229
Speaker 0: That's good.

1244
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:24,570
Speaker 0: All right.

1245
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:25,491
Speaker 0: Wow.

1246
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:26,152
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

1247
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:33,210
Speaker 0: You can see like these people coming in from like the front page of Ustream saying like these really horrible things.

1248
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:34,120
Speaker 0: It's like what, you know.

1249
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:34,626
Speaker 1: Wow.

1250
01:04:35,492 --> 01:04:35,975
Speaker 0: Look at that.

1251
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:37,770
Speaker 1: It tells you a lot about the Internet.

1252
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,325
Speaker 1: It's like as soon, well, kind of like.

1253
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:39,710
Speaker 0: look at you.

1254
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:43,247
Speaker 0: It's like you got 100 listeners, but then there's like this fluctuating number of...

1255
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:44,732
Speaker 1: It's weird.

1256
01:04:45,474 --> 01:04:47,421
Speaker 1: I think what really illustrates it is YouTube comments.

1257
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:53,309
Speaker 1: Like how come YouTube comments like they're... Who is posting YouTube comments?

1258
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:58,090
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I filled my wine glass while the stream was down, so it came back and my wine glass was full.

1259
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:59,609
Speaker 0: Oh, we should have done it on purpose.

1260
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:03,490
Speaker 1: That was... Oh, well.

1261
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:03,891
Speaker 1: Wow.

1262
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:09,888
Speaker 1: That's amazing, though, that... Who are all these people on the Internet who are just like...

1263
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,378
Speaker 0: They really have nothing better to do?

1264
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,887
Speaker 0: I mean, go play a video game.

1265
01:05:12,947 --> 01:05:13,410
Speaker 0: Seriously.

1266
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:17,806
Speaker 0: That's... Instead of, you know, posting racial slurs in some random chat room.

1267
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:18,570
Speaker 1: Not that I care.

1268
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're probably going to want to tweet us or chat us or something.

1269
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:24,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at the chat.

1270
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:27,866
Speaker 0: You can also... You can tweet Geek Nights or you can tweet APRECHE.

1271
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:28,548
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

1272
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:29,311
Speaker 1: Yep.

1273
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,336
Speaker 1: So someone asked what kind of wine I'm drinking.

1274
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:33,763
Speaker 1: My favorite red wine is Chianti.

1275
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:36,090
Speaker 1: I drink Chianti all the time.

1276
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:40,268
Speaker 1: I don't know what else I can say other than that I really like Chianti.

1277
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,661
Speaker 0: Someone says, "What animes are you

1278
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:43,225
Speaker 0: watching?".

1279
01:05:45,113 --> 01:05:46,730
Speaker 1: We were trying to watch more Michio and Hachi.

1280
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:49,950
Speaker 1: Well, we were trying to watch that, but there was a subtitle issue.

1281
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:56,190
Speaker 0: I'm always trying to watch more Galaxy Express 3-9, but I found out they stopped Fansub me because Crunchyroll's got it.

1282
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:00,150
Speaker 0: But I can't see enough of it on Crunchyroll without joining Crunchyroll.

1283
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,549
Speaker 1: So it's like, what the hell?

1284
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:07,110
Speaker 1: So apparently people really wanted me to be here without pants.

1285
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,450
Speaker 1: You know, if we had the table taller, my idea was... Because this is what I wore to work today.

1286
01:06:13,412 --> 01:06:16,349
Speaker 1: My plan was just to take off the pants I wore to work and have boxers on.

1287
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:19,169
Speaker 1: But you wouldn't be able to see because the table would have been covering it.

1288
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:22,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I turned the sensor off, maybe I could turn it on.

1289
01:06:24,092 --> 01:06:26,427
Speaker 0: Maybe that'll help keep some of the spam down a little bit.

1290
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:26,809
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1291
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:28,109
Speaker 1: How did the sensor work?

1292
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,541
Speaker 0: Basically, you just turn it on and off like that.

1293
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:32,010
Speaker 0: I don't know if it works or not, though.

1294
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,047
Speaker 1: "What wines, liquors, mixed drinks do you recommend to a newbie at

1295
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:36,469
Speaker 1: drinking?".

1296
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,730
Speaker 1: So you're trying to get into drinking?

1297
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:42,750
Speaker 1: Should we do a show on that, getting into being an alcoholic?

1298
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:43,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't.

1299
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:44,612
Speaker 1: Nah.

1300
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,326
Speaker 1: Wow, look at everything censored now.

1301
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:47,970
Speaker 0: Wow.

1302
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:48,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

1303
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:51,134
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

1304
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:53,248
Speaker 1: So now we just have a bunch of censored spam.

1305
01:06:54,312 --> 01:06:54,650
Speaker 1: Drink nights?

1306
01:06:56,250 --> 01:07:00,021
Speaker 1: If you want to try alcohol, try one of every classic, standard mixed drink.

1307
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:08,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, go to the... I don't know enough about it, but I can tell you this is pretty much common sense.

1308
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:15,910
Speaker 0: Go to a liquor store or the grocery store and buy wines or alcohols that have names you are familiar with.

1309
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,018
Speaker 0: And then get one of everything, maybe in a small quantity at a low price.

1310
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:27,490
Speaker 0: If there's something that you recognize the name of, you're never drinking any alcohol.

1311
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,475
Speaker 1: Go drink a Budweiser.

1312
01:07:29,535 --> 01:07:33,390
Speaker 0: It probably doesn't taste good, but you try it and see what it tastes like.

1313
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:35,218
Speaker 1: And then go and try...

1314
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:37,470
Speaker 0: It's a Pilsner, I think, Budweiser?

1315
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:38,732
Speaker 0: So I guess.

1316
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,860
Speaker 0: then try another type of beer.

1317
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,730
Speaker 0: Try... I don't know, what are the other names for them?

1318
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:45,958
Speaker 1: I don't know, but you get my point, right?

1319
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:46,982
Speaker 0: Try one of every type.

1320
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:48,990
Speaker 0: See what they taste like.

1321
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,469
Speaker 1: Try a whiskey, try a scotch, try a vodka.

1322
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:56,930
Speaker 1: My real recommendation is find someone you know who drinks alcohol but does not get drunk.

1323
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,299
Speaker 1: Like someone who actually enjoys alcohol.

1324
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,970
Speaker 1: Like someone who has a cocktail at five o'clock.

1325
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,984
Speaker 1: But not your friend who... Woo!

1326
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:03,649
Speaker 1: With the red cups.

1327
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,950
Speaker 1: And just tell them and ask them to make you a drink and they'll make you a drink and you'll find out if you like it or not.

1328
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:13,170
Speaker 1: And tell them what you like or don't like about it and then they'll recommend something else.

1329
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,506
Speaker 1: Like I give some to the Manhattan and they say, "Ah, it's too

1330
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:15,809
Speaker 1: sweet.".

1331
01:08:16,332 --> 01:08:19,227
Speaker 1: Then I give them like a dry gin and tonic or a dry martini.

1332
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:19,830
Speaker 1: That sort of thing.

1333
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:32,910
Speaker 0: You can also... You probably want to go... If you're going to do stuff just like that comes in a can or a bottle, you can... You go to the grocery store, but if you want to try other stuff, you should probably go to a bar that has a good bartender with some friends and whatnot.

1334
01:08:33,131 --> 01:08:34,220
Speaker 1: Yes, go to a nice bar.

1335
01:08:34,563 --> 01:08:35,207
Speaker 1: Maybe either a...

1336
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:36,996
Speaker 0: Not like a hotel bar.

1337
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:41,010
Speaker 0: A place that actually is kind of crowded, which means it has a good quality bartender.

1338
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:42,809
Speaker 0: If they do tricks, that also means they're good.

1339
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:43,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends.

1340
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:44,716
Speaker 0: It depends.

1341
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:49,701
Speaker 1: You can tell if their tricks are... Just go to a bartender and say... Just tell them straight up, "I don't drink a lot.

1342
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:50,221
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1343
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:52,268
Speaker 1: What would you recommend?

1344
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:52,569
Speaker 1: Help me

1345
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:52,710
Speaker 1: out.".

1346
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:58,210
Speaker 1: Bartenders love nothing more than making a drink for you and telling you all about it.

1347
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:03,830
Speaker 0: And if it tastes like rubbing alcohol, that means that they're trying to get you drunk as opposed to trying to make it taste good.

1348
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:06,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, good drinks should taste good.

1349
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:12,149
Speaker 1: If they don't taste good to you, you shouldn't be drinking alcohol unless you're trying to get drunk and then go nuts.

1350
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:13,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1351
01:09:13,953 --> 01:09:17,042
Speaker 0: So people want to know when this is going to end.

1352
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:17,783
Speaker 0: When do you want to end this?

1353
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:18,787
Speaker 0: 8.30, 8.45, something like that?

1354
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:20,055
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1355
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:20,648
Speaker 1: This is kind of fun.

1356
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,370
Speaker 1: How long have we got to eat dinner?

1357
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:22,729
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1358
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:25,285
Speaker 1: Well, we're stopping at 9 at the latest.

1359
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:26,189
Speaker 0: I'll tell you that.

1360
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,010
Speaker 0: Alright, so before 9, this will be over.

1361
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,749
Speaker 1: 9 Eastern Daylight Time.

1362
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:30,392
Speaker 0: Alright.

1363
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:35,109
Speaker 0: So yeah, just keep sending in comments and questions for us to answer and such.

1364
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:36,814
Speaker 1: I'll answer one more alcohol question.

1365
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:37,156
Speaker 1: That's it.

1366
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:41,448
Speaker 1: My favorite mixed drink is a Manhattan on the Rocks with Jameson.

1367
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:43,170
Speaker 1: Alright.

1368
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:46,180
Speaker 1: You want to hit something?

1369
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:46,524
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1370
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:47,340
Speaker 1: You got anything over there?

1371
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,232
Speaker 1: Any thoughts on the Nintendo DSi?

1372
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:50,439
Speaker 1: I don't care about it at all.

1373
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,163
Speaker 0: The DSi is sort of a weird thing.

1374
01:09:52,224 --> 01:09:54,351
Speaker 0: It's a little bit thinner, I heard.

1375
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:57,240
Speaker 0: The screen's a little bit bigger, I heard.

1376
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:02,220
Speaker 0: It's got the SD slot and I guess you can download software, right?

1377
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,599
Speaker 1: I think it's going to be big for homebrew.

1378
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,453
Speaker 0: Well, they got to crack the slot.

1379
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:06,957
Speaker 1: Someone's going to crack it.

1380
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,500
Speaker 0: I mean, the homebrew cartridges, R4s and Cyclos and whatever, are actually a lot bigger than you think in the US.

1381
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:21,179
Speaker 0: I saw just, you know, there's people in the city, when you go in the city on the subway and on the train, you see people who are not, they don't look like gamers and they have DSs or PSPs.

1382
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:26,199
Speaker 0: They all have freaking, you know, crack pirate cards now.

1383
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,600
Speaker 0: I hardly ever see anyone playing a real DS game.

1384
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:34,440
Speaker 1: You know, it's weird how quickly it went from handheld games or unpiratable to all the pumpkins, pirate everything.

1385
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:34,840
Speaker 0: Yep.

1386
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:50,000
Speaker 0: So I think that if they crack the SD slot on the DSi, I think that, you know, people who have no interest in GBA games are going to get DSIs and use the, just use SD cards instead of paying out for piracy cards, right?

1387
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,900
Speaker 0: It's going to really hurt the piracy card business.

1388
01:10:52,302 --> 01:10:58,260
Speaker 0: I think you're going to see some people try to sell the piracy software, but someone's going to have one that's free and then no one's going to be able to sell it anymore.

1389
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:08,780
Speaker 0: And so the whole business of selling Cyclos and selling R4s is going to go away because everyone's just going to put some software on an SD card and put it in that slot and that's going to be it, right?

1390
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:22,070
Speaker 0: I also think that, you know, while buying and downloading software to the DS might be interesting at first and there might be a few really good things to get on there, I think that in the long run it's going to become

1391
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:22,753
Speaker 1: more

1392
01:11:22,874 --> 01:11:32,774
Speaker 0: like what's on the Wii and hardly ever going to the Wii shop anymore because it's like, you know, the virtual console is overpriced and there's barely any good

1393
01:11:32,814 --> 01:11:33,240
Speaker 1: WiiWare games.

1394
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,359
Speaker 1: They're not going to let you if you bought Mario 1 on the Wii.

1395
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,619
Speaker 1: I don't think they're going to let you just also have it on your DS.

1396
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,507
Speaker 1: That would be nice.

1397
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,560
Speaker 1: That might be good.

1398
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,250
Speaker 1: That would be the killer app, but they're not going to do it.

1399
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,020
Speaker 1: They'll make more money by reselling again.

1400
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:44,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not cool.

1401
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:49,600
Speaker 1: I feel like most of the features on the DSi are aimed at the Japanese market and not at the American market, to be honest.

1402
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:51,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is definitely aimed at the Japanese.

1403
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:58,600
Speaker 0: I think that, you know, the lack of a GBA slot on it and the fact that it isn't significantly better.

1404
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:04,279
Speaker 0: I mean, the DS Lite was a huge improvement over the DS, which is a huge improvement over the SP, which is a huge improvement over the GBA.

1405
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:12,760
Speaker 0: Notice the GBA Micro didn't really do so well because it wasn't a huge improvement over the, you know, SP.

1406
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:20,300
Speaker 0: I mean, it had a better screen, you know, but it was kind of small and it only had GBA games where the SP could play anything.

1407
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,139
Speaker 1: It would have done a lot better if it had come out a lot earlier, I think.

1408
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:26,600
Speaker 1: I might have bought one because I was still playing a ton of GBA games, like, all the time.

1409
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:35,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if the DSi had been the DS, it would have helped out a lot, but I really don't have a lot of interest in the, you know, DSi.

1410
01:12:38,435 --> 01:12:40,700
Speaker 1: I mean... All right, wow, there's a lot of questions here now.

1411
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,197
Speaker 1: CycloDS works on the DSi.

1412
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,223
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

1413
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:47,277
Speaker 0: I guess that'll hold people over until there's a non-hard worker.

1414
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,724
Speaker 1: I got a bunch of quickies.

1415
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:50,876
Speaker 1: Any chance on the Seinfeld Thursday episode?

1416
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:51,640
Speaker 1: That's an easy one.

1417
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,888
Speaker 0: That's a good Thursday episode.

1418
01:12:52,908 --> 01:12:54,440
Speaker 0: We'll do a Thursday episode on Seinfeld.

1419
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,419
Speaker 0: We're gonna watch a few more, just refresh our memories, watch some episodes, and we'll be good to go.

1420
01:12:58,900 --> 01:12:59,705
Speaker 1: Favorite grinding games.

1421
01:12:59,745 --> 01:13:02,040
Speaker 1: back when grinding games weren't an issue for us?

1422
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:06,300
Speaker 1: I kind of always hated the grind, but I played The Realm, the first MMO.

1423
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:10,820
Speaker 0: It's actually weird that back in the day, I didn't hate the grind.

1424
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,060
Speaker 1: Don't hate the game, hate the player.

1425
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,560
Speaker 0: Because I had so much free time that the grinding didn't bother me.

1426
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,180
Speaker 0: What bothered me was random encounters, and what bothered me is an imbalanced grind.

1427
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:24,867
Speaker 0: Like, I would play MUDs back in the day.

1428
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:37,240
Speaker 0: There was one MUD I played, and it's like, as soon as I got to level 100-something, it was at this point where it was, like, too hard to kill the next hardest bad guy, but the bad guy that I could kill didn't give me enough experience to level up quickly.

1429
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,459
Speaker 0: And World of Warcraft solves that problem.

1430
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:45,640
Speaker 0: You level up nice and smooth, straight up, and you never have that frustration.

1431
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,300
Speaker 0: So the thing is, now I have the problem of my time is limited.

1432
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,840
Speaker 0: So now I'm frustrated by any grind, even if it's a smooth grind.

1433
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,340
Speaker 0: But back in the day, any smooth grind was all good.

1434
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know AKA.

1435
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:01,495
Speaker 0: That's a crazy MUD.

1436
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:11,711
Speaker 1: Plus, single player games, the grind... I guess there's the difference between leveling up in the course of a game versus being forced to grind through... Oh, that's a good question.

1437
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:12,560
Speaker 1: Who designed the new Geek Nights logo?

1438
01:14:13,004 --> 01:14:13,698
Speaker 0: Oh, I should do this.

1439
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,376
Speaker 0: That's not a new logo, first off.

1440
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,660
Speaker 0: Okay, so the Geek Nights logo is not super new.

1441
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,910
Speaker 0: There is a person named Brandon Kramer.

1442
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,311
Speaker 0: His website...

1443
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:24,849
Speaker 1: Brando K.

1444
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:30,160
Speaker 0: Brando K. Yeah, if you search for that on Google, you should be able to find this guy.

1445
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:31,079
Speaker 0: He's a man.

1446
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,524
Speaker 0: He is the awesomest man.

1447
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:37,800
Speaker 0: I think now, the last I heard from him, he's writing for AdultSwim.com, I think.

1448
01:14:38,902 --> 01:14:43,200
Speaker 0: I don't think he works on shows yet, but I think he was writing for the website or something like that.

1449
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,989
Speaker 0: So he's a pretty awesome dude.

1450
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,020
Speaker 0: We met at Otakon and some conventions.

1451
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:52,880
Speaker 0: He's got awesome art skills, and he did some awesome arts that we bought off of him.

1452
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:57,080
Speaker 0: Since we liked him so much, we asked him to design these logos for us, and he did so.

1453
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:04,480
Speaker 0: We had our friend Kat Lee, who is a professional graphic designer, design the website around those logos.

1454
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:11,700
Speaker 0: So she took the black thing and put the white and blue over it and did all that other stuff.

1455
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:17,620
Speaker 1: This banner, I threw this together with a demo copy of Photoshop, just barely.

1456
01:15:17,901 --> 01:15:19,045
Speaker 1: I got it printed, and it worked.

1457
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:23,240
Speaker 1: okay, but it's a little too big, and I just took the logo and put a shadow on it.

1458
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:26,379
Speaker 1: We're making much better logos and banners and everything now.

1459
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:30,399
Speaker 0: Someone says, "What do you think the ratio of girl-to-guy listeners

1460
01:15:30,419 --> 01:15:30,459
Speaker 0: is?".

1461
01:15:31,362 --> 01:15:33,019
Speaker 1: I feel like there are more girls than guys.

1462
01:15:34,884 --> 01:15:40,180
Speaker 0: I can't really tell, because I think the girls are less likely to interact.

1463
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,540
Speaker 1: But I feel like the girls that do interact, they always have a lot more to contribute than the guys.

1464
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:55,960
Speaker 0: If you just pick out the super hardcore Geek Nights fans, I think maybe half of them are female, and it's about half to half.

1465
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,315
Speaker 0: When you look at the forum as a whole, like all registrations in the forum, it's more of maybe a 30-70 or a 40-60.

1466
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,780
Speaker 1: But look at who has sent us awesome fan art or awesome things.

1467
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,520
Speaker 1: It's all girls, like Ro and Vega and Mancun.

1468
01:16:12,082 --> 01:16:13,980
Speaker 0: The best fans are always girl fans.

1469
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:14,960
Speaker 1: Mancun is so cool.

1470
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy fans are not as cool.

1471
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:19,198
Speaker 0: Sorry guys.

1472
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:22,935
Speaker 1: Yes, we know a lot of you contribute, but...

1473
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:30,520
Speaker 0: There are plenty of girl geeks out there, and they are the awesome.

1474
01:16:33,404 --> 01:16:34,130
Speaker 1: More Final Thoughts?

1475
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do more Final Thoughts episodes.

1476
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:36,566
Speaker 0: We can do more Final Thoughts.

1477
01:16:36,587 --> 01:16:37,799
Speaker 0: We have to watch some more shows.

1478
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,819
Speaker 1: What is your opinion on Super Dolphy?

1479
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:44,426
Speaker 1: Super Dolphy is a hobby.

1480
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:45,149
Speaker 1: You can be into that.

1481
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:49,485
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

1482
01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:50,449
Speaker 0: You're making little dolls.

1483
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:59,160
Speaker 0: Usually you buy the dolls, but you do the hair and you do the clothing, and there's a craft to it.

1484
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:02,490
Speaker 0: It's a very respectable and cool hobby.

1485
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,580
Speaker 0: It's just as cool as any other arts and crafts kind of hobby.

1486
01:17:06,142 --> 01:17:08,308
Speaker 0: It's just sort of creepy.

1487
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:12,820
Speaker 0: Some of the people in that community treat their doll-fies as if they are real people.

1488
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:16,560
Speaker 0: Or they act in a very strange way.

1489
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:21,660
Speaker 0: That is sort of kind of scary, and it turns people away.

1490
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:25,067
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with the hobby itself.

1491
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:28,520
Speaker 0: There's just a certain creepiness in that community.

1492
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,980
Speaker 0: Sort of like the furries.

1493
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:36,820
Speaker 0: I have nothing against someone who gets jollies from whatever they get.

1494
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,040
Speaker 1: Or even more to the point, I'll admit I really like a lot of anthropomorphic art.

1495
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:42,709
Speaker 0: Looney Tunes is anthropomorphic.

1496
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:43,695
Speaker 0: Disney is anthropomorphic.

1497
01:17:43,715 --> 01:17:44,520
Speaker 0: Technically, right?

1498
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,114
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with anthropomorphic art inherently.

1499
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:47,396
Speaker 0: It's art.

1500
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:54,680
Speaker 0: It's just that there's a particular community, and a portion of that community acts in a creepy way.

1501
01:17:55,081 --> 01:17:59,920
Speaker 0: So that turns people off of that hobby because they associate this creepy behavior with the hobby.

1502
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:08,000
Speaker 0: If you're a smart person like us, you can learn to disassociate these things and recognize them for what they are.

1503
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,840
Speaker 0: They're asking about Conficker.

1504
01:18:12,082 --> 01:18:13,145
Speaker 1: We could do a show on it.

1505
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:19,780
Speaker 1: Honestly, no competent tech company or firm or person had any issue with Conficker.

1506
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:29,720
Speaker 0: People saw it coming so far in advance that either the person who put it out there screwed up, or the person out there chickened out.

1507
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:39,119
Speaker 0: It was a good example of, "Look, we can see this virus coming in advance, and we can take care of it, and now nothing happened, and everything's all

1508
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:39,340
Speaker 0: cool.".

1509
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:45,980
Speaker 0: For now, we're ahead of these people a little bit, and it's good stuff.

1510
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:48,277
Speaker 1: There's an interesting question here.

1511
01:18:49,481 --> 01:18:53,014
Speaker 1: "Do you think the FRC was inevitable, or was it a product of RIT's

1512
01:18:53,055 --> 01:18:53,516
Speaker 1: environment?".

1513
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,640
Speaker 1: Is a product inevitable?

1514
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:07,660
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was RIT specifically, but I think there's a certain kind of environment that can foster the sort of relationship that the front-room crew formed that isn't necessarily possible in other environments.

1515
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,060
Speaker 1: I think it was a combination of the fact that RIT is a self-selected set.

1516
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:15,959
Speaker 1: The majority of the people there have very similar interests in a lot of ways.

1517
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:21,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's true about a lot of other colleges, but not everyone who goes to RIT has this kind of thing happen.

1518
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:28,555
Speaker 1: True, but at the same time, notice how all the people in the front-room crew were all into gaming, all into anime.

1519
01:19:29,257 --> 01:19:30,700
Speaker 1: We all had very similar interests.

1520
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:35,140
Speaker 0: I think what it was is you went to the gaming club, and you saw some people there.

1521
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,660
Speaker 0: You went to the anime club, and you saw different people there.

1522
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,960
Speaker 1: We had friends in the gaming club that didn't join the front-room crew, but we totally had the same gaming interests.

1523
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:43,522
Speaker 0: The front-room crew.

1524
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:46,860
Speaker 0: people were in both independently of each other.

1525
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:59,800
Speaker 0: It was sort of like you had the self-selected sample of like-minded people, RIT students, and then you had a sample of people, people who went to the gaming club, and then you had people who went to the anime club, and then there were people who went to both.

1526
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:17,617
Speaker 0: There was this even smaller group of people that saw each other a lot, and that set-up, anyone who is socially adaptable, didn't scare others away, was friendly and got along well and had discussions with each other, and saw each other frequently.

1527
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,914
Speaker 0: There were people that I would just see while I was at RIT.

1528
01:20:21,934 --> 01:20:23,060
Speaker 0: I would see them every day.

1529
01:20:23,363 --> 01:20:23,640
Speaker 0: Like Mitch.

1530
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:30,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you see someone every day, you're going to talk to them, you're going to get to know them, especially over the course of multiple years, it's going to happen.

1531
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,420
Speaker 0: You just had to be the person who's in that situation.

1532
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:46,260
Speaker 1: Plus, it was a self-selected sample at RIT, and then it's a self-selected sample from that of all these different hobbies, and everyone in the crew, like Scott said, kind of was in all of those groups.

1533
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,386
Speaker 1: I mean, we had a lot of friends in the gaming club.

1534
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:52,760
Speaker 1: They didn't watch really anime or anything, there weren't any other things, so they didn't really become a crew.

1535
01:20:53,381 --> 01:21:07,640
Speaker 0: Imagine this, what if you're a Geek Nights listener, supposedly, unless you're one of these YouTube stragglers, and let's say you're getting along in this community with other Geek Nights listeners.

1536
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:18,100
Speaker 0: And then independently of that, you listen to some other podcast, and you find someone who you didn't recommend to them this other podcast, they just happen to also listen to that same other podcast as you.

1537
01:21:18,381 --> 01:21:25,380
Speaker 0: So now you're in the same community with this person, you're in two different communities with the same person, independently, you didn't tell them to go to this other one.

1538
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:33,899
Speaker 0: So you're going to probably keep bumping into this person frequently, you're going to get together with them, and it's going to be, you know, it's going to happen.

1539
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:47,959
Speaker 1: Plus, I think the isolation had something to do with the fact that RIT was this like self contained unit, it was like we were on a spaceship going somewhere, we were pretty much cut off from the world because we had one car among like 20 people.

1540
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,488
Speaker 1: So we couldn't leave campus, we had to stay on campus or walk or like take the bus as a group.

1541
01:21:54,249 --> 01:22:00,320
Speaker 1: And we spent a lot of time like hanging out as a group together in the lounges just doing nothing.

1542
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:05,339
Speaker 1: As a group, because there's nothing else to do, we had no money, we had nothing, we played games together.

1543
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:12,011
Speaker 0: All right, some people are asking about what is the breakdown of the OS's the listeners use?

1544
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:16,620
Speaker 0: They probably mostly use Windows, a bunch of Mac, and I know there's a bunch of Linux people out there.

1545
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:19,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's no such thing as OS.

1546
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:22,260
Speaker 1: I got all three in this room right now, all right.

1547
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:24,739
Speaker 1: Windows, Linux, Mac.

1548
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:30,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you know, there's no OS bias here, and I really don't care.

1549
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,669
Speaker 1: Whatever OS does what you need.

1550
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,200
Speaker 1: That's the only question.

1551
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:39,131
Speaker 0: It's like saying, oh, do you know more listeners use hammers or more use screwdrivers?

1552
01:22:39,191 --> 01:22:41,877
Speaker 0: It's like, when you got a nail, use the hammer.

1553
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,480
Speaker 0: When you got a screw, use a screwdriver.

1554
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,747
Speaker 1: Kind of like the browser question.

1555
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:46,580
Speaker 1: I mean, everyone seems to use Firefox or Chrome.

1556
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, oh, we need to do some arts.

1557
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,130
Speaker 0: Well, let's get some Macs to make the artists happy.

1558
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:53,612
Speaker 0: Oh, we need to do some programming.

1559
01:22:53,653 --> 01:22:55,216
Speaker 0: Let's get some Linuxes, you know.

1560
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,738
Speaker 0: Oh, we need to play some games.

1561
01:22:56,759 --> 01:22:57,540
Speaker 0: Let's get some Windows.

1562
01:22:58,001 --> 01:22:59,639
Speaker 1: No, this banner is not always up here.

1563
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:00,627
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

1564
01:23:00,688 --> 01:23:02,220
Speaker 1: We put this banner up here just now.

1565
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:10,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to pan the camera, but the living room is pretty big, and there's like, over there is like the piano and the other loveseat and all this other stuff.

1566
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:17,040
Speaker 1: And over there is all the board games, and over there is all the DVDs, and around the corner there is the table for snacks, and we have people over.

1567
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,439
Speaker 1: And then there's the big window and the extra couch.

1568
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:23,059
Speaker 0: They want us to talk about the James Randi YouTube thing.

1569
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:36,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, they took all, Randi got banned from YouTube, all their videos, and the rumor is that it has something to do with Oprah Winfrey, but this rumor, I haven't seen any confirmation of it or anything like that.

1570
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,084
Speaker 1: Here's the thing, though.

1571
01:23:37,386 --> 01:23:40,160
Speaker 1: I know that the JREF would not have taken these down.

1572
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,119
Speaker 0: No, it was definitely YouTube pushed them out.

1573
01:23:42,961 --> 01:23:44,979
Speaker 1: I'm filled with righteous indignation, but what can I do?

1574
01:23:46,222 --> 01:23:50,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, everyone go write a letter to YouTube or send an angry email.

1575
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,680
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm sure this will be in news next time we do a Monday show.

1576
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll almost definitely be in news once we have more reliable information about it.

1577
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:01,679
Speaker 0: But right now, it's just a bunch of rumors and indignation, so what are you going to do about it?

1578
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:06,520
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see, how many people in something, something?

1579
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:10,378
Speaker 1: Have you ever tried a banana dipped in pizza sauce?

1580
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:10,539
Speaker 1: No.

1581
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,674
Speaker 0: That's a Douglas or a Dougwatcher.

1582
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:14,378
Speaker 0: I like that.

1583
01:24:15,601 --> 01:24:16,659
Speaker 0: Mad props to the Dougwatcher.

1584
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:17,497
Speaker 1: What, that guy?

1585
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever asked for that.

1586
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy's been asking a lot of the good questions.

1587
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,215
Speaker 0: Oh, has he?

1588
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,008
Speaker 1: Oh, that's Kevin!

1589
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,040
Speaker 1: That's the theory shadow.

1590
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a Dougwatcher, alright.

1591
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:25,771
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1592
01:24:29,433 --> 01:24:31,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, we kind of fell out of touch with you, Kevin.

1593
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:32,645
Speaker 0: What's going on?

1594
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:38,030
Speaker 1: I should probably make you into the secret for him, but you probably already are.

1595
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,389
Speaker 1: Or you should have been and I forgot, so remind me.

1596
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:46,410
Speaker 1: You're not looking for another question?

1597
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:50,365
Speaker 0: GN has been around for so long, there's an old school, new school line now?

1598
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:51,470
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

1599
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:52,920
Speaker 1: We've only been around, what, 2005 we started.

1600
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:56,210
Speaker 0: We're not popular, really.

1601
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:02,210
Speaker 0: I mean, there's only 100 people in this chat, Leo Laporta's thousands, so we're not popular enough.

1602
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:08,390
Speaker 0: I mean, if you start listening now, right, if we ever do become popular, you're going to be old school stuff.

1603
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:13,090
Speaker 1: We have between, statistically, one and five thousand regular listeners.

1604
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:19,850
Speaker 1: And less than ten thousand, probably, at most, at absolute maximum, six or seven thousand occasional listeners.

1605
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:20,427
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

1606
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:23,709
Speaker 1: That's like the absolute, like, statistical, it's hard to tell, so.

1607
01:25:24,211 --> 01:25:25,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was in before.

1608
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:25,570
Speaker 0: it was cool.

1609
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,209
Speaker 0: Guess what, it's still not cool.

1610
01:25:28,072 --> 01:25:28,705
Speaker 0: It's not cool yet.

1611
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:31,610
Speaker 1: So you're all in before it's cool.

1612
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:38,289
Speaker 1: Someone asked, do you get anything, quote, has Geek Nights fame brought you any significant benefits to your lives?

1613
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:39,554
Speaker 1: E.g.,

1614
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:42,449
Speaker 1: free stuff, gifts, girls, all of those.

1615
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:49,510
Speaker 0: We've gotten, see the thing is, there are other podcasts out there that do a much better job of getting listener gifts.

1616
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:51,865
Speaker 1: Well, we don't shoot for it, we don't try, other than...

1617
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:57,610
Speaker 0: Well, they don't shoot for it either, but they behave in a way that gets it going on.

1618
01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:02,450
Speaker 0: For example, I listen to Comic Geek speak, and these guys get tons of stuff from listeners.

1619
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:07,710
Speaker 0: And the reason they get tons of stuff from listeners is because they always give back to the listeners, big time.

1620
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:14,450
Speaker 0: They constantly play voicemails on the show, read emails, they're constantly giving mad props to people.

1621
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:20,810
Speaker 0: When their listeners do stuff, they always pimp them, even if the listeners are doing stuff that's not the greatest stuff in the world.

1622
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:27,510
Speaker 0: And as a result, they get a lot back from the listeners, always giving them gifts and helping them out and all that sort of thing.

1623
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:32,630
Speaker 0: We don't play voicemails, we don't do a lot of email reading.

1624
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:35,386
Speaker 0: Geek facts are very, very rare.

1625
01:26:36,851 --> 01:26:44,930
Speaker 1: The only time I ever, I guess I feel like I took advantage of the listeners, not really, but I really wanted one of these, and I couldn't get one at PAX.

1626
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:46,629
Speaker 1: I tried so hard, but I couldn't get one.

1627
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:50,930
Speaker 1: And four listeners offered them to me, and two listeners sent them to me.

1628
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:56,170
Speaker 1: I still owe the people who sent these to me a gift box that I kind of half put together and just never finished.

1629
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:01,550
Speaker 1: But other than this, I don't know, I haven't paid for a convention since 2002.

1630
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, not paying for conventions is very nice.

1631
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:08,410
Speaker 0: But I mean, even without Geek Nights, we probably could have built up panels and all that stuff.

1632
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,787
Speaker 1: I mean, we were doing panels since 2002 at anime conventions.

1633
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:14,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were doing panels long before Geek Nights.

1634
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:20,170
Speaker 1: I get press stuff, like anytime I want press access to something, I just get it at this point, which is pretty cool.

1635
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:24,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I would do another hate mail show, someone's asking about a hate mail show, but we haven't got any hate mail.

1636
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:25,325
Speaker 0: Not in a while.

1637
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:28,920
Speaker 0: I don't think we've ever, the only real hate mail we've gotten was

1638
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:29,823
Speaker 0: V.I.V.,

1639
01:27:31,147 --> 01:27:32,110
Speaker 0: you know, what's his name?

1640
01:27:33,436 --> 01:27:33,584
Speaker 1: Beefy?

1641
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,865
Speaker 0: Admiral Beefy, who had a voicemail on Anime World Order.

1642
01:27:36,906 --> 01:27:37,629
Speaker 0: that was to us.

1643
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,730
Speaker 0: He was pissed off at us, and he was just a ranting lunatic.

1644
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,433
Speaker 1: I was hard to tell.

1645
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:44,428
Speaker 1: To this day, I can't tell if that was a joke or not.

1646
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,982
Speaker 1: Either that's a scary guy or that guy's really good.

1647
01:27:48,022 --> 01:27:49,289
Speaker 1: Like, that guy should do a radio show.

1648
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:53,890
Speaker 0: Someone wants to know what are the chances of a teething a geek talk?

1649
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,763
Speaker 1: Geek talks, I just don't have time for, to be honest.

1650
01:27:57,823 --> 01:27:58,769
Speaker 1: Emily's in them off and on.

1651
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:07,890
Speaker 1: The one time I was in one, Emily was in my room instead of being in her apartment, and I happened to walk into the room, so I stepped in for a bit, but I don't have time.

1652
01:28:08,212 --> 01:28:10,889
Speaker 1: I don't even talk to my own friends, let alone you guys.

1653
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:18,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, we do, we communicate with you in the forums, we communicate with you with stuff like this, right?

1654
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:22,064
Speaker 0: I mean, the geek talk is for listener solidarity.

1655
01:28:22,124 --> 01:28:23,450
Speaker 0: It's not, it's not for us.

1656
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:27,370
Speaker 1: I read, we read every email we get, but we don't have time to respond to them all.

1657
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:30,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, I mean, that's, that's how it's gonna be.

1658
01:28:32,353 --> 01:28:33,109
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see.

1659
01:28:34,211 --> 01:28:34,913
Speaker 1: I think it's winded up.

1660
01:28:34,974 --> 01:28:39,710
Speaker 1: Now, while the banner is not always up here, when we lived in Colony, we duct taped DDR pads to the floor.

1661
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:44,590
Speaker 1: Those were there pretty much as long as we lived there, until we moved out at the end of that summer.

1662
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,280
Speaker 0: That's a complicated question, I want to answer that.

1663
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,300
Speaker 1: That's a really complicated question that would make a really good show.

1664
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:53,160
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1665
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,488
Speaker 1: I mean, do a show on that.

1666
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:55,920
Speaker 1: I'm sure everyone has seen it.

1667
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,557
Speaker 0: Rims had his eyebrows trimmed.

1668
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a unibrow forever, and eventually Emily convinced me to pluck this middle part.

1669
01:29:03,801 --> 01:29:04,968
Speaker 1: It hurts so much!

1670
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:07,340
Speaker 1: Good God, I cry every time I do it.

1671
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:08,500
Speaker 0: You should just go back to the unibrow.

1672
01:29:08,741 --> 01:29:09,080
Speaker 1: I should.

1673
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,222
Speaker 1: I am so hot.

1674
01:29:11,744 --> 01:29:20,073
Speaker 1: On Hot or Not, back in the day, when that was the popular thing, I ended up with an average of, I think, 8.9.

1675
01:29:20,073 --> 01:29:21,408
Speaker 1: I haven't cut my hair in a year and a half.

1676
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,548
Speaker 0: You should probably cut it soon, it's getting a little, uh...

1677
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:27,450
Speaker 1: It's getting kind of raggedy in the end now.

1678
01:29:31,272 --> 01:29:32,749
Speaker 1: Uh, yes, I have piercings.

1679
01:29:34,513 --> 01:29:35,930
Speaker 0: We don't have tattoos, though, I don't think.

1680
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:36,211
Speaker 1: Nah.

1681
01:29:36,632 --> 01:29:41,350
Speaker 1: I've considered tattoos often, the only reason I never got one was that they don't look good enough yet, in my opinion.

1682
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:42,578
Speaker 1: Like, they're not there.

1683
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:44,110
Speaker 1: The technology is not there fully.

1684
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:44,831
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1685
01:29:45,396 --> 01:29:47,150
Speaker 0: Uh, I would, I would like tattoos.

1686
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,270
Speaker 0: The main problem I have with a tattoo is that it's irreversible, right?

1687
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:54,029
Speaker 0: And I just, I don't like to do anything that I can't undo, you know?

1688
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:57,390
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I'm willing to try all sorts of stuff.

1689
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:04,370
Speaker 0: But anything that has a permanent effect is sort of, like, probably a bad idea to do that so early in life.

1690
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:04,907
Speaker 0: If I could get it...

1691
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:06,529
Speaker 1: 'Cause then you're gonna have to live with that effect forever.

1692
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:11,210
Speaker 1: If I could get a clear ink that I could just, like, plug a USB stick in my arm and change the picture.

1693
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:11,767
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1694
01:30:12,051 --> 01:30:13,090
Speaker 1: My whole body would be covered in tattoos.

1695
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:18,830
Speaker 0: I would, I would just, uh, you know, if I could digitally load, like, JPEGs into my arm, I would do that all the time.

1696
01:30:18,971 --> 01:30:21,930
Speaker 0: I would, you know, I would turn it blank, you know, most of the time.

1697
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:26,250
Speaker 0: But, like, if I would, you know, I would have, like, a default one, or maybe if my mood changed, I would change.

1698
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:27,567
Speaker 0: I would do that, it would be awesome, you know?

1699
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,470
Speaker 0: You know, putting art on your body is totally great, but...

1700
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:32,670
Speaker 1: You're wrong, whoever said that's not gonna get that advanced.

1701
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:37,010
Speaker 1: They have already designed tattoos that could be changed in real time.

1702
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,790
Speaker 1: It's just the problem is that the technology's not there yet.

1703
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:43,830
Speaker 1: Within ten years, we will have tattoos that you can just change with some sort of light device.

1704
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:44,390
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

1705
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,128
Speaker 1: I'm so sure.

1706
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:49,650
Speaker 0: Some of us who play Resident Evil 5, what system do I have that can play Resident Evil 5?

1707
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,390
Speaker 0: We have a Wii, and we have computers.

1708
01:30:51,671 --> 01:30:52,735
Speaker 1: What's under the TV?

1709
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:56,310
Speaker 1: A Wii, a Switch, a Roku, an amplifier, and a Mac Mini?

1710
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:59,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we would need a 360 or a PS3 or something.

1711
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,182
Speaker 0: Is Resident Evil 5 for the Wii?

1712
01:31:02,202 --> 01:31:02,848
Speaker 0: I don't think it is.

1713
01:31:04,311 --> 01:31:07,110
Speaker 1: Oh, there are a whole bunch of good questions that just passed by real quick.

1714
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:11,770
Speaker 0: If I would lose a limb, would I have a weapon and a small computer built in?

1715
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:13,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I lose a limb, I'm going all out.

1716
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:26,246
Speaker 0: There's a great TED Talk with this lady who has no legs, and talking about how her prosthetics actually give her superpowers, because she can switch them up to ones that have different utilities, so she can be taller or shorter or whatever.

1717
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:29,270
Speaker 0: I would totally be the same way.

1718
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:35,850
Speaker 0: If I had to replace some part of my body with a prosthetic, it would be loaded with awesomeness.

1719
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:39,270
Speaker 1: Kevin said, "You keep forgetting to add me to the secret forum.

1720
01:31:39,712 --> 01:31:41,206
Speaker 1: I'd be more in touch if I had travel

1721
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:41,428
Speaker 1: money.".

1722
01:31:42,113 --> 01:31:43,482
Speaker 1: I'll add you to the secret forum.

1723
01:31:43,603 --> 01:31:44,590
Speaker 1: You deserve to be there.

1724
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:45,410
Speaker 0: I just keep forgetting.

1725
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,932
Speaker 0: That's fine.

1726
01:31:46,714 --> 01:31:50,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, Mega Man is fully robotic, but, you know, he's not a...

1727
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:53,750
Speaker 1: He's like Tetsuan Adam.

1728
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:57,050
Speaker 0: Stop asking the difficult question that requires an episode to answer.

1729
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:59,650
Speaker 0: We want the short questions that we can answer in a few sentences.

1730
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:00,773
Speaker 1: Favorite comedians?

1731
01:32:00,873 --> 01:32:04,590
Speaker 1: I always liked George Carlin because he, I think, had a big effect on American culture.

1732
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:05,858
Speaker 0: I like Lewis Black.

1733
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:07,370
Speaker 1: He makes me roll the most.

1734
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:08,650
Speaker 1: I've met Lewis Black twice.

1735
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:11,850
Speaker 0: We talked about OnLive on our show yesterday.

1736
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:12,913
Speaker 1: I really like Eddie Izzard.

1737
01:32:18,067 --> 01:32:18,688
Speaker 1: Laser guitar?

1738
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:18,929
Speaker 1: What?

1739
01:32:18,989 --> 01:32:19,290
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1740
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:22,979
Speaker 1: I think we're petering out here.

1741
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:24,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, we are petering a little bit.

1742
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,880
Speaker 1: There are a lot of good questions, but they're scrolling by too fast.

1743
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's give, like, five or ten more minutes and then we'll meet.

1744
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna wind this down.

1745
01:32:30,387 --> 01:32:30,911
Speaker 1: I gotta eat dinner.

1746
01:32:30,931 --> 01:32:32,019
Speaker 1: I got work tomorrow, so...

1747
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually have to interview tomorrow in the city that I have to go to.

1748
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:38,840
Speaker 1: I'll admit, I haven't found any new comedians that I like.

1749
01:32:40,182 --> 01:32:47,620
Speaker 0: There are a few, if you go to College Humor, you watch, they do stand-up videos on there, and most of them are bad, but once in a while, they're pretty good.

1750
01:32:48,384 --> 01:32:51,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just, it's tough to be a good comedian.

1751
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,479
Speaker 1: Like, maybe one out of a million comedians is worth listening to.

1752
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:58,490
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not telling you about the secret forum.

1753
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:03,066
Speaker 1: Someone asked here, "Will there ever be official Geek Nights parties at summer

1754
01:33:03,106 --> 01:33:03,588
Speaker 1: conventions?".

1755
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:06,520
Speaker 1: No.

1756
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,249
Speaker 1: I'm done with that.

1757
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,370
Speaker 1: My days of running parties at conventions are over.

1758
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:15,210
Speaker 1: It is so much, Geek Nights takes a tenth of the work that convention parties take.

1759
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:17,109
Speaker 1: I will never have time for that again.

1760
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:21,950
Speaker 0: If you want more Geek Profiles episodes, I've seen that go by a few times.

1761
01:33:22,632 --> 01:33:29,190
Speaker 0: We've been trying, I wanted to do some more, but the thing is, Rim always goes, you know, it's usually the day of that we think to do it.

1762
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:32,668
Speaker 1: And I gotta get up at like 4.30 the next morning and go to work, so...

1763
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:36,730
Speaker 0: So we'd have to record it in advance or something like that, you know?

1764
01:33:37,531 --> 01:33:39,530
Speaker 0: We couldn't record it on the Thursday.

1765
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:43,650
Speaker 1: If you presented the opportunity, who would you apprentice under?

1766
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:46,568
Speaker 1: Robert Koo, I just want that man to tell me what to do.

1767
01:33:47,232 --> 01:33:48,950
Speaker 0: That's a good one, that's a good one.

1768
01:33:49,131 --> 01:33:50,950
Speaker 0: Who would I apprentice under?

1769
01:33:53,191 --> 01:33:54,770
Speaker 1: James Randi, I would love to take--.

1770
01:33:55,171 --> 01:34:00,130
Speaker 1: If my job could be to take over the JREF, I would do that without question or thought.

1771
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:00,889
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

1772
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,689
Speaker 1: I would dedicate my life to that.

1773
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:04,787
Speaker 1: I might app--.

1774
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:09,490
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, do I want to apprentice under someone who has skills in something I don't have?

1775
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:11,569
Speaker 0: That way I can learn something new and be awesome at it?

1776
01:34:11,991 --> 01:34:17,750
Speaker 0: Or do I want to apprentice under a programmer and then explode my programming awesomeness all over the place?

1777
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:18,995
Speaker 0: You know?

1778
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:20,770
Speaker 0: I think that's the real decision.

1779
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:25,870
Speaker 0: If I could pick a dead person, I would apprentice under DaVinci, because that would be the easiest.

1780
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,055
Speaker 0: Maybe Imhotep.

1781
01:34:27,257 --> 01:34:29,230
Speaker 1: Depends if he really designed the pyramid or not.

1782
01:34:30,834 --> 01:34:31,522
Speaker 1: If he did, yes.

1783
01:34:31,563 --> 01:34:32,109
Speaker 1: If he didn't, no.

1784
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:37,330
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say Alexander the Great, because he kind of just took over the stuff his daddy did.

1785
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:38,590
Speaker 1: He didn't do anything interesting.

1786
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,201
Speaker 1: What's for dinner?

1787
01:34:40,262 --> 01:34:40,809
Speaker 1: We don't know.

1788
01:34:40,992 --> 01:34:42,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't eat dinner yet.

1789
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:43,230
Speaker 0: Try to get a pizza somewhere?

1790
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:47,230
Speaker 1: Actually, that pizza place down the road went out of business.

1791
01:34:48,031 --> 01:34:51,090
Speaker 1: There's a sign reopening again as a pizza place.

1792
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:52,825
Speaker 1: And I was looking at it like,

1793
01:34:52,845 --> 01:34:52,886
Speaker 1: "Eh?".

1794
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:55,410
Speaker 1: And this Mexican guy walked over and he had his daughter.

1795
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,042
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Yeah, I bought this place.

1796
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:57,787
Speaker 1: I'm opening a pizza

1797
01:34:57,807 --> 01:34:58,049
Speaker 1: place.".

1798
01:34:58,451 --> 01:34:59,697
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Good luck, man.

1799
01:34:59,717 --> 01:35:01,043
Speaker 1: I will try your pizza.

1800
01:35:01,707 --> 01:35:01,907
Speaker 0: Good

1801
01:35:01,928 --> 01:35:02,149
Speaker 0: luck.".

1802
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:02,813
Speaker 0: Wow.

1803
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:05,250
Speaker 0: Let's try this place on Beacon Main Street.

1804
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,090
Speaker 0: We should actually just drive over there and get slices, I think.

1805
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,490
Speaker 1: I want to eat at Poppy's, but I don't think they're open this late.

1806
01:35:10,531 --> 01:35:12,030
Speaker 0: No, this is the Nova Roma place.

1807
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Poppy's, it's just burgers.

1808
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,317
Speaker 0: We could try there, too.

1809
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,950
Speaker 0: Actually, isn't the sushi place open late?

1810
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:18,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it is.

1811
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:20,930
Speaker 1: Well, we learned that the Charlie Brown's is open till one.

1812
01:35:22,372 --> 01:35:24,770
Speaker 0: Rym said he figured out how to do a Skype call-in.

1813
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:31,847
Speaker 0: The big problem with doing a Skype call-in show, which we would really like to do, actually, is the screening.

1814
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:37,130
Speaker 0: We would need a set-up for someone else off-camera to screen the call.

1815
01:35:38,591 --> 01:35:39,097
Speaker 1: I can do it.

1816
01:35:40,631 --> 01:35:48,270
Speaker 1: What we would probably do is do it on a Saturday morning sometime, and then we'd edit it and put it on the show.

1817
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:53,129
Speaker 1: So you'd hear it not live, but there would be a live equivalent on Ustream, I guess.

1818
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:54,465
Speaker 1: Kind of like this.

1819
01:35:55,230 --> 01:36:01,330
Speaker 0: It would basically be just like this, only we'd have some buttons where you'd be like, "Next caller," and you would hear the voice of the caller.

1820
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,470
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to edit this too much for tomorrow.

1821
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,570
Speaker 0: And we wouldn't be paying attention to the chat pretty much at all.

1822
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,130
Speaker 0: We would only be paying attention to the caller.

1823
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:09,568
Speaker 1: If we do a call-in show, I would heavily edit it.

1824
01:36:10,794 --> 01:36:12,370
Speaker 1: I don't listen to any podcasts anymore.

1825
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:14,569
Speaker 0: I don't listen to any gaming podcasts anymore.

1826
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:17,590
Speaker 1: I listen to It's All Politics from NPR.

1827
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:20,208
Speaker 1: I listen to Dave and Joel every now and then.

1828
01:36:21,091 --> 01:36:21,920
Speaker 1: And I listen to...

1829
01:36:23,274 --> 01:36:24,790
Speaker 0: Actually, stop listening to Dave and Joel.

1830
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,510
Speaker 1: Anime World Order, occasionally.

1831
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:28,259
Speaker 0: Not that I didn't like them.

1832
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:28,846
Speaker 0: I just didn't.

1833
01:36:29,832 --> 01:36:33,910
Speaker 0: I listen to Anime World Order, Twit, ESPN, Floss Weekly.

1834
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:37,370
Speaker 0: And I'm watching, like, TED videos, right?

1835
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:39,330
Speaker 0: It's a video podcast, technically.

1836
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:43,150
Speaker 0: I got the Onion video podcast, not the audio one.

1837
01:36:43,432 --> 01:36:44,190
Speaker 1: Oh, that's really good.

1838
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,047
Speaker 0: It is really good.

1839
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,970
Speaker 1: Geek Profile of Dave Riley and Joel White.

1840
01:36:48,912 --> 01:36:58,610
Speaker 1: In the years we've been podcasting and been kind of internet friends with Dave Riley, I have had maybe 15 minutes of total contiguous conversation with that man.

1841
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:05,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's actually surprisingly difficult to talk to for a significant amount of time.

1842
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:08,650
Speaker 1: I mean, I love Dave Riley, but he is scatterbrained.

1843
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:09,725
Speaker 1: I think he said he has ADHD.

1844
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:11,089
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1845
01:37:12,212 --> 01:37:16,430
Speaker 1: I cannot have a consistent conversation with him for any period of time.

1846
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:17,059
Speaker 1: I've tried.

1847
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:17,809
Speaker 1: I like him, though.

1848
01:37:18,831 --> 01:37:21,750
Speaker 0: One day, I will go to the San Diego Comic-Con before I die.

1849
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:22,830
Speaker 0: Most likely.

1850
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:26,750
Speaker 1: As a sysadmin, are there any tools you rely upon heavily?

1851
01:37:26,954 --> 01:37:27,016
Speaker 0: SSH.

1852
01:37:28,573 --> 01:37:28,963
Speaker 1: V.I.?

1853
01:37:28,963 --> 01:37:29,291
Speaker 0: ?

1854
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:29,373
Speaker 0: V.I.

1855
01:37:29,434 --> 01:37:29,660
Speaker 0: and SSH.

1856
01:37:30,532 --> 01:37:31,125
Speaker 1: Uh, tail-f?

1857
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,250
Speaker 0: That's not a tool.

1858
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:35,790
Speaker 1: Tail-f pipe grep something?

1859
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:37,470
Speaker 0: Grep, I guess, maybe.

1860
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:38,053
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1861
01:37:38,257 --> 01:37:38,850
Speaker 1: No, seriously.

1862
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:44,290
Speaker 1: What I rely upon primarily is tail-f pipe grep some regular expression.

1863
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:49,230
Speaker 0: Why don't you use, like, um... Oh, there's, like, a... Is it called, like, super tail or something?

1864
01:37:49,471 --> 01:37:49,926
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

1865
01:37:50,411 --> 01:37:50,964
Speaker 1: I say tail-f.

1866
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:54,050
Speaker 1: We actually have our own proprietary tail that will... Oh, okay.

1867
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:59,730
Speaker 1: We have all our system demons, and if you just type the name of our demon, it will tail whatever instance of that demon I want.

1868
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,548
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

1869
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:05,241
Speaker 1: And I can... It's all alias-powered, or... I can also do an equivalent of this.

1870
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:11,950
Speaker 1: that will basically, on its own, go back through the logs an arbitrary amount of time and find certain... We have demon... We have log channels.

1871
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:16,129
Speaker 1: So, like, channel three, like, every line that says 03 is for us.

1872
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:19,850
Speaker 1: 10 is for, like, customer support, so I can see what everyone else is seeing.

1873
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:22,710
Speaker 0: Okay, so someone's asking best Firefox add-on, right?

1874
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:23,769
Speaker 0: I want to talk about this.

1875
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:25,430
Speaker 0: This is something that keeps coming up, right?

1876
01:38:25,491 --> 01:38:29,122
Speaker 0: People will come up and they'll ask me, you know, "What are some good Firefox

1877
01:38:29,263 --> 01:38:29,708
Speaker 0: add-ons?".

1878
01:38:30,091 --> 01:38:31,120
Speaker 0: "I just got an iPhone.

1879
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,047
Speaker 0: What apps should I

1880
01:38:32,128 --> 01:38:32,430
Speaker 0: install?".

1881
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:35,290
Speaker 0: You know, these sorts of questions, right?

1882
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,505
Speaker 0: You know, "What are some really good

1883
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:37,969
Speaker 0: apps?".

1884
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:40,506
Speaker 0: You know, "What are some really good widgets for OS X

1885
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:41,070
Speaker 0: dashboard?"

1886
01:38:41,112 --> 01:38:41,469
Speaker 0: Right?

1887
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:46,110
Speaker 0: This is the wrong question to ask, right?

1888
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,650
Speaker 0: You do not think of things in this direction.

1889
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:49,503
Speaker 0: "What apps do I

1890
01:38:49,544 --> 01:38:49,829
Speaker 0: install?".

1891
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:50,409
Speaker 0: "Bad, wet...".

1892
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:51,229
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no.

1893
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:53,767
Speaker 0: What you should do is instead say, "What do I

1894
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:54,129
Speaker 0: need?".

1895
01:38:54,933 --> 01:38:56,090
Speaker 0: That's the question you should ask.

1896
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,965
Speaker 0: "What do I need that I do not

1897
01:38:58,026 --> 01:38:58,289
Speaker 0: have?"

1898
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:58,538
Speaker 0: Right?

1899
01:38:59,111 --> 01:39:06,510
Speaker 0: As soon as you figure out what you need that you do not have, then you can go and find an app that satisfies the need.

1900
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:11,309
Speaker 0: Don't go around just installing a whole bunch of apps just because they're cool or whatever, right?

1901
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:15,630
Speaker 0: Think of what you need and then meet those needs with appropriate tools.

1902
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:21,870
Speaker 0: Don't go get this giant toolbox full of tools you're never going to use and are just cluttering up your iPhone or your Firefox, right?

1903
01:39:22,131 --> 01:39:23,250
Speaker 1: Don't think in that direction.

1904
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:23,315
Speaker 1: Yep.

1905
01:39:24,253 --> 01:39:24,905
Speaker 1: I use three.

1906
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:27,550
Speaker 1: Adblock, Delicious, and Farkit.

1907
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:28,162
Speaker 1: That's it.

1908
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:42,050
Speaker 0: I use Adblock, Delicious, and, like, you know, there's some... I use a lot of developer ones, like, you know, Web Development Toolbar and Firebug, but those are only for development, so most people don't need those.

1909
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:45,145
Speaker 1: Someone's asking, "What language of

1910
01:39:45,206 --> 01:39:45,488
Speaker 1: choice?".

1911
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:47,670
Speaker 1: Use whatever language fits whatever task you're doing.

1912
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like we said with operating systems.

1913
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:51,449
Speaker 0: Programming languages are tools.

1914
01:39:51,972 --> 01:39:55,250
Speaker 1: A real programmer, it's not a matter of what languages you know.

1915
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,729
Speaker 1: It's a matter of you know how to program.

1916
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,050
Speaker 1: If you do, you can use any language.

1917
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,630
Speaker 0: I can use any object-oriented programming language.

1918
01:40:00,771 --> 01:40:10,670
Speaker 0: If you came up with a new object-oriented programming language today and there was a book about it, a documentation that was good, I could read that documentation and write a program in that language just right away.

1919
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:12,930
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have any problem with it whatsoever, you know?

1920
01:40:13,834 --> 01:40:15,450
Speaker 0: I don't have to learn a new language.

1921
01:40:16,211 --> 01:40:20,450
Speaker 0: The big differences are syntax, right, and libraries and those sorts of things.

1922
01:40:20,631 --> 01:40:22,870
Speaker 0: As long as I have documentation, it's all good.

1923
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:33,524
Speaker 0: So figure out what your project is, what are you trying to make, and then find the best, you know, language or framework that does what you need to do, and you'll find.

1924
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:40,926
Speaker 0: on different projects you're going to use a different language, you're going to use a different framework, a different library, and that's how it goes.

1925
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:47,910
Speaker 0: So learn the fundamentals of programming, and then you should be able to use whatever tool you're going to need.

1926
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,520
Speaker 0: You mean when you're a carpenter, you don't just say, "What tool do you learn how to use?

1927
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:52,345
Speaker 0: I learned how to use the

1928
01:40:52,365 --> 01:40:52,647
Speaker 0: hammer.".

1929
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:56,690
Speaker 0: Well, when it comes time to screw, right, it's not going to work out.

1930
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,270
Speaker 0: Carpenters learn how to use any tool, right?

1931
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:04,409
Speaker 0: If you gave a carpenter a brand new carpeting tool, he wouldn't have to, you know, learn how to use it.

1932
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:09,309
Speaker 0: He can just sort of look at it and intuit, you know, what to do with it, because he's a carpenter.

1933
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,308
Speaker 0: Unless it's the whole hog.

1934
01:41:10,591 --> 01:41:11,389
Speaker 0: He knows how to carpet.

1935
01:41:11,872 --> 01:41:13,110
Speaker 1: If it's the whole hog, you might have trouble.

1936
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:14,790
Speaker 0: Maybe, but you see what I'm saying.

1937
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,210
Speaker 0: We've said this many times before.

1938
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:17,549
Speaker 1: Yep, someone has a good comment.

1939
01:41:18,413 --> 01:41:19,850
Speaker 1: You guys, it's not really a question.

1940
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:21,288
Speaker 1: It's just, it's a thank you to us.

1941
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:26,549
Speaker 1: So you guys gave me some really valuable and honest advice when I was stressing over exams.

1942
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:27,709
Speaker 1: Just want to send my thanks.

1943
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:29,160
Speaker 1: See?

1944
01:41:29,893 --> 01:41:31,069
Speaker 1: I guess people have noticed this.

1945
01:41:31,212 --> 01:41:31,670
Speaker 1: I brought it down.

1946
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:35,730
Speaker 1: I thought I bought this at an Otakon a while ago, and I just, I think it's the cutest thing ever.

1947
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:41,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rim has sort of this thing where when he knows he's going to be on camera, he sort of like intentionally does corny things.

1948
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:44,489
Speaker 0: So he explicitly like intentionally brought that downstairs.

1949
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:45,947
Speaker 1: I collect plushies.

1950
01:41:47,213 --> 01:41:49,229
Speaker 0: I have a bigger plushie collection than Rim does.

1951
01:41:49,891 --> 01:41:51,030
Speaker 0: See, now you've got him going.

1952
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:54,850
Speaker 0: He's going to start a, I might do freelance work.

1953
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:57,190
Speaker 0: I don't really know what I'm going to do at all.

1954
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:06,488
Speaker 0: So if you have, if you want me to do freelance work, if you have some work for me, you know, call me up, and I'll, you know, we can see what goes on.

1955
01:42:08,236 --> 01:42:08,469
Speaker 0: Great.

1956
01:42:08,632 --> 01:42:10,089
Speaker 0: Now we have a plushie fest.

1957
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:12,470
Speaker 1: So these are not all of them, but these are the best ones.

1958
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:13,706
Speaker 1: I got to, I got to bring these up.

1959
01:42:14,872 --> 01:42:18,790
Speaker 1: This is the, I have the Hachiroku from Initial D. I really like this.

1960
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:20,050
Speaker 0: That's a pillow, I think, technically.

1961
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:21,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's also a stuffed thing.

1962
01:42:23,892 --> 01:42:27,550
Speaker 1: The story of how I got, this Cactuar was not easy to get.

1963
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:30,950
Speaker 1: These are now common again, but there was a time when these were rare as fuck.

1964
01:42:32,172 --> 01:42:34,047
Speaker 1: And there was almost a fight, but I got it.

1965
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:39,060
Speaker 1: The dragon from Brave Story.

1966
01:42:40,724 --> 01:42:42,418
Speaker 1: I cannot express how cute I think this is.

1967
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:45,098
Speaker 1: This is possibly the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1968
01:42:47,187 --> 01:42:47,739
Speaker 1: And the Tachiko.

1969
01:42:49,403 --> 01:42:50,199
Speaker 1: One more needs to be said.

1970
01:42:51,323 --> 01:42:51,440
Speaker 0: Yep.

1971
01:42:52,161 --> 01:42:53,120
Speaker 0: I got a whole bunch upstairs.

1972
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,519
Speaker 0: I got, I have a...

1973
01:42:54,723 --> 01:42:55,559
Speaker 1: Well, you have that poly wag.

1974
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:56,519
Speaker 0: I have a poly wag.

1975
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,739
Speaker 0: That was, oh god, I think it's a poly whirl technically.

1976
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I guess it is.

1977
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,160
Speaker 0: I've got a chicken from like Cow and Chicken.

1978
01:43:03,881 --> 01:43:05,700
Speaker 0: I've got a Charmander.

1979
01:43:06,523 --> 01:43:07,114
Speaker 0: I've got Cthulhu.

1980
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:09,680
Speaker 0: I've got Calcifer.

1981
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:15,480
Speaker 0: I've got... The Calcifer.

1982
01:43:16,341 --> 01:43:18,180
Speaker 0: Oh, right, that Kitaro with also his dad.

1983
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,040
Speaker 0: Kitaro with his dad.

1984
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,295
Speaker 0: Kitaro.

1985
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:21,014
Speaker 0: Kitaro.

1986
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:28,900
Speaker 0: I've got, I don't know, I've got, I have a, I have like a little manta, like a stingray.

1987
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,110
Speaker 0: It's a little tiny stingray guy.

1988
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:31,199
Speaker 0: I got from an aquarium once.

1989
01:43:31,481 --> 01:43:32,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got a Cthulhu.

1990
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:32,940
Speaker 1: It's upstairs.

1991
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:36,720
Speaker 1: The 8086 plush was bought at a convention.

1992
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:39,760
Speaker 1: I think it was Otakon 2003.

1993
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,040
Speaker 0: I think it's Otakon 03.

1994
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:41,579
Speaker 0: We've got that.

1995
01:43:41,761 --> 01:43:44,660
Speaker 1: I walked, I carried around the con for the entire con.

1996
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,440
Speaker 1: I always had it on me for the rest of the con.

1997
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,479
Speaker 1: I would like plop down in a panel room and just sleep on it for an hour.

1998
01:43:51,484 --> 01:43:52,919
Speaker 1: I don't find Cow and Chicken funny at all.

1999
01:43:53,786 --> 01:43:54,359
Speaker 0: It's not that good.

2000
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,778
Speaker 0: Someone wants to know what our closing music is.

2001
01:43:57,862 --> 01:43:59,539
Speaker 1: Oh, should we reveal that?

2002
01:43:59,849 --> 01:43:59,893
Speaker 1: No.

2003
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:00,592
Speaker 1: Nah.

2004
01:44:01,202 --> 01:44:01,313
Speaker 1: No.

2005
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:13,600
Speaker 1: The only people who know, if you want to try to figure it out, the people who did a guest episode of Geek Nights a long time ago, uh, involving- I don't even, but they probably don't remember even.

2006
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:17,180
Speaker 1: Yes, but I told them and I gave them the song because they kept asking about it.

2007
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,619
Speaker 0: I think someone once guessed it.

2008
01:44:20,902 --> 01:44:23,500
Speaker 1: If anyone guesses it, you're awesome.

2009
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:29,620
Speaker 0: The thing of the day music- I think someone once talked to me and knew what it was and I told them, I don't remember if I told them not to tell anyone.

2010
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,020
Speaker 0: Alright, I'll give everyone a hint.

2011
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,180
Speaker 1: The thing of the day music is from the same thing that the closing music is.

2012
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:35,799
Speaker 0: That's true.

2013
01:44:37,662 --> 01:44:40,080
Speaker 0: Someone asked what the oldest computer hardware we have is.

2014
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,840
Speaker 1: The Apple II?

2015
01:44:41,181 --> 01:44:42,258
Speaker 0: I got an Apple II GS.

2016
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:43,079
Speaker 0: It's pretty old.

2017
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,500
Speaker 0: I also have a Mac Plus that has one megabyte of RAM.

2018
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,479
Speaker 1: Oh, they all know who it was at least.

2019
01:44:49,863 --> 01:44:50,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all know.

2020
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,919
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, people know what it was.

2021
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:52,740
Speaker 0: Someone's smart.

2022
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,099
Speaker 1: If you can tell me what album it was from.

2023
01:45:01,207 --> 01:45:02,960
Speaker 0: Alright, people are repeating themselves now.

2024
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,703
Speaker 0: Alright, let's do-.

2025
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:07,016
Speaker 0: when my clock here says 845, I'm gonna close it out.

2026
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:09,320
Speaker 1: Alright, so we got four minutes.

2027
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:10,259
Speaker 0: We got four minutes here.

2028
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:15,080
Speaker 1: So, if you have a question you really want us to answer, now is the chance.

2029
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:15,720
Speaker 1: This is it.

2030
01:45:15,881 --> 01:45:16,599
Speaker 0: Oldest board game.

2031
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,459
Speaker 0: The one you've owned the longest.

2032
01:45:18,701 --> 01:45:20,100
Speaker 1: Not the one that is the oldest.

2033
01:45:20,702 --> 01:45:21,779
Speaker 1: Oh, I was about to go grab one.

2034
01:45:21,881 --> 01:45:22,779
Speaker 1: At risk is pretty old.

2035
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:26,040
Speaker 0: I mean, I have some board games I've owned almost my whole life.

2036
01:45:27,547 --> 01:45:28,572
Speaker 1: I have an Uncle Wiggly.

2037
01:45:28,612 --> 01:45:30,180
Speaker 1: that was my mom's when she was a kid.

2038
01:45:30,541 --> 01:45:31,499
Speaker 0: Wow, that's a pretty old one.

2039
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:31,758
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2040
01:45:31,944 --> 01:45:32,640
Speaker 0: I've got a game.

2041
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,540
Speaker 0: It's basically- remember the Hangman game, Probe?

2042
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,389
Speaker 0: That was my mom's.

2043
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good game.

2044
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:37,720
Speaker 0: It's basically just Hangman.

2045
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:38,699
Speaker 0: It's versus Hangman.

2046
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,660
Speaker 1: It's a good game, though.

2047
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,859
Speaker 0: That's a good game to make on the computer for Probe.

2048
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:45,079
Speaker 0: That game is probably- no one owns the rights to that shit.

2049
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,760
Speaker 0: Will it be- no, the forums are staying the way they are.

2050
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,039
Speaker 0: I mean, what are we gonna change on them?

2051
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,499
Speaker 0: How they look?

2052
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:51,110
Speaker 1: Yup.

2053
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:57,477
Speaker 1: The oldest game that we own, if you want to answer the broader question, probably chess or go.

2054
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:03,000
Speaker 0: Best Beatles album is Rubber Soul.

2055
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,340
Speaker 1: Favorite Final Fantasy?

2056
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,339
Speaker 1: Not Crystal.

2057
01:46:05,922 --> 01:46:06,520
Speaker 1: Well, Crystal.

2058
01:46:06,804 --> 01:46:06,889
Speaker 0: Six.

2059
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:08,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, six.

2060
01:46:08,585 --> 01:46:09,098
Speaker 1: Maybe four.

2061
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:09,668
Speaker 0: Yeah.

2062
01:46:10,022 --> 01:46:11,500
Speaker 0: Also, Legend 3.

2063
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,701
Speaker 1: Legend 2.

2064
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:14,840
Speaker 0: Dad turns into a self bomber.

2065
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,500
Speaker 1: My favorite thing at a convention, because people always go woo, is to call them out.

2066
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,800
Speaker 1: Like, you guys go woo when I say anything you like or recognize.

2067
01:46:21,902 --> 01:46:22,839
Speaker 0: We don't have Shoki.

2068
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:23,539
Speaker 0: Should we get it?

2069
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:24,218
Speaker 0: I don't know how to play it.

2070
01:46:24,747 --> 01:46:25,119
Speaker 1: We could learn.

2071
01:46:25,442 --> 01:46:27,539
Speaker 1: I've heard- I've heard a lot of people say it's hyped.

2072
01:46:28,285 --> 01:46:28,920
Speaker 1: It's not that good.

2073
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,320
Speaker 0: I thought it was very similar to chess.

2074
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,959
Speaker 0: I'd much rather play the Star Wars table game.

2075
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:32,678
Speaker 1: Yes, Celeste for the win.

2076
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,060
Speaker 1: Moncola is not that great of a game, to be honest.

2077
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:36,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got Moncola- I had Moncola.

2078
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:40,220
Speaker 0: I actually learned how to play it very recently on my iPhone because it was a free app.

2079
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:42,000
Speaker 0: And then I was like, oh, that's how this game works?

2080
01:46:42,207 --> 01:46:42,273
Speaker 1: Eh.

2081
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:45,415
Speaker 0: Okay, we got like two minutes here.

2082
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,880
Speaker 1: Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple?

2083
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:48,580
Speaker 0: Led Zeppelin.

2084
01:46:49,063 --> 01:46:50,340
Speaker 0: Not that Deep Purple isn't awesome.

2085
01:46:50,942 --> 01:46:52,099
Speaker 0: I didn't see the Watchmen movie.

2086
01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:53,520
Speaker 1: Do another live show.

2087
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,039
Speaker 0: We'll do another live show someday.

2088
01:46:55,282 --> 01:46:56,999
Speaker 1: No, I'm not going to take my pants off.

2089
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,739
Speaker 1: I like lolcats.

2090
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,099
Speaker 1: Everyone likes lolcats.

2091
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,200
Speaker 0: You may be running- we didn't- didn't we do an episode about running a panel?

2092
01:47:06,267 --> 01:47:06,556
Speaker 1: I don't know.

2093
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:12,100
Speaker 1: I'm toying with the idea of doing a how to run a panel panel at some convention in the future.

2094
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,539
Speaker 1: No, I'm not still watching Birdie Decode because my etymotic earphones, the filter's busted, so I'm waiting for the replacement to be sent.

2095
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:25,899
Speaker 1: I'm not going to answer the question for Ro because I don't want anyone else to scoop me on it.

2096
01:47:26,304 --> 01:47:27,360
Speaker 1: I called them and they didn't answer.

2097
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:28,796
Speaker 1: I'm still trying to do that thing.

2098
01:47:30,522 --> 01:47:31,860
Speaker 0: D&D 4th Dad is just World of Warcraft.

2099
01:47:32,921 --> 01:47:33,798
Speaker 0: We played it at PAX.

2100
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,659
Speaker 0: We talked about it on a show.

2101
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,100
Speaker 1: It's great if you want to play a tabletop World of Warcraft.

2102
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:39,380
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's terrible.

2103
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,040
Speaker 0: We can- we'd need to do something different if Emily was on the live show.

2104
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,107
Speaker 1: Do the show.

2105
01:47:44,188 --> 01:47:45,099
Speaker 1: Drunk is All Hell?

2106
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:46,859
Speaker 0: No.

2107
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:50,360
Speaker 1: You realize me drunk is not that different from me sober.

2108
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,180
Speaker 1: I just smile all the time.

2109
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,020
Speaker 0: We haven't done a show on Princess Tutu, have we?

2110
01:47:53,121 --> 01:47:53,779
Speaker 0: I thought we did.

2111
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,659
Speaker 0: But we watched- we both watched the whole show.

2112
01:47:55,841 --> 01:47:58,899
Speaker 1: No, we did a show where I had seen it all and you'd seen some of it.

2113
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:00,619
Speaker 1: We did a review, not a final thoughts.

2114
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:02,480
Speaker 1: We could do a final thoughts on Princess Tutu.

2115
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,040
Speaker 1: I think Princess Tutu deserves a final thoughts.

2116
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:04,979
Speaker 0: That's a good one, yes.

2117
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:05,758
Speaker 1: That's a good show.

2118
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,060
Speaker 0: Alright, I think we're running out of time here very, very quickly.

2119
01:48:10,482 --> 01:48:12,720
Speaker 0: I would get a 360 if I had an HDTV.

2120
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:18,974
Speaker 0: The thing is, the 360 is kind of old, so I'd probably, if I did get an HDTV, would probably wait around until there was like a 460, right?

2121
01:48:19,761 --> 01:48:21,460
Speaker 1: Yes, we'll do a. there were 11 final thoughts.

2122
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:22,238
Speaker 1: It needs to be done.

2123
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:22,755
Speaker 0: Yes.

2124
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,419
Speaker 1: Anime Expo, I have no interest.

2125
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,060
Speaker 0: Probably not going to Anime Expo unless it's just really convenient.

2126
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,240
Speaker 1: Yes, Baccano is great.

2127
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,353
Speaker 1: Yes, I love Emily too.

2128
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:32,980
Speaker 1: Giant Robo, someone brought up Giant Robo.

2129
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,877
Speaker 0: We have Giant Robo, we just haven't watched it.

2130
01:48:36,141 --> 01:48:37,413
Speaker 0: We have never done a Cowabeebop.

2131
01:48:37,453 --> 01:48:38,039
Speaker 0: final thoughts?

2132
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,097
Speaker 0: We might not have.

2133
01:48:40,162 --> 01:48:43,998
Speaker 0: I never watched all of Area 88, but you can play the SNES game, and I think we're out of time.

2134
01:48:44,801 --> 01:48:45,159
Speaker 1: Wait, wait.

2135
01:48:45,483 --> 01:48:46,000
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, what?

2136
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:47,058
Speaker 0: We're talking about Giant Robo, though.

2137
01:48:47,241 --> 01:48:52,037
Speaker 1: So we're going to play with this- No, I do have the- I bought this at Otacon for like 15 bucks.

2138
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,960
Speaker 1: It's all Giant Robo in the Eye of Vogler.

2139
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:58,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you could have gotten- there's a better Slimcase box.

2140
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,479
Speaker 0: That one is kind of poofy.

2141
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:00,690
Speaker 1: The thing is, it was so cheap.

2142
01:49:02,563 --> 01:49:03,879
Speaker 1: Plus, the Eye of Vogler.

2143
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,198
Speaker 0: I know, but it's, you know, you could have gotten cheaper at the Slimcase.

2144
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,898
Speaker 1: Yes, any of you may groom me.

2145
01:49:12,443 --> 01:49:13,220
Speaker 0: Come to a convention.

2146
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,019
Speaker 0: All right, I'm going to stop the recording part at least.

2147
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:16,880
Speaker 0: We're done.

2148
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:17,937
Speaker 0: This is it for the show.

2149
01:49:18,943 --> 01:49:20,300
Speaker 0: We will do this again someday.
