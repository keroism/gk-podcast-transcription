1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,175
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 13th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:09,437
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:13,030
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,598
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,490
Speaker 0: Tonight, we're talking about a webcomic.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,145
Speaker 0: We're talking about Katie Cook's "Nothing

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:18,489
Speaker 0: Special.".

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,208
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:32,308
Speaker 0: So you may remember, a while ago, right when the quarantine started, I mentioned, uh, kind of just in the middle of a show, like, "I'm working on a project.

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,020
Speaker 0: I got this wood hurdy-gurdy kit.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,370
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a hurdy-gurdy.

12
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:36,318
Speaker 0: I'll see how that

13
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:36,419
Speaker 0: goes.".

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,119
Speaker 1: Finish your hurdy-gurdy?

15
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,478
Speaker 0: I finished it a long time ago.

16
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:39,510
Speaker 1: -And it works.

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,339
Speaker 1: -Are you playing it?

18
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,530
Speaker 0: So I did play it.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,400
Speaker 0: I can make music come out of it.

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,120
Speaker 1: Are you annoying everybody?

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,560
Speaker 0: So the cool thing is, someone posted a YouTube video where they made that kit and it sounded like shit.

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:59,179
Speaker 0: But that video, literally, once I built it and actually investigated it, the only reason that one sounded like shit is that they did not, at any point, they did not tune it at all.

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,100
Speaker 0: They built it and it started cranking the stupid thing.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,005
Speaker 0: Imagine if you just bought a random guitar, like, in a garage sale and tried to play on it without even touching all those little knobblies -at the top.

25
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,400
Speaker 0: -Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,140
Speaker 0: So I tuned it, and it sounded okay.

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,020
Speaker 0: Like, it sounded as good as I would have expected it to sound.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,227
Speaker 0: I could play some songs on it.

29
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,279
Speaker 0: I tuned the drone string to a D.

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,880
Speaker 1: Is it succeed in annoying everyone around you?

31
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,228
Speaker 0: It's not that loud.

32
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,840
Speaker 0: It basically could only annoy at most one person because we're in a quarantine.

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,334
Speaker 1: Well, that's what you're best at.

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was my goal.

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,700
Speaker 0: So I was annoying with it for maybe two days, and then one of the strings snapped.

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,208
Speaker 1: -Wah-wah-wah.

37
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:41,540
Speaker 0: -Because the strings are basically just nylon fishing line.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,456
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what guitar strings are for every guitar.

39
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,159
Speaker 1: that's not, you know...

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,720
Speaker 0: Oh, nah, all the lower strings are at least, like, brass-wrapped or whatever.

41
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:51,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean...

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Speaker 0: Every guitar I've ever had, only a couple strings were just nylon.

43
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,100
Speaker 1: Right, but the point is that, like, you know, all the cheap guitars of the world have plastic nylon strings, right?

44
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,800
Speaker 1: The fancy electric guitars have metal strings, right?

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,000
Speaker 0: But anyway, these strings were not just cheap nylon.

46
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,779
Speaker 0: They were, like, literally just fishing line.

47
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,860
Speaker 0: So I bought some real guitar strings, and I'm going to restring it, but I'm going to have to be delicate with it.

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,236
Speaker 0: I might have to actually reinforce it a little bit, because a real string...

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,580
Speaker 1: Are the guitar strings the same, like, notes as what the hurdy-gurdy is?

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,659
Speaker 0: I mean, it wouldn't matter, because with the frequencies, like, the way this thing would work, I just need a string that I could tune to a D vibration, and I'm good to go.

51
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,639
Speaker 0: I could probably tune it to something else.

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,056
Speaker 1: I was saying, you might want to, like, you know, it might be better to look for piano strings, right, that are the right...

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,113
Speaker 0: - What do you think's in a piano?

54
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:40,600
Speaker 0: - You have more choices.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,320
Speaker 0: Piano is a piano wire.

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,740
Speaker 1: Oh, right, but I was saying, you get the right, you can have more choices.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,620
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I mean, yes, that is the kind of thing I did.

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:03:05,299
Speaker 0: So I got some strings that I could tune to D. The thing I'm curious about is if I can do this without snapping the hurdy-gurdy, because if any of you don't play string instruments, not that I play string instruments, I was told at a young age that I should never play a string instrument, because I was terrible at it, preternaturally so.

59
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,660
Speaker 0: But, like a violin, look at a violin.

60
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:18,020
Speaker 0: If you string it, there's, like, 30 or 40 pounds of force trying to snap the violin in two right at the middle, because the strings are tight.

61
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,279
Speaker 1: Right, but almost always, it's the strings that break and go doing.

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,600
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I'm saying the violin would just collapse if you, like, tightened everything too tight.

63
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,978
Speaker 1: Yes, but that hardly ever happens.

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,185
Speaker 0: - Yes, however...

65
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,659
Speaker 1: - Usually the strings will break first.

66
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:48,019
Speaker 0: Or the bridge will... Anyway, this thing, because it is not, like, a crafted instrument, but a woodcraft that I piece together like a big jigsaw puzzle, I'm not confident that it could actually hold the tension of two real strings fully tensioned.

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,600
Speaker 1: Why not buy some cheapo nylon guitar strings instead of the good ones?

68
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:59,408
Speaker 0: Even nylon guitar strings, to tension them to the point where this would sound good, as opposed to just as good as I expected it to sound.

69
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,260
Speaker 0: based on the kit, I don't know.

70
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,280
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna play with it and see what I can do.

71
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,900
Speaker 1: Why not go and buy a fucking fishing line?

72
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,659
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's what it came with.

73
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:13,038
Speaker 0: I could do that, but it will never sound better than it sounded when I first made it.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,142
Speaker 1: Why not?

75
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,212
Speaker 1: You could buy some cheap... You could buy, right?

76
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,459
Speaker 1: I don't know if ukulele strings are a good idea, but...

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,715
Speaker 0: - Ukulele!

78
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:22,900
Speaker 1: - Right.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,191
Speaker 1: You could buy, you know, those, like, souvenir, cheapo, like, children guitar.

80
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,309
Speaker 1: that, like, you basically... - It's gonna break and you throw it out.

81
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,340
Speaker 0: - That's just that fishing line in 'em.

82
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,880
Speaker 1: Right, that's like... You know what I'm talking about?

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,560
Speaker 0: Yep, so the other thing I might do is...

84
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,220
Speaker 1: The ones that are, like, party favor guitars.

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,778
Speaker 1: Like, you'll hand them out at, like, a party or a compartment or some shit, and, like, they have a couple strings and go jing, jing, jing, and that's about it.

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,377
Speaker 0: So the good news is I did an experiment...

87
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,320
Speaker 1: It's like a plastic thing in the shape of a guitar.

88
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,692
Speaker 0: This thing only needs two strings.

89
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:50,520
Speaker 0: It's a simple hurdy-gurdy.

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,300
Speaker 0: There's a drone string and there's a melody string.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,242
Speaker 0: - Oh, okay.

92
00:04:53,262 --> 00:05:03,120
Speaker 0: - So I put just one... I replaced the drone string with, like, a G, like, a metal, like, a full-on guitar string, and I tensioned it to the point where it would play a sound.

93
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:09,580
Speaker 0: that was, like, the note I wanted, and it seemed that the structural integrity was totally fine with that.

94
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:13,780
Speaker 0: So I just have to try to figure out if it can take about double that amount of tension.

95
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,783
Speaker 0: - All right.

96
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,140
Speaker 0: - I might just have to reinforce the bridge.

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,251
Speaker 1: Yeah.

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:28,572
Speaker 1: - But... - You could always... You know, like, a lot of people make, you know, that are sound actually pretty good, like, you know, cigar box guitars with, like, you know... So you could just get, like, you know, Rubberband or something.

99
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 1: I don't know.

100
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:37,560
Speaker 0: Or what I might just do, if I really want to play this, I mean, the right answer is just to buy or make a real hurdy-gurdy instead of one that is basically a giant jigsaw puzzle.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,888
Speaker 0: - Sure.

102
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,519
Speaker 0: - So we'll see.

103
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,760
Speaker 1: Or just give up on this and stop making annoying noises and find something for you.

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:54,860
Speaker 0: No, no, no, because the magic of a hurdy-gurdy is that it does not require the skills that I'm preternaturally bad at, which is fingering on frets, I just can't fucking do.

105
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,140
Speaker 0: Like, that's just, like, I have a weird blind spot where I cannot play stringed instruments to any capacity.

106
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,299
Speaker 0: And also I'm not good with a bow.

107
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,220
Speaker 0: So with my powers combined, like, it's a perfect storm of a violin sounding worse, as bad as possible.

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,498
Speaker 1: Why don't you, if your goal is to make annoying noises, why don't you just buy one of those, like, automatones where you, like, you know...

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,559
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, wait till we get to my thing of the day.

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Speaker 1: Okay, isn't it another automaton thing of the day?

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,360
Speaker 0: Do you remember the Sing-a-ma-jig?

112
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,059
Speaker 0: The Sing-a-ma-jig?

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,864
Speaker 1: -It was a toy?

114
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,040
Speaker 1: -Yeah, the thing you're obsessed with, right?

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,585
Speaker 1: -That guy?

116
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,030
Speaker 1: No?

117
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,415
Speaker 1: -What?

118
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:30,799
Speaker 0: No?

119
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:33,139
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought that was the name of the big...

120
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,499
Speaker 0: No, it was a toy from, like, a long time ago.

121
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,420
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, I just Googled it and I've never seen it before.

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
Speaker 0: Okay, good, that's my thing of the day.

123
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,838
Speaker 0: But, uh, remember...

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,420
Speaker 1: But it looks like an automaton inside a stuffed animal.

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,180
Speaker 0: Sort of, yeah, but it predates the automaton by a wide margin.

126
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,146
Speaker 0: -All right.

127
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:51,900
Speaker 0: -But, yeah, basically, if I want to be a true Annoy-a-tron, I have my trumpet.

128
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,979
Speaker 0: That is louder than any stringed instrument could ever possibly be.

129
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,680
Speaker 1: Annoy-a-tron is a character in Hearthstone/World of Warcraft.

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,153
Speaker 0: Ah.

131
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,880
Speaker 0: All right, it's Wednesday.

132
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,880
Speaker 0: You guys want to hear about anime and comics, you don't want to hear about my hurdy-gurdy.

133
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,840
Speaker 0: So, there is actually a lot of anime news, even though a lot of it follows a theme that you're going to see momentarily.

134
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:14,739
Speaker 0: So, what do you got?

135
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:38,380
Speaker 1: I just wanted to first, you know, make people aware that certain... I think we might have said this on recent Wednesday episodes, but it bears repeating, that certain animes that were recently the ones that we talked about on the show, because they were the kind that are in the movie theater in the US, when you can still go to the movie theater, are now available streaming in various forms.

136
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:42,859
Speaker 1: So, I know that you can see Promare streaming somewhere, you might have to pay money for it.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,804
Speaker 0: -Yep, it's worth it.

138
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:51,216
Speaker 1: -I know that... Um, Song of the Sea, I think, is streaming somewhere, right?

139
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:53,399
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

140
00:07:53,821 --> 00:08:12,514
Speaker 1: So, go back and look at all past Geek Nights Wednesdays, and I think the vast majority of the anime that we discussed there, movie-wise, should mostly all now be available streaming somewhere, or, you know, pay a few dollars, like four dollars on Amazon to watch it, or, yarr.

141
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,320
Speaker 0: Honestly, though, the pay four-ish dollars to watch it on Amazon option, it worked.

142
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,834
Speaker 0: Like, if you've never used that option, it works real well.

143
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,518
Speaker 1: I've been opening myself up to that option more and more, because when you think about it...

144
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Speaker 0: Like, you wanna watch Parasite?

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,119
Speaker 0: Like, I'm pretty sure you can do that.

146
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, you can, absolutely.

147
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,078
Speaker 1: But it's like, think about it, what's Netflix?

148
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,957
Speaker 1: a month, 20 bucks, something like that, 15, I don't know.

149
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,971
Speaker 1: -I don't even know anymore, right?

150
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:42,578
Speaker 0: -When I was a kid, to rent a movie, I would go to Blockbuster, and it cost four dollars to rent a VHS tape.

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,272
Speaker 0: -But that was for 19, like, 91.

152
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,680
Speaker 0: -That was a lot of money.

153
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,020
Speaker 1: Right, so let's think about, you know, let's say you pay one of those, like, annual subscriptions for, like, a niche streaming site.

154
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:58,880
Speaker 1: Like, I think the Criterion Channel is, like, 100-something dollars a year is their cheapest price, right?

155
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:08,098
Speaker 1: So, 100-something dollars a year divided by 12 is, you know, like, eight-something bucks a month, maybe, right?

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,380
Speaker 1: Seven, eight, somewhere in there, I guess.

157
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:11,199
Speaker 1: I don't know, math.

158
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,940
Speaker 1: The point is, let's see, 100 -- I don't want to be wrong and stupid.

159
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,759
Speaker 1: 8.3, I was good, okay.

160
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:19,700
Speaker 1: Eight dollars a month.

161
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:26,880
Speaker 1: The point is, okay, so if you watch two movies a month, you're paying, like, four dollars a movie, right?

162
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:31,740
Speaker 1: So, if you're watching movies every day, you're gonna watch every movie on that whole frickin' channel.

163
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,599
Speaker 1: It's not that big.

164
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,779
Speaker 0: -I mean, remember back when we lived in Beacon and weren't doing a podcast yet?

165
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:36,786
Speaker 0: We got, like --.

166
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:37,760
Speaker 1: -And we watched every --.

167
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:40,199
Speaker 0: -We got, like, five Netflix DVDs a week, and we watched them all.

168
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:49,480
Speaker 1: -So, with the streaming services, if you're watching several times a week or if you're one of those people, you know, binge-watching the TV shows, then you're getting your money's worth, right?

169
00:09:49,961 --> 00:10:00,400
Speaker 1: If you're like me, where all you really watch is, like, a few, like, the excellent movies, right, and you don't even watch the man movies and you don't watch the TV shows too much, right?

170
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,460
Speaker 1: It's like Netflix is -- I'm watching "The Castlevanias" and "Dragon Prince," that sort of thing, so it's kind of worth it, right?

171
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:13,179
Speaker 1: But, you know, the A-plus movies are not really on most of these services, right?

172
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,279
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you want to even watch fucking -- I guess, you know, Disney has all Star Warses, but those aren't the Star Warses you want to --.

173
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaker 0: -Well, you know, I'll put it this way.

174
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:29,337
Speaker 0: Every time, 100% of the times in recent memory, I've typed the name of a movie into, like, Netflix, 'cause I thought, "Oh, I'd like to watch that

175
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:29,680
Speaker 0: movie.".

176
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:30,998
Speaker 0: They have not had it.

177
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,720
Speaker 1: -It's almost never there, almost, right?

178
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:45,698
Speaker 1: So, often, these days, when I search for a movie I want to watch legally, for some reason, right, it almost always pops up and says, "You can watch this on YouTube, Amazon Prime," right?

179
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,220
Speaker 1: You can watch it at, like, these four different places, and they all cost, you know, iTunes.

180
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,935
Speaker 0: -Like, four-ish dollars.

181
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:52,380
Speaker 0: -Right.

182
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,820
Speaker 1: Three to four dollars to watch it once, right?

183
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,357
Speaker 1: Actually, "Lord of the Rings" trilogy extended edition, I own digitally on Amazon.

184
00:10:59,378 --> 00:10:59,539
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

185
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,975
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, buying -- like, promo.

186
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:07,220
Speaker 0: right now, actually, you can't stream promo, you can't rent it on Amazon, but you can buy it for 20 bucks.

187
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,580
Speaker 1: -I mean, are you gonna buy a Booray?

188
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Speaker 0: -No, you can buy the digital access forever.

189
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,140
Speaker 1: -That's what I'm saying, is, like, why would you buy a Booray?

190
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,519
Speaker 0: -Yeah, exactly, 'cause I don't think Amazon will disappear, and if Amazon disappears and I lose whatever movies I have bought over the years, then --.

191
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,350
Speaker 1: -The point is, even though you're buying it, that's still streaming.

192
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,179
Speaker 1: You're not downloading it.

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,497
Speaker 0: -True.

194
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaker 0: But I can watch it an infinite number of times at very high quality.

195
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,099
Speaker 1: -The movies that you're thinking that you should be watching are now available to watch legally online if you want to.

196
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,695
Speaker 0: -Oh, like here, "The Night is Short, Walk on

197
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:37,918
Speaker 0: Girl.".

198
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,229
Speaker 0: Rent it, $3.99 from Amazon.

199
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,371
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

200
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,000
Speaker 0: That movie's beautiful.

201
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,659
Speaker 1: -Maybe I will.

202
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
Speaker 0: -I would watch that movie again.

203
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,872
Speaker 0: That movie is so good.

204
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:46,580
Speaker 1: -It's good.

205
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,600
Speaker 1: All right, so, that's news one.

206
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:58,959
Speaker 1: News two, speaking of movies, right, the movie you want to watch is, you know, Miyazaki, the man who is retired 20 times and come out of retirement 21 times.

207
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:06,839
Speaker 1: Michael Jordan is jealous of how many times Miyazaki has come out of retirement to animate again.

208
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:13,297
Speaker 1: It's been a while since he's come out for his not, I don't believe, final time.

209
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,732
Speaker 1: The point is that --.

210
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,900
Speaker 0: -You're talking about the 36 minutes of that film.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 1: -Right.

212
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:31,780
Speaker 1: The film that he is working on, which is called "Kimitachiwa do Ikiruka," which means -- "How Do You Live," which is supposed to be amazing.

213
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,523
Speaker 1: Who knows?

214
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,539
Speaker 1: It's a film Miyazaki's making, right?

215
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:46,377
Speaker 1: Despite the coronavirus delaying or severely hindering the production of many other cinematic works, this movie, they've managed to animate by hand 36 minutes.

216
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,760
Speaker 1: There is no computer involved.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,140
Speaker 1: They're animating it by hand the old-fashioned way.

218
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,765
Speaker 1: -Interesting.

219
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:53,457
Speaker 1: -'Cause he's got nothing better to do.

220
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,040
Speaker 1: He doesn't care how much money it costs.

221
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:56,868
Speaker 1: He wants to die.

222
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,620
Speaker 1: making the movie, most likely, right?

223
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,199
Speaker 1: That's what it looks like.

224
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,820
Speaker 0: -I feel that he says they say the movie is a big fantastical story.

225
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,358
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it other than that.

226
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,860
Speaker 1: -Who knows anything about it except him, right?

227
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,020
Speaker 1: But the point is, he looks like a captain who wants to go down with the ship, so he keeps going out for another one.

228
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,772
Speaker 0: -God, I just keep thinking that one episode of "Horatio" where the captain's like, "Run up to that fort and attack it so that I may

229
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,115
Speaker 0: die.".

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:31,659
Speaker 1: -Right, like Antoine de Saint-Éjourpéry, who went out in his plane in the horrible situation, right, because clearly he was asking for it, right?

231
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:37,920
Speaker 0: -Or a scene involving a character in "BoJack Horseman" that I will not say any more on because that would be a spoiler.

232
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,043
Speaker 1: -Okay.

233
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,180
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, they're still making it.

234
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,599
Speaker 1: They've animated 36 minutes, so at this rate, if he lives for a few more years, it will come out.

235
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,800
Speaker 0: -But this article with that promise also comes a threat.

236
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:50,996
Speaker 1: -Yes.

237
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,020
Speaker 1: Well, so his son, his son Goro, with four arms.

238
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,558
Speaker 0: -Goro made a good movie.

239
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:09,420
Speaker 1: -The four-armed animator is making a completely computer-generated anime 'cause his dad's not using the computers, so he's like, "All right, I'll use all the computers while you're not using them.

240
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,277
Speaker 1: They're just sitting there not working and not doing

241
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:11,580
Speaker 1: anything.".

242
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,017
Speaker 0: -Yeah, just come on.

243
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,719
Speaker 0: That's how you get that ghost in the shell.

244
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,680
Speaker 1: -Right, so Goro is making an animated film that is an adaptation of a book from England about a very wise girl.

245
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,140
Speaker 1: Somebody, I'm sure, knows what book that is.

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,646
Speaker 1: I don't.

247
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,296
Speaker 1: -Yep.

248
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,478
Speaker 0: I feel like you can narrow it down to a couple.

249
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,019
Speaker 1: -That's going to be a CG-animated film that will probably come out well before "How Do You

250
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,220
Speaker 1: Live?"

251
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:34,669
Speaker 1: comes out.

252
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:35,057
Speaker 1: -Yep.

253
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,447
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

254
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:47,280
Speaker 1: -And it probably has a higher chance of being finished also because computers and young person and trying to actually make money and not trying to die while working on an anime.

255
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,000
Speaker 0: -Yep, though while some films like that are continuing to make progress, other films are just being delayed.

256
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,820
Speaker 0: Like, there is a general broad slowdown in anime production for all the reasons you can imagine.

257
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:08,317
Speaker 0: So, for example, the 23rd Pokemon film has now been delayed due to COVID, and the studio can't work on it effectively, so they've delayed it.

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:27,400
Speaker 1: -I think we also mentioned probably last Wednesday episode that Cartoon Saloon working on "Wolfwalkers" also has an excellent work-at-home situation, and they're progressing just fine, and we also talked about how that's going to be supposedly maybe only on Apple+ when a TV+ goes.

259
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,313
Speaker 0: -Which means I will literally, like, DM Tom Moore, "Cash," and then pirate it.

260
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:33,958
Speaker 0: because -- -We'll see what happens.

261
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,979
Speaker 0: -'Cause I'm not using that Apple platform.

262
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,350
Speaker 0: I'm not paying for that.

263
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,640
Speaker 1: -We'll see how it goes.

264
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,039
Speaker 1: Maybe go to someone's house who has an Apple TV, watch it.

265
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,443
Speaker 1: I don't know.

266
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:45,180
Speaker 0: -I'm telling you, just DM him, like, a link to, like, send him some cash.

267
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:45,765
Speaker 0: It'll work.

268
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:47,179
Speaker 1: -We'll see what happens.

269
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,939
Speaker 0: -Here's 20 bucks.

270
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,299
Speaker 0: But what I'm surprised about there is that I knew there were a lot of Pokemon movies, but I don't think about them.

271
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 0: We've reviewed, like, two of them on "Geeknights" ever.

272
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:02,672
Speaker 0: I didn't realize it was the 23rd Pokemon movie that is being delayed.

273
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:03,260
Speaker 1: -Oh, yeah, I know.

274
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,115
Speaker 1: All those franchises that don't die just keep having movies -- "One Piece" movies,

275
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:08,559
Speaker 1: "Naruto.".

276
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,719
Speaker 0: -Why can't I have 23 "Ghost in the Shell" standalone complex movies?

277
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,230
Speaker 1: -'Cause they're a lot harder to make, and they make less money.

278
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,140
Speaker 0: -Yep, exactly.

279
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Speaker 1: -It costs more money to make.

280
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,499
Speaker 0: -Instead, we get "Ghost in the Shell" goes to work.

281
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,991
Speaker 1: -But the thing is, there are plenty of movies for things like

282
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:25,439
Speaker 1: "Modica.".

283
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,756
Speaker 1: "Modica" is like, "I got a handful of

284
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:26,979
Speaker 1: movies.".

285
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
Speaker 0: -Yeah, but they didn't need a mod.

286
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,180
Speaker 0: The show "Modica" ended perfectly.

287
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:31,575
Speaker 1: Any more -- Like, "Cowboy

288
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:31,758
Speaker 1: Bebop.".

289
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:33,797
Speaker 1: "Cowboy Bebop" didn't even need a movie.

290
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:38,939
Speaker 0: It was okay that they made one movie, but they did not need to make more movies.

291
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,344
Speaker 1: -Anyway.

292
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:49,711
Speaker 0: -Anyway, the real delay news that's a big deal is that, for the first time in 45 years, "Sazai-san" is airing reruns.

293
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,920
Speaker 0: -Mm-hmm.

294
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,439
Speaker 0: -Because they can't keep producing the show.

295
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,290
Speaker 1: -So, people don't know about

296
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,159
Speaker 1: "Sazai-san.".

297
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,296
Speaker 1: "Sazai-san" is sort of -- It's not -- The content isn't very

298
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:00,720
Speaker 1: "Simpsons-esque.".

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,789
Speaker 0: -It's not the "Simpsons of Japan," like people like to say, except in the sense that it is a very long-running animated series about a family that is broadly popular.

300
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:13,560
Speaker 1: -Yes, it is a very popular, very long-running animated series in Japan.

301
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:18,480
Speaker 1: that doesn't look like anime that people outside Japan don't care about, right?

302
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,040
Speaker 0: -And you might already take issue, but "Simpsons" isn't popular anymore.

303
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,439
Speaker 0: If it wasn't popular, they wouldn't still be making it.

304
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,980
Speaker 0: It's more popular than you think.

305
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,760
Speaker 1: -Right, and also, "Sazai-san," the feeling I get is that it's about as popular in Japan as "Simpsons" is in the US, right, relatively speaking.

306
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,239
Speaker 0: -Everyone at least knows about it.

307
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,847
Speaker 1: -And they just -- You know, yeah, it's like people -- Anyone in Japan, if you showed them characters from "Sazai-san," you'd say, "What is

308
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:41,029
Speaker 1: this?".

309
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:41,373
Speaker 1: They go, "It's

310
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:41,858
Speaker 1: Sazai-san.".

311
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,027
Speaker 1: They know exactly what it is.

312
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:43,812
Speaker 1: -But what's fascinating is why.

313
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,320
Speaker 0: This is why I list these three things.

314
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,740
Speaker 0: The "Pokemon" movie is probably --.

315
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,880
Speaker 1: -Well, I think, didn't some of the voice actors pass away 'cause they were so old, I think, was also with it?

316
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,292
Speaker 0: -Their age is actually part of the problem, but the specifics are --.

317
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:56,180
Speaker 0: Well, contrast these three.

318
00:17:56,481 --> 00:18:04,980
Speaker 0: So, Goro can probably move on with the CG stuff 'cause that's easy to do work from home, and Ghibli has infinite resources to make this situation work, so they're still animating.

319
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:15,759
Speaker 0: "Pokemon" movie needs, like, a big -- Like, there's a lot of contributors to that kind of, like, crank-it-out movie for a franchise, so it's probably easier to just delay it than try to keep that team going.

320
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:20,079
Speaker 0: But "Sazai-san," I'm just gonna quote this article because it says it pretty eloquently.

321
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,399
Speaker 0: "Recording new episodes seems especially difficult for the program.

322
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:28,974
Speaker 0: Many of the actors are older and might not have the necessary equipment or environment at home to voice the

323
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:29,195
Speaker 0: show.".

324
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,860
Speaker 0: It's the voice acting, primarily.

325
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,838
Speaker 0: The voice acting -- Like, you can't just change the voice of one of these kind of characters.

326
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,500
Speaker 1: -As far as I'm aware, they voice act that show with everyone in the same room, and they've been doing it that way forever.

327
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,159
Speaker 0: -I've heard that, but I never confirmed that, but I do believe it's true.

328
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,880
Speaker 1: -Right, and they've been doing it so long that, much like "The Simpsons," the voice actors are very old now, right?

329
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:55,640
Speaker 1: It's like, when they started doing it, they were young, and they've had that same job for a super long time, right?

330
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,619
Speaker 1: It's like, find a picture of the lady who's, like, the voice of Bart now.

331
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,317
Speaker 1: How old is she?

332
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,080
Speaker 1: -Oh, and I got to point something out.

333
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,899
Speaker 0: I got to point something out to you kids.

334
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:09,975
Speaker 0: This is the first time in 45 years "Sazai-san" has run reruns, but "Sazai-san" is older than 45 years.

335
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,660
Speaker 0: You realize the first time they ran reruns was during the oil crisis in 1973.

336
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,599
Speaker 0: The show had already been running for a long time before that.

337
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,019
Speaker 1: -Yeah, you can't even begin to -- It's like, other things you might try to, like, watch all of.

338
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:25,455
Speaker 1: Like, you could watch all of "The

339
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:25,839
Speaker 1: Simpsons.".

340
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:28,617
Speaker 1: You can't even begin to try to watch all of

341
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 1: "Sazai-san.".

342
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:37,200
Speaker 1: Even if you were fluent in Japanese and had it all on a hard drive, you couldn't -- It's, like, impossible.

343
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,952
Speaker 0: -Like, "Sazai-san" started airing in 1969 and has not stopped.

344
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,120
Speaker 1: -Nope.

345
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,300
Speaker 0: -But, yeah, even "The Simpsons" is a fairly difficult challenge.

346
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:57,780
Speaker 0: "The Simpsons" has been airing continuously for all -- for pretty much as long as I've been alive because I watched it continuously up until it got bad, and I stopped in season 12.

347
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,096
Speaker 1: -"The Simpsons" started when I was in, like, fourth or fifth grade.

348
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:00,219
Speaker 0: -Yep.

349
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:03,839
Speaker 0: I even saw the "Tracy Ullman Show" stuff before "The Simpsons" came out.

350
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 1: -That's why I said fourth or fifth.

351
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,020
Speaker 1: I think the actual show was fifth.

352
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,446
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

353
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:07,771
Speaker 1: -Great.

354
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:08,259
Speaker 1: Anyway.

355
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,860
Speaker 0: -So, anyway, that's all.

356
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:23,160
Speaker 0: So, the anime industry is gonna have trouble just like every other industry is, but, thankfully, so many things were far enough along in the pipeline to where there is still a lot of new and newish content that we're gonna get.

357
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:31,319
Speaker 0: And, also, honestly, if you're running out of stuff to watch, there's a lot of great anime just, like, randomly on Crunchyroll that you might have never thought to watch.

358
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,160
Speaker 0: Like, that was the time to go into the backlog.

359
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:41,680
Speaker 1: -Oh, I just remembered one more news that I didn't send Rim a link for, but I did post it in our forum, so you should come to our forum, and you would have gotten this news early.

360
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,580
Speaker 0: -'Cause I got a bunch more news I can crank out.

361
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,514
Speaker 1: -Okay, no, just a short one.

362
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:45,858
Speaker 1: -All right.

363
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:56,900
Speaker 1: -So, Jeff Lemire, favorite comic writer of "Geek Nights," did, a while ago, when Vertigo Comics was still a thing, did a series called "Sweet Teeth" that I own all of.

364
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,080
Speaker 0: -Oh, yeah, I only read the beginning of that.

365
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,935
Speaker 0: I never read it anymore.

366
00:20:58,955 --> 00:20:59,118
Speaker 0: -Yeah.

367
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,209
Speaker 1: I have all the volumes.

368
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,360
Speaker 1: I didn't finish it, but I will.

369
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,938
Speaker 1: I enjoyed every page that I did read of it.

370
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,598
Speaker 0: -It gave me that Jeff Lemire feeling.

371
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,720
Speaker 1: -Yeah, so, that series is being made for Netflix, supposedly.

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Speaker 1: We'll see how far along that gets, but it looks like, you know, I think someone else had, like, paid to do it and then ended up not doing it, and now Netflix is paying somebody to produce.

373
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,100
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be live-action, not animated, but it's still based on a comic book, right?

374
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,131
Speaker 1: So, that's gonna be pretty interesting, and I think it might get people to read the book, as usually happens.

375
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,776
Speaker 0: -Yep, DC Comics Suite 2, the set to be adapted to Netflix by Robert Downey

376
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,079
Speaker 0: Jr.'

377
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:40,806
Speaker 0: 's production company.

378
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,259
Speaker 1: -Yep, there you go.

379
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,860
Speaker 1: So, that's gonna be fascinating.

380
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,264
Speaker 1: Give me "The

381
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:45,769
Speaker 1: Descender.".

382
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,345
Speaker 1: "The Descender" -- -Oh,

383
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,072
Speaker 1: "Driller."

384
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:53,334
Speaker 1: -That would make me watch a TV show as if you made -- I've already read the whole thing,

385
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:53,699
Speaker 1: "Descender.".

386
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:03,120
Speaker 0: -Oh, I have not, but I do know that the thing I know that I know will just keep coming up, the Chekhov's "Driller," because "Driller" is a goddamn killer.

387
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,239
Speaker 1: -"Killer" is a real killer.

388
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Speaker 0: Real killer.

389
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,799
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, you don't even know.

390
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,720
Speaker 0: -Speaking of killers, Scott talked about this.

391
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,993
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna belabor the point, but I'm catching up on

392
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 0: "Castlevania.".

393
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,178
Speaker 0: I just watched all of season two.

394
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:26,380
Speaker 0: All I will say is that I did not expect certain things to be resolved so quickly and relatively easily.

395
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,659
Speaker 1: -Season two is a lot -- Season two is a lot, like, extravagant, right?

396
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,900
Speaker 1: "Dracula's Castle," "Dracula," big bad guys, right?

397
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,000
Speaker 0: -Season two, you said this, but I just have to reiterate.

398
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,279
Speaker 0: Season two escalates rapidly, and when a character's like, "I'm gonna do the thing," and the thing is something ridiculous and crazy, you might think, "Okay, that's the arc,".

399
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,700
Speaker 0: and then they do it in the next scene.

400
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,419
Speaker 1: -Season two is definitely made.

401
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,139
Speaker 1: You could tell when they were making it.

402
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:55,800
Speaker 1: This could be the last season, right?

403
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,060
Speaker 1: So they had to do the big ending.

404
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,900
Speaker 1: -It could have been the last season.

405
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Speaker 1: -Yeah, and still leave opening for a third.

406
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,640
Speaker 1: The third season, it definitely feels like it was made knowing there was gonna be a fourth season.

407
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,040
Speaker 1: It's just a bridge, right?

408
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,740
Speaker 1: The third season is all the characters left over from the second season are all separated, and you're skipping and looking.

409
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:19,219
Speaker 1: The camera's switching between the different groups of characters, seeing what they're up to.

410
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 0: -It's an old trope, but I love the hell out of that trope.

411
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,220
Speaker 1: -But they do not converge in a snatch moment.

412
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:32,720
Speaker 1: The season three ends, and the snatch moment is clearly early in season four, if not the very beginning of season four.

413
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,278
Speaker 0: -And based on now that I know more about the threads of, like, all those different bits, I'm real excited for season three, which I'm gonna watch pretty quick.

414
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,778
Speaker 1: -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,460
Speaker 0: -All right, so I guess now it's time for... Things of the Day!

416
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,999
Speaker 0: So, speaking of annoy-a-trons, there was an old toy called a Sing-a-ma-jig.

417
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:58,820
Speaker 0: I got to look up exactly when this thing came out.

418
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,077
Speaker 0: It was, like, early 2000s or maybe early 2010s.

419
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,614
Speaker 0: Like, it's this old --.

420
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:14,299
Speaker 1: -I mean, the name definitely sounds like the name of an old toy, but I've never heard of it before, and I didn't have any memory of it whatsoever, and I searched for it, and I'm like, "Okay, there it

421
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,360
Speaker 1: is.".

422
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:24,139
Speaker 0: -So, the story is that supposedly -- Like, basically, it's a little doll, and you're like -- Every time you squeeze the doll, it'll sing, like, one more word in a song that's programmed into it, and that's it.

423
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,058
Speaker 0: That's what it does.

424
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,420
Speaker 1: -So, it's not Teddy Ruxpin with a cassette player in his ass.

425
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,777
Speaker 0: -Do you?

426
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:33,059
Speaker 0: You can, like, control the rate that it sings, and its mouth will move, and, like, that's pretty much it.

427
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:46,200
Speaker 0: But there was a promotional, special, limited-edition one that was made to sing the All-Star song, and the little Sing-a-ma-jig is wearing the suspenders and the black shirt and the tie.

428
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,704
Speaker 1: -Okay.

429
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:49,340
Speaker 0: -And it's really hard to find.

430
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,192
Speaker 0: So, Hank Green --.

431
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,739
Speaker 1: -So, you went on eBay and got one, or you made one?

432
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Speaker 0: -So, Hank Green, like, told John Green that this thing existed, and then John Green, like, waited his mission to find one of them, and he got one, and there's a video of him playing it and then him explaining the deal with it, and that's my thing of the day.

433
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:10,414
Speaker 0: You're an All-Star.

434
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:10,556
Speaker 0: -Okay.

435
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:20,439
Speaker 0: -And the video ends with someone else got a bunch of Sing-a-ma-jigs, reprogrammed them, and then made them sing an All-Star chorus with all the parts.

436
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,462
Speaker 1: -All right.

437
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,987
Speaker 1: So, this is a thing of the day that would be best for Monday or Tuesday, but you know what?

438
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:27,900
Speaker 1: You're getting it on Wednesday.

439
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:28,880
Speaker 1: Deal with it, right?

440
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:32,388
Speaker 1: So, here's a YouTube channel called Some Computer Guy that only has 309 subscribers.

441
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,019
Speaker 0: -It's got 310 as of dateline now, and guess what?

442
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,465
Speaker 1: -Whoa.

443
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:49,920
Speaker 1: And, basically, this guy, he -- You know, a lot of people know about old computers with vacuum tubes or paper tape or punch cards, right?

444
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,537
Speaker 1: But few people have actually seen those or know how to operate them.

445
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:53,679
Speaker 1: -Yep.

446
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,143
Speaker 1: -Right?

447
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,200
Speaker 1: I don't know how to operate one.

448
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,020
Speaker 1: I would need to read a manual and get help.

449
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,237
Speaker 0: -I learned in RIT --.

450
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:06,960
Speaker 1: -Even though I know the principle behind the mechanism of computation that it uses, right, I don't know the physical interface and how to use the machine.

451
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,678
Speaker 0: -There was an Altair emulator that was, like, in a web browser that I remember we found when we were at RIT.

452
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,360
Speaker 1: -That's at least -- Oh, Altair, right.

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Speaker 0: -Yeah, but I did learn it enough.

454
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,379
Speaker 0: Like, I made it do a thing, and then I was bored with that and done with it.

455
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,060
Speaker 1: -Yeah, this would actually be quite similar to an Altair with a row of switches on the front, only this is, like, an Altair was a home PC, right?

456
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,100
Speaker 1: So you could think of, like, an Altair being basically, like, one of these for the home, sort of, right?

457
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,216
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this computer he's got is a cell, an SEL-810A.

458
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,457
Speaker 1: It was used for a lot of things back in the '60s.

459
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:51,440
Speaker 1: This particular one he's got was used for managing the pressure of, like, a gas pipeline somewhere, and it was in operation between 1969 and 2006.

460
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,360
Speaker 0: -Okay, so this computer started operation the same year that Sunlight-san started airing.

461
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,258
Speaker 1: -Sure, yes.

462
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:01,920
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so he's got this computer.

463
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,359
Speaker 1: He knows how to fix it.

464
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,509
Speaker 1: He did fix it.

465
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:05,257
Speaker 1: -Whoa.

466
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,960
Speaker 1: -And in this video, he shows you it working.

467
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,240
Speaker 1: He fast-forwards the slow parts.

468
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,199
Speaker 1: He has to punch in the binary to load.

469
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:22,700
Speaker 1: 'Cause first he has to -- When you turn your computer on, you have, like, a BIOS or UFI, and then you have a master boot record, right?

470
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,100
Speaker 1: So the computer turns on, and it can sort of start itself.

471
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,424
Speaker 1: -Yep.

472
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,000
Speaker 1: -Right?

473
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,380
Speaker 0: -Computers didn't used to do that.

474
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,958
Speaker 1: -You turn on.

475
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,460
Speaker 1: Right, this computer turns on, and it's nothing.

476
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,720
Speaker 1: So the first thing you need to do is input a program by hand to tell it how to load things.

477
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,650
Speaker 0: -Yep, I had to do that.

478
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,600
Speaker 1: -The loading program.

479
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,100
Speaker 0: -I did that a handful of times at IBM.

480
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,460
Speaker 1: -It has absolutely no memory whatsoever when it's been off.

481
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,179
Speaker 1: You turn it on.

482
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:47,300
Speaker 1: You input the loading program on the switches.

483
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,200
Speaker 1: Then you can load programs, right?

484
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,763
Speaker 1: -Yep.

485
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,679
Speaker 0: -Well, then you had to do the IPL, the initial program load.

486
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,860
Speaker 0: That is, initializing the computer with anything.

487
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,100
Speaker 1: -Right, exactly.

488
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,560
Speaker 1: So he shows you him doing all that, and he's got on tape, right?

489
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,660
Speaker 1: First, he loads in the basic compiler, right?

490
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,119
Speaker 1: Because it doesn't have that.

491
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:14,680
Speaker 1: And then he loads in, he has to patch it because it's written for a slightly different computer.

492
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,800
Speaker 1: So he has to manually edit it after it's loaded into the memory.

493
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:25,220
Speaker 1: And then he loads in Lunar Lander off of paper tape, and then he plays Lunar Lander on the terminal, which is pretty awesome.

494
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,866
Speaker 0: -This is amazing.

495
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,120
Speaker 1: -Yeah, it's great.

496
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,380
Speaker 0: -In the meantime, we're stuck at home.

497
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Speaker 0: We're doing the show remotely.

498
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,420
Speaker 0: We're doing live streams on YouTube.

499
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:34,378
Speaker 0: You can watch them.

500
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,138
Speaker 0: There's some people watching this one right now.

501
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,260
Speaker 0: The pipeline seems fine.

502
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:47,080
Speaker 0: People keep making this point, and I've watched a bunch of professional video game people and sports people.

503
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:59,220
Speaker 0: All the people who are professionals, who do this kind of thing for a living, who are stuck at home and are trying to make content at home, and across the board, they all have the worst possible quality and also often aren't that entertaining.

504
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:02,478
Speaker 0: I feel like without their writers and their technology, they have a lot of trouble.

505
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 0: But it's all just blown-out mics and nonsense.

506
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:11,720
Speaker 0: So I can at least say that even if our content is not as great as some of those people you love, we will at least have a high production quality.

507
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,979
Speaker 1: -Well, could you imagine being a pro video guy, right?

508
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:25,500
Speaker 1: And normally, your job is to make all the video, and you're behind the camera, and there's professional -- there's, like, actors or famous people in front of the camera, and they just show up and do their thing.

509
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,460
Speaker 1: You put microphones on them, right, with your hands.

510
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:31,019
Speaker 1: You go up in their coat and stuff, right?

511
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,219
Speaker 1: And now that person's at home.

512
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:37,875
Speaker 1: You mail them a bunch of stuff, and you have to get them to do it on their own without fucking up.

513
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:38,059
Speaker 1: -Yep.

514
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,839
Speaker 1: -And all they do is see your face and hear your voice, and you have to explain to them what to press, what to do.

515
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,144
Speaker 0: Right?

516
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:54,440
Speaker 0: -The other day, we were watching or listening to and watching this live stream that some people were doing, a sports thing, and one of them, their mic was clipping, like, so bad.

517
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,040
Speaker 0: It was crazy, and the comments in their stream was just a sea of, "Dude, fix your mic.

518
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:01,979
Speaker 0: Here are links to what clipping is.

519
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,537
Speaker 0: Please, please, please fix your

520
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:03,699
Speaker 0: mic.".

521
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:10,960
Speaker 0: But the guy was getting increasingly salty and mad that his fans were yelling at him for his clipping mic, so he was clipping even more, and it was just, like, this weird feedback loop.

522
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,181
Speaker 1: -Ew.

523
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 0: -I think that the real difference is, well, like you said, if we had a production company, I would probably never fuck around with cameras again in my life.

524
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:23,739
Speaker 0: I would just let someone else do that, and I'd probably start forgetting how to do things.

525
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:31,340
Speaker 1: -I do have a friend who's an acquaintance who's very camera-y, and I've thought about getting them to come over.

526
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:38,774
Speaker 1: They posted, like, "Hey, I'm looking for freelance videoing work," and I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll have them come over to do, like, one fancy project or

527
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:39,117
Speaker 1: something.".

528
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,200
Speaker 0: -The sad part is the thing I would want people to do the most -- -And now I can't have anyone come over.

529
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,960
Speaker 0: -The thing I want people to do the most would be follow us around a PAX and, like, record a lot of the games we play so we can then have the footage.

530
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,280
Speaker 1: -This friend would do that for enough money.

531
00:30:52,340 --> 00:31:05,107
Speaker 0: -That we could do, but part of that is, when we're doing our panel, I'd like them to actually operate the camera, but the union in four of the five PAXes we would go to would not let someone touch our camera while we're on stage

532
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:06,878
Speaker 1: because we would have

533
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,180
Speaker 0: to pay the convention center to put their camera person on our camera.

534
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:28,359
Speaker 1: -I know, but this friend would, for example, you know, come over, help me set up the lighting, right, give me advice because they're better video than me, right, operate the several cameras to record me from angles and edit the video, right, and all that, you know, put the graphics on it and stuff.

535
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:34,560
Speaker 1: So that would be well worth paying for, but that plan is dead for a while.

536
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:44,560
Speaker 0: -Even when things start to open up, most likely you might see me and Scott doing content together in one of our apartments again, but we're not gonna be inviting third parties into that mix anytime soon.

537
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,993
Speaker 1: -Undone third parties, right?

538
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:46,216
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

539
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:56,318
Speaker 1: -It's like, I know Rim hasn't left his house, and he knows I haven't left my house, right, so we can sort of trust, right, that we're, you know, at equal risk here, right?

540
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,979
Speaker 0: -So, otherwise, you know, the booklet book is still the tale of Hanzo.

541
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,058
Speaker 0: We'll get to it when we get to it.

542
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,083
Speaker 1: -Hanzo.

543
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,020
Speaker 0: -I'm playing a lot of Overwatch.

544
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,180
Speaker 1: -The sword maker.

545
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,400
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's not the sword maker.

546
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:09,169
Speaker 0: It's the --.

547
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,720
Speaker 0: -Hanzo and Genji.

548
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,439
Speaker 1: -The sex haver.

549
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:15,712
Speaker 0: -So, yeah, follow us in all the places, especially our forum.

550
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:16,280
Speaker 0: Hang out in there.

551
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,430
Speaker 0: Hang out in our Discord.

552
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,339
Speaker 0: There's stuff going on, and we're gonna talk about something we haven't talked about in a long time, a webcomic.

553
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:23,960
Speaker 1: -So it's sort of a webcomic.

554
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,675
Speaker 1: If you don't know, there's a company called Naver, N-A-V-E-R.

555
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:39,675
Speaker 1: It's spelled like naval, like your belly button naval, only you replace the R with an L, and this Naver is basically Google in South Korea, right?

556
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,060
Speaker 1: It's like they are everything in South Korea.

557
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,740
Speaker 1: You know, like, it's shocking how much of the South Korean Internet is Naver.

558
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:54,279
Speaker 1: It's the same amount of the Internet in the US that's Google and Amazon, a lot, right?

559
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,618
Speaker 1: Like, there'll be websites you go to, and it's like, "Oh, that's -- It doesn't even look like it's a Naver

560
00:32:59,679 --> 00:32:59,800
Speaker 1: site.".

561
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:01,096
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, yeah, Naver runs

562
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:01,258
Speaker 1: that.".

563
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,524
Speaker 1: Yep.

564
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,060
Speaker 1: Okay.

565
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:08,860
Speaker 1: So one of the websites they run that is actually a worldwide website is this Webtoons site.

566
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:18,300
Speaker 1: So webcomics are actually kind of big in South Korea, bigger than they are in the United States, at least relative to the country, right?

567
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,719
Speaker 1: So, for example, you know, what's a big webcomic in the US, right?

568
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:28,279
Speaker 1: Like, you know, Penny Arcade is big, right?

569
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,399
Speaker 0: -Art of the Stake is bigger than it looks.

570
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:32,560
Speaker 1: -Yeah, exactly, right?

571
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:42,639
Speaker 1: But a big webcomic in Korea would have the prominence that a big newspaper comic would have in the US in the '90s.

572
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:55,178
Speaker 1: So, like, I have seen on Korean television webcomic artists on television, right, where normally you would see in the US, like -- -Like Penny Arcade -- -Jim Davis from

573
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:55,460
Speaker 1: "Garfield.".

574
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,600
Speaker 0: -Yeah, but, like, Penny Arcade might be one of the most, like, lucrative webcomics in American history.

575
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,640
Speaker 1: -Right, but it has no prominence on television, mainstream, whatever.

576
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
Speaker 0: -Yeah, Leno wasn't gonna interview Mike and Jerry.

577
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,540
Speaker 1: -Gabe and Tycho aren't on -- Right, like, an NBC talk show.

578
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,380
Speaker 1: They're not even "Good Morning America" level.

579
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,337
Speaker 0: -Yeah, the press at New York Comic-Con wouldn't even mention they were there.

580
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,139
Speaker 1: -Right, exactly.

581
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,859
Speaker 0: -So, they made their own comic-con.

582
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,402
Speaker 0: Anyway.

583
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:23,516
Speaker 1: -Right, but webcomics have that level of popularity there.

584
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,559
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of people read them on their phones, I think.

585
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,219
Speaker 1: So, Webtoons is a site, Naver Webtoons.

586
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,739
Speaker 1: It's actually an international site.

587
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,600
Speaker 1: You don't have to read any Korean whatsoever.

588
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,359
Speaker 1: And you can make an account or not.

589
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,527
Speaker 1: Making an account helps you sort of save your spot, right, in your different comics.

590
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:40,600
Speaker 0: -Which is real important.

591
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:42,286
Speaker 1: -Yep.

592
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:47,668
Speaker 0: -That's why I stopped reading a lot of webcomics, 'cause I forget where I was, then I forget to go to the site 'cause I didn't bookmark it, and then I'm done.

593
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,500
Speaker 0: -Right.

594
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,340
Speaker 1: There's nice apps for it on your phone or your tablet or whatever.

595
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,500
Speaker 1: You can publish your own comics on the site.

596
00:34:56,721 --> 00:35:11,740
Speaker 1: And I think that, you know, I don't know all the details of it, but there are lots of extremely high-quality color comics on here that are, like -- The format of a lot of them is basically long-paid.

597
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:23,579
Speaker 0: -Which that's part of why I think it's interesting to talk about this, because a lot of webcomics tended to, especially in the early days, have either the four-panel format or they'd be formatted in a way that could then be put in a book later.

598
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,739
Speaker 0: These comics, very much like it feels right to read them on a screen.

599
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,560
Speaker 1: -These were designed to be read on your phone.

600
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,320
Speaker 1: It's a long thing.

601
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,038
Speaker 1: So, you go to say, "Here, I'll pick a random

602
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,220
Speaker 1: one.".

603
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,100
Speaker 0: -I picked a random one.

604
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,519
Speaker 0: I'm scrolling down in the stream, too.

605
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:44,620
Speaker 1: -In the bleak midwinter, right, it looks like angsty dude in snow with some sci-fi and whatever, right?

606
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:50,480
Speaker 1: And you click, and first of all, it's separated into episodes, which are separated into seasons, right?

607
00:35:50,980 --> 00:36:01,760
Speaker 1: So, and each episode is one page, one vertically long page, and you just scroll down and down and down as you read the page, and that's the episode.

608
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Speaker 1: And then several of those will make up a season, and the creator will, you know, release, like, page, page, page -- episode, episode, episode -- on a regular schedule until the season is over, and then there'll be a break while this next season is getting ready, right?

609
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,160
Speaker 1: And that's the format of pretty much all of these.

610
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,979
Speaker 1: The creators are getting money for these.

611
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,360
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's based on popularity or if they're being contracted or whatever, but I think it's actually a good deal based on what I've heard.

612
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,219
Speaker 1: The artists who are working and making "Webtoons" seem to be happy with it.

613
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,719
Speaker 1: I haven't seen them complaining and saying it's no good.

614
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,080
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of readers, right?

615
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:41,743
Speaker 1: Some of these comics, it's like the one I just mentioned, "Randomly,".

616
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:42,427
Speaker 1: it has 334,000 hearts, right?

617
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,460
Speaker 1: There is one called "True Beauty," some romance one.

618
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,300
Speaker 1: 20.1 million hearts, right?

619
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,935
Speaker 1: My giant nerd boyfriend, 31.8 million hearts.

620
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,780
Speaker 1: So there's millions of people using this app, if you're not aware of it, to read comics in this format.

621
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:07,480
Speaker 0: -And think about this, 'cause webcomics, they're, like, they're their own thing, and especially as paper media is in decline, where do people want to read stuff?

622
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:11,360
Speaker 0: There's no good way to read traditional comics on technology yet.

623
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,979
Speaker 0: Like, all the readers that exist, even tablets, there's not a great experience in many cases, but...

624
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,320
Speaker 1: -That's why I buy the paper ones.

625
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:24,540
Speaker 0: -But this format, if you design it for the format that most people will access it in, it just works, and it's great.

626
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,659
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people don't even think about that.

627
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,120
Speaker 1: -The quality is extremely high art-wise, right?

628
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:38,540
Speaker 1: It's like you scroll down the page with, like, list of comics, and every single thumbnail looks like it was made by, like, one of the best artists in the artist alley at the convention.

629
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,737
Speaker 0: -There's got to be a bad comic in there somewhere, but...

630
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,478
Speaker 1: -That one might be meh, but it might be funny, though.

631
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:54,000
Speaker 1: Anyway, and the comics are extremely diverse, covering so many genres and, you know, styles and types of characters and all sorts of crazy stuff.

632
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:02,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, today, we want to talk about just one of these, right, even though there's so many of them, done by someone we've been a fan of for a long time, Katie Cook.

633
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:05,560
Speaker 1: If you don't know, Katie Cook is someone who's been in the U.S.

634
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,299
Speaker 1: Comics Convention art scene for a long time.

635
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,400
Speaker 1: Katie Cook did a lot of the early official licensed My Little Pony comics.

636
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,247
Speaker 0: -I think she's a big part of why that comic was so good.

637
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:18,600
Speaker 0: early on, like, she set a tone.

638
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,220
Speaker 0: She did cover art for it and writing.

639
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:31,080
Speaker 1: -Yep, Katie Cook has done -- When you go to conventions, she'll do this thing where she makes a tiny watercolor on these little cards that are very cute.

640
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:36,240
Speaker 1: She, for a long time, if you went to the store, it's about a collectible card series.

641
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,680
Speaker 1: Like, let's say you were buying Indiana Jones trading cards, right, because those were a thing.

642
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:48,380
Speaker 1: You know, you buy them, and these collectible cards that don't do anything, they're not like baseball cards.

643
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,060
Speaker 1: They're just like pictures from the movies or whoever, right?

644
00:38:51,521 --> 00:39:02,700
Speaker 1: And then, randomly, if you were super lucky, what they were doing to promote these trading card sets was they would randomly insert cards into the packs that had hand-drawn art.

645
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,860
Speaker 1: Like, the artist drew on that card.

646
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:14,339
Speaker 1: They gave the artist a blank white card that they painted or drew on, and then they sent those back to the company, and they shuffled them in with all the manufactured printed cards.

647
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,459
Speaker 1: And if you're lucky, you would get one of those.

648
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,120
Speaker 1: Katie Cook did a lot of those in various trading card sets.

649
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,360
Speaker 1: She's done some books, a lot of Star Wars licensed art.

650
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:30,140
Speaker 1: I think she did books like ABC 3PO, like a little children's Star Wars book.

651
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,559
Speaker 0: - Yep, Gronk is what a lot of people, I think, would know Katie's work from.

652
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,400
Speaker 1: - Yeah, Gronk was her webcomic that she did on her own, right, just like I think on her own website.

653
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,558
Speaker 1: I don't even think it was with another website at all.

654
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,740
Speaker 1: But anyway, the thing we're talking about today is her webtoon, right, which is called Nothing Special.

655
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:50,900
Speaker 1: Its third season just started, so there are two seasons to read.

656
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:54,760
Speaker 1: Just like all these other webtoons, each page is really long.

657
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:59,498
Speaker 1: The two seasons have like 30 something-ish chapters, I guess, each.

658
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:02,040
Speaker 1: So you can read it all pretty quickly.

659
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:03,640
Speaker 1: I read it all in like a few days.

660
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:12,478
Speaker 0: - And I think one main thing I like about it is that all webcomics, especially like when they start, have to do their sort of like establishing origin, like who are these characters, why do you care about them?

661
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:25,659
Speaker 0: But a lot of them sort of, like a lot of amateur ones tend to fail in that they'll spend so long doing that that everyone loses interest, or like they never get to the part they wanted to get to and then their career changes or anything.

662
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,634
Speaker 1: This moves-- - Right, or the Naruto can happen where that establishing part is good or bad, right?

663
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:39,260
Speaker 1: And then when they switch, they sort of switch modes to the actual story and you don't like one or the other.

664
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,400
Speaker 1: So if you don't like the first part, you don't get to the story.

665
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:45,980
Speaker 1: And if you don't like the story, you fall off once you're done with the beginning part, which is Naruto, right?

666
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,820
Speaker 1: Naruto is like, "Funny ninja school, yes.

667
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,334
Speaker 1: "Tournaments, I'm

668
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:49,598
Speaker 1: done.".

669
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:50,128
Speaker 1: Forget this.

670
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:52,240
Speaker 0: - Yuhaka Show, I even was tricked for a few episodes.

671
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,879
Speaker 1: - Exactly, Yuhaka Show, before they start having tournaments is an amazing A+ shounen show.

672
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,713
Speaker 1: After that, it's just like, "Okay, fighting, what

673
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:00,915
Speaker 1: else?".

674
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,459
Speaker 0: - But this one, but nothing special moves pretty-- - Is something special.

675
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,079
Speaker 0: - It's good.

676
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Speaker 0: It moves quick past that establishing thing and gets right to its sort of kickoff plot.

677
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,700
Speaker 0: And it's very consistent in quality.

678
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,279
Speaker 0: Like it just moves at a good steady pace.

679
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,539
Speaker 0: You never get bored with it.

680
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:26,220
Speaker 0: Like as I read, or as I read, I haven't read season three yet, secrets are revealed early enough to keep it going and to keep it interesting.

681
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,560
Speaker 1: - Right, it's not like there isn't really, like with a lot of other stories, right?

682
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,280
Speaker 1: There's usually like a big secretive space.

683
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:39,080
Speaker 1: And while they go through the smaller stories, right?

684
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,740
Speaker 1: It's like, "No, just get to the big story, right?

685
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,659
Speaker 1: "X-Files, just tell me about the fucking smoking

686
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:43,740
Speaker 1: man.".

687
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Speaker 0: - Until he did, and then please, I wish I didn't know about the smoking man.

688
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:47,558
Speaker 0: That is so dumb.

689
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,659
Speaker 1: - Right, it's like, you know, but it's the same feeling you usually get, right?

690
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:57,060
Speaker 1: With nothing special, it's like the big story isn't really a thing.

691
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,620
Speaker 1: There's a big setting that has mysteries about it, right?

692
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 1: Like what's the deal with this, right?

693
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,640
Speaker 1: But there isn't like a big bad guy.

694
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,899
Speaker 1: There isn't a big threat really of any kind.

695
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,819
Speaker 0: - Not to spoil anything, but the deal with her mom.

696
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 0: Like she lives alone with her dad, the main character, and there's magic afoot, obviously.

697
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:14,440
Speaker 0: It's a fantasy thing.

698
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,240
Speaker 0: There's like the real normal world.

699
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:18,000
Speaker 0: And then there's the fantasy world.

700
00:42:18,263 --> 00:42:24,700
Speaker 0: And there's some reason why multiple magical non-human people just happen to live in the normal world.

701
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:34,900
Speaker 0: Like there's a whole setting here, but like the mystery is her dad disappears, and then you meet her mom, and her mom's deal is just very like interesting and environmental.

702
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,680
Speaker 1: - And then, but that's take, it's like, you know, you would think, oh, whenever there's like a missing family member, that's like a big deal, right?

703
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:44,259
Speaker 1: It's like, no, they just take care of that.

704
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,380
Speaker 0: - Like right away, like, oh.

705
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:47,800
Speaker 1: - And season one, and they take care of it fully.

706
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,480
Speaker 0: - That's where dad went.

707
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,900
Speaker 1: - It's like, they don't, right.

708
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,180
Speaker 1: It's like, they don't leave it hanging.

709
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,900
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, here it is, solved.

710
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:54,559
Speaker 1: Boom, done, move on.

711
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,740
Speaker 0: - The mystery, and I'm just avoiding, I don't want to spoil it, 'cause it's short.

712
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,437
Speaker 0: Like just read it.

713
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Speaker 0: But the mystery of that, like that bit about her parents and like how she came to be is very straightforward.

714
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,180
Speaker 0: It's not like a big secret of space.

715
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:09,720
Speaker 0: It's just like, oh, I guess that happened.

716
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,240
Speaker 0: Like dad met this person and that's what happened.

717
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,520
Speaker 0: And this isn't like a big epic plot.

718
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:15,918
Speaker 0: This is just going to resolve itself.

719
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,120
Speaker 0: - It's hard to talk about it in any circumspect way, unfortunately.

720
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 1: - Right, so also it's like usually in shows when there's like a romance situation, right?

721
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,200
Speaker 1: The romance is like very like, ooh, are they going to kiss?

722
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,500
Speaker 0: - Miyaka, Tomohome, it doesn't get to that for like 40 episodes.

723
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,920
Speaker 1: - Right, nothing special.

724
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:43,920
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, you know, there's some romance back and forth thing going on, but then boom, they kissing, right?

725
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:46,200
Speaker 1: And then they basically don't stop kissing.

726
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,000
Speaker 1: They're always kissing and people are like, oh, come on.

727
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
Speaker 0: - That was like the anime with the big guy and the smaller girl and they start dating.

728
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,431
Speaker 1: - Exactly, my love story.

729
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:53,980
Speaker 0: - Yes, my love story.

730
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,480
Speaker 0: The fact that they start dating and try to make it work right away is the only reason that show was good.

731
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,000
Speaker 1: - Right, they start dating pretty quickly in this, right?

732
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,320
Speaker 1: And they keep on dating and you know, they don't keep it a secret from anybody.

733
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,739
Speaker 1: They don't, you know.

734
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,734
Speaker 0: - It's, I guess one of the thing I like about Nothing Special.

735
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,780
Speaker 0: specifically without like spoiling anything is kind of that.

736
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:21,599
Speaker 0: It just, it skips past what would normally be in like a typical more amateur web comic, a full arc.

737
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:25,638
Speaker 0: Like they'll spend a year telling the story of how they fell in love.

738
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:34,080
Speaker 1: - Right, well, I think the number one thing is that you never get that situation where someone's not saying something just because, right?

739
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:38,160
Speaker 1: It's like people say stuff to each other and things keep moving along.

740
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,799
Speaker 1: No one's really, some of the characters are weird 'cause they're in a fantasy world.

741
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,900
Speaker 1: Like the little fairy old man.

742
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,420
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I like those characters because they're weird, but they're not just like hiding the big secret.

743
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,460
Speaker 0: Like, oh, I'll tell you when you're older and then like it's a big mystery.

744
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,379
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, here's the deal.

745
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:58,340
Speaker 1: - Right, well, there's the demon guy who doesn't want to talk about his demon family, but it's like, he tells you about the demon family.

746
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,179
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, they're bad.

747
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,480
Speaker 1: It's not like, he's not like hiding.

748
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,020
Speaker 1: Like, oh no, my family's, you know.

749
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,880
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you know the deal basically.

750
00:45:05,643 --> 00:45:06,860
Speaker 1: He's like, oh shit, that's my brother.

751
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,877
Speaker 1: He's evil, watch out.

752
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:09,520
Speaker 1: Anyway, he's a demon.

753
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:10,820
Speaker 1: I'm basically the only good demon.

754
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Speaker 0: - And I'm not even that good.

755
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,660
Speaker 1: - Demon brothers, yeah.

756
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,492
Speaker 1: Right?

757
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, you know, in other things, right?

758
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:32,059
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, when there are mysteries, like, oh, he's got the, it's like they foreshadow a little bit of mystery or like a little Chekhov's guns here and there, like he's got a pink broken wing, Chekhov's gun, that gun fires in a few pages.

759
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:33,898
Speaker 1: And it's like, boom, there it is.

760
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:36,280
Speaker 1: It's not like Chekhov's gun's hanging on the wall.

761
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,760
Speaker 1: Chekhov's gun's always in someone's hand, right?

762
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:42,898
Speaker 1: When it gets pulled out, it's in the hand and then it fires, there's no--.

763
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:57,900
Speaker 0: - Maybe it's 'cause I just watched it, but aspects of that are part of what I liked about "Castlevania" season two as well, in that it's like a character learned something and the next scene is that character, like either telling everyone who needs to know it or doing a thing based on that information.

764
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,600
Speaker 1: - Right, so we gotta talk about everyone's favorite character, the radish, radishes.

765
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:18,780
Speaker 1: - So there's these little, so basically in the, it's a fantasy world situation where there's a real world and a fantasy world and they're connected, but unlike "Escaflowne," it's not like one of those, what do they call it, transported to another world situations.

766
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:23,940
Speaker 1: It's like the worlds are connected and they can freely move between them and it's not a big deal.

767
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,099
Speaker 0: - Like she could just go home any time.

768
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,878
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like, it's not a thing, right?

769
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,300
Speaker 1: It's taking care of immediately.

770
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,560
Speaker 0: - And it also, there's no central mystery of why is this other world?

771
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,799
Speaker 0: Like it's just part of the world.

772
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:35,899
Speaker 0: That's just how the world is.

773
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,498
Speaker 1: - There are two worlds, but you need magic to go between them, but her dad is a magic dude so they can't.

774
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,520
Speaker 0: - Not like "Escaflowne" where like someone going between the worlds is like an entire arc of a story.

775
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,320
Speaker 1: - Right, everyone else in the human world doesn't know.

776
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:56,060
Speaker 1: Presumably, most of them don't know there's another world or worlds and everyone in the magic world doesn't really have a reason to go to the real world.

777
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,779
Speaker 0: - They know about it.

778
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,740
Speaker 1: - Real human world.

779
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,639
Speaker 0: - Like a lot of them know about it and just don't care about it.

780
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,620
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like, why would they go to the not magic world?

781
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:06,938
Speaker 1: Whatever, I guess it's a lot of effort and no reason to do it.

782
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:19,120
Speaker 1: I imagine at some point they might do, there's no foreshadowing for this whatsoever, but I could see when they need more plots, do the old cliche, bad guys, demons, go to the real human world plot, right?

783
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,200
Speaker 1: That's always a good one.

784
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:20,637
Speaker 1: - That happens.

785
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,900
Speaker 0: I mean, Inuyasha had that.

786
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,540
Speaker 1: - There's absolutely no, right.

787
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,640
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this is radishes, which are like ghosts of dead vegetables.

788
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,219
Speaker 0: - And the main character for reasons can see them and communicate with them.

789
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:41,920
Speaker 1: - Right, so some characters can see them and some can't, but the main character can, and they sort of semi-worship the main character?

790
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:59,092
Speaker 0: - Yep, that's sort of the theme of the show is that people will worship the main character for reasons that aren't entirely explained and all characters in the world sort of assume that everyone knows the deal and talk about it like, "Oh, of course everyone worships

791
00:47:59,133 --> 00:47:59,213
Speaker 0: her.".

792
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,980
Speaker 1: - Right, and she doesn't know what the deal is 'cause she's grown up in the not-magic world and only came to the magic world somewhat recently.

793
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:11,280
Speaker 1: It doesn't even know that much magic yet, but she has inborn magic, right?

794
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:15,039
Speaker 1: She thinks she's nothing special, but she's like super special.

795
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,900
Speaker 0: - And a lot of the themes just seem to follow that idea of what does it mean to be special and what is special?

796
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:29,537
Speaker 1: - Yep, so yeah, if you are looking for web comics to read and most of the web comics you read ended, Dr.

797
00:48:29,578 --> 00:48:32,960
Speaker 1: Vignetja, or are hard-to-read websites.

798
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,140
Speaker 0: - Or don't update that frequently.

799
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,320
Speaker 1: - Even if they're-- - Order the stick.

800
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:50,040
Speaker 1: - Right, or they're just on Twitter, like Penny Arcade or whatever, and you read one strip in like, it's a little tiny three-panel thing, and you're not getting your long story situation, right?

801
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:56,380
Speaker 1: And you don't wanna pay for graphic novels on paper or comixology 'cause that costs a lot of money.

802
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:12,160
Speaker 1: You just wanna read something long-form comics for free in English with lots and lots of choices, lots and lots of content, stuff you won't see published by Marvel, DC, or even manga publishers, Shonen Jump, whoever.

803
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:14,177
Speaker 1: This is the place to go.

804
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
Speaker 0: - And you can read these without buying anything?

805
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,079
Speaker 0: You can read these without going outside?

806
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,719
Speaker 1: - You can read 'em on your tablet, read 'em on your phone.

807
00:49:22,723 --> 00:49:23,419
Speaker 1: Totally free.

808
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:32,820
Speaker 1: I highly recommend the site, especially the comic, Nothing Special, which is the one that I have read the most of on this site.

809
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:38,780
Speaker 1: But yeah, a Webtoons, Naver Webtoons is the stuff.

810
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,767
Speaker 0: - All right.

811
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:40,418
Speaker 1: - There you go.

812
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,950
Speaker 0: - This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 0: I know I say that every night, but we are still working on stuff.

825
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:51,980
Speaker 0: You'll see our pipeline get better and better.

826
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,479
Speaker 0: The quality of our streams is improving a little bit.

827
00:50:55,082 --> 00:50:55,978
Speaker 0: We're tweaking some stuff.

828
00:50:57,042 --> 00:51:01,399
Speaker 0: I sent back that dodgy RTMP device that I think I talked about on a Monday show.

829
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:10,257
Speaker 0: But all that aside, right now, I leave you with something that some of you will remember, but I suspect many of you are too young for.

830
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,503
Speaker 0: - Code Z, code Z 1212.

831

Speaker 0: Code Z, code Z 1212.

833
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:28,260
Speaker 0: Code Z 1212.

834
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,500
Speaker 1: - These people, these people, these people shot the faith.

835
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,920
Speaker 1: These people, these people, these people shot the faith.

836
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,379
Speaker 0: These people- These people- These people start to fade!

837
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:37,799
Speaker 0: (Fade me!lett).

838
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,399
Speaker 0: These people start to FADE ME!

839
00:51:39,622 --> 00:51:40,058
Speaker 0: (I can't handle it).

840
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,600
Speaker 0: C-C-C-C-C-C-call me on my cell phone!

Speaker 1: busy!).

843
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:44,199
Speaker 0: These people start to FADE ME!

844
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:44,676
Speaker 0: (I can't handle

845
00:51:44,697 --> 00:51:44,739
Speaker 0: it!).

Speaker 1: C-C-C-C-C-call me on my cell phone!

847

Speaker 0: busy!).

849
