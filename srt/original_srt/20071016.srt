1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Speaker 1: So, in case you don't listen to Monday Geek Nights, I guess we should say it again briefly, that this is Questions Week!

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:14,820
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no news, there's gonna be no things of the day, which is good, because I can save all these news and things of the day for next week, and now I'll have a surplus instead of a drought.

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:22,680
Speaker 1: Yep, we're just gonna jump right into this, partly because we have a lot of questions, and if last night was any indication, we're not gonna get through 'em all.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,440
Speaker 0: Which is fine, because that'll let us make an extra episode of questions later and save us some time.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,800
Speaker 0: Also, I just wanna say that these questions, we're not giving credit for any of the questions, mostly for psychological reasons and for other reasons.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,179
Speaker 0: You know what question you ask.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,218
Speaker 1: You don't wanna hear us say, you know, "So-and-so from Idaho

8
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:42,359
Speaker 1: rights.".

9
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:47,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's just wasting our time and yours, and it'll also change the way we answer.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,240
Speaker 0: If we know that a certain series of questions were all asked by the same person, that'll change the way we answer them.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 0: And this way, it'll just be straight up the question with nothing outside of that fooling with our minds.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,960
Speaker 1: And also, I know a lot of you are Tuesday night only listeners, or you don't listen to Mondays.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:14,340
Speaker 1: And this week only, I highly recommend that you check out All Four Nights, because we've gotten a lot of feedback already from last night's show, and it seems to be that people really like this sort of thing, these question shows.

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,520
Speaker 1: And a lot of people really like that episode, and one particular listener even said that he's gonna listen to Wednesday night, even though he hates anime.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,174
Speaker 0: Oh wow.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,016
Speaker 1: Dams.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
Speaker 0: Alright, so, you wanna just get to it?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,980
Speaker 1: Alright, so, uh, what are your least favorite trends in gaming today?

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,168
Speaker 0: The least favorite trends in gaming?

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,840
Speaker 0: Video gaming and board gaming and role-playing gaming?

21
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:36,920
Speaker 1: Well, they said just gaming.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,380
Speaker 1: Well, very specifically, I can say, one, the direction Dungeons & Dragons is going.

23
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not the greatest trend.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,300
Speaker 1: But that's, I think that's really too narrow for this question.

25
00:01:48,821 --> 00:02:00,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, my least favorite trend in gaming would have to be the trend of there being games that are not games of... I mean, I guess, I don't wanna know, that's sort of bad, but...

26
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:01,820
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't say anything.

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Speaker 0: Because of what I was thinking I was going against.

28
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,920
Speaker 0: I was gonna say that I don't like games that don't require skill, however, games like Apples to Apples and stuff like that are included in that, and I like those.

29
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:17,520
Speaker 0: I guess it's games that reward, like, things, that reward the wrong thing.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:29,400
Speaker 0: Like, they reward how much time you spend, or they reward other things besides, you know, getting, you know, reflexes or thinking or strategy or, you know, creativity.

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,700
Speaker 0: They're games that reward stupid things like spending more time or spending more money or things like that.

32
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:41,600
Speaker 1: I guess I would just go that it's not really a new trend, but it's a trend that's been continued for a long time.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,160
Speaker 1: Just that a lot of games are released, they don't take risks, and there's very little risk taking going on in gaming.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:56,380
Speaker 1: I mean, Nintendo took a gigantic risk with the Wii and the DS, but the PlayStation 3 shouldn't have been a risk, and the Xbox definitely wasn't a risk.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,179
Speaker 1: And most games that come out, and they're just, "We're gonna make Halo 3, it'll sell no matter

36
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,380
Speaker 1: what.".

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,800
Speaker 1: Luckily, Halo 3 seems to be pretty good, but Halo 3 could have been crap, and people would have bought it anyway, and they probably would have bought Halo 4.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:07,865
Speaker 1: Yup.

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a more interesting part of that question, because it's the same question.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,460
Speaker 1: Your most favorite.

41
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,440
Speaker 0: Most favorite trend in gaming today?

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,659
Speaker 1: I gotta say, I'm really happy with this.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,740
Speaker 1: I mean, we did it way back, this analogy of FPSs, and back in the day, we're like Rome, and then, you know, we have the Renaissance on the consoles.

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:35,160
Speaker 1: And what's going on in console FPSs, and just gaming in general, especially with Xbox Live and these sorts of things, is I like how everything's getting integrated.

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:47,400
Speaker 1: Kind of like what happened on the internet with Web 2.0, and just stat generation, and just like it or not, the way the achievements on the Xbox work, and just, there's a lot of multiplayer going on that wasn't happening outside of the PC world.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

47
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,060
Speaker 0: My favorite trend is multiplayer-ing everything.

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,840
Speaker 0: You know, making everything out to be a competition between people, you know?

49
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,287
Speaker 1: Or even a cooperation between people.

50
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:01,620
Speaker 1: Co-op gaming is something that kinda died, and it's starting to come back in a big way.

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,980
Speaker 0: And think about the NES, most two-player games were like beat 'em ups like Contra or River City Ransom.

52
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,557
Speaker 1: Or they were a "I play, then you play, and then I play, and then you

53
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:10,838
Speaker 1: play.".

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, there weren't too many versus other than like Tetris, and Tetris on the NES wasn't even versus.

55
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:18,640
Speaker 0: I guess Yoshi's Cookie on the NES was versus, that's about it.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,988
Speaker 0: Dr.

57
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,358
Speaker 1: Mario.

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,137
Speaker 0: No, that too.

59
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,120
Speaker 1: Not a real doctor.

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,562
Speaker 1: Nope.

61
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:23,339
Speaker 0: Don't let him touch your business.

62
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:26,143
Speaker 0: Alright.

63
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:29,360
Speaker 0: What is the worst game mechanic?

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:40,720
Speaker 1: Alright, so, I like how a lot of these questions, I mean, based on who did write the questions when I first looked at 'em, you can kinda tell like what, like obviously they're talking about video games or board games or whatever.

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,020
Speaker 1: But, uh, they said game mechanic, and I think in all of gaming, I think the absolute worst game mechanic is the grind.

66
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,228
Speaker 0: I was gonna agree.

67
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,480
Speaker 0: The grind is the worst.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,983
Speaker 1: I mean, even Final Fantasies.

69
00:04:52,123 --> 00:05:00,380
Speaker 1: I ate that up as a kid, but leveling in Final Fantasy IV was just as much a grind as any MMO, and you can't pretend it was anything else.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:13,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's one thing to say, "Okay, you know, solve a puzzle, and then you displayed skill, and you increased your knowledge as a person, and therefore we're going to give you a reward that gives you more

71
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,580
Speaker 0: abilities.".

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,262
Speaker 0: That's fine.

73
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:19,396
Speaker 0: But World of Warcraft, there's no skill or testing your knowledge or abilities.

74
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:20,560
Speaker 0: It's just click.

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,798
Speaker 0: Anyone can just click, and the more times you click and the longer you click, it gets better.

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, now remember, we're talking about just the grind.

77
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:32,100
Speaker 1: Not the epic raids, not the big deal things, but the grind.

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 1: The fact that to do the big deal things, you still gotta level up, and even the most hardcore WoW players will agree that there's a lot of grinding out, you know, "I got a cowboy paladin for next week" kind of deal.

79
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,103
Speaker 0: Even just Final Fantasy.

80
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,109
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy combat, you can't lose.

81
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,820
Speaker 0: If you're running out of resources, you go back to the inn, and then you start again.

82
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,207
Speaker 1: A Final Fantasy combat can go one of three ways.

83
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:56,000
Speaker 1: I lose because I'm not high enough level or don't have the right items.

84
00:05:56,762 --> 00:06:01,080
Speaker 1: I lose because I didn't figure out the trick to beating whatever this boss is.

85
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,387
Speaker 0: Well, that's a boss.

86
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,180
Speaker 0: We're talking about random encounters in the field here.

87
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:08,900
Speaker 1: Well, in that case, I didn't manage my resources properly and didn't bring enough healing potions.

88
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,540
Speaker 0: You have to do such an epic failure of management, though, to actually die.

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,320
Speaker 1: Hey, in Final Fantasy IV, it was not hard to get yourself fucking trapped in the middle of nowhere with no way back.

90
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:19,868
Speaker 0: Anyway...

91
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:26,060
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna go in different kinds of gaming, because board games, I think the worst game mechanic is dice.

92
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,680
Speaker 1: I just think that any time a board game, especially in the modern era, uses dice, it's just a cop-out, and they could've done something interesting with it.

94
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,932
Speaker 0: Well, I guess not all uses of dice themselves.

95
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:40,220
Speaker 0: I mean, Burning Wheel uses dice, but that's not really a board game.

96
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 0: But Liar's Dice uses dice to great effect.

97
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I guess they're the exception.

98
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:49,080
Speaker 1: I mean, Endecker uses a die, and I think it uses it really well.

99
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,619
Speaker 1: Battlelore, I think, uses dice really poorly.

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,384
Speaker 0: Battlelore does use dice, really.

102
00:06:54,444 --> 00:07:00,260
Speaker 0: I guess it's poor use of dice, or heavy dependence on dice, or dice being like the core of the game.

103
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:05,796
Speaker 0: I mean, you can use a six-sided cube, or a multi-sided cube, as an item in your game.

104
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,120
Speaker 0: that, you know, does things.

105
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 1: I guess it's just that dice, it's not just that randomness is often a bad game mechanic, or is often, if it's a good game mechanic, used poorly.

106
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,620
Speaker 1: I think it's just that dice are very unimaginative, and you could've done something cooler if you'd thought about it.

107
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,001
Speaker 0: Yep.

108
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:24,480
Speaker 0: Alright, what is the best game mechanic?

109
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:25,979
Speaker 1: I know what Scott's gonna say.

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,340
Speaker 0: I'm gonna sa- because I said it yesterday.

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,815
Speaker 0: Yes, you did.

112
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaker 0: I think that my favorite game mechanic as of recent is the draft, which is sorta like, play Ticket to Ride, right?

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,424
Speaker 0: Ticket to Ride is a draft.

114
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:41,840
Speaker 0: What you do is you have a deck of cards, and they draw, like, five cards from the deck and put them face-up.

115
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,420
Speaker 0: And on your turn, you can either take, like, one face-up card, or two face-down cards.

116
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,410
Speaker 1: Yep, Third in Texas also does this.

117
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:51,672
Speaker 1: St.

118
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:53,280
Speaker 1: Petersburg does something similar.

119
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:54,761
Speaker 1: St.

120
00:07:54,822 --> 00:08:01,080
Speaker 1: Petersburg, just the whole mechanic of that game, the game's kinda broken in the sense that all games are broken and you eventually figure it out.

121
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,805
Speaker 1: But I feel like all the core mechanics of a game like St.

122
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:14,160
Speaker 1: Petersburg, and just this kind of round-robin drafting, giving up resources to get other resources, anticipating what other people are going to take, is just so elegant.

123
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:15,678
Speaker 1: I eat it up.

124
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:16,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, think about it.

125
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:23,580
Speaker 0: Instead of having dice, you know, roll a di- you know, Candy Land, you know, you just draw one card, which is effectively the same as dice, and do what it says.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,163
Speaker 0: Here, you get to ch- you have a decision to make.

127
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:29,447
Speaker 0: It's still random, but you're so much more in control.

128
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:38,077
Speaker 0: You can either choose to take a face-up, or take a calculated risk on, you know, you could turn out better, it could turn out worse, or the status quo.

129
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,620
Speaker 0: You know, it's up to you, and I think that's pretty cool.

130
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:56,000
Speaker 1: And, the randomness is mitigated by the fact that usually it's iterative, where you'll draft round-robin style, or by some other mechanism, and you'll do a whole bunch of drafts, and your decisions, you'll have to look at what other players are doing, what the board looks like, you'll have to anticipate a lot of things.

131
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,149
Speaker 1: It's not as- you can still add a lot of randomness to a game, but it's the good kind of randomness.

132
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,540
Speaker 1: It's the kind of randomness that prevents the "Puerto Rico, wow, the three-player game is broken" situation.

133
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,120
Speaker 0: Alright.

134
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:15,540
Speaker 1: Alright, uh, give me an example of a game that is style over substance Myst.

135
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:17,799
Speaker 0: Haha, that's a good one.

136
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:33,300
Speaker 1: Myst, I mean, a lot of people like Myst, but I think a lot of people- I hate to use Scott's stupid like-like argument, I'm not gonna, but I think a lot of people, when Myst came out, felt like they had to like Myst, or they'd be ostracized by the popularized gaming community.

137
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,760
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's true.

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,277
Speaker 1: I think that happened- I know a lot of people in my high school were like, "Yeah, Myst is awesome," and it was kind of that situation where you know that- well, I guess it was middle school.

139
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:43,600
Speaker 1: God, that was a long time ago.

140
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,019
Speaker 1: Like, when someone says they've seen a movie, but you know they haven't, or they say they like the Terminator, but they don't know what the Terminator is, they're just trying to fit in.

141
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,740
Speaker 1: 'Cause I think Myst was a terrible puzzle game.

142
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,465
Speaker 0: Oh, Myst is- yeah, I'm not a big fan of Myst.

143
00:09:55,505 --> 00:10:01,640
Speaker 0: I have a big rant about how Myst ruined gaming for quite a long time, and it's still- we're feeling the effects even now.

144
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:06,186
Speaker 0: But regardless of that, give an example of a game that is style over substance.

145
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:15,540
Speaker 0: So I guess I was trying to think of the ultimate game that is style over substance, and I was gonna say something like Katamari, which while the substance of Katamari is good, the style is over it.

146
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:23,379
Speaker 1: Well, I'll say the actual gameplay of Katamari on a core level is alright, but it's not great, and it doesn't have much staying power.

147
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,159
Speaker 0: No.

148
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:36,520
Speaker 1: But, just, the way the game plays, and the music, and the feeling you get, and just the- all the art direction, everything together, just make the game so much more than the game itself should've been.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,720
Speaker 0: And I'm also- my answer is gonna be Luigi's Mansion.

150
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,359
Speaker 1: Ah, General Boo-regard?

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, alright.

152
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:48,340
Speaker 0: Give an example of a game that is substance over style.

153
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,620
Speaker 1: Alright, I have the ultimate example, and that is going to be fucking Weapons Factory.

154
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,960
Speaker 0: Oh, you're not gonna say Bionic Commando?

155
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,079
Speaker 1: I think Bionic Commando had a lot of style to it too.

156
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,260
Speaker 0: It did have some style, but it wasn't- the substance was clearly over the style.

157
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,256
Speaker 1: It was, but a lot of NES games were like that just because graphics were limited.

158
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:06,040
Speaker 1: You couldn't do much.

159
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:15,258
Speaker 1: I mean, but seriously, Weapons Factory, or all those super old mods for Quake 2, I think they were fantastic games.

160
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:16,360
Speaker 1: I think they were amazing.

161
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:19,948
Speaker 1: But at the same time, they looked like garbage.

162
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,451
Speaker 1: They were bare- like.

163
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,220
Speaker 1: the graphics were barely beyond the original, you know, Quake models.

164
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:26,828
Speaker 1: And they were just god awful to look at.

165
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,899
Speaker 1: They were terrible, but they were good games.

166
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,894
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say- it says just name one, so I will say Outlaw.

167
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:36,862
Speaker 0: Ah.

168
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:39,420
Speaker 0: Outlaw is high quality.

169
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 1: Outlaw is a really fun game.

170
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

171
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,620
Speaker 1: Actually, you know, I'd say Kaboom, but Kaboom I think has a lot of style.

172
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,740
Speaker 0: Kaboom does have style.

173
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:49,880
Speaker 1: Alright, give an example of a game- these are all give an example questions.

174
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,119
Speaker 0: I guess they were all by the same person, but who knows who that is.

175
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,100
Speaker 1: Give an example of a game that was better only after changing the rules.

176
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:58,040
Speaker 0: Okay, I got something to say about this.

177
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,262
Speaker 1: What?

178
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,220
Speaker 1: This is a good question.

179
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 0: Oh, but I got a weird answer to this question.

180
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,198
Speaker 0: Oh, do you?

181
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,809
Speaker 0: A game that is better only after changing the rules.

182
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,797
Speaker 0: If you change the rules, isn't it now a different game?

183
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,020
Speaker 0: Where's the line?

184
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:21,020
Speaker 0: Well, I think in that case, the way I would look at it- You know, in his five card draw poker and seven card stud poker, are those different games, or are they different variations of the same game?

185
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Speaker 1: Well, I know Scott said off the air that he wanted to answer all questions directly, literally, mostly to make fun of people who wrote poor questions.

186
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:41,460
Speaker 1: But, in the spirit of this question, I think the idea is more- Was it a game that you bought, like Puerto Rico or Monopoly, and that by changing the rules of the game as it was bought, but playing the same game otherwise, it was better?

187
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,960
Speaker 1: I have a different kind of answer.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,039
Speaker 0: I have a cop-out answer.

189
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,061
Speaker 1: Amoré.

190
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:50,432
Speaker 1: Because we played the game wrong, like, 20 times.

191
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,420
Speaker 1: And we'd be like, "Oh, we were playing this part

192
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,580
Speaker 1: wrong.".

193
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,160
Speaker 1: But we were always playing another rule wrong, and it took us a long time to actually play the game right, and every wrong way we played was really fun.

194
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,120
Speaker 1: And I think the game had a lot more staying power for us because we played it all these different ways.

195
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:20,600
Speaker 0: I'm gonna cop-out, kind of, and I'm gonna say Blockus, because there's a game called Travel Blockus, which is a small Blockus board that allows you to play two-player Blockus.

196
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:29,500
Speaker 0: We bought four-player Blockus, the real Blockus, but because we knew about Travel Blockus, we were able to use our big Blockus to play Travel Blockus.

197
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,220
Speaker 1: Man, Blockus is such a good game.

198
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,179
Speaker 0: Blockus is a good game.

199
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,000
Speaker 0: It gives you all that feeling.

200
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
Speaker 0: We changed the rules of the four-player Blockus to play two-player Blockus.

201
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,059
Speaker 1: That's such a cop-out answer.

202
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,259
Speaker 0: That is such a cop-out answer.

203
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,260
Speaker 0: Because basically, I really do think that if you change the rules of a game even a little bit, you are now effectively playing a different game.

204
00:13:48,140 --> 00:14:02,000
Speaker 0: Even if it's only a slightly different game, or even if the game is still incredibly similar, I even think that playing a game like Puerto Rico, where you don't change any rules really, but you play three-player, and then four-player, and then five-player.

205
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,159
Speaker 0: I think those are three different games.

206
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:06,360
Speaker 0: Like, they're not completely different games, but I think they're different games.

207
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,939
Speaker 1: Oh, I got a really good answer here.

208
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 1: Alright.

209
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
Speaker 1: Dungeons and Dragons.

210
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:13,260
Speaker 0: Oh, great answer!

211
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:28,340
Speaker 1: Because there are parts of D&D that are good, and parts of D&D that are bad, and I think that by incorporating other elements from other role-playing systems, or by perhaps ignoring certain stupid rules in D&D, you can still use the system to great effect.

212
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:32,440
Speaker 1: And we've talked about that at length, so I'm not going to go any further on that track.

213
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,080
Speaker 0: Alright.

214
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,020
Speaker 0: Who is your favorite game designer?

215
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,440
Speaker 1: I like how game designer is capitalized.

216
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,195
Speaker 1: Yep.

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,857
Speaker 1: Alright, of all time, it's hard to say, because that's like saying, "Who's your favorite creator of movies or

218
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:46,319
Speaker 1: comics?".

219
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:46,989
Speaker 1: Yep.

220
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,140
Speaker 1: Because if you want video games, board games, role-playing games, let's do them all.

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,649
Speaker 1: Alright.

222
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,620
Speaker 1: Board games, I would have to go with Rainer Canisia.

223
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,759
Speaker 0: Rainer Canisia has the most games.

224
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:57,259
Speaker 1: Tigers and Euphrates.

225
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,937
Speaker 1: Tigers and Euphrates.

226
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,360
Speaker 1: He's my favorite game ever.

227
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:05,560
Speaker 0: But, you know, he's definitely up there, but I don't know, the Andrea Seyfarth is also the high quality.

228
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:05,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

229
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,760
Speaker 0: It's a tough call.

230
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,396
Speaker 1: But, I don't know, we can't really debate that, because I don't want to just drop a whole bunch of names and be like, "But what about so-and-so?

231
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:13,817
Speaker 1: What about

232
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:14,198
Speaker 1: so-and-so?".

233
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,859
Speaker 1: But, role-playing games?

234
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,500
Speaker 1: Luke Crane.

235
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:23,060
Speaker 0: I like the Jared Sorenson, the inspectors lacuna guy.

236
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:31,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is- Those little tiny indie RPGs are just so up my alley.

237
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:31,791
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh

238
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:31,995
Speaker 0: yeah.".

239
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,140
Speaker 1: I think both are equal in different ways.

240
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,533
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,400
Speaker 1: Like, the two together are more than the sum of their parts.

242
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:40,359
Speaker 0: Video games.

243
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:49,160
Speaker 1: This is really tricky, because video games are very collaborative and- I mean, it's like, I could say Miyamoto, but- Or you could say Sid Meier.

244
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,220
Speaker 0: I could say Sid Meier.

245
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,278
Speaker 0: I could say, like, Gunpei Yokoi.

246
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,253
Speaker 1: Oh, Gunpei.

247
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,099
Speaker 1: Japan wronged you.

248
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,947
Speaker 0: I could say, who's the SimCity guy?

249
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:03,950
Speaker 0: Will Wright?

250
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, Will Wright.

251
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,769
Speaker 0: I don't like the Molly Neu guy so much.

252
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,707
Speaker 1: Nah, I don't like him.

253
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,194
Speaker 0: No.

254
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:11,308
Speaker 1: Alright, this is dragging out.

255
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,350
Speaker 0: Gabe Newell, the Half-Life guy.

256
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,170
Speaker 1: We're doing what we said we shouldn't do for board games.

257
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,350
Speaker 1: Let's just name all the game designers we know that we like.

258
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:17,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there you go.

259
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,469
Speaker 1: You know what?

260
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 0: I don't really have a favorite.

261
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,809
Speaker 0: I guess Miyamoto, or whatever.

262
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:29,350
Speaker 1: I think Mordu, there aren't game designers, especially video game designers, by and large are not in the spotlight like other- Carmack.

263
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:29,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

264
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,890
Speaker 0: It's not like, 'cause the problem is, is there's a bunch of big name game designers, but none of them really stand out above the rest.

265
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,350
Speaker 0: You know, like, aha, that one's the best one right there.

266
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,570
Speaker 1: Because they all make very different games that don't compete with each other.

267
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're a bunch of guys, and they all make awesome games, and- Like, look, FPSs, right?

268
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,349
Speaker 1: Alright, John Romero, John Carmack.

269
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:49,549
Speaker 1: Name anyone else.

270
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:50,289
Speaker 0: Gabe Newell.

271
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, name anyone else.

272
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:53,830
Speaker 0: The people who work for Gabe Newell.

273
00:16:56,593 --> 00:17:11,188
Speaker 1: I just think in general, a lot of people don't know who make their games, and, like, I remember when I started paying attention to who directed the movies or anime I liked, and it was a great way to find other things I might like, and I don't think many people look at that when they look at video games, and- Nope.

274
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:13,530
Speaker 1: I could talk about Kojima.

275
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright.

276
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,849
Speaker 0: Why do you think some good game designers publish crap games?

277
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,089
Speaker 0: Money.

278
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:18,488
Speaker 0: Money.

279
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,810
Speaker 1: What is your opinion of games with dice as the primary game mechanic?

280
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:23,887
Speaker 0: We don't like it.

281
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,310
Speaker 1: Except for Dice Land?

282
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:29,350
Speaker 0: You might as well just flip a coin, and whoever, you know, calls it wins.

283
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,010
Speaker 0: End of story.

284
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,606
Speaker 1: I mean, dice can be used.

285
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:31,910
Speaker 1: well.

286
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,270
Speaker 0: They can be used- But as the primary mechanic?

287
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,370
Speaker 1: Well, Dice Land, Liar's Dice.

288
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,229
Speaker 0: That's about it.

289
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,990
Speaker 1: But then again, I would argue that the primary mechanic of Liar's Dice is lying.

290
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,030
Speaker 0: That's true.

291
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,790
Speaker 1: Alright, what is your opinion of games that do not use dice?

292
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,510
Speaker 1: They tend to be awesome.

293
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:57,430
Speaker 0: They tend to be awesome, however, once you figure them out, unless they have some sort of randomness, you will eventually figure them out and you won't need to play them anymore.

294
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:57,778
Speaker 1: Yup.

295
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,810
Speaker 0: Are CCGs dead?

296
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:03,308
Speaker 0: I don't think they're dead because- Well, they're dead to me.

297
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,830
Speaker 0: They're dead to me, and there's still a lot of people who play them, and they're not as popular as they used to be, and I don't think their popularity is going to increase.

298
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,930
Speaker 0: I think their popularity is going to remain the same.

299
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,590
Speaker 1: However, you cannot underestimate the Pokemon hordes.

300
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,710
Speaker 0: You cannot underestimate the Pokemon and the Magic.

301
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,926
Speaker 0: What is the best CCG?

302
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,289
Speaker 1: You know, I've played a bunch of them.

303
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,725
Speaker 1: Not a lot.

304
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,890
Speaker 0: I have played a bunch of them, and none of them- I can say which ones are crappy.

305
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,569
Speaker 1: I mean, Magic was kind of the first one.

306
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:28,170
Speaker 1: Yup.

307
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,789
Speaker 1: And Magic wasn't that bad.

308
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:30,182
Speaker 0: Nope.

309
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,150
Speaker 1: I mean, Magic's problems were caused mostly by the collector mentality around the game.

310
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,490
Speaker 0: Yet the Pokemon one is also not so bad.

311
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,326
Speaker 0: The Pokemon one's fun.

312
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:39,630
Speaker 1: It's really fun.

313
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,830
Speaker 1: Yu-Gi-Oh is cra- I think it was our friend Luke who explained how- The can of Coke won the Yu-Gi-Oh tournament?

314
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:48,269
Speaker 1: Yes, they had a Yu-Gi-Oh tournament and a 20 ounce of Coca-Cola.

315
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:49,290
Speaker 1: It might have been diet.

316
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:49,988
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

317
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,889
Speaker 1: Basically, they said, "Alright, this Coke-".

318
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,230
Speaker 0: Because the store, the gaming store, has every good card.

319
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,430
Speaker 0: So the gaming store took all the best cards and made the best deck.

320
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:05,290
Speaker 0: And basically, what the can of Coke did was, the rules of it were, it draws a card and plays a card every turn, and that's all it does.

321
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,169
Speaker 0: And it won.

322
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,269
Speaker 0: It won the whole tournament.

323
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh was a crap game.

324
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:10,670
Speaker 1: The Harry Potter CCG was really awful.

325
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:11,869
Speaker 1: I played it a bunch of times.

326
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,130
Speaker 0: Penny Arcade CCG, I bought it for the art.

327
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,230
Speaker 0: And it was terrible.

328
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:16,309
Speaker 1: The Penny Arcade game.

329
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,630
Speaker 0: So I guess whatever that is, yeah, not good.

330
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,249
Speaker 1: So- I've got it.

331
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,750
Speaker 1: I'm holding it in my hands.

332
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Speaker 0: The best CCG might be the Pokemon one.

333
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,024
Speaker 0: There's probably some others I haven't played.

334
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,930
Speaker 0: that might be better, but I don't play them.

335
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:28,409
Speaker 0: I don't know.

336
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,048
Speaker 0: I don't care.

337
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:37,689
Speaker 1: I think it's just that a collectible card game has a problem that no matter how good the game is, the collectible mentality will win out.

338
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:46,430
Speaker 1: And I think what we could do to make a game like this awesome is take all the ideas of a collectible game, but make it a drafting game instead.

339
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,990
Speaker 1: Where you buy the set, and your friend buys the set, and you make a deck from a common pool of cards, and then you play.

340
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,510
Speaker 0: I like the, if you want to talk, if you count it as a card game, there's the one where you pop out the ships.

341
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,490
Speaker 0: There's Pirates of the Spanish Game.

342
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:01,770
Speaker 1: I've heard that's actually kind of fun.

343
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,730
Speaker 0: I've heard that's actually okay.

344
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:05,229
Speaker 0: So that and maybe some of the clicks games.

345
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,530
Speaker 0: I think the hero clicks is the best of the clicks games.

346
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:08,330
Speaker 0: That's not saying much.

347
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:08,647
Speaker 0: All right.

348
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:14,510
Speaker 1: Well, what were the hardest rules or controls that you have ever had to overcome in a game?

349
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,950
Speaker 0: Well, usually when the controls are difficult to overcome, I don't overcome them, and I just don't play.

350
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,070
Speaker 1: Well, nowadays I don't.

351
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,130
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I would.

352
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,348
Speaker 1: I played Renegade, and I got real used to the fact that depending on which direction you're facing, you did different things.

353
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,550
Speaker 0: Oh, I did not bother.

354
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,010
Speaker 1: I would deal with that a lot.

355
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,589
Speaker 1: Renegade was real tough to deal with.

356
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,151
Speaker 1: So was freaking Double Dragon 3.

357
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:37,829
Speaker 0: Hardest rules.

358
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,350
Speaker 0: Goa was hard to learn from the rule book, but it's actually not really that hard a game if someone teaches it to you.

359
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,490
Speaker 1: I think part of that was that we tried to learn Goa in a very loud room.

360
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,070
Speaker 0: I think the rule book is also shitty.

361
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,950
Speaker 1: Yes, but in addition, it was a loud room, and there was a dog barking.

362
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,403
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,490
Speaker 0: Hardest rules, maybe Daimacher.

364
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,149
Speaker 0: Pretty complicated right there.

365
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,250
Speaker 1: Actually, Daimacher wasn't that complicated.

366
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,310
Speaker 1: Well, it was complicated, but it wasn't difficult complexity.

367
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,930
Speaker 1: It was just like you kind of powered through it, and it all just kind of worked.

368
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:06,449
Speaker 0: Yeah.

369
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,670
Speaker 1: Square tomatoes and all.

370
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:08,570
Speaker 0: I don't know.

371
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:15,789
Speaker 0: I guess some of those really crazy war games are too difficult for me to overcome, but I just don't play them.

372
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,570
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to know a game that I never was able to play correctly?

373
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:20,970
Speaker 1: Battle System.

374
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:21,352
Speaker 0: Ah.

375
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:30,949
Speaker 1: Battle System was the mass combat set of rules, official, for advanced Dungeons and Dragons, like second edition style.

376
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,343
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

377
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:35,110
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, that was one hell of a game.

378
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:44,085
Speaker 1: I'm talking terrain, like moving units by giving them orders without measuring, and then measuring to see where they get, so you had to eyeball a lot, and formation mattered.

379
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,330
Speaker 1: That game was so hard.

380
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,270
Speaker 0: All right.

381
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:55,269
Speaker 1: I could say that one of the hardest things I've ever had to overcome is trying to play games with other people who just don't listen when we teach them how to play a game.

382
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:56,328
Speaker 1: All right.

383
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:08,150
Speaker 1: Like it's one thing if you screw up a game that we teach you, because some games are try to learn how to play, and it's infuriating.

384
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,910
Speaker 0: It's true.

385
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,450
Speaker 0: Okay.

386
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,529
Speaker 0: Favorite video game moments?

387
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:16,789
Speaker 1: I think it was when I got the hammer for the first time in Zelda II.

388
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,449
Speaker 0: That was a good moment right there.

389
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:26,450
Speaker 1: Or when I walked into the ninth dungeon in Zelda for the first time, and that music was different, and I got really scared.

390
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:27,670
Speaker 0: Also a good moment.

391
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,364
Speaker 0: I think in my life, probably when I beat Mega Man 2 for the first, that was the first game I beat.

392
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:34,949
Speaker 0: Another good moment.

393
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,669
Speaker 0: The beginning of Half-Life 2, where you're running away from all these guys, and you don't have any weapons yet.

394
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,650
Speaker 0: Oh, and the apartment block?

395
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you run through, and then the combine guys come up the stairs, and they got the spark thing.

396
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,149
Speaker 0: I don't know, man.

397
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:54,730
Speaker 1: That was hot, because I expected, you know, Half-Life games in the past were like, the game was dynamic, but it wasn't that dynamic and that hard-hitting.

398
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,770
Speaker 1: And when I ran back, they're like, "Oh, crap!

399
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,054
Speaker 1: Run

400
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:57,328
Speaker 1: away!".

401
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:06,805
Speaker 1: And I run back down the stairs, and I see the guards banging open the apartment and dragging some guy out, and then they look up and see me, I yelled a little bit in the real world.

402
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:08,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good moment right there.

403
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,890
Speaker 1: Uh, actually, the first time, I beat Doom 2, because that was an epic experience.

404
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,970
Speaker 1: I beat Doom 2.

405
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the ending is so disappointing.

406
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:18,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

407
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,649
Speaker 1: It didn't matter, because I beat that game.

408
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,770
Speaker 1: You know how hard that game was on Ultra-Violent?

409
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,296
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

410
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:23,756
Speaker 0: God.

411
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:25,450
Speaker 0: Alright.

412
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:33,610
Speaker 0: Has there ever been for either of you a major epiphany related to video games in which you knew that your life would be significantly different after that experience?

413
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:41,390
Speaker 0: For example, this could be anything that signaled you a new, unexpected epoch of gaming, or a change to your understanding of video games, or just interpreted however.

414
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:52,909
Speaker 1: Uh, I think the biggest one for me was that I played, and I've mentioned this every now and then, I played The Realm, the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game, or Memorpica.

415
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:55,970
Speaker 1: And I played it for a long time.

416
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,030
Speaker 1: I got in on the beta.

417
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:58,867
Speaker 1: I played that game hardcore.

418
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,170
Speaker 1: I was super into it.

419
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,830
Speaker 1: I ground like you wouldn't believe.

420
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,809
Speaker 1: I had my guild.

421
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,890
Speaker 1: I had my millions of gold.

422
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,030
Speaker 1: I had my Baldricks of various colors.

423
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,090
Speaker 1: And I really got into it, and I had a bunch of friends on there.

424
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:15,050
Speaker 1: And one day, there was a kind of a net split, where the login server crashed.

425
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,270
Speaker 1: So you could not log into the game.

426
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,470
Speaker 1: But if you were already logged in, you could keep playing.

427
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,648
Speaker 1: And the game was getting kind of buggy, because something else was going on, and there was a memory leak.

428
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,570
Speaker 1: And bit by bit, like people started dropping out.

429
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:39,365
Speaker 1: And out of the thousands of people in the game, it came down to there were like 30 or 40 people left, and it was kind of this, like everyone was kind of banding together in the city.

430
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,447
Speaker 1: And we were like, "Oh man, this is so

431
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:41,749
Speaker 1: cool.".

432
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,070
Speaker 1: And people were taking screenshots like, "Who's gonna be the last one left?

433
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,666
Speaker 1: This is gonna go down in gaming

434
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:47,050
Speaker 1: history.".

435
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:47,519
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh

436
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:47,906
Speaker 1: man.".

437
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,027
Speaker 0: And no one remembers it.

438
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,148
Speaker 1: Well, now I'll get to that.

439
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:56,250
Speaker 1: And I remember I was sitting there, and I'm in there, and it got down to 14 people left.

440
00:24:56,692 --> 00:25:02,730
Speaker 1: And I'm standing, like holding out in this room, and I'm talking to like the cool kids in the front area of Leenster.

441
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,319
Speaker 1: You couldn't often hang out in that area, because the room filled up and you couldn't get in.

442
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,070
Speaker 1: So I was talking to like Elemental, and all those awesome people.

443
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,690
Speaker 1: You know, awesome in my playing MMOs days.

444
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:15,950
Speaker 1: And my dad comes over, you know, it was just me and my dad for the weekend.

445
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,504
Speaker 1: He's like, "Hey, you wanna go out for dinner or

446
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:17,848
Speaker 1: something?".

447
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:21,190
Speaker 1: And I was like, "No, something important's happening in my video game.

448
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:22,108
Speaker 1: I can't leave.

449
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:22,982
Speaker 1: I gotta sit

450
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:23,144
Speaker 1: here.".

451
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,009
Speaker 1: And I sat there all night.

452
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,890
Speaker 1: And at like 4 in the morning, there were like 10 of us left.

453
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,169
Speaker 1: And the login server came back up.

454
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,267
Speaker 1: And someone logged in.

455
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,968
Speaker 1: And someone else logged in.

456
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:35,788
Speaker 1: And then a bunch of people logged in.

457
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,390
Speaker 1: And then I realized, wow, I should've gone out to dinner with my dad.

458
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,950
Speaker 1: I've been wasting my life playing this stupid game.

459
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,509
Speaker 1: And I pretty much never played it again.

460
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:48,070
Speaker 1: And that is why World of Warcraft is crap.

461
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:57,289
Speaker 0: So, for me, a major epiphany related to video games, maybe the first time I played Counter-Strike and I was like, "Oh, that's...".

462
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,350
Speaker 0: 'Cause someone told me about Counter-Strike.

463
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,688
Speaker 0: And they were like, "Yeah, you die and you can't play

464
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:01,890
Speaker 0: again.".

465
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,300
Speaker 0: I'm like, "What?

466
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,464
Speaker 0: That's

467
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:02,730
Speaker 0: crap.".

468
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,410
Speaker 0: And then I'm like, "Oh, wait, rounds are like two minutes.

469
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,023
Speaker 0: This game total is awesome.

470
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:07,346
Speaker 0: Oh my

471
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:07,609
Speaker 0: god.".

472
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,427
Speaker 1: Man, I remember that the first time I played Counter-Strike, I'm like, "I'm walking.

473
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:11,769
Speaker 1: I got my

474
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:11,950
Speaker 1: gun.".

475
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,534
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Alright.

476
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,628
Speaker 1: This is really slow, but I can deal with

477
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:14,728
Speaker 1: it.".

478
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:15,830
Speaker 1: And then I just died.

479
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,517
Speaker 1: I was like, "What?

480
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:17,387
Speaker 1: That

481
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:17,610
Speaker 1: sucks.".

482
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:19,167
Speaker 1: And I just didn't get it.

483
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:19,845
Speaker 0: Yep.

484
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:25,670
Speaker 0: Has there ever been for either of you a similar epiphany related to board games or tabletop role-playing games?

485
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:36,490
Speaker 1: Well, when I was at UberCon the year before Scott went to his first UberCon, I saw some indie gamer guys and they were hyping up their little system called Burning Wheel.

486
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,707
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Alright, I'll try that stupid

487
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:38,969
Speaker 1: thing.".

488
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:40,455
Speaker 1: You know, I got nothing better to do.

489
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:44,329
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for the Settlers of Catan sanctioned tournament that I did very well in.

490
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:50,090
Speaker 1: And I walk over and I play this combat demo and it was not like anything I'd ever played before.

491
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,890
Speaker 1: And it was kind of cool, but at the same time, the guys seemed really intense.

492
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:56,510
Speaker 1: And I was kind of put off by that.

493
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,790
Speaker 0: He is real intense.

494
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,581
Speaker 1: I was like, "Alright, gamer guys.

495
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:00,488
Speaker 1: Your system's not that

496
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:00,770
Speaker 1: great.".

497
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,843
Speaker 1: Because I didn't know about the rest of Burning Wheel.

498
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:03,990
Speaker 1: They just played the combat for me.

499
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,539
Speaker 1: And I was like, "This is cool, but it's also really kind of

500
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:06,760
Speaker 1: difficult.".

501
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:07,877
Speaker 1: "Alright, cool.

502
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,240
Speaker 1: Whatever.".

503
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,130
Speaker 1: Then we played Burning Wheel The Inheritance with Luke Crane the following year.

504
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,785
Speaker 0: Just playing the sword was definitely the RPG epiphany.

505
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:18,006
Speaker 0: Like,

506
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:18,569
Speaker 0: "Oh!".

507
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,450
Speaker 1: Well, we sat down and he passes out characters.

508
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:23,766
Speaker 1: And I was the elf who was like, "Father

509
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:24,149
Speaker 1: whatever.".

510
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,087
Speaker 1: And Pete was the dwarf who was, "Father

511
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:26,450
Speaker 1: whatever.".

512
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,310
Speaker 1: And Scott was the filthy human who was just trying to steal the sword because humans are filthy.

513
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,230
Speaker 0: You mean the awesome human.

514
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,786
Speaker 1: And Luke's like, "Alright, I gotta go talk to someone.

515
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:35,169
Speaker 1: I'll be right

516
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:35,310
Speaker 1: back.".

517
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:40,210
Speaker 1: By the time he came back, we were already arguing loudly in character.

518
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:43,206
Speaker 1: And then we stop when he walks in and he says, "No, no.

519
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:43,629
Speaker 1: Continue.".

520
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:47,365
Speaker 1: And at that moment, I was like, "I think this system is what I

521
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:47,647
Speaker 1: want.".

522
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:52,315
Speaker 0: In terms of board games, I think the first time I played Settlers, I was like, "Oh

523
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:52,708
Speaker 0: man.".

524
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,708
Speaker 0: I was like, "This is a new kind of

525
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:54,910
Speaker 0: game.".

526
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:02,690
Speaker 0: Because up until then, right, I had played games like Monopoly, but I was tired of those because they were all just sort of random crap.

527
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:08,710
Speaker 0: And then I was playing games like Risk and Axis and Allies, but I was tired of those because they just had so much shit.

528
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:13,390
Speaker 1: Yep, and then we played Shogun before we played Settlers, and that game was just impossible.

529
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,315
Speaker 1: Yeah.

530
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:16,609
Speaker 0: Alright, let's keep going here.

531
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,288
Speaker 1: Well, I got one more.

532
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,110
Speaker 1: Dance Dance Revolution.

533
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:20,150
Speaker 0: Oh, good call.

534
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,510
Speaker 1: Because I thought DDR was stupid.

535
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it was stupid and then I did it and I learned my lesson.

536
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,590
Speaker 1: But the story... Well, maybe we'll tell that another time.

537
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:34,339
Speaker 1: But suffice to say, there was a moment when I was playing DDR one day and I was like, "This is

538
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:35,209
Speaker 1: awesome.".

539
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:38,007
Speaker 1: And I went over to Scott and I'm like, "Scott, this game is

540
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:38,390
Speaker 1: awesome!".

541
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,201
Speaker 1: And he didn't believe me.

542
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:39,607
Speaker 1: and I'm like, "Stop

543
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:39,810
Speaker 1: it.".

544
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,010
Speaker 0: I'd known about that game, I'd been avoiding it, I thought it was stupid, it looked stupid, and even if it didn't look stupid, I wasn't going to have any of it.

545
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,550
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Scott, play one game with me and I'll eat my words if you don't like

546
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:50,630
Speaker 1: it.".

547
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,784
Speaker 1: He's like, "Fine, I'll shut you

548
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:51,946
Speaker 1: up.".

549
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:53,123
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Game

550
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:53,407
Speaker 0: over.".

551
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,070
Speaker 1: And then he kept playing and history was made.

552
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:57,442
Speaker 1: Alright.

553
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,650
Speaker 1: Has there ever been for... Oh, we just answered that.

554
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:05,770
Speaker 1: Besides Astro Boy Omega Factor, what other anime-based games are good?

555
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:11,270
Speaker 0: The question assumes that Astro Boy Omega Factor is good, and I think I've never played it.

556
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:12,390
Speaker 0: I've heard it's good.

557
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:20,550
Speaker 0: I've heard it's good, and I'm confident that it is good because it's Astro Boy, it's for the GBA, and it's made by Treasure, the people who made Dynamite Headdy and Gunstar Heroes.

558
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:26,470
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure it's a good game, but I'm not 100% sure of that, so I'm not going to perfectly agree without playing it.

559
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,210
Speaker 0: However, are there other anime-based games that are good?

560
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:41,910
Speaker 1: Well, my easy answer is, in Japan, on the Wonderswan, even though I don't know how good those games are, but I've always wanted to play the Utena game for the Sega Saturn.

561
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think that's actually a good game, though.

562
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,790
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's one of those Japanese adventure... It has the rules of a dating game, but it's not a dating game.

563
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:57,230
Speaker 1: It's like, the decisions you make and the people you talk to and what you say to them kind of affect this world and is kind of a choose-your-own adventure.

564
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:59,709
Speaker 0: I just remember the best anime game.

565
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,290
Speaker 0: Initial D Arcade, end of story.

566
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,319
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah!

567
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:04,390
Speaker 1: Oh, man!

568
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,670
Speaker 0: Initial D Arcade is the best anime-based game.

569
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:09,450
Speaker 0: Every other anime-based game is crap.

570
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:09,973
Speaker 0: You know what?

571
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:12,088
Speaker 1: Actually, if you like fighting games...

572
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Naruto fighting games and, like, the... Are really fun.

573
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:16,729
Speaker 0: They're pretty good games.

574
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:19,009
Speaker 0: The Shonen Jump DS fighting games, they're okay.

575
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,975
Speaker 0: They're all okay.

576
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,910
Speaker 0: They're not like these amazing games, but they're good.

577
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,510
Speaker 1: The Naruto game on the PSP is actually really fun.

578
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:29,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're okay, but... Initial D in the arcade, best anime game.

579
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,930
Speaker 1: Goddamn, to this day.

580
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,450
Speaker 0: Oh, Fist of the North Star Arcade.

581
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:34,710
Speaker 1: Also awesome.

582
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:36,969
Speaker 0: Alright, but not as good as Initial D.

583
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:37,708
Speaker 1: Alright.

584
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,365
Speaker 0: How do you guys feel about overhyped games, i.e.

585
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:43,047
Speaker 0: Halo 3 XD?

586
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,190
Speaker 1: Alright, I don't think Halo 3 was really overhyped.

587
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,290
Speaker 1: I think everyone... I mean, the ads were the ads, and I think everyone who bought it knew exactly what to expect and got exactly what they wanted.

588
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:54,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, an example of an over... And the game wasn't bad.

589
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, an example of an overhyped game would be something like Gun.

590
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:02,450
Speaker 0: I remember going to GameStop, whatever, there were these huge displays for Gun.

591
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,101
Speaker 0: There were ads for Gun everywhere.

592
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,370
Speaker 0: People were talking about Gun, Gun, Gun.

593
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,885
Speaker 1: Every time you bought a game, they'd be like, "You want to pre-order Gun?

594
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:08,429
Speaker 1: We're gonna sell

595
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,610
Speaker 1: out.".

596
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,809
Speaker 1: And I was like, "If you're gonna sell out, how come you keep trying to get me to pre-order

597
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:11,889
Speaker 1: it?".

598
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,392
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:16,328
Speaker 0: So, Gun was just a...

600
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:16,709
Speaker 1: Garbage!

601
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,423
Speaker 0: Who cares about that game now?

602
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:19,070
Speaker 0: It was crap.

603
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:23,066
Speaker 0: It was just GTA, crappy GTA clone in the wild west.

604
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,110
Speaker 0: Had nothing to it.

605
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,843
Speaker 1: Except there weren't even any horses to steal.

606
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:26,610
Speaker 1: There was just nothing.

607
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:34,405
Speaker 0: So, pretty much, if someone spends a lot of money on marketing dollars to try to sell a game, you know, they can do that.

608
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:34,910
Speaker 0: That's fine.

609
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,730
Speaker 0: But, if your game doesn't live up to the marketing dollars you spend, maybe you shouldn't have embarrassed yourself.

610
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,379
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really care what you do.

611
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:43,909
Speaker 0: It's all fine by me.

612
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,589
Speaker 0: I don't buy crap games.

613
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:51,890
Speaker 0: But, I just, you know, I think people wouldn't want to embarrass themselves.

614
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,430
Speaker 1: Alright, this is actually a good question.

615
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:59,270
Speaker 1: Why do you guys come off like you hate the idea of console FPS?

616
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,690
Speaker 1: Aside from the fact that a mouse is superior.

617
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,890
Speaker 0: A mouse is superior.

618
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:10,190
Speaker 1: Honestly, I mean, the problem is that the genre, FPS, first person shooter, is really broad.

619
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:13,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you could go Wolfenstein 3D.

620
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:15,509
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein 3D is technically an FPS.

621
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,469
Speaker 0: You're in the first person and you shoot.

622
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:24,210
Speaker 0: But, it's really a maze game and a game of touching all the walls to find all the secrets and getting all the treasure.

623
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,470
Speaker 0: There isn't a lot of, I mean, there is shooting, but there's not really dodging.

624
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,590
Speaker 0: It's just kill the bad guys and manage your ammo.

625
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,508
Speaker 1: And I guess it's more that...

626
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:33,370
Speaker 0: It's not like Quake.

627
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:41,890
Speaker 1: Without the fine control that you can get from a mouse, the kind of FPS that I prefer is impossible to have.

628
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:51,330
Speaker 1: And a few people have argued against this, but the level of control with a mouse is just to the point that it's like I'm in the game looking around.

629
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,303
Speaker 1: The only thing better than that would be VR.

630
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,069
Speaker 0: Or Wiimote's pretty good, too.

631
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,670
Speaker 1: Wiimote is really good, but in certain circumstances.

632
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,734
Speaker 1: Yes.

633
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:02,630
Speaker 0: Wiimote is better than an analog stick, but it's still not as good as a mouse.

634
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,167
Speaker 1: Plus, you know what?

635
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:12,290
Speaker 1: I love the idea of console FPSs, because games like Halo are introducing whole generations of people to FPSs and the FPS community, the FPS culture.

636
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:22,550
Speaker 0: It's just not introducing them to the type of FPS that involves ludicrously fast action, requiring ludicrously perfect aim from the players to have any measure of skill.

637
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,869
Speaker 1: That may be a dead genre.

638
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:34,150
Speaker 0: It may be, but that's the kind of FPS that we kind of like, is the ones that require you to have incredible aim, that require you to be incredibly precise movements and incredibly fast reflexes.

639
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:41,390
Speaker 0: And those kinds of games can't be played without a mouse and keyboard or some other new input device we have not yet invented.

640
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:48,270
Speaker 0: They cannot be played with analog sticks, where the fastest you can move is pushing the analog stick to the edge and then just waiting.

641
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:59,170
Speaker 1: Plus, PC gaming is not for everyone, and the fact that games like Halo allow people who would otherwise never have a gaming PC to experience the community of an FPS is, I think, really great.

642
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,486
Speaker 0: What is your views on game crossovers?

643
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:03,350
Speaker 0: I don't really know what you mean.

644
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:05,630
Speaker 1: And that was an improper sentence.

645
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,962
Speaker 0: Oh, this could be described as either cross-promotions, i.e.

646
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:10,889
Speaker 0: Halo game fuel, I don't know what that is.

647
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,089
Speaker 1: Oh, they marketed an energy drink, Halo something.

648
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,830
Speaker 0: How's that any different from marketing anything with putting a cartoon like Mario Cereal?

649
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,489
Speaker 1: Or Pocky with Gundam on it.

650
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine, who cares.

651
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:27,670
Speaker 0: Or medium crossovers, a la .hack with OAVs, TV shows, video games, and manga.

652
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,768
Speaker 1: Or that vampire thing.

653
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:32,668
Speaker 0: Oh, Blood Plus, or Blood the Last Vampire, and then Blood Plus, yeah.

654
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:46,310
Speaker 0: This crossover of something into multiple mediums idea, where you take one property, and I mean it's one thing to like where Voltron, this Voltron, the anime, and then this Voltron the comic, but they're sort of separate, it's not like you have to do both.

655
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:56,429
Speaker 0: But .hack, the idea of that is, you have to play the video game, you have to watch the anime, and you have to get the manga to get the whole story, because it pans across all these different mediums.

656
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:58,670
Speaker 0: And that's kinda cool.

657
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,210
Speaker 1: I guess it's kind of like the same feelings I have about communism.

658
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:15,246
Speaker 1: The idea is great, I really would love to see someone do it well, but .hack was a god awful anime, and when I say .hack, you might say, "What do you mean, hack sign, hack all of

659
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:15,488
Speaker 1: them?".

660
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,210
Speaker 1: And the video games were MMO simulators.

661
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't even an MMO, it was pretend MMO.

662
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,409
Speaker 1: And the manga was crap, and just, it's one of those things where- Is crap, it still exists.

663
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:30,949
Speaker 1: Okay, regardless.

664
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:47,289
Speaker 1: It's why I feel like that sort of thing could be done really well, and I think you could make kind of a really immersive experience by having this unified media, and I think unified media is going to be a push in gaming over the next decade, but not in the next five years.

665
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,550
Speaker 1: But that's just an out there guess.

666
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,045
Speaker 0: Alright, what import games have you played/owned?

667
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:03,670
Speaker 1: Alright, we semi-legitimately owned every DDR that was released in Japan for the PlayStation 1.

668
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,269
Speaker 0: That's kind of true.

669
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:09,270
Speaker 1: I got them from Red Octane, and I may or may not have copied them to CDRs and had a 6-pin mod chip.

670
00:36:10,412 --> 00:36:10,553
Speaker 0: Yep.

671
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:14,870
Speaker 0: Other than that, I'd ever really buy or play import games so much.

672
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,209
Speaker 0: I see games in Japan like, "Oh man, those games are so cool, I want

673
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:18,350
Speaker 0: them.".

674
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:23,030
Speaker 0: But most of those games are games that require me to read Japanese very fluently.

675
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,730
Speaker 0: For example, Earthbound 3, or Mother 1-2 for the GBA.

676
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:33,050
Speaker 0: So I don't buy them, and they're also way more money than I'm willing to spend, and way more effort than it's worth it for me.

677
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:40,370
Speaker 0: I already have more games in the US than I have time to play, so why am I going to spend more money to get Japanese games that are going to be hard to play?

678
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,430
Speaker 1: I mean, I wanted to buy Extra Mix DDR, but it was like 80 bucks to import that from Japan.

679
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:51,690
Speaker 1: Or for $4, I could rent it from Red Octane and maybe copy it or something.

680
00:36:51,910 --> 00:37:00,690
Speaker 0: Now back in the college days, I used to play a lot of import games such as Para Para Paradise, Cardcaptor Sakura Tetris, Magical Drop.

681
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,329
Speaker 1: But we had friends who had all those games.

682
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,270
Speaker 0: Those are mostly puzzle games, which didn't require reading, and rhythm games.

683
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:13,270
Speaker 0: And also Tokimeki Memorial, but with people helping us to figure out what it said.

684
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:19,190
Speaker 1: Oh man, we used to play Tokimeki Memorial tag-team audience style.

685
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:20,889
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, that is fun.

686
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:39,190
Speaker 0: But other than that, I guess there are some indie PC games such as Cave Story, and Two Miki Fighters and things like that that I will play, which are games made by indie developers in other countries, but they're for the PC so I can play them, and it's not really an import game technically.

687
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,696
Speaker 0: But that's about it.

688
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:46,850
Speaker 0: I mean, I always pay attention to see what games they're making, but I don't really bother to play them until they come out here.

689
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,270
Speaker 1: Well there's that Penny Arcade, it was Mario Sunshine comes out in a week, you can probably wait.

690
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:55,810
Speaker 1: And then the other side was Mario Sunshine comes out in a week, how are you gonna wait?

691
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,486
Speaker 0: Yup.

692
00:37:57,471 --> 00:38:00,089
Speaker 1: And there's a follow-up question from the same person I guess.

693
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,830
Speaker 1: What's your highest score on Frogger?

694
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:02,488
Speaker 0: I don't know.

695
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:03,241
Speaker 1: A lot.

696
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,610
Speaker 0: I played Frogger, I got pretty far.

697
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,590
Speaker 1: I played Frogger a lot on the Intellivision 2, like more than I should have.

698
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,810
Speaker 0: Alright, what about highest score in anything?

699
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,030
Speaker 0: A billion billion.

700
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:16,290
Speaker 0: A hagillion bajillion.

701
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,370
Speaker 1: Have you guys ever modded a console?

702
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,009
Speaker 1: I soldered a 6-pin mod chip with stealth into a PlayStation, well a PS1.

703
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:35,329
Speaker 1: I bought that PS1 in order to mod it for the sole purpose of playing Dance Dance Revolution, until Scott bought, I forget what game he bought, but he bought some SHMUP.

704
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:36,710
Speaker 0: G-Darius?

705
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:37,429
Speaker 1: G-Darius.

706
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,209
Speaker 1: That was the first game that was not a DDR game that was run in my PS1.

707
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,568
Speaker 1: It was also the first non-pirated game that ever ran in my PS1.

708
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,170
Speaker 0: Alright, what would be your perfect console?

709
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,359
Speaker 1: A computer.

710
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,046
Speaker 1: A PC.

711
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,783
Speaker 0: Something that is so incredibly small you can't see it.

712
00:38:55,823 --> 00:39:03,328
Speaker 0: that allows me to download and play any game ever created on my TV with the perfect control interface for each and every game and it's all free.

713
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:04,970
Speaker 1: Uh, virtual reality.

714
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:05,925
Speaker 0: That too.

715
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,733
Speaker 1: Okay.

716
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:09,290
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if LARP can count as gaming.

717
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,390
Speaker 1: LARP stands for live-action role-playing, by the way.

718
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:12,956
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts on that?

719
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:13,963
Speaker 1: Have you ever LARPed?

720
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,009
Speaker 1: Should people try it?

721
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:18,850
Speaker 1: Unless you live in Rochester, New York, by all means.

722
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,670
Speaker 0: Well, the thing with LARP, I mean, there's nothing wrong with LARP itself.

723
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:31,510
Speaker 0: I mean, the idea is that you're playing D&D-ish kind of game, only you're standing up and you're actually acting things out, and sometimes you get the Boffa weapons going on or something like that.

724
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:32,639
Speaker 1: LARPing is really fun.

725
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:33,930
Speaker 1: I've done it several times.

726
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, there's no reason it can't be done in a fun and good way.

727
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:51,910
Speaker 0: The problem is, I'd say a good part of LARPing, perhaps a majority of it, at least in this country, involves scary vampire people who want to have sex and drink blood in their freaky occult-type people.

728
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,109
Speaker 1: Well, let me put it this way.

729
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,490
Speaker 0: And you don't want to associate with that.

730
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,342
Speaker 1: There is the large subset of LARPers.

731
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:57,410
Speaker 1: That includes a lot of people.

732
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:05,230
Speaker 1: But there is a significant percentage of those people who only play the White Wolf-style vampire World of Darkness kind of games.

733
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,489
Speaker 1: And a large percentage of those people...

734
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,370
Speaker 0: Isn't it called, like, the Camarilla or something?

735
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,303
Speaker 1: Well, the Cam is separate.

736
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:11,486
Speaker 1: Don't...

737
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:12,989
Speaker 0: Don't you want to avoid that?

738
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,090
Speaker 1: Don't get me started on the Cam.

739
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:16,639
Speaker 0: Yeah.

740
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:37,690
Speaker 1: The real problem is that LARPing is awesome, but it has been my experience at every Con I've ever been, with the possible exception of AnimeCons, which is a whole different ballgame in terms of LARPing, is that a lot of the people who are attracted to LARPing are really, really, really creepy and really way too into the LARPing.

741
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:43,989
Speaker 1: And the worst part is that they want to act it all out, but they take everything personally, and it's not just a game to them.

742
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:45,830
Speaker 1: And it matters more than their lives.

743
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,169
Speaker 1: And the sheer amount of drama that came out of LARPs...

744
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:56,520
Speaker 0: Because these are usually people... I guess I'm going to do the armchair psychology here, where they don't have a lot of self-confidence.

745
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,560
Speaker 0: They don't like themselves.

746
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,500
Speaker 0: They're kind of not so very social, kind of crummy people.

747
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,499
Speaker 0: But in the world of darkness, they're a sexy vampire.

748
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:11,400
Speaker 0: That's why they like comic books and anime and video games, because they can escape from the world where they don't like, where they're anti-social losers.

749
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,700
Speaker 0: So they LARP to put themselves in another character, and suddenly they're awesome.

750
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,800
Speaker 0: I'm super awesome robot pilot.

751
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,220
Speaker 0: I'm super awesome vampire.

752
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,739
Speaker 0: And then they get super into it, and it means a lot to them, and they're freaky.

753
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,840
Speaker 0: So LARPing itself is okay.

754
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,000
Speaker 0: Most of it is with freaky people, so avoid freaky people.

755
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,319
Speaker 0: Just do it with your cool friends.

756
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,320
Speaker 1: So the real answer is, yes, by all means try it out.

757
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Speaker 1: But if anyone in a LARP makes you feel uncomfortable, or you just feel like something's wrong, just don't play anymore, because it's not worth it.

758
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,460
Speaker 0: Find some other people, or find your own friends or something.

759
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,057
Speaker 0: Someone you know.

760
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,499
Speaker 0: What are your favorite real-time strategy games, if you play these at all?

761
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,179
Speaker 1: I don't like real-time strategy games.

762
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,080
Speaker 0: Warcraft 1?

763
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,276
Speaker 1: Yeah.

764
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,340
Speaker 1: Command & Conquer 1.

765
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

766
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Speaker 0: I mean, the thing is, I played real-time strategy games when they were new.

767
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,420
Speaker 0: Warcraft 1, Warcraft 2, Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer Red Alert, those kind of games.

768
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,440
Speaker 0: And I kind of liked them, but all of them bothered me.

769
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,139
Speaker 0: Like, playing StarCraft is kind of fun.

770
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 0: The problem with it is that I will always lose and I will always suck, because there isn't really a strategy.

771
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:21,220
Speaker 0: The game comes down to who knows the exact order to build things, and who can click the fastest to build the things the fastest.

772
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:25,720
Speaker 1: Well, luckily, a lot of newer RTSs don't have this problem to that degree.

773
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Speaker 1: But I think the biggest thing holding RTSs back is that, one, it's very difficult to make an RTS that plays fast enough and is controllable in an intuitive and effective manner.

774
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,139
Speaker 0: And two-- Well, you can.

775
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:47,219
Speaker 0: It's sort of like the weapons factory in a way, where it's very complex and blah, but some people, like Koreans, they learn how to do it.

776
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:48,686
Speaker 0: And it's not my thing.

777
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:50,057
Speaker 0: I don't want to learn how to do it.

778
00:42:50,480 --> 00:43:02,600
Speaker 1: But the other thing that I think really holds RTSs back is that without really good AI, it's really hard to send units off or set up interesting strategies, because your soldiers just stand there and get run over by the tank.

779
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you have to manage the units too much.

780
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:13,080
Speaker 0: It's like if you make the people manage the units too much, then it's just annoying and crappy, and it's not strategy anymore.

781
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:18,940
Speaker 0: But if you make them manage the units too little, then it's just build a bunch of guys, select them, I'll click on the enemy base.

782
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,128
Speaker 1: I think it's something that--.

783
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:21,319
Speaker 1: I mean, there are good RTSs.

784
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,959
Speaker 1: There's probably a lot of pretty good RTSs.

785
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:31,359
Speaker 1: I think it's just that it's a genre of gaming that is nowhere near its potential and is still relatively primitive compared to what it could be.

786
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:41,020
Speaker 1: I had a lot of hope for Supreme Commander, and I haven't really played it much yet, but one thing I can say is that it disappeared from the radar and hardly anyone talks about it anymore.

787
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:42,379
Speaker 1: That really worries me.

788
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:42,902
Speaker 0: Yep.

789
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:46,819
Speaker 0: What are your all-time favorite single-player games?

790
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,420
Speaker 0: Rims not so big on the single-player games.

791
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,161
Speaker 0: I guess I'd say Zelda 1, Mario 3, Mega Man 2, Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2.

792
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:55,678
Speaker 1: Mostly NES and SNES games.

793
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:58,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, those kind of games.

794
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,680
Speaker 1: I would have to say, of all time, just by going-- Bionic Commando.

795
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:07,097
Speaker 1: I really like Bionic Commando, but I think of all time, it would have to be Civilization II.

796
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,159
Speaker 0: Civ II is a good one.

797
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,700
Speaker 1: I think Civ II gave me the most enjoyment total of all gaming.

798
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,136
Speaker 0: Star Control II, Master Brian II.

799
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:18,360
Speaker 1: Honestly, I really, really like the Quest for Glory series.

800
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,166
Speaker 1: 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5 is crap.

801
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,490
Speaker 1: Don't even bother with it.

802
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:22,399
Speaker 1: Pretend it doesn't exist.

803
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:23,060
Speaker 0: All right.

804
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:29,940
Speaker 0: Why are the majority of console shooters in third person when compared to PC-centric shooters, which are usually in first person?

805
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:33,140
Speaker 1: Because the games focus on entirely different kinds of gameplay.

806
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:33,630
Speaker 1: Yep.

807
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,629
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

808
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:35,620
Speaker 1: We've talked about it already.

809
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,860
Speaker 0: What's your favorite type of grenade in a game?

810
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:49,236
Speaker 1: So, in Quake II days, there was a mod called Weapons of Destruction, and it added a total of, like, 30 weapons to Doom-- or to God Doom for Quake II.

811
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:49,876
Speaker 1: Good God.

812
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:59,640
Speaker 1: And it was like Rocket Launcher, Fire Rocket Launcher, Cluster Rocket Launcher, Homing Rocket Launcher, all of them with homing, all of them without homing.

813
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:01,779
Speaker 1: Million kinds of machine guns.

814
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:05,620
Speaker 1: And among all those were a million different kinds of grenades.

815
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:21,419
Speaker 1: And a grenade, you could throw it like a normal grenade, you could stick it to a wall and make a laser trap if you had some cells that did whatever the grenade did, or there were a whole bunch of special grenades, like the napalm grenade and the cluster grenade and the plasma grenade and the normal grenade, and one of those was the nuke.

816
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,899
Speaker 1: And the nuke was a nuke.

817
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:40,260
Speaker 1: And it killed, like, everyone in a very large radius and filled a three-dimensional space that was near-- like, it would kill a third to two-thirds of the people playing on a 24-person deathmatch server.

818
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:42,580
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

819
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:48,160
Speaker 1: And it did-- I remember the first time I played, like, people generally avoided using it.

820
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:56,420
Speaker 1: A lot of servers wouldn't give you frags if you used the nuke, because it just kind of wasn't-- like, people would just save up cells till they had enough and throw a nuke and get a billion frags.

821
00:45:57,302 --> 00:45:59,219
Speaker 1: So the nuke was just kind of there and people didn't use it.

822
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:02,008
Speaker 1: And I joined a server, and I was like, "Huh, they didn't disable the nuke.

823
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:03,156
Speaker 1: Huh.".

824
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:09,180
Speaker 1: So I threw a nuke down a long cylinder, and everyone else on the server but me died.

825
00:46:10,121 --> 00:46:12,620
Speaker 1: And I was kicked less than 30 seconds later.

826
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:24,440
Speaker 0: My favorite kind of grenade-- I actually kind of like-- and I'm not going to speak a specific one, but, like, little tiny 2D games where they have, like, funny little grenades, like Metal Slug, where you just go, "Doo," little grenades.

827
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:28,200
Speaker 0: Or Smash TV, where it's like, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.

828
00:46:28,684 --> 00:46:30,600
Speaker 0: I like it when it's like a little dude throwing little grenades.

829
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,299
Speaker 0: Contra Force, grenade, grenade, grenade.

830
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,732
Speaker 0: I like that kind of action.

831
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:34,339
Speaker 0: That's always fun.

832
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:37,600
Speaker 1: I did really like the laser cutter in Weapons Factory.

833
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,315
Speaker 0: All right.

834
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:39,079
Speaker 1: All right.

835
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:44,139
Speaker 1: What is your favorite all-time first-person shooter weapon of all time?

836
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:48,181
Speaker 1: Uh... Plasma Gun Doom 2.

837
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really love that Plasma Gun.

838
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:51,620
Speaker 1: Especially in Doom 2.

839
00:46:51,620 --> 00:47:04,500
Speaker 1: I mean, the Plasma Gun's really cool in Quake 3, but in Doom 2, the Plasma Gun, because the game was effectively two-dimensional, it wasn't really a normal-- like, it wasn't a Plasma Gun like in Quake 3.

840
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,200
Speaker 1: It was effectively a plasma wall.

841
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,239
Speaker 1: And I-- Oh, I love that weapon so much.

842
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:11,840
Speaker 0: I'm going to put a tentative hold.

843
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,600
Speaker 0: Basically, the Portal Gun and the Gravity Gun are probably the winners, but it's too soon to say those.

844
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,660
Speaker 1: Oh, the only reason I didn't say those is because they're kind of like the obvious.

845
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:23,238
Speaker 1: It's like, "What's the best movie ever, Citizen

846
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:23,440
Speaker 1: Kane?".

847
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,940
Speaker 1: All right, so really, what's the best movie ever other than Citizen Kane?

848
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:37,916
Speaker 0: Right, so those two, but I'm going to say, actually, the Plasma Gun from Quake 3, because it's the same as the one from Doom 2, but it's, like, a better implementation of it, and it's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

849
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:38,018
Speaker 0: whoa.".

850
00:47:38,262 --> 00:47:38,999
Speaker 0: I like the way it shoots.

851
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,780
Speaker 1: Actually, how about the Heavy Machine Gun in Natural Selection?

852
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,118
Speaker 0: It feels-- It's really not a fan so much.

853
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,279
Speaker 1: It feels so much like I'm in the movie Alien, and I'm just shooting that thing.

854
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:56,000
Speaker 0: It is a good gun, but-- How about the-- no, here, the Devourer from the Onos in Natural Selection?

855
00:47:58,385 --> 00:47:59,154
Speaker 0: All right, all right.

856
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:02,019
Speaker 0: Turn the page.

857
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:02,918
Speaker 1: Melee Attack.

858
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,540
Speaker 0: Ah, your all-time favorite Melee Attack.

859
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:14,040
Speaker 1: Now, they didn't say in a game, and this is a cop-out, but I'll have a real answer, but my tentative answer is the way the Big O punches things.

860
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:14,893
Speaker 0: Yep.

861
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,000
Speaker 1: Number one, nothing beats that.

862
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,480
Speaker 1: That is the best Melee Attack in the history of media.

863
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,579
Speaker 0: No, best Melee Attack, Voltron Blazing Sword.

864
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:25,960
Speaker 1: All right, but in video games, in video games.

865
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,360
Speaker 0: I think they're supposedly going for the first-person video games.

866
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:29,897
Speaker 1: I don't know.

867
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,779
Speaker 1: I'd have to go for video games all over.

868
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,460
Speaker 1: Probably when Sephiroth killed Eris.

869
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:35,996
Speaker 0: Maybe.

870
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:39,440
Speaker 0: River City Ransom hit him with a lead pipe.

871
00:48:41,787 --> 00:48:42,160
Speaker 1: I don't know.

872
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,820
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

873
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,040
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of games-- First-person shooters do Melee usually terribly.

874
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lightsaber to the face.

875
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:52,314
Speaker 1: Actually, though, that Lightsaber-- Jedi Knight.

876
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:54,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was actually really fun for like a week.

877
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,539
Speaker 0: Jedi Knight is pretty good for a little while.

878
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,479
Speaker 1: So, yeah, for that week, that was the best Melee Attack in an FPS.

879
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:06,100
Speaker 1: What is currently the best multiplayer first-person shooter to Team Fortress 2?

880
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,860
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike, Natural Selection.

881
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,763
Speaker 0: Tribes 2.

882
00:49:10,763 --> 00:49:11,740
Speaker 0: Tribes 2.

883
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,780
Speaker 1: Tribes 2 in an unplayable state is still the best.

884
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:16,980
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, that game was good.

885
00:49:17,142 --> 00:49:18,520
Speaker 0: Tribes 2, Counter-Strike, Natural Selection.

886
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:24,260
Speaker 1: I think, overall, it would have to be Natural Selection, or the Natural Selection source that doesn't exist yet.

887
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:24,700
Speaker 0: Yep.

888
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:27,220
Speaker 0: I find console gaming to be crap.

889
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,739
Speaker 0: This is a question, by the way, not me.

890
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,360
Speaker 0: The only exceptions are Wii games to make good use of the controls.

891
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,340
Speaker 0: Is there a counter-argument, apart from the obvious, that games are now made for release on console first?

892
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,611
Speaker 0: What?

893
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,260
Speaker 0: Okay, guys, listen.

894
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:39,380
Speaker 0: A game is a game is a game.

895
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,520
Speaker 0: How is a game suddenly bad because it's on a different machine?

896
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:54,280
Speaker 0: I mean, console gaming versus PC gaming, the only real difference, aside from sitting at a desk or sitting in front of your TV, is that the game is on a different machine.

897
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,318
Speaker 1: It's more locked in.

898
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,780
Speaker 1: There's often less customization, things like that.

899
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,459
Speaker 1: You can't just plug a weird peripheral in.

900
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are advantages and disadvantages to both.

901
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,840
Speaker 0: However, you can have a good game on any machine, in any environment.

902
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:08,200
Speaker 0: Why should console gaming be crap?

903
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,060
Speaker 0: There are probably good games.

904
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,700
Speaker 0: There are good games and bad games on the console, and good games and bad games on the PC, and good games and bad games on the DS.

905
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:17,960
Speaker 0: So, why would you totally eliminate a whole category of games?

906
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,880
Speaker 0: That's like saying, "I'm not gonna watch...".

907
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,336
Speaker 1: Movies are crap.

908
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,860
Speaker 0: Movies on DVD are crap.

909
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,000
Speaker 0: I'm only watching them in the theater.

910
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:25,740
Speaker 1: Granted, I've heard people say that before.

911
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, those people are dumb.

912
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:27,675
Speaker 1: All right.

913
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:42,480
Speaker 1: If you were trapped on a lost-like island, electrical power, network computers, TV screens, basically anything we want, but no off-island communication, with the rest of the front row crew for a year, so not forever, but just for a year, because forever my answer is very different.

914
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:46,498
Speaker 1: And if you could only have one game with you during that period, what would it be?

915
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,700
Speaker 1: Now, if I'm trapped there forever, my answer is the game of boat.

916
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,739
Speaker 1: It comes with a boat and gas for the boat, and I take the boat home.

917
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:02,700
Speaker 0: Can we have a game of don't die and let's have an orgy?

918
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:03,899
Speaker 1: I don't know.

919
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,439
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

920
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,100
Speaker 1: I don't know.

921
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:07,500
Speaker 1: Honestly, it depends on exactly how many people.

922
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,999
Speaker 0: It depends exactly on who and what and how long and what the island was like.

923
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,660
Speaker 1: But if it was the whole front row crew, it would have to be Burning Wheel.

924
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,859
Speaker 0: Burning Wheel's good.

925
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:17,040
Speaker 1: I think that would keep me going for a year.

926
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,620
Speaker 0: How about a game of let's play every game in the world once and see who wins the most?

927
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:23,219
Speaker 1: Or, you know what?

928
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:31,599
Speaker 1: In that case, a game like Go, because I'd have the time to sit down and learn that game in the way that I currently do not know it.

929
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,179
Speaker 0: Good call.

930
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,040
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a good question.

931
00:51:35,303 --> 00:51:35,720
Speaker 1: All right.

932
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,860
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts on the Metal Gear Solid series?

933
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:43,860
Speaker 1: Does Hideo Kojima get commended for his deep political message?

934
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:48,279
Speaker 1: Or should that be left out of video games?

935
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,540
Speaker 1: All right, one, it's not a matter of that being left out of video games.

936
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,138
Speaker 1: I think video games are just as valid a medium for political or any sort of idea.

937
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,120
Speaker 0: Any sort of artistic expression.

938
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:00,140
Speaker 1: As any other medium.

939
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Speaker 1: No different from a movie or a novel or a comic or a spray painted graffiti.

940
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:11,660
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is that Kojima is a madman and his political message is crazy.

941
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,580
Speaker 0: Also, Metal Gear Solid, I'm going to come right out with it.

942
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:24,020
Speaker 0: I've only played the very beginning of the first Metal Gear Solid and I've watched a few minutes of Metal Gear Solid 2 and a few minutes of Metal Gear Solid 3 at random points.

943
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:25,159
Speaker 0: And that's it.

944
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,900
Speaker 0: And I'm really not so interested in playing them so much.

945
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,320
Speaker 0: I don't know what political message you're talking about.

946
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:40,200
Speaker 1: The FMVs are just really melodramatic and the political message is not particularly deep.

947
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,896
Speaker 1: And a lot of you are like, "Why do I wage

948
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:43,178
Speaker 1: war?".

949
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,435
Speaker 1: "What's the meaning of love and honor and

950
00:52:46,616 --> 00:52:47,018
Speaker 1: duty?".

951
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:49,896
Speaker 1: "Meanwhile, I'm in a fight with a man named Revolver

952
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:50,459
Speaker 1: Ocelot.".

953
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:51,730
Speaker 0: Rob Roslith, that was cool.

954
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:52,840
Speaker 0: I've seen that part.

955
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:53,169
Speaker 1: Yes, he is.

956
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:53,460
Speaker 1: God damn.

957
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:59,199
Speaker 1: But in terms of the Metal Gear Solid series, my favorite Metal Gear game is Metal Gear.

958
00:53:00,068 --> 00:53:00,158
Speaker 0: One.

959
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:04,160
Speaker 1: And I think that game was revolutionary in a lot of ways.

960
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,200
Speaker 0: That was a really good game.

961
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,140
Speaker 0: I still suck at it, but that's just because I didn't bother to brute force it to figure it out.

962
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,740
Speaker 0: I'm awesome at that game because I played it a lot.

963
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:14,950
Speaker 0: I have the skill to play it.

964
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,580
Speaker 0: I just don't have the knowledge to play it.

965
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,640
Speaker 0: I don't know which trucks to get in and all that stuff.

966
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,440
Speaker 1: Well, you're supposed to figure it out and if you just try, you'll figure it out.

967
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:22,265
Speaker 0: I know.

968
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,420
Speaker 0: It would just take me a while.

969
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,839
Speaker 1: Plus, the hardest part of the game was just not dying.

970
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:26,660
Speaker 0: I know, right?

971
00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:28,347
Speaker 0: That I can handle.

972
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:29,737
Speaker 0: I just can't handle the "where do I

973
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:29,898
Speaker 0: go?".

974
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,286
Speaker 1: But I'm going to warn you all.

975
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:33,959
Speaker 1: There is a Metal Gear 2 for the NES.

976
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:34,939
Speaker 0: Don't play that.

977
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,119
Speaker 1: That is not the game you were looking for.

978
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:38,660
Speaker 0: Pretend it doesn't exist.

979
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,132
Speaker 1: Seriously.

980
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:40,769
Speaker 0: Angry video game.

981
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:41,599
Speaker 0: nerd should hit that one up.

982
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,620
Speaker 1: Oh yes, he should.

983
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,660
Speaker 0: Please describe your favorite RPG characters.

984
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,340
Speaker 0: Are you talking about characters we made for an RPG?

985
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,100
Speaker 0: Or are you talking about RPG characters like a video game we played that was an RPG?

986
00:53:55,341 --> 00:53:57,980
Speaker 1: Well, let's do that one first because that's less scary, the latter.

987
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:02,821
Speaker 1: I really liked Celeste from Final Fantasy 6.

988
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:08,559
Speaker 1: And my reason is, and I'm not going to super spoil Final Fantasy 6, but seriously, statute of limitations, guys.

989
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:14,500
Speaker 1: In Final Fantasy 6, you begin the game, like you play from the perspective of a bunch of different characters.

990
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:17,760
Speaker 1: But the main character is this girl named Terra.

991
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,860
Speaker 1: And she's in a sphere.

992
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:21,799
Speaker 1: That's an inside joke.

993
00:54:22,102 --> 00:54:23,572
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's also a spoiler.

994
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:24,620
Speaker 1: But whatever, I don't care.

995
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,780
Speaker 1: So, you play from her perspective.

996
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:29,480
Speaker 1: She's kind of the reluctant hero.

997
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,700
Speaker 1: She is the plot device.

998
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,139
Speaker 1: She's kind of the MacGuffin.

999
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,460
Speaker 1: She's the thing that holds the whole story together.

1000
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:41,700
Speaker 1: You follow her path and along the way you meet all these people who are trying to do good or evil or whatever.

1001
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,000
Speaker 1: But they're all engaging characters and they all work together.

1002
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,600
Speaker 1: And one of the people you meet is Celeste, who is the general in kind of the bad guy's side.

1003
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,800
Speaker 1: But you know, it's all ambiguous.

1004
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,039
Speaker 0: See, I don't actually know the names of the people in a lot of these Final Fantasy games because I always change them.

1005
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,759
Speaker 1: You know who Celeste is, right?

1006
00:54:58,301 --> 00:54:59,540
Speaker 0: The yellow hair magic girl.

1007
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,280
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know who Terra is, right?

1008
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,140
Speaker 0: The girl at the beginning.

1009
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:02,573
Speaker 1: Okay.

1010
00:55:04,363 --> 00:55:07,200
Speaker 1: And you meet all these people and they all have really good motivation.

1011
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,360
Speaker 1: And there's this really, I think, a really good story.

1012
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:10,760
Speaker 0: Who's the guy with the autocrossbow?

1013
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,120
Speaker 1: That was Edgar.

1014
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,120
Speaker 0: I always named him Arthur.

1015
00:55:13,864 --> 00:55:13,953
Speaker 0: Aha.

1016
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:14,514
Speaker 0: Aha.

1017
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:19,180
Speaker 1: So, you go through all this and the game is going like a normal RPG.

1018
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,920
Speaker 1: Like she's the main character and blah, blah, blah.

1019
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:26,560
Speaker 1: And you're holding, like she's holding everything together and the plot's going forward.

1020
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:29,480
Speaker 1: And then basically the apocalypse happens.

1021
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,460
Speaker 1: And the whole time you've played from the perspective of or around this character.

1022
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:41,780
Speaker 1: And then you wake up in the ruined world and you're not that character.

1023
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,000
Speaker 1: You're Celeste, who is an important character but effectively until that point a side character.

1024
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:54,200
Speaker 1: And she was a person who had lost all faith in the world and all faith in humanity and all faith in herself.

1025
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:07,840
Speaker 1: And the story of the game ends up where as this broken character, you are the one who has to go around and gather up all the people who have decided that it's not worth it to continue in their quest.

1026
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:14,520
Speaker 1: And you went from the person who had no motivation, who's being dragged along in this plot to save the world, whatever.

1027
00:56:15,102 --> 00:56:21,120
Speaker 1: To being the only person in the entire world strong enough to gather these people together and do what needs to be done.

1028
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,460
Speaker 1: And you even have to convince the main character to snap out of her bullshit and come along.

1029
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that she is one of the best characters in any video game RPG ever.

1030
00:56:31,663 --> 00:56:32,820
Speaker 0: I like Shadow.

1031
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,439
Speaker 0: Shadow is shallow crap.

1032
00:56:35,985 --> 00:56:37,460
Speaker 1: I like... Unless you got all the dreams.

1033
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:43,260
Speaker 1: And even then half of Shadow's dialogue was actually Realm's dialogue because they coded the game shittily.

1034
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:44,620
Speaker 0: I like Gato.

1035
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,453
Speaker 0: I like...

1036
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:50,520
Speaker 1: I think Scott and I enjoy RPGs on different levels.

1037
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,363
Speaker 0: I like your dad in Final Fantasy Legend 3.

1038
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:58,980
Speaker 1: Um, should I spoil that?

1039
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:00,058
Speaker 0: It's up to you.

1040
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,420
Speaker 1: So, in Final Fantasy Legend 3, you get an airship.

1041
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
Speaker 1: But it turns out that your dad is the airship.

1042
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,540
Speaker 0: And not only is your dad the airship, he's basically a B2 bomber.

1043
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:12,100
Speaker 0: With an "N" inside of it.

1044
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,983
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy Legend 2.

1045
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,519
Speaker 0: An "N" and a shop.

1046
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,779
Speaker 0: Not only an "N" and a shop.

1047
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,580
Speaker 0: An "N" and the best shop in the game inside your dad.

1048
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,700
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy Legend 2 is a much better game.

1049
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,179
Speaker 0: No it's not.

1050
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Speaker 1: The reason being, there's a scene in Final Fantasy Legend 2 that comes kind of out of nowhere.

1051
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,499
Speaker 1: And you know, the characters all have leitmotifs.

1052
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:37,060
Speaker 1: And like the main, like your party, have like the hero theme that plays when you're doing your hero shit.

1053
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:42,879
Speaker 1: And near the end of the game, like two thirds of the way through, you come across a door and you eavesdrop through it.

1054
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,159
Speaker 1: And like the three bad guys are on the other side of the door.

1055
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:48,239
Speaker 1: And they're talking to each other.

1056
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:50,100
Speaker 1: And they're like, they're revealing the plot.

1057
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,519
Speaker 1: And there's like the super artifact right there.

1058
00:57:53,423 --> 00:57:55,140
Speaker 1: And then your hero music starts playing.

1059
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:58,450
Speaker 1: And then they go, "What's that music?

1060
00:57:58,771 --> 00:57:59,896
Speaker 1: I don't know but it's freaking me out.

1061
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:00,659
Speaker 1: Let's get the hell out of

1062
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:00,820
Speaker 1: here.".

1063
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,578
Speaker 1: And then they run away.

1064
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,280
Speaker 1: And then you bust through the door and they took the artifact with them.

1065
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,258
Speaker 0: And you're like, "Damn

1066
00:58:05,278 --> 00:58:05,340
Speaker 0: it!".

1067
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:05,492
Speaker 0: Yup.

1068
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:12,720
Speaker 1: Now, the other way to answer this question is a topic that is, we have to approach this carefully.

1069
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,240
Speaker 1: Because nothing in the world is more interesting to you than your RPG characters.

1070
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:23,420
Speaker 1: And nothing in the world is less interesting to you than anyone else's RPG characters.

1071
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,090
Speaker 0: Yup.

1072
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,380
Speaker 1: And any conversation that begins with, "So I'm playing a paladin," is not going to end well.

1073
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,297
Speaker 0: Or, "Hey, what do you play

1074
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:32,479
Speaker 0: as?".

1075
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,017
Speaker 0: Or, "Hey, I got this character I just made called...".

1076
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:36,559
Speaker 0: Don't go there.

1077
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:38,240
Speaker 0: So, keep it real short.

1078
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,220
Speaker 0: That way we can just answer this question and move on.

1079
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to go first?

1080
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:42,740
Speaker 1: You ever played a memorable character?

1081
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:44,502
Speaker 0: Um...

1082
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,740
Speaker 1: I would go with the vampire guy from that Requiem campaign.

1083
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,699
Speaker 0: I like the skeleton kinda.

1084
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,280
Speaker 1: Scott played a skeleton monk and actually he... Scott roleplayed that character pretty well.

1085
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:58,680
Speaker 1: Partly because the character was mute.

1086
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,100
Speaker 0: It was a good character.

1087
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,526
Speaker 0: It was.

1088
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:01,200
Speaker 1: I liked it.

1089
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,039
Speaker 0: I like the skeleton monk.

1090
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:08,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the vampire was a better character because you basically played you if you were an evil prick vampire.

1091
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,140
Speaker 1: And it ended up ending always in hilarity.

1092
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:11,513
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1093
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,820
Speaker 1: This one time is the only story I'm going to tell.

1094
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:15,586
Speaker 0: No, don't.

1095
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:16,499
Speaker 0: You've been dragging this out.

1096
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,860
Speaker 1: Well, we're going to end on this question probably.

1097
00:59:19,465 --> 00:59:20,199
Speaker 0: It's been an hour.

1098
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:21,000
Speaker 0: Oh, good.

1099
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,019
Speaker 1: I guess we could answer one more.

1100
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,428
Speaker 1: Alright.

1101
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,667
Speaker 1: You know what?

1102
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:25,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll answer one more.

1103
00:59:26,026 --> 00:59:26,279
Speaker 0: Okay.

1104
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:26,858
Speaker 1: Two more.

1105
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:30,800
Speaker 1: Two more because I just looked and the next question's dumb and the question after that is good.

1106
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,840
Speaker 1: But, uh... Alright, I won't tell that story.

1107
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:35,700
Speaker 1: But, I'll just spare the details.

1108
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:41,460
Speaker 1: I played one character for many, many years through high school and then even in college a bit.

1109
00:59:42,122 --> 00:59:44,399
Speaker 1: And I really like this character and I'm going to leave it at that.

1110
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,160
Speaker 1: But I played him a lot and he's near and dear to me.

1111
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,219
Speaker 0: Are you going to say what character it is?

1112
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,240
Speaker 1: Not really.

1113
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:51,212
Speaker 0: His name is... It was a froufrou elf.

1114
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:51,840
Speaker 0: End of story.

1115
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:52,518
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

1116
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,279
Speaker 0: Okay.

1117
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,740
Speaker 0: Why is the status of not being able to cast spells known as silence?

1118
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,020
Speaker 0: Well, let's see.

1119
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,096
Speaker 0: I'm going to cast a spell.

1120
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,778
Speaker 1: Mecha lecha hi, mecha hiney ho.

1121
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,717
Speaker 1: Well, I believe you should have said, "Antar bak red gormor

1122
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:09,239
Speaker 1: ulya."

1123
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:10,177
Speaker 1: That's okay too.

1124
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,260
Speaker 0: Okay, so now I'm silent.

1125
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:15,800
Speaker 0: I can't cast the spell because I can't fucking say the spell.

1126
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:16,277
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

1127
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:17,738
Speaker 1: And that's why.

1128
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but actually in D&D that only stops you from casting spells that have verbal components.

1129
01:00:23,201 --> 01:00:26,118
Speaker 0: If it's only a somatic component, then you can still... Well, that's nerdy.

1130
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:26,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1131
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:28,320
Speaker 1: All right.

1132
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,040
Speaker 1: Well, this is the last question, but don't worry.

1133
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,219
Speaker 1: We have enough questions to do a whole other hour and we're going to do it.

1134
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,280
Speaker 1: And you'll hear that at some point in the future.

1135
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:38,180
Speaker 1: Last question for tonight.

1136
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,780
Speaker 1: Now that the virtual consoles exist, do you think ROMs of old games are still justified?

1137
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:47,040
Speaker 1: Now one, ROMs were barely justified in the first place.

1138
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:53,240
Speaker 1: Most of the time when someone justifies for whatever BS reason, pirating something, don't pretend.

1139
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,439
Speaker 1: Just say you're stealing it and then steal it.

1140
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,440
Speaker 1: Don't act like it's okay because it's overpriced or it's okay because I'd have to track it down in a... No, that's bullshit.

1141
01:01:02,804 --> 01:01:03,480
Speaker 1: You're pirating.

1142
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,137
Speaker 1: Just deal with it.

1143
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:04,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1144
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:30,640
Speaker 0: I think that morally speaking from my viewpoint, if there's a game and there's no way to get that game reasonably, for example, there's like one copy of it in the world or it's totally out of print and no one will give up their copy or it's incredibly hard to find and it's not made anymore and the company that made it is out of business and whatever, then getting a ROM of that game I think is okay for the sake of history and preserving art and then whatever.

1145
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:34,580
Speaker 0: Also, if you own a game, let's say I bought a game for the NES, right?

1146
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,040
Speaker 0: But now my NES is broken and I haven't played the game in a bunch of years.

1147
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:38,548
Speaker 0: Why?

1148
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,220
Speaker 0: You really shouldn't really have to pay to play it again in the virtual console.

1149
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,498
Speaker 0: You having a ROM of that and playing on your computer, I really don't see a moral problem with that.

1150
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,739
Speaker 0: If you own the cartridge, sure.

1151
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:49,220
Speaker 0: Why not?

1152
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:57,000
Speaker 1: Now, morals aside, I think the main justification I have for emulating is mostly that emulation is really, really convenient.

1153
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,400
Speaker 0: It is really convenient.

1154
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:09,260
Speaker 1: And also, a lot of games aren't on the virtual console yet and I guess I've noticed that all the games that are like big, like games that are important to us, we've bought on the virtual console.

1155
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, despite all my complaining about how overpriced.

1156
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:20,539
Speaker 0: it is and I still think it's overpriced, but when they put like freaking, you know, Super Mario 2, they put Super Metroid on there, I gotta click buy.

1157
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:22,260
Speaker 0: I can't stop myself.

1158
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,579
Speaker 0: I need it and I play it.

1159
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:33,680
Speaker 0: And it's mostly because even with all the awesome features you get with an emulator, right, what you still don't get is the flawless control.

1160
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,860
Speaker 0: You have to use some sort of USB game pad.

1161
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,940
Speaker 0: I mean, even if using an Xbox controller, which I guess is the best you can do, you know, it's still not the greatest.

1162
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:52,220
Speaker 0: Being able to play an NES game with the Wiimote turned sideways with perfect control, that's sort of worth the money that I don't get on the emulator.

1163
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,420
Speaker 0: But then again, the emulator gives you other things like save states.

1164
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I love Castlevania 2, but I was not about to beat Castlevania 2 legitimately again.

1165
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,380
Speaker 1: So I use save states to only have to get through the really freaking impossible parts once or twice.

1166
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:18,400
Speaker 0: Yep, so there are some cases where I morally think there is a case to be made where it's okay to have ROMs and other cases where it's even okay to distribute them and share them.

1167
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,278
Speaker 0: But legally, you know what the law is.

1168
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:23,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't kid yourself.

1169
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:33,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Virtual Console does sort of eliminate it somewhat because it used to be like, basically all it did was decrease the list of games that I thought it was morally okay to get ROMs of.

1170
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:34,738
Speaker 0: That's what it's done.

1171
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:38,940
Speaker 0: You know, like I would have said you want Metal Marines for SNES, ROM is okay.

1172
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,460
Speaker 0: Now, not okay anymore.

1173
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,620
Speaker 1: Speaking of which, if you've never played Metal Marines for the SNES, buy it on the Virtual Console.

1174
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:52,559
Speaker 1: That game is the kind of game that needs to be remade with modern technology in a powerful fierce way.

1175
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll be honest with you, the game is not perfect.

1176
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:04,560
Speaker 0: It has many problems, but the core fundamental of that game is awesome and it's just the implementation on the SNES that breaks down after a few levels.

1177
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:09,160
Speaker 0: But, just to see what the core of that game is and why it's so awesome is worth playing.

1178
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,079
Speaker 1: It's worth the money just to understand what kind of game that is.

1179
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:13,500
Speaker 0: Yep.

1180
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:14,802
Speaker 0: Alright,

1181
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:29,898
Speaker 1: we've gone on for about an hour, but like I said, sometime in the future you're going to hear the other half of this where we answer a whole bunch of other questions about things like Kill Puppies for Satan, sad moments in video gaming, XCOM UFO Defense, and Pokemans.

1182
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,238
Speaker 0: Oh, Pokemans.

1183
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:33,760
Speaker 1: Oh, worst game you've ever paid for is a good question.

1184
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,200
Speaker 0: Oh, I got a couple of those.

1185
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,679
Speaker 1: But I'm not going to answer that right now.

1186
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:39,660
Speaker 0: Oh, we should have just done the second half.

1187
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:40,800
Speaker 1: There's some really good questions.

1188
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,520
Speaker 0: We put all the good questions in the other episode.

1189
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,258
Speaker 0: Sucks to be you.

1190
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:45,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh well.

1191
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,699
Speaker 1: You'll hear them at some point in the next couple of years.

1192
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:48,360
Speaker 0: Alright.

1193
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,050
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1194
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,670
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1197
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,889
Speaker 1: Mondays are science and technology.

Speaker 1: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1199
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,090
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

1200
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,430
Speaker 1: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.
