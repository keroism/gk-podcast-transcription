1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,439
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 13th 2019.

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,365
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:22,407
Speaker 1: Super Mario maker to Make it your way play it your way Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:34,730
Speaker 1: So uh in New York you see Brands from around the world that you really don't see in other American cities just in random places like bodegas and gas stations and grocery stores.

5
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,113
Speaker 1: It's just.

6
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,544
Speaker 1: it's one of the nice perks of living here.

7
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:37,350
Speaker 0: like what?

8
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,658
Speaker 1: Just like random like German candy.

9
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:46,217
Speaker 1: We're like random Danish crap or like Japanese or Korean grocery stores I thought you're talking about like tempeh.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,261
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,550
Speaker 0: No you can't get tempeh cream cheese if you don't live in New York.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,489
Speaker 1: I mean if we want to get into that I'll tell you how you can't get Colby cheese in New York.

13
00:00:53,872 --> 00:01:00,790
Speaker 1: Uh-huh some of the grocery store the other day And I saw a brand from a country that I very rarely see stuff from here.

14
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:02,763
Speaker 1: I saw a Turkish beer.

15
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:07,730
Speaker 1: all right If this is the type of beer I would have wealthy brand that I would always drink.

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,763
Speaker 0: Was it actually made in Turkey was like bottled here or something like cuz?

17
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,250
Speaker 0: you know the Japanese beer they buy.

18
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:15,516
Speaker 0: Right you go to.

19
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:16,522
Speaker 0: it says imported.

20
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:17,830
Speaker 0: It's imported from Canada.

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,919
Speaker 0: They have a separate place where they make and bottled some Japanese beers in Canada And they literally just do it in Canada.

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,335
Speaker 1: so they can say imported and your stupid brain will Assume it was imported from Japan.

23
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,906
Speaker 0: The law should have make it so they have to say imported from.

24
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,673
Speaker 0: they shouldn't be able to just say Imported.

25
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,708
Speaker 1: I mean they do say that in tiny tiny print that people don't notice.

26
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,981
Speaker 0: yeah They do, but you know are you sure it was so?

27
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,030
Speaker 0: was this actually imported from Turkey?

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, because no one makes this outside of Turkey all right, so how aren't there like you know trade problems with Turkey?

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,315
Speaker 1: No, there are not trade problems with the Turkey.

30
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:59,879
Speaker 1: the problems with the Turkey right now are around the regime and around them falling increasingly under Sphere of I almost said Soviet, but Russian influence.

31
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,140
Speaker 0: right.

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,686
Speaker 0: so wouldn't we not buy beer from heaven?

33
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,949
Speaker 1: no cuz that's not how Economic diplomacy works.

34
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,026
Speaker 1: So what the interesting thing was the brand F is.

35
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:19,446
Speaker 1: it's just like it You know basically in more like in that part of the world and in Asia You pretty much only find really really light really really weak tasting beer.

36
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:20,690
Speaker 1: That's just how it is.

37
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Europe is and you know German Belgium.

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:33,690
Speaker 1: That's where the strong beer thing is that you know that's kind of a misconception cuz even in Germany like when it's summer people drink Way light wheat beer and they tend to like I mean I don't drink any beers.

39
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:40,374
Speaker 0: But I would imagine if it's summertime you would want to drink something more light and refreshing and in the winter you would want to Drink something heavier.

40
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:44,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually, but in Germany like a lot of people like really light beer.

41
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,961
Speaker 1: It's just how it is in most places.

42
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,389
Speaker 1: people don't like real good beer.

43
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:53,550
Speaker 1: But I digress in Turkey you can really only get like really light pilsners and things and a lot of Asian beer.

44
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:57,225
Speaker 1: So the brand F is is just one of those beers like.

45
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:58,530
Speaker 1: it's not actually that good.

46
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,659
Speaker 1: It's just kind of nostalgic, but I noticed something else.

47
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:07,489
Speaker 1: They only have one kind of F. is the alcohol-free one?

48
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:15,250
Speaker 1: Because alcohol-free F is is sold in countries where drinking alcohol is not okay like Muslim country yes.

49
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,642
Speaker 1: So I saw it there, but because it was the alcohol-free one.

50
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:22,689
Speaker 1: I didn't buy it and It sat there.

51
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,292
Speaker 1: There's just one.

52
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:24,035
Speaker 1: there was no other.

53
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:33,265
Speaker 1: they're just like this one section that had a few six packs of F is like by itself Mm-hmm and then eventually after like a week I saw the price went down and after another week the price went.

54
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,010
Speaker 0: was it still good?

55
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,610
Speaker 1: I mean beer doesn't really go bad in the fridge.

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,626
Speaker 1: So eventually this is only the core over the course of like a month.

57
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:50,230
Speaker 1: so today I went to get some groceries on the way home And I see that it is now on sale to the point that it was like four dollars for how much for six bottles.

58
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:51,984
Speaker 0: Okay, so I bought it.

59
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:55,015
Speaker 0: okay Drinking alcohol-free F is.

60
00:03:55,336 --> 00:04:02,796
Speaker 1: I've never actually had alcohol-free F is and I'm curious to see what it tastes like because I Primarily enjoy beer because of the flavor.

61
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:08,337
Speaker 1: so if this tastes like regular F is and just happens not have alcohol It's a good.

62
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,910
Speaker 0: so how do they remove the alcohol?

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,690
Speaker 0: I'm like you remove the alcohol from bread because you fucking put it in the oven right at a zillion degrees.

64
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,089
Speaker 0: How do you remove the alcohol from beer?

65
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,733
Speaker 1: How does this different kind somehow?

66
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:27,964
Speaker 1: so they put like an enzyme that eats the alcohol and some of these beers are just low Alcohol like it's 2% like the beer kids would drink and some of these beers.

67
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,090
Speaker 1: They actually remove most if not all the alcohol.

68
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,578
Speaker 1: I'm just curious to see what this tastes like.

69
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:40,928
Speaker 1: and the funny thing is it even has the weird Pull-tab tops that bottles of beer tend to have in Asia and parts of like Eastern Europe.

70
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:48,481
Speaker 1: hmm So yeah, I've got some effies in my fridge, which is not something I would be able to say I have not had.

71
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:56,950
Speaker 0: F is since the last time I was in Turkey Which was right before the coup attempt, but I mean even if it does taste like it like this didn't you just say it's bad?

72
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,134
Speaker 1: It's not that it's not bad.

73
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,459
Speaker 1: It's just not particularly good.

74
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:00,362
Speaker 1: It's just nostalgic.

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,470
Speaker 1: It's kind of like that Dublin doctor pepper.

76
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,459
Speaker 1: I got it a few times.

77
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,209
Speaker 1: when I get that instead I'm thinking about getting some of that again But they won't ship it here in the summer because it might go bad as I got away for the winter.

78
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:16,250
Speaker 1: I was thinking about getting one shipment of that one last one last glory day of some Western sugar water.

79
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,470
Speaker 1: So uh there's a lot of gaming news.

80
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,990
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to pick and choose because a lot of game news has happened, but simultaneously a bunch of new stuff happened Mm-hmm, so I want to start with this.

81
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,860
Speaker 1: It's only gaming adjacent But it's important to get out there loot crate Which is an exploitative business model like.

82
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,544
Speaker 1: I have basically hated loot crate from the moment I realized this was a legitimate company selling a thing right.

83
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:42,977
Speaker 0: there are a lot of subscription box services and you know the.

84
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:49,696
Speaker 0: the subscription box itself isn't necessarily a problematic business model.

85
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,225
Speaker 1: right usually it is though it usually it is.

86
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:58,225
Speaker 0: but the loot crate one Specifically is one where it's like you buy random shit.

87
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,730
Speaker 0: right at least there are clothing ones.

88
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,656
Speaker 0: Or it's like buy random clothes and back What you don't want right?

89
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,539
Speaker 1: did stitch fix?

90
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,282
Speaker 0: you know a lot of it.

91
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:09,996
Speaker 1: the ones that sell shirt is from stitch fix this like Weird Henley with the half-length like.

92
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:15,573
Speaker 0: there are also ones that sell have consumable stuff in a box for example like a blue apron Or whatever.

93
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:18,186
Speaker 0: right I made the ones that send like regular like.

94
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:21,910
Speaker 0: I think there's one out there That does like like toilet paper and all that sort of stuff.

95
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,470
Speaker 0: You use it all up right and that's not the worst.

96
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:26,458
Speaker 0: But loot crate the way it worked.

97
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,410
Speaker 0: if you haven't heard us say this before we have many times.

98
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:33,728
Speaker 0: They take the junk that nerdy stores couldn't sell.

99
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:42,530
Speaker 0: all the stuff That's on the shelf at the comic book store and is always there and no one ever buys it like the Funko pop of the D-list character right and all that stuff.

100
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:48,008
Speaker 0: it's like the store paid money to get it and it sits and takes up shelf space and it costs the store money.

101
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:49,956
Speaker 0: if The store could get rid of it.

102
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,130
Speaker 0: You know they could throw it out, which is still would be good.

103
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,644
Speaker 0: But you know they can't sell it.

104
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:59,629
Speaker 0: They if they could get even one penny for it They would make out so and no one wants it.

105
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,624
Speaker 1: So you can't actually just like sell it even at like.

106
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:04,299
Speaker 1: you can't go to a convention But in the clearance you clearance bin.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,786
Speaker 0: no still no one buys it.

108
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,693
Speaker 0: in the clearance bin It just does not sell.

109
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:17,541
Speaker 0: so loot crate goes and for almost nothing scoops up tons of inventory not even necessarily from stores But from like you know the warehouses in the wholesale market.

110
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,103
Speaker 0: like we couldn't.

111
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,210
Speaker 0: no stores bought all these figurines.

112
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,542
Speaker 0: We made too many, or you know maybe it's promotional materials.

113
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:24,987
Speaker 0: It's effectively advertising.

114
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,296
Speaker 0: It's like all right These aren't extras no one wanted.

115
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,645
Speaker 0: I'm making these specifically to shove them in loot crates.

116
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:39,545
Speaker 0: that way they will effectively be Advertisements because now I've inserted my thing into all these people's houses, and I'll pay loot crate.

117
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,139
Speaker 0: in fact to put this in the box It's like please create put this garbage in your box.

118
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:44,720
Speaker 0: that way ever.

119
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:48,836
Speaker 0: all of your customers are being advertised to and now loot crate Makes money on both ends.

120
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:55,347
Speaker 0: you be will pay to put an ad in the box And then people buy to pay to buy a box with ads in it and then

121
00:07:55,408 --> 00:08:03,530
Speaker 1: even better Once someone's hooked on this because they want their nerd crap then they only need to occasionally have anything even remotely worthwhile.

122
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:12,741
Speaker 0: There's some consumerist nerds right who are Materialistic and just like getting stuff and then they open the box And it's like surprise, and they really get hooked on.

123
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,569
Speaker 0: surprise is busy gambling.

124
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:19,907
Speaker 1: no It's not necessarily their fault because this is that variable reward schedule brain hacking stuff.

125
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:27,310
Speaker 1: Yeah like Remember the sword equation if you ever have money and a desire for swords at the same time your life is over.

126
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, so people pay for loot crate.

127
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:30,870
Speaker 0: loot crate shows up.

128
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,847
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of garbage, but apparently not enough people fell for it because they're going bankrupt.

129
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:35,150
Speaker 0: Yep

130
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:46,459
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of why they're going bankrupt is that they were the first one and a lot of people Expected this to be bigger than it was coupled with the fact that Nerds aren't buying it as much of this stuff anymore,

131
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:46,861
Speaker 0: and

132
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,430
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of other companies competing with loot crate.

133
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:51,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also says that they've got a lot of debt.

134
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, and taxes that they haven't paid yeah.

135
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:56,138
Speaker 0: So they're in trouble.

136
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,190
Speaker 1: it sounds like it was not.

137
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:02,545
Speaker 1: Despite the fact that the business model was questionable at best the business was run poor.

138
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,110
Speaker 1: the business was run very poorly.

139
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:06,259
Speaker 1: They've laid off 50 people.

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,935
Speaker 1: they filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy Had 50 people.

141
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,570
Speaker 0: Wow doesn't take a lot of it doesn't take 50 people to do that.

142
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we could outsource most of the business.

143
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,810
Speaker 1: It's got to the point that their credit card processor is withholding customer billings.

144
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:30,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, they haven't shipped goods tied to 20 million dollars in sales, so I get the impression a ton of nerds Still paying them and aren't gonna get anything.

145
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:36,189
Speaker 1: When they're not in that money isn't even gonna go to them It's gonna go to the credit card process.

146
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:46,610
Speaker 0: I guess if you're if you were sad or dumb or foolish enough to pay loot crate cancel that shit now because otherwise you're just Gonna be sending money to some debtor or to some I guess daddy.

147
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, lender lender.

148
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,606
Speaker 0: so someone loot crate owes money to and you ain't gonna get shit.

149
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,139
Speaker 0: you even get ads You ain't gonna get.

150
00:09:53,159 --> 00:10:01,480
Speaker 1: oh my god I just felt real old loot crate was founded in 2012. if you go back to 2012 you'll probably find a lot of geek nights Episodes where we're bitching about this thing.

151
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,887
Speaker 1: probably we were probably really well.

152
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:03,570
Speaker 1: We were really mad.

153
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,320
Speaker 0: Don't rest in peace.

154
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,070
Speaker 0: I rub my butt on your grave.

155
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:15,610
Speaker 1: Quote one of the fastest-growing startups loot crates woes began after defaulting on a loan in 2017.

156
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,437
Speaker 0: yep all right that low.

157
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:18,200
Speaker 1: no this is important.

158
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,201
Speaker 1: that loan was later refinanced and has now been purchased by Money chest LLC.

159
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,809
Speaker 0: that sounds like a great company.

160
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:31,670
Speaker 1: Money chest that sounds like easy pod Which will provide loot crate with a 10 million dollar?

161
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:40,617
Speaker 1: Bankruptcy loan and will serve as its stalking horse bidder, so this money chest company is basically buying loot crate out effectively.

162
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:41,163
Speaker 0: good luck.

163
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:47,466
Speaker 1: I Do not trust this company - I feel like there's shenanigans going on with this bankruptcy.

164
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:48,649
Speaker 1: actually the more I read this.

165
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,155
Speaker 1: hmm I'm not an insider.

166
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:50,999
Speaker 1: I don't know.

167
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:56,021
Speaker 1: I'm purely speculating Sue me, but you don't for the lawyer.

168
00:10:56,041 --> 00:11:02,604
Speaker 0: Bye if you weren't gonna buy the stuff Seeing it then it's not something you're willing to pay money for.

169
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:05,372
Speaker 0: yeah, don't buy Surprise.

170
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:11,150
Speaker 0: if you want surprise you can just have your friends take stuff and put it in boxes and trade it with your each other.

171
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,174
Speaker 0: I'm telling you guys which of the things I own is this Free surprise.

172
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,944
Speaker 1: should I finally do it I was thinking about.

173
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,090
Speaker 1: we talked about this a while ago.

174
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:28,957
Speaker 1: You're even kind of on board of adding a tear to the gig nights patreon of the gig nights loot crate And if you're at that tear every moment like every couple months We'll just mail you stuff.

175
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,246
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what I'm gonna get.

176
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,390
Speaker 1: you're gonna get a whole bunch of books I'm trying to get rid of for the cost of shipping.

177
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,122
Speaker 0: I will send you random crap from my house that I'm trying to get rid of.

178
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,569
Speaker 0: it will be nerdy stuff of some kind.

179
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:41,652
Speaker 0: I Will.

180
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:45,266
Speaker 1: I might actually just make this a tear on the patreon because if someone does it you're.

181
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:49,930
Speaker 0: I guarantee Gig nights when I go cover the shipping of heavy nerd stuff.

182
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:54,304
Speaker 1: Yeah But gig nights will not go bankrupt and you will in fact get packages from.

183
00:11:54,525 --> 00:12:00,250
Speaker 0: anyone wants free nerd stuff Contact me and get yourself to my apartment and I will give you piles of nerd stuff.

184
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,449
Speaker 0: You have no saying what it is.

185
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,730
Speaker 1: It's stuff I'm trying to get rid of and it won't even be bad because we tend to not buy bad stuff.

186
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:06,995
Speaker 0: It could be just.

187
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,389
Speaker 0: I can't make no claims about the quality or how much you will want it.

188
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:14,003
Speaker 0: You could maybe sell it on your own, but I don't have time.

189
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,408
Speaker 1: I might just mail you all of dr.

190
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:15,709
Speaker 1: Slump.

191
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,430
Speaker 1: So in some other news, there's a bunch of news from like Gen Con and all this stuff.

192
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:28,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's Gen Con says a lot of board game news But the biggest board game news is actually digital board game news.

193
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:36,848
Speaker 0: Yeah the long-awaited Root digital edition now has a trailer that shows what it looks like and it looking good.

194
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:37,168
Speaker 0: Yep.

195
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:37,670
Speaker 1: It looks good.

196
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:38,769
Speaker 1: We have no other content.

197
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,633
Speaker 1: I'm like no other.

198
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:42,605
Speaker 1: we don't know what this will actually entail other than that.

199
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:43,930
Speaker 1: It is just root.

200
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,857
Speaker 0: It will let you play root digitally.

201
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:54,369
Speaker 0: who knows single-player multi who knows we don't have any details but Play root on a digital device of some kind.

202
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,454
Speaker 1: now This isn't probably

203
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:59,811
Speaker 0: a computer or a phone or a tablet or who knows because root a switch I don't know

204
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:08,021
Speaker 1: is probably one of the most influential and important tabletop games in recent memory in terms of reach in terms of Expanding interest in the hobby at

205
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:09,750
Speaker 0: least people who are in the hobby

206
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, but of people in.

207
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,910
Speaker 0: you don't see root is not in target as far as I know.

208
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,030
Speaker 0: But

209
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:29,050
Speaker 1: people who are in the hobby but tend to not play heavier games are Tricked into playing a root and then discover that they actually like these sort of mean war games and things Mmm, like I see a lot of people who would never have played a game like this.

210
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,450
Speaker 1: It was branded differently and then they get vicious.

211
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:38,769
Speaker 1: But the other thing that's going on here in general is that the tabletop industry is kind of a huge bubble right now.

212
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,797
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah been for I'm sorry.

213
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:44,450
Speaker 0: I don't understand how it has not popped after so many years.

214
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,988
Speaker 0: What is keeping that bubble inflating?

215
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:59,890
Speaker 1: well So part of what is keeping that bubble inflating is all these Kickstarter games that are bad But include minis and people buy these games never actually play them and just keep backing these kickstarters.

216
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

217
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,278
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of Kickstarter board games.

218
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:05,930
Speaker 0: That's not keeping like the publishers around right then, you know.

219
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,690
Speaker 1: So the publishers are just consolidating.

220
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,190
Speaker 0: Consolidating because increase there's only one only as mode a seems to be buying up lots of companies.

221
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,256
Speaker 0: I don't see anyone else consolidating really.

222
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:30,590
Speaker 1: but in terms of like the people who design games are increasingly working for a smaller number of places and independent game designers are having a harder and harder time even getting in front of the publishers because the publishers have Their own game designers like in their stables.

223
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,332
Speaker 0: It's something to do.

224
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:33,119
Speaker 0: some of them don't and the ones that don't.

225
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:40,170
Speaker 1: there are so many good game designers out there that you can Basically find the people who are the most desperate and get them to work for a pittance.

226
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:52,005
Speaker 1: So the industry is definitely moving toward higher production values Toward games that are difficult for smaller publishers to even bring to market games that have gimmicks that are complicated

227
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:52,689
Speaker 0: or weird and

228
00:14:53,631 --> 00:15:02,909
Speaker 1: having the resources to get someone to make a full digital version of your game is definitely one of those Differentiating factors that smaller publishers and Indies are not going to be able to do.

229
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:19,781
Speaker 0: Usually it seems like most of the digital tabletop games are made by another set of companies that like specialize yeah in making digital tabletop games and you can sort of tell like ah The same people who made this one made that one and that one and that one because you could all looks pretty similar Interface wise and and such and such.

230
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,253
Speaker 1: so the other thing that I think is gonna happen here Is that I would

231
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:29,221
Speaker 0: hire the company made the race for the galaxy or my god Hex to this day whatever I'm in my board game race

232
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:39,830
Speaker 1: for the galaxy is a triumph of Making a UX that works on even a tiny screen for a card game where there are like 50 cards on the table at any given time.

233
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,690
Speaker 1: Yep, like that is one hell of a UX design.

234
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:43,917
Speaker 1: But what I'm curious about?

235
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,910
Speaker 1: we don't know anything about this root implementation yet.

236
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,459
Speaker 1: So one will it have be?

237
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,669
Speaker 1: will it support VR the way that the settlers one did?

238
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,333
Speaker 1: Probably not.

239
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,097
Speaker 0: it could.

240
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,886
Speaker 0: I don't think that's necessary.

241
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:58,540
Speaker 0: I That is a very low priority.

242
00:15:58,661 --> 00:15:59,103
Speaker 1: I don't know.

243
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,976
Speaker 1: because the Tabletop simulator.

244
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:12,080
Speaker 1: I've seen some statistics that are dubious So I don't want to really like read into them too much that a huge percentage of the people who play tabletop simulator Play it primarily in VR.

245
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:17,889
Speaker 1: Uh-huh and having played it in VR It's way easier and better than playing it on a desktop.

246
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:26,109
Speaker 1: somehow I don't think that that is on the table But the only reason it's that way is because the desktop interface is still pretty garbo and because super good.

247
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:38,350
Speaker 1: Yeah But I also wonder if this will have PBM play by mail Asynchronous turns that kind of thing because I've already got like five multi-year running Civ games going play by mail.

248
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,829
Speaker 1: I could keep several root games going play by mail take a turn every day before I go to work.

249
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:53,830
Speaker 1: But there's also this trend that digital implementations of games like this make it easier to get people who refuse to learn the rules To games to actually learn the rules.

250
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,637
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many people I've run into who love root and play it a lot But don't actually know the rules.

251
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:02,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like need someone to walk them through every single turn

252
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:03,052
Speaker 0: Yeah,

253
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:04,621
Speaker 1: like that is a problem

254
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:13,450
Speaker 0: as well, you know, and there's also Even if you don't know the rules see I think some people What they get a digital edition of a game and it helps them learn the rules and that's good.

255
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:21,829
Speaker 0: Yep, but there's also people where they get digital edition of the game and because you know The video game provides these rails on which you can't break the rules.

256
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,858
Speaker 0: They just the user interface right.

257
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:29,550
Speaker 0: they managed to play the game without fully understanding all the rules.

258
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,287
Speaker 0: They just keep making legal moves because they can't not make legal move.

259
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:49,716
Speaker 1: legit encountered a person who had trouble playing Carcassonne with the tiles on a table because they couldn't figure out Which tiles were allowed to be placed legally where because the app just shows you where it could go and they just use that to Make their decisions.

260
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:50,019
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

261
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:56,170
Speaker 1: So, uh This is both a blessing and a curse in terms of the learning but I think it's generally a net positive.

262
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:57,460
Speaker 0: I mean my fate my.

263
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,302
Speaker 0: the positive I take away I'm happiest about is we may now play route very very quickly Even if we're just sitting around a tablet playing route.

264
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,130
Speaker 0: we can play a route real fast.

265
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we can bust out a route while we're in line for the omega-thon finale.

266
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:17,602
Speaker 0: Yep the other announcement yellow and Yangtze a Seems to be the same developer slash publishers.

267
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the news is on the same page.

268
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:24,070
Speaker 0: Yep, and again, it is that similar 3d style to the route implementation.

269
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,359
Speaker 0: So it looks like it's from the same people.

270
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,085
Speaker 1: We've talked about yellow and Yangtze.

271
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,430
Speaker 0: It is what is the name of the company?

272
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:29,997
Speaker 0: That's making these.

273
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,199
Speaker 1: Ah You're wolf digital.

274
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,530
Speaker 0: Okay, dire wolf digital.

275
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:42,219
Speaker 1: So yellow Yangtze as we've talked about is the not sequel nor successor But simply companion game to Tigris and Euphrates.

276
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,670
Speaker 0: It is the space almost the same game, but not entirely but as a hex map.

277
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,437
Speaker 1: Yep, it's real good.

278
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:51,837
Speaker 1: And this is a game that I would play a Lot of weekly basis.

279
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:56,830
Speaker 0: I played some toilet T&E, you know I'm iPhone and that was okay.

280
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,810
Speaker 0: But if I can play this way, I was not good enough to really do anything.

281
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,595
Speaker 1: Hey eyes cannot be good at games like this.

282
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:05,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can play the team digital T&E with people.

283
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:05,926
Speaker 0: it works.

284
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:06,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does work.

285
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:17,283
Speaker 1: Anyway, so in some interesting and strange news if you didn't know the history of system shock 2 Which is a game might have played it.

286
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,229
Speaker 0: You should have played it.

287
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you might have played it.

288
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,870
Speaker 1: if you haven't now's a good time 90s, like when did it actually come out?

289
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,750
Speaker 1: Early 2000s late 90s as you guys got me out of the system shock train.

290
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,263
Speaker 1: I was not on the system shock train in high school sometime around there.

291
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need to play system shock 1 You just need to play - it's like Megaman.

292
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just need to play Deus Ex human revolution.

293
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,798
Speaker 0: That games way good.

294
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:55,970
Speaker 1: So system shock 2 is one of those old games that the developer looking glass went out like went under in 2000 and there was and no one owned the property and no one could play the game because computers changed.

295
00:19:56,824 --> 00:20:14,982
Speaker 1: so 12 years later Someone made an unofficial bootleg patch that made the game work on Modern computers and that patch was great Like it was really well done, which is crazy because to this day No one knows who made that patch.

296
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:23,970
Speaker 1: the patch is somehow Not secret malware and someone made the patch despite the fact that nobody had the source code to this game.

297
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:25,093
Speaker 1: Nobody.

298
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,778
Speaker 1: the source code was lost there.

299
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,102
Speaker 0: You just decompile the game.

300
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,106
Speaker 1: No, there was.

301
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:43,550
Speaker 1: there was a leak of Incomplete source code in 2010 and apparently the best guess is that the person who made this patch Made the patch based on looking at that leaked source code Which was not a complete set of the source code.

302
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,921
Speaker 1: All we know about this person is that they go by their online handle.

303
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:50,232
Speaker 1: look or boo or the crow Mm-hmm.

304
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,199
Speaker 1: So the plot thickens.

305
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,223
Speaker 1: because a company.

306
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:55,049
Speaker 1: they continued to make patches to this game.

307
00:20:56,074 --> 00:21:04,714
Speaker 1: they also made patches to thief - same thing and You can play this game on modern computers because of the corbo independently.

308
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:19,656
Speaker 1: night dive is a company that got the rights to system shock - finally and they Would really like to find out who look or bow is because they would like this person's help because

309
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:20,162
Speaker 0: they are

310
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:25,584
Speaker 1: Making a spiritual successor like remake of system shock -

311
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:30,936
Speaker 0: system shock - is getting the HD remake Right, yeah after Like 20 years or whatever.

312
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:34,447
Speaker 1: So there's a whole bunch of nonsense going around here.

313
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:35,530
Speaker 1: That is real fun.

314
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:40,290
Speaker 0: You just read this article to see the detail and you haven't played system shock - well, that's wait a little bit.

315
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,830
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you just get it and like GOG or steam or whatever.

316
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:45,859
Speaker 1: But at this point I would say wait a little bit and get this remake.

317
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,083
Speaker 0: maybe maybe.

318
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:49,270
Speaker 1: well, maybe probably it could be bad.

319
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:54,144
Speaker 1: That can happen But I've never actually played system shock - maybe you should.

320
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:54,567
Speaker 1: may.

321
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,230
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna wait.

322
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,301
Speaker 1: I'm gonna wait and see if this remake is good.

323
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:58,849
Speaker 0: I think you just play right now.

324
00:21:59,191 --> 00:21:59,653
Speaker 1: Why cuz?

325
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,946
Speaker 0: it's like it doesn't need a remake.

326
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:02,589
Speaker 0: it still holds up.

327
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, but is it better than half-life 2?

328
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:06,170
Speaker 1: because I feel like I should just play that again.

329
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:08,045
Speaker 0: It's completely different from half-life 2.

330
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:13,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, but on an Same category better than or worse than from an absolute measure of.

331
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,510
Speaker 1: should I spend time on it?

332
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,095
Speaker 0: I mean you should spend time both.

333
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,806
Speaker 1: I mean you should play Deus Ex human revolution.

334
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:19,710
Speaker 1: No, why not?

335
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,326
Speaker 0: Play Deus Ex and I was not into it.

336
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:22,890
Speaker 0: Why not?

337
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,735
Speaker 0: Not did not a fan.

338
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:25,378
Speaker 1: Why not?

339
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:25,679
Speaker 1: What's?

340
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,090
Speaker 1: what do you what don't you like about Deus Ex a long time ago?

341
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,033
Speaker 0: I wasn't a fan.

342
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:29,717
Speaker 1: Okay.

343
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:30,722
Speaker 0: I remember anything else.

344
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:32,370
Speaker 1: You can't articulate anything about this.

345
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,279
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything other than I remember.

346
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,630
Speaker 0: I played the game and I went man and I stopped playing it.

347
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,738
Speaker 1: So what about system shock 2 specifically?

348
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,956
Speaker 1: is why I should play it right now with the old janky version instead of waiting for the HD remake.

349
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:55,530
Speaker 0: well system shock 2 is Maybe the premiere or first or best FPS that had like really sort of like the cinematic horror of loneliness and like a dark space station.

350
00:22:55,938 --> 00:23:01,358
Speaker 0: surreal creepy You know, it's like you're.

351
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:14,590
Speaker 0: you're sitting there and suddenly like, you know It's like these wild like lab monkeys coming at you and shit also in maybe the first or most best FPS to really incorporate like these RPG elements, right?

352
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,977
Speaker 0: You know, I feel like Bioshock does it right.

353
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:21,710
Speaker 0: and Bioshock does it in kind of like, you know a more sleek modernized way.

354
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:35,580
Speaker 0: This does it in more of a you know, the the real old-school RPG kind of way right made more like More like the original fallouts almost You know kind of style in terms of like.

355
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,770
Speaker 0: upgrade your biz and your stats and your items.

356
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:41,180
Speaker 0: Really really tight inventory management.

357
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,450
Speaker 0: Like you just can't go around shooting things willy-nilly.

358
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

359
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,170
Speaker 0: It's like you get hardly any bullets for anything.

360
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,110
Speaker 0: All right, you know, there's a plot is exploring.

361
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:53,247
Speaker 1: But one last thing about this news at least is that we talk about this a lot.

362
00:23:53,307 --> 00:24:01,070
Speaker 1: when people make Remakes D makes they do something cool that technically violates copyright law in a complicated way.

363
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:02,577
Speaker 1: And then they get takedowns.

364
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:06,614
Speaker 1: the pro move is to release stuff anonymously.

365
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:09,664
Speaker 1: so Le Corbeau my hat is off to you.

366
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:19,608
Speaker 1: if somehow this Episode of geek nights finds that you're to you I would love to interview you and we would keep your identity secret.

367
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:22,350
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Because I think you have interesting stuff.

368
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,719
Speaker 1: We'll get you in Daft Punk and tell a showdown.

369
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,367
Speaker 1: we'll get Le Corbeau both Daft Punk and teller.

370
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,290
Speaker 1: we'll get all them on the show.

371
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,789
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

372
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:44,220
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm gonna use a Mario maker thing of the day because we're talking about Mario maker.

373
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:48,070
Speaker 1: There's a lot of really impressive and weird crap people are making.

374
00:24:48,491 --> 00:25:00,700
Speaker 1: but this channel is the height of making ridiculous logic inside of Mario maker to make weird levels and This is just one example.

375
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,493
Speaker 1: This is a level where the level will just kill you.

376
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:16,130
Speaker 1: if you ever look forward You have to be looking backward the entire time and still somehow complete the level and it does not do it in the way You're imagining by having like a boo on a rail.

377
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,155
Speaker 1: That's right next to you.

378
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:25,720
Speaker 1: It's Complicated and kind of amazing and it really showcases The clever emerging crap you can do with a game like Mario maker.

379
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:30,160
Speaker 1: Also, the guy who runs this channel is just delightful to listen to and it's real fun.

380
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:41,057
Speaker 1: And if you like this video you will like literally every video they make and they make a lot of videos All right, so rim seems to be complaining that Frankfurt Germany is super boring.

381
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:48,979
Speaker 1: Oh my god It's like the most boring place I've ever visited on the European continent, but Apparently they had a very not boring thing there.

382
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:57,000
Speaker 1: I think this is literally yet I'm looking at your thing of the day the most interesting thing that has ever happened in the city of Frankfurt.

383
00:25:57,301 --> 00:26:14,307
Speaker 0: They had a concert there known as rockin 1000 right and at this concert the song killing in the name by Rage against the machina Whose play you you may.

384
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:17,398
Speaker 1: if you hear this song, I think you may recognize if you don't know.

385
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:19,535
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a familiar popular song.

386
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:22,995
Speaker 0: I think Anyway, they played this song and it's like, okay.

387
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:23,960
Speaker 0: What's the big deal?

388
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:42,163
Speaker 0: Well, the big deal is that rockin 1000 is literally a rockin 1000. what this concert is is There's a band and in the arena The band takes up the entire floor of the arena and everyone else is in the bleachers as if you were watching like an ice Game or something.

389
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:46,055
Speaker 1: This band is as big as five times bigger than my high school.

390
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:50,800
Speaker 0: I don't think this band Is hooked up to any sort of sound system or anything?

391
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:59,394
Speaker 0: It's like there are a field of drummers a field of Guitarists a pile of vocalists a pile like bassists, right?

392
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,340
Speaker 0: It's just like large numbers.

393
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,290
Speaker 0: It's like look how many drummers are there?

394
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,692
Speaker 0: a hundred?

395
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:08,810
Speaker 1: and it's like I see like 400 symbols, maybe there's so many symbols.

396
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,692
Speaker 1: just right.

397
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,423
Speaker 0: tons and tons of people set up their drum set and all play simultaneously.

398
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:16,029
Speaker 0: all these guitarists have one little amp next to them.

399
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:28,660
Speaker 0: each and all their amps combined are loud enough that you can hear them and You don't need to actually have you know, some sort of you know Big sound system that's projecting the one guitarist amp all the way to everyone else.

400
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,793
Speaker 1: So I got to see where this band performs.

401
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:41,060
Speaker 0: if there's a way to see them in person I don't know if there's a way to see rockin 1000 anywhere or ever again But this is a you know, I think they did play other songs obviously because who would pay to hear one song?

402
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,235
Speaker 1: I mean, they have a YouTube channel with like 400,000 subscribers.

403
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,320
Speaker 1: So I assume they're still active.

404
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is I discovered them via this video and it's a good song and a good video.

405
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:55,200
Speaker 0: So start here and if you are into it, you can check out their other stuff until the novelty wears off.

406
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:56,678
Speaker 1: I am already into it.

407
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:06,479
Speaker 1: Yeah in the meta moment the geek nights book club book is the first novel the tale of Genji, apparently it's about this item that gives you extra attacks.

408
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:15,084
Speaker 0: No, it's about Yeah kind of.

409
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:17,292

Speaker 1: I Fucking dare you there is no way you would do that.

418
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:43,749
Speaker 0: That's like the move in a samurai movie I'll get I'll get a dragon lens Scott.

00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:44,753
Speaker 1: That is like the move.

428
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:09,000
Speaker 1: Scott you pick in one of those books is like that move in a samurai movie Where you let the other dude stab you just so you can stab them and you both die.

Speaker 0: I'll get your favorite dude.

430
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,258
Speaker 0: Is it drizzed your favorite dude?

431
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:12,319
Speaker 1: or?

432
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,232
Speaker 0: Drizzed might be my least favorite Character so that's the one I'll get.

433
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:19,578
Speaker 0: I'll get the most drizzy book.

434
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:24,899
Speaker 1: there is One you want to go to get fucking Catherly, okay?

435
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:29,840
Speaker 0: I'll get a book where Catherly is the main character and it's all about Catherly.

436
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,640
Speaker 1: Oh, there are five books where Catherly the cleric of Deneer is the main character.

437
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,500
Speaker 0: Which one is the worst one okay?

438
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,954
Speaker 1: Those books are written by the same dude who wrote drizzed.

439
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:47,852
Speaker 1: so imagine drizz But without even it without even having someone cool like Artemis and Traire who is cool in the same way that Reaper and overwatch is cool.

440
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,079
Speaker 1: Not cool, okay?

441
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,774
Speaker 1: Anyway, otherwise uh in not that much time.

442
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,501
Speaker 1: We will be at PAX West 2019.

443
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,726
Speaker 0: it's so soon.

444
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,553
Speaker 0: We are doing we are all summer.

445
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:01,400
Speaker 0: We're like I'm a convention is so far away.

446
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,918
Speaker 0: It's like well fuck summer is over soon.

447
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:10,700
Speaker 1: fun Not one, but two panels and those panels are on Friday and then Saturday meaning the rest of this PAX.

448
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:23,168
Speaker 1: We're just gonna be in tabletop And we're probably only gonna go into the expo hall or even the entire convention center once because packs has added ridiculous Terrible security lines that I am really worried about.

449
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:35,058
Speaker 0: fYI all of tabletop stuff at PAX West has been moved To a central location at the Hyatt Regency Which is a new venue for back which is also I believe where our panels are.

450
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:37,732
Speaker 0: no Well, I think the panels are in the Grand Hyatt.

451
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:41,113
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we're one of the Hyatt's good We're in the hippogriff theater.

452
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 0: there are three Hyatts.

453
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,800
Speaker 0: There's the Grand Hyatt the Hyatt Regency and also the Olive 8 which is a Hyatt.

454
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:56,840
Speaker 1: Yeah Which is a problem because the way you know every PAX has the rule to figure out where the panel rooms are Based on the names, but PAX West has the most complicated rules because the PAX West is across a bunch of places.

455
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:04,480
Speaker 1: So the rule was always that's the first letter of the name of the theater is the same first letter as the name of the hotel.

456
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:10,420
Speaker 0: There are many significant changes to PAX West this year And if you're going you need to look them up on the PAX West.

457
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, they they.

458
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,368
Speaker 1: you really need to look them up Otherwise, you're gonna go to the wrong main.

459
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:27,130
Speaker 0: unless you're not you've never been to PAX before in which case It'll you'll think it was always this way Son I remember when tabletop was in this incomplete Abandoned looking like NX space.

460
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,295
Speaker 0: that is now the annex.

461
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:28,717
Speaker 0: Yes.

462
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:32,500
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, let's talk about some Mario maker.

463
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:41,933
Speaker 0: Alright so Mario maker one came out for the Wii U which obviously didn't buy cuz I don't fucking with you Yeah, and the 3ds and I bought the 3ds one.

464
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:42,736
Speaker 1: I did not.

465
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:55,522
Speaker 0: I ended up You know, I the 3ds one was good because the stylus is the perfect tool for creating Mario maker levels But I didn't play it too much just because it wasn't really you know The DS one.

466
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:55,843
Speaker 0: it just.

467
00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:59,134
Speaker 0: it just lacks some stuff that the full Wii U one had.

468
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:09,480
Speaker 0: and I even though I was really into the Idea of Mario maker and I played the DS one a bit I just you know because I wasn't on the Wii U I wasn't getting the full deal.

469
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:16,845
Speaker 0: I have spectating some Mario maker a lot on the internet a bit YouTube and such like that But I missed the boat.

470
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:17,949
Speaker 0: a Mario maker once.

471
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:29,271
Speaker 0: now Mario maker 2 comes out on the switch and I'm like All right, all my other games that I was into were sort of falling off, you know, I'm not playing Hearthstone I'm not really playing any the auto chess's anymore.

472
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,339
Speaker 0: I'm going all in on Mario maker.

473
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:42,278
Speaker 1: Yep I'm not going all-in because I play as my game that I can just keep playing because one overwatch I mean you gave you don't play FPS is anymore Which is part of why you like you don't have some counter-strike to just play every day.

474
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:43,847
Speaker 1: No, I still got the overwatch.

475
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:52,187
Speaker 0: Mario maker's got a lot more variety than counter-strike Yeah, but counter-strike so good and your counter-strike is good, but it's not Like just eating sugar cookies all day.

476
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:55,237
Speaker 0: really what Mario maker is the TLDR.

477
00:32:55,297 --> 00:33:11,870
Speaker 0: if you got a switch Yeah, and you're like Mario and you're the kind of person where you're will because the game is 60 bucks Yeah, where you are content to play 2d Mario a lot Like a whole lot then you should get Mario which I am like.

478
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,399
Speaker 1: I'll still just randomly play Mario 3 sometimes, right?

479
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,114
Speaker 0: However, if you are just the kind of person who just only wants to play Mario a little bit.

480
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,343
Speaker 0: It's not worth $60.

481
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:23,392
Speaker 0: No, right you're.

482
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:26,700
Speaker 0: if you're not gonna be Playing this frequently don't play.

483
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:31,117
Speaker 1: So in terms of that like the kinds of people who should really get this game.

484
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:37,198
Speaker 1: if you want to break that down a little More if you want to make Mario levels as a hobby hell yeah.

485
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,465
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah This is this.

486
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,210
Speaker 1: is it like?

487
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,640
Speaker 1: I'm working real hard.

488
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:47,720
Speaker 1: I'm trying to recreate my favorite levels like the the feeling I got for my favorite levels of Mario 2.

489
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,235
Speaker 1: Mario 2 is not the kind of game you can make in this no, but there's in the world.

490
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:53,499
Speaker 0: meaning are you as a?

491
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:53,780
Speaker 0: yes?

492
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,333
Speaker 0: You can totally make Mario real.

493
00:33:55,373 --> 00:34:05,800
Speaker 1: Mario 2 levels But for one and for two in the American Mario 2 are some of my favorite levels in Mario games Because it's ice and you got to like Dobbs the enemies.

494
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,255
Speaker 1: I'm trying to make levels that are reminiscent of that in this game right now, and it is.

495
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:20,000
Speaker 1: it really Drives home how much craft and effort and knowledge and skill it takes to make a good 2d Mario level.

496
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:22,610
Speaker 1: It is real hard to make a lot of work.

497
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:35,025
Speaker 1: cuz you make one you feel like it's okay Then you go and play like even just Mario 1 world 1 1 again, and you're like oh I can't make these right,

498
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:37,914
Speaker 0: but even if you are not interested in making levels at

499
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:38,295
Speaker 1: all it

500
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:43,231
Speaker 0: is perfectly worthwhile To get Mario maker just to play levels.

501
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:49,136
Speaker 0: in fact on the main screen when you turn on the game There are two little you know movie clacky things.

502
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:52,154
Speaker 0: You know what I'm talking about And one of them says make it.

503
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:53,120
Speaker 0: one says play.

504
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:56,414
Speaker 0: And if you just want to make or just want to play you're not interested in both.

505
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:57,880
Speaker 0: That is perfectly okay.

506
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,979
Speaker 0: There is a sea of content for people who just want to play or just want to make.

507
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,611
Speaker 1: yep There's a story mode like there's a single-player mode.

508
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:06,600
Speaker 0: so the story mode is really simple.

509
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,614
Speaker 0: It's basically the cast.

510
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:09,520
Speaker 0: you built the castle.

511
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:14,320
Speaker 0: Oh, it got the dog hit the reset switch on the castle you to make the castle again.

512
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,119
Speaker 1: I realized almost no kids have any idea like what that reset rocket is.

513
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:27,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, no no no I appreciate that Nintendo has made the Mario maker games look and feel a lot like Mario paint.

514
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,648
Speaker 0: But that reset rocket was also in Mario maker 1.

515
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:34,900
Speaker 1: yeah, but that's because Mario maker 1 leaned into the Mario paint aesthetic.

516
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:39,634
Speaker 0: anyway The point is that the castle got destroyed.

517
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:40,780
Speaker 0: to build it again need coins.

518
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:54,713
Speaker 0: So you basically play a bunch of 2d Mario levels that were better included in the game already And talk go around talking to toes in this little area until you have enough coins And you slowly over time eventually rebuild the whole castle and beat all the levels.

519
00:35:55,134 --> 00:36:04,020
Speaker 0: and all these levels that were sort of included with The game in the story mode are levels that were made by some top Mario maker designers as well as people who work at Nintendo.

520
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:05,874
Speaker 0: So it's that wasn't?

521
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:13,911
Speaker 1: that's kind of nice And they're worth playing because they actually they teach you things about the mechanics of different Mario games that you might not have Recognized or realize.

522
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:14,336
Speaker 0: I beat them all.

523
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:15,201
Speaker 0: yeah You play.

524
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:16,905
Speaker 1: that is not enough to justify $60 to play a hundred 2d level.

525
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:23,081
Speaker 0: nope that is $5.

526
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,748
Speaker 0: yeah, that's like to play just like you know.

527
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:31,726
Speaker 0: as this one package of 2d Mario levels is not a $60 purchase Do not buy it.

528
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:33,295
Speaker 0: play story mode and then stop playing.

529
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:35,064
Speaker 0: that was foolish Right.

530
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,600
Speaker 0: what you need to do is you need to look at the other modes, so let's talk about the other modes.

531
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously there is making mode right.

532
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,437
Speaker 0: so in making mode you make Mario levels.

533
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:54,245
Speaker 0: the way It works is you pick Mario 1 like Super Mario 1 not Mario 1. right Mario 3 Mario World Mario.

534
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:56,719
Speaker 0: you like new Mario Brothers right?

535
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,739
Speaker 0: or 3d Mario 3d with like the cat and all that stuff.

536
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:05,998
Speaker 1: yeah And this sets the sort of palette of what things Mario is capable of right.

537
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:10,106
Speaker 0: so mode there They're a lot of them are pretty like Similar right.

538
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:13,198
Speaker 0: it's like you can do like all of them have boo the ghost.

539
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,328
Speaker 0: yeah All of them have bullet bill.

540
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:15,890
Speaker 0: all of them have.

541
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,004
Speaker 1: even if those things didn't exist in those games It's more like Mario's.

542
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:21,212
Speaker 1: physics will be like that game, but the mate right.

543
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:28,400
Speaker 0: well most well the physics Yeah, detailed physics like if you're a connoisseur are basically new Mario Brothers physics.

544
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:30,367
Speaker 0: But yeah the rules will change.

545
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:35,527
Speaker 0: so for example if you pick Mario Mario Mario Brothers You can't pick up shells.

546
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,859
Speaker 0: you pick Mario 3. oh well now you can pick up shells and get a tanooki suit.

547
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,970
Speaker 0: well you pick Mario World you can get a cape and you can spin jump.

548
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,456
Speaker 0: and then you pick new Mario Brothers.

549
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:44,540
Speaker 0: well now you can wall jump.

550
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,805
Speaker 0: Right yeah, and it's like so.

551
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:47,833
Speaker 0: the rules change when you choose the different ones.

552
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,440
Speaker 0: you can choose different themes.

553
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,611
Speaker 0: You can do snow world right you can do ghost house.

554
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,420
Speaker 0: you can do right, and it's all the themes are the same across.

555
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:59,808
Speaker 0: So it's like you could do a Mario Brothers Ghost house which you couldn't do before right.

556
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:04,586
Speaker 0: you can do ice world in Mario 3 which didn't exist before Snow world.

557
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,400
Speaker 0: ice world existed in level 6.

558
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,851
Speaker 1: I'm basically only making worlds in Mario 3 because that's really what I'm like.

559
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:12,820
Speaker 0: that's what I'm feeling not into Mario world not as much.

560
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,373
Speaker 0: I mean I think about the world.

561
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,808
Speaker 0: what I'm the level I want to make like I made a level that was.

562
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,746
Speaker 0: the idea of the level was go into the cave Right or the start of the level.

563
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:29,859
Speaker 0: there's a pipe and you can see the goal on the other side of a wall And it's like oh yeah, I guess go over this wall You could win, and it's like yeah You could but the walls real high.

564
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:33,940
Speaker 0: So you got to go in the cave in the pipe go all the way and there's a one-way thing.

565
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,588
Speaker 0: So you got to go all the way across the bottom.

566
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:40,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's a pipe that just spits out cape feathers Hmm, and then you got to go across the top.

567
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:50,043
Speaker 0: you can't go across the bottom got to go across the top Without losing that cape and get all the way back to the start go in the pipe you came out of and then fly over To the exit.

568
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:54,020
Speaker 0: people tell a lot of people chose Mario world for that because it made sense.

569
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of the levels.

570
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,214
Speaker 1: I see are that there and back again.

571
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:58,520
Speaker 1: pattern like they're back again.

572
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,946
Speaker 0: I haven't seen any other ones doing that.

573
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:00,528
Speaker 1: I've seen that.

574
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,738
Speaker 0: yeah, but yeah did that.

575
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:04,847
Speaker 0: and then The most of the levels.

576
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,474
Speaker 0: I see there's lots of kaizo levels.

577
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:07,860
Speaker 0: There's lots of theme levels.

578
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you break them down the level I see most are Just bad level.

579
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:18,320
Speaker 0: bad level is very common like kid just put random stuff on a screen the ends you open the level.

580
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,505
Speaker 0: It's a hundred bosses.

581
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:21,151
Speaker 0: Aha pick a pipe.

582
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:22,396
Speaker 0: It's like here's five pipes.

583
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:23,440
Speaker 0: They all kill you but one.

584
00:39:24,882 --> 00:39:25,747
Speaker 0: Oh, they all kill you.

585
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:27,759
Speaker 0: that we all eat the level is a hidden thing.

586
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:35,557
Speaker 1: Then there's the kaizo which uh I'm a fan of watching other people do those, but I'm not actually interested in playing right.

587
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:36,220
Speaker 0: I'm amazed.

588
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:43,955
Speaker 0: It's like I could beat those if I right but the thing that keeps me from actually beating them I guess you could say you could argue that I can't based on right.

589
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:44,377
Speaker 0: It's like I'm.

590
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:45,140
Speaker 1: I could do that.

591
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,863
Speaker 1: I just don't wanna.

592
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:46,044
Speaker 0: well.

593
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,540
Speaker 0: I'm physically capable with my hands if I put enough time.

594
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:52,500
Speaker 0: I'm not capable of putting in the time.

595
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:59,308
Speaker 0: I don't have the patience and the Memorize and perfect the execute.

596
00:39:59,328 --> 00:40:06,520
Speaker 1: I mean frankly other than the fact that I have some gnosis I don't know if rim today would be patient enough to beat the star world stuff in Mario world.

597
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:07,199
Speaker 0: I could do that.

598
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:18,840
Speaker 0: But as I watch people play these kinds of levels and basically they do have all the patience in the world they play and will Retry and retry and retry for hours and hours and hours until they clear the level and it's like damn.

599
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,927
Speaker 1: There was a time when I was like that.

600
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:23,436
Speaker 0: They're totally chill the whole time after 10 minutes.

601
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:24,640
Speaker 0: I'd give up and throw my control.

602
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:27,225
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like that.

603
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:29,398
Speaker 0: They'll be four hours in just chillin like whatever.

604
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,483
Speaker 0: Yep This is how I do.

605
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:38,260
Speaker 1: then you run into levels that are like a very specific gag or gimmick Like someone came up with something clever.

606
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,743
Speaker 1: They want to do something funny like the one we saw that was a 2d like 2d 3d Walking adventure.

607
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:48,233
Speaker 0: It's a very popular level that one because it was well-crafted even though it was small.

608
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:53,288
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah, so You can do is you can go into.

609
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,155
Speaker 0: the first is making mode right.

610
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:59,088
Speaker 0: the second mode is Basically like course world right?

611
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:02,100
Speaker 0: So in course world you have a few options, right?

612
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,621
Speaker 0: You can.

613
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:04,928
Speaker 0: you can just play levels.

614
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:06,633
Speaker 0: You can like search for levels.

615
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:08,739
Speaker 0: You can look at the most popular levels.

616
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:11,260
Speaker 0: You can look at like recently hot levels.

617
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:18,733
Speaker 0: You can look at there's a queue of the levels that were just uploaded just now that no one's played yet You know, you can get codes for levels.

618
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:20,140
Speaker 0: like every level has a code.

619
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,940
Speaker 0: So if someone shares a level code with you, you can type it in and play that level.

620
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've been sharing some in the gig Knights forum.

621
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,739
Speaker 0: I tweeted out some level codes the levels I made right?

622
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,070
Speaker 0: You can also the multiplayer.

623
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,280
Speaker 1: I haven't played yet, but it looks pretty fun.

624
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,011
Speaker 0: The multiplayer is good and bad right.

625
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,311
Speaker 0: the biggest problem with the multiplayer is That I think you need to do Nintendo online.

626
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:42,959
Speaker 0: First of all, right, which sucks.

627
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,631
Speaker 0: But second of all the mode.

628
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,280
Speaker 0: I had mad lag because it's Nintendo.

629
00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:56,640
Speaker 0: If you want to play the multiplayer and have a good experience either find a way to avoid the lag Which I think means be in Japan or be play it just locally.

630
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:59,238
Speaker 1: Yeah local is the only way I would ever play a game like this.

631
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:07,602
Speaker 0: so the multiplayer works is you get a level and everyone is stuck in this little box at the start all four characters like Mario Luigi toad and Toadette.

632
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:11,776
Speaker 0: you're stuck in this box and it's basically like three two one and the box goes away.

633
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:13,000
Speaker 0: and now you can escape the box.

634
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,656
Speaker 0: You can move around in the box all you wanted.

635
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:20,200
Speaker 0: now You can escape and it's whoever gets to the end first and if you die you go back to the start or the check.

636
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it actually has two modes.

637
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:27,963
Speaker 1: You can put it in a versus mode where you're just like fighting or a co-op mode where if anyone makes it you all win Right.

638
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:31,640
Speaker 0: So the car I don't really see a difference between the modes and the co-op mode is kind of silly.

639
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:40,699
Speaker 0: I guess you could if you Specifically crafted levels where the cop was necessary But then it's fun or something like that.

640
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:44,860
Speaker 0: Like you maybe you could craft levels to where the co-op was necessary fun or helpful.

641
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,959
Speaker 0: But co-op is basically just versus but everyone wins isn't the only the ending screen is any different.

642
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:53,599
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't really notice any other difference between them.

643
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:55,284
Speaker 0: So it's kind of dumb.

644
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:58,394
Speaker 0: but the versus mode can be dumb or not dumb a lot of time.

645
00:42:58,455 --> 00:42:59,900
Speaker 0: It's luck based like.

646
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,624
Speaker 0: Sometimes there are good levels designed for versus where it works out But sometimes not.

647
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:09,140
Speaker 0: and you know, it can be kind of random or it can be kind of good depending on a lot of circumstances.

648
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:15,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you really want to save the verses for a situation where you can control the circumstances.

649
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,495
Speaker 0: You pick levels that are good for versus.

650
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:28,320
Speaker 0: you have people With you that are good for versus like you're hanging out at a convention in line for something Right here you play it like random internet online versus is gonna.

651
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

652
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:34,815
Speaker 0: It's like it's definitely not skilled player wins Right, not usually anyway.

653
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:39,920
Speaker 0: Yep So then you've got what I think is the best mode which is the endless mode.

654
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:50,580
Speaker 0: Yeah So the endless mode just turn it on and go you turn it on and you can choose easy Normal expert or super expert and it sorts levels based on their clear rates.

655
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:56,601
Speaker 0: So if a level has been like only cleared once out of like a thousand plays that's probably super expert Right.

656
00:43:56,922 --> 00:44:02,319
Speaker 0: and if a level is as like a 50% clear rate meaning like half the time someone starts the level they beat it.

657
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,554
Speaker 0: That's probably like normal and a level that has like 90%.

658
00:44:05,554 --> 00:44:06,980
Speaker 0: well, that's probably like easy, right?

659
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,507
Speaker 0: Yeah so it gives you some lives.

660
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:12,379
Speaker 0: the harder the difficulty the more lives they give you to start with.

661
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:25,128
Speaker 0: and Then it picks a random level from all the levels that have been uploaded into Mario And says here you go play and if you beat if you clear the level you get one point If you die, you lose a life.

662
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:28,400
Speaker 0: if you lose all your lives game over your score goes back to zero.

663
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,193
Speaker 0: You have to try again and and this is important You can always skip a level.

664
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,963
Speaker 0: right you if you're dead Like if you die You can then skip.

665
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:41,780
Speaker 0: or if you're standing on the ground you can skip but you can't use skip to like avoid death.

666
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,087
Speaker 0: Like oh god, here comes spike.

667
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:43,389
Speaker 0: Skip.

668
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:43,651
Speaker 0: Skip.

669
00:44:43,671 --> 00:44:43,811
Speaker 0: Skip.

670
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:44,375
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

671
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,260
Speaker 0: That won't work, right?

672
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:51,409
Speaker 0: You have to skip when you're like standing in a safe spot or if you were already died Then you can see you really use this.

673
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:53,078
Speaker 1: for oh this level is just random.

674
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,940
Speaker 0: be right You use the skip when a level is complete bullshit.

675
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:57,626
Speaker 0: Or I've seen a lot of.

676
00:44:57,646 --> 00:45:01,860
Speaker 0: I'm watching people on Twitch who are trying to like win at endless mode and get the high score.

677
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:04,748
Speaker 0: No Like having the longest streak and they're like concert.

678
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,180
Speaker 0: you can only get to 99 lives and you can only get three one-ups per level.

679
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,279
Speaker 0: So they're really conserving their lives.

680
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:15,214
Speaker 0: You know trying to beat levels getting all three one-ups if possible.

681
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:27,919
Speaker 0: Some levels don't have enough one-ups or enough coins and You know trying to beat the level with it dying less than three times and then you can Increase your lives and get farther away from game over, right?

682
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:31,952
Speaker 0: But what they'll do is because they're trying to get this high score.

683
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:34,340
Speaker 0: It's good for them to play shorter levels.

684
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:48,917
Speaker 0: so if they see that the average clear time or the world record clear time for the level is like three minutes or four minutes or Five they're like no I'm just not playing this skip even if it's beatable because they could be beating like Three one minute levels in the same amount of time, right?

685
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:51,264
Speaker 0: So that's a thing.

686
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:54,616
Speaker 0: yep, but yeah endless mode on super expert.

687
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:55,740
Speaker 0: the levels are too hard.

688
00:45:56,061 --> 00:46:01,460
Speaker 0: I think the world record for like the streak on super expert is like hundreds maybe of levels.

689
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:03,084
Speaker 0: Right easy and normal.

690
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:19,526
Speaker 0: You could go forever if you put the effort into it, but expert endless is really where it's at Because the levels are gonna be hard enough But not just stupid hard and broken that had to skip almost every level to find a beatable one that you could be in Less than three lives, right?

691
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:23,840
Speaker 0: It's like you can beat expert levels in less than three lives if you're an expert, right?

692
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,120
Speaker 0: You know, you're gonna have to do some skips now and then but for the most part, you know the people I watch on Twitch.

693
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,050
Speaker 0: It's mostly this nice Irish guy named as Iran who's in second place.

694
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:34,800
Speaker 0: We can't think fine the Spanish person is in first place.

695
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,493
Speaker 0: They're a mystery.

696
00:46:36,406 --> 00:46:37,558
Speaker 1: Wonder if it's Le Corbeau.

697
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,840
Speaker 0: There's also some a Japanese person who's in like sixth or seventh place who's named like Gigi sevaku.

698
00:46:44,123 --> 00:46:45,419
Speaker 0: That's he's a very funny dude.

699
00:46:47,243 --> 00:46:48,428
Speaker 0: The Irish news just chill.

700
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:57,620
Speaker 0: but yeah, it's like you watch them play and It's good times, but they're skipping a lot, you know, but they're also really fucking good at Mario.

701
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,696
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the making because the UX is

702
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:02,299
Speaker 0: pretty

703
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:14,300
Speaker 1: good And there's a lot of clever things in this interface that actually make it way easier than it could have been Like and it's worth noting that this interface and this tool is way better than anything The NES developers had to make levels.

704
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:19,800
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, they were like drawing them on paper and using that to like make levels, right?

705
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:23,240
Speaker 0: So, I mean it there's some limitations in level making right?

706
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:29,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you make a level you have an area and a sub area and they can have different themes But they have to be the same game.

707
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:30,874
Speaker 0: You can't be like Mario World up now.

708
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:31,477
Speaker 0: It's Mario 3.

709
00:47:31,477 --> 00:47:32,080
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

710
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

711
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:36,033
Speaker 0: You can change the length of each area longer or shorter.

712
00:47:36,434 --> 00:47:38,380
Speaker 0: You can also be elevation.

713
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,560
Speaker 0: So if you keep all of your stuff in the bottom half, there will not be any vertical scrolling going on.

714
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,440
Speaker 0: But if you suddenly put stuff in the sky, then when players get Mario up near the top suddenly the camera will move up.

715
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:57,820
Speaker 0: But if you keep everything in the bottom half It'll be like, you know Mario Brothers 1 Where Mario goes on top of the bricks at the top and the camera doesn't go up there.

716
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:00,697
Speaker 0: Yeah And you just run across the top so you can sort of control things.

717
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:06,320
Speaker 0: that way You will always have no matter what a goal is Going to be in your main area.

718
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,193
Speaker 1: And what's cool is depending on the mode you pick.

719
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:16,300
Speaker 1: like if you pick Mario 3 It's gonna be that black area right behind the scenes with the little square right and the player always starts in the main area.

720
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:24,890
Speaker 0: So if you're playing a Mario maker level and you're in the main area and you reach like a giant hole and a pipe or something You know, you don't have to go in that pipe.

721
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,140
Speaker 0: You could theoretically if you can go forward.

722
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:33,240
Speaker 0: You know The goal is in this area and that pipe is taking you to a sub area where there is no goal.

723
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:37,557
Speaker 0: Just presumably another pipe that takes you closer to the goal in the main area.

724
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:38,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

725
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,584
Speaker 0: So you have that knowledge.

726
00:48:39,604 --> 00:48:42,996
Speaker 0: so then you got the sub area which is just more room to make Mario.

727
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:44,300
Speaker 0: shit, right?

728
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:49,460
Speaker 0: And it's where your pipes go back and forth from but there's no goal there.

729
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,660
Speaker 0: So it's just a way for you to make your level bigger by putting more stuff in this other space.

730
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,292
Speaker 0: So, you know a common level design is level starting area.

731
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:03,492
Speaker 0: where the pipe pipe goes to the sub area You go through the sub area you go through another exit or door pipe.

732
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:05,800
Speaker 0: it comes out back in the main area near the goal.

733
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:14,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I made one where I just use the sub area to make a bunch of bonus rooms like Mario once that's also a pot Of pot pattern you're in the main area.

734
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:20,699
Speaker 0: You could just beat the level going through the main area But you put lots of little bonus rooms in the sub area and pipes that go back and forth between them.

735
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,226
Speaker 0: Yep, I made a level like that.

736
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:26,784
Speaker 1: or people I see a lot where there's a the main areas horizontal But the sub area is a vertical.

737
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,971
Speaker 0: right your main area must be horizontal.

738
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:31,780
Speaker 0: the sub area can be vertical or horizontal.

739
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:43,792
Speaker 0: So if you want to make a level where the player has to go up Maybe like a rising lava level or a rising water level or just go up in a tower level or go down Then you could use the sub area for that.

740
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:45,059
Speaker 0: You can't do that with the main area.

741
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,691
Speaker 0: Alright, so that's the first.

742
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:49,105
Speaker 0: that's the main Structure of your level.

743
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:52,254
Speaker 1: it has to have in terms of like the tool like.

744
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:54,922
Speaker 1: the most important part of this UX is the Mario Trails.

745
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:57,068
Speaker 1: yep, that is how you make a good level.

746
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:58,172
Speaker 0: you make a level right.

747
00:49:58,192 --> 00:50:16,179
Speaker 0: you just put stuff terrain blocks Mushrooms enemies just put stuff and you Mario is always there And you move them around and it you can push select at any time and the game will just start playing and with Mario in The spot that he was in so you can test out whatever it is in your level and see how it feels which

748
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:16,460
Speaker 1: is good.

749
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:25,231
Speaker 1: It's a lot like in the early days of HTML the first time we had Software where you could literally just like Futs with your code and then just see your website live

750
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:27,500
Speaker 0: that you can unit test any part of your level with Mario

751
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:27,802
Speaker 1: Yep,

752
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,799
Speaker 0: and then when you push select again.

753
00:50:30,181 --> 00:50:35,000
Speaker 0: You will see what like the trail of where Mario most recently was.

754
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:41,520
Speaker 0: So for example, you make a platform you start the game you run and jump then you stop the game.

755
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,259
Speaker 0: You can see the arc of Mario's jump.

756
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:48,960
Speaker 1: So maybe you want to put like a bonus block at the maximum height of a perfect jump from the beginning.

757
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:53,439
Speaker 0: Maybe you put the platform Mario has to land on in the spot where he lives you.

758
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:55,726
Speaker 0: aha That is exactly how far Mario can jump.

759
00:50:55,967 --> 00:51:00,040
Speaker 0: So I'll make Mario jump maximum distance or I'll make the game a little easier.

760
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,379
Speaker 0: I don't want to make a super hard level.

761
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:06,579
Speaker 0: I'll make sure to put my platform for Mario to land on three four or five blocks closer.

762
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:09,028
Speaker 0: So that way you can do a small jump.

763
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:10,694
Speaker 0: Okay, I'll make the small jump.

764
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:12,540
Speaker 0: All right, that's the distance for the small jump.

765
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:18,559
Speaker 0: I'll put my coins in the path of where Mario jumped right to encourage you to make this kind of jump here.

766
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:23,860
Speaker 0: Alright now I'll put my goomba right there where Mario is gonna land to make it a little scary.

767
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,864
Speaker 1: I cannot stress enough.

768
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:31,911
Speaker 1: use this feature to test out your levels and figure out how things work Because this is how you make a level that has things like flow.

769
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:32,292
Speaker 1: Yep.

770
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,620
Speaker 0: You got to undo this little undo dog.

771
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:37,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can use As eraser.

772
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:40,615
Speaker 0: you can erase stuff that you can select and move.

773
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:41,960
Speaker 0: you can select and copy.

774
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,131
Speaker 0: So like for example You make a pipe then you put a piranha in the pipe.

775
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:50,559
Speaker 0: if you want to make a whole bunch of piranhas and pipes You're gonna do go pipe pipe pipe piranha piranha piranha.

776
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,424
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

777
00:51:51,725 --> 00:52:02,900
Speaker 0: you make the pipe you make the piranha you select them both you copy You make you copy it several times Then you select all of them and you copy that several times and now you've got a whole freaking army of piranha pipes.

778
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:04,813
Speaker 0: All right, that's how you do it.

779
00:52:05,438 --> 00:52:15,433
Speaker 0: So It's a lot of stuff is easier to do with the touch screen on the switch, obviously Yep, but some stuff is easier to do with like gamepad.

780
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:16,900
Speaker 0: So it's like you're sort of mixing it up.

781
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,639
Speaker 1: This is one thing I wish I could just have this on a PC.

782
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,159
Speaker 0: Well, I wish I could have it back in the 3ds of the stylus.

783
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,748
Speaker 1: I just want a mouse and a keyboard.

784
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:24,512
Speaker 0: that would work too.

785
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:26,860
Speaker 1: Mouse and a keyboard would be great Yeah, but yeah.

786
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:33,973
Speaker 0: So it's like you're kind of mixing it up between the controller And also the touch screen to sort of craft your level stuff.

787
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:34,736
Speaker 0: and you got it sort of.

788
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,383
Speaker 0: get used to it and learn your Way around.

789
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,369
Speaker 1: you're gonna need to use both.

790
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,234
Speaker 1: like you can play.

791
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:39,260
Speaker 0: you gotta learn the different button.

792
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,979
Speaker 1: You can play the levels on your TV.

793
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:47,335
Speaker 1: But if you're making a level sit there with the switch in your hand Learning to use the different what the buttons map to like.

794
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,432
Speaker 0: if you actually want to like, you know Use the touchscreen and you have to reach over to like.

795
00:52:50,532 --> 00:52:51,660
Speaker 0: touch the undo dog.

796
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,262
Speaker 0: It's like no.

797
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:59,302
Speaker 0: you got to learn that B is undo L is a race, you know, the L Z whatever is, you know Selecting copy.

798
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:03,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta learn all these controls to really be efficient at making levels.

799
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,218
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's gonna be a huge pain in the ass.

800
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:09,348
Speaker 0: What else is there to say about Mario mate?

801
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:11,196
Speaker 0: that doesn't really have any other modes, right?

802
00:53:11,236 --> 00:53:12,060
Speaker 0: It's like you miss it.

803
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's just.

804
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:22,980
Speaker 0: even with those few modes There is just such an insane amount of content like levels constantly being uploaded you making levels constantly, right?

805
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,592
Speaker 0: They're just thousands and thousands and maybe even million.

806
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:28,660
Speaker 0: who know this game has sold millions of copies?

807
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:33,400
Speaker 0: So if everyone made a level that's millions of levels and there's a huge active online community.

808
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,024
Speaker 0: Yeah the best thing is like.

809
00:53:35,104 --> 00:53:37,071
Speaker 0: I was talking about watching people play it on Twitch.

810
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:48,310
Speaker 0: one thing that I've been doing lately is you go Twitch and you look for Mario maker and the Mario maker category is a lot of players and you'll see some people who say viewer Levels and of course that means they're playing.

811
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,219
Speaker 0: you submit levels to them and they play them.

812
00:53:50,721 --> 00:53:57,919
Speaker 0: there's some sort of API or something that they've got that hooks up to Mario maker where you think you can type in your Level code and it will add it.

813
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:13,678
Speaker 0: There's like an automatic queue these twitch streamers have set up to where it cues your level up for them to play Right, and it actually somehow finds the name of the level and the information about it via some API and Gives that to the twitch streamer and shows it on the screen for them.

814
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:19,222
Speaker 0: But what I use this for is not because I'm desperate to have people play my level I don't.

815
00:54:19,283 --> 00:54:20,048
Speaker 0: I don't care about that.

816
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:25,659
Speaker 0: as a user for play testing Nothing will help you make a better level than watching someone play your level.

817
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:29,180
Speaker 0: So what I do is I make a level I go to twitch, right?

818
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,100
Speaker 0: I said I find a small streamer who doesn't have a big audience.

819
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,678
Speaker 0: But I watch them play Mario a little bit to see how good they are.

820
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:36,819
Speaker 0: Right because sometimes I want someone who's not good.

821
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:39,180
Speaker 0: Sometimes I want some real good, right?

822
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,100
Speaker 0: But certain people it's like you don't want them at all because they can't really give you any useful feedback.

823
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:49,440
Speaker 0: Right, you can sort of tell and then once I find someone good I add I follow them and I add my level to the queue.

824
00:54:49,823 --> 00:55:09,599
Speaker 0: I waited five minutes because they don't have a lot of viewers Like empty queue or whatever and I watch them play my level and I ask him for feedback And then I see how they play my level like I why I've made a level called Damage boost desert and the design of the level was your little area is like Mario 3 Right in the desert and there's you know, the purple pipes, right?

825
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:19,678
Speaker 0: so the it's sort of zoned in the little separate rooms with the purple pipes and the only way to get to the next room is a Small Mario sized slit that has spikes on it.

826
00:55:20,121 --> 00:55:25,620
Speaker 0: So you have to have a mushroom and you just run onto the spikes get hurt and then run into the next room.

827
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:33,960
Speaker 0: Right and you damage boost and if you get hit by something else You're not making it into the next room because now you're small Mario and there's exactly one mushroom in every room.

828
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:38,620
Speaker 0: And at the end of the level I put some spikes underneath this question block with a star in it.

829
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:48,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have to land you lose you you Right you get hit by those spikes You have to hit the question block and grab the star before you die and then you can run to the end, right?

830
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:58,060
Speaker 0: And what I watch someone play this level and what I noticed was when they got to a certain area They were approaching it completely differently than I was even though it was a really straightforward area.

831
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,439
Speaker 0: We just jump up onto some platforms to go higher.

832
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:06,540
Speaker 0: Right, but there was a goomba that I had placed far away from this area very far away.

833
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:10,079
Speaker 0: But because it was a goomba it walks and then falls off.

834
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, right only you got to pay attention to stuff like this like red Koopa and go loomba.

835
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:21,120
Speaker 0: They will turn around when they get the edge of a platform and stay on it, but green Koopa and goomba they fall off.

836
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,924
Speaker 0: They just keep going.

837
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:27,734
Speaker 0: so that goomba because the way they had played the level Fell out of the sky and just landed on him.

838
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:28,680
Speaker 0: It's complete horseshit.

839
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:33,039
Speaker 0: It's like imagine just going up and suddenly a goomba comes out of nowhere lands on you.

840
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,130
Speaker 0: It's like that's just bullshit bad level, right?

841
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,740
Speaker 0: So when that happened, I was in the chat like oh shit my bad I'm gonna fix that.

842
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:45,357
Speaker 0: And I never would have known that if not for the ability to submit my level to a twitch streamer.

843
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:48,299
Speaker 0: watch them play it And then you can't edit your levels.

844
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:55,408
Speaker 0: So what I did is I just deleted the level and uploaded it again with a different code Right and you know with a better version.

845
00:56:55,428 --> 00:57:01,147
Speaker 0: and I think some people what they do is they keep uploading levels and they just keep Uploading like v2 v3.

846
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:04,120
Speaker 0: They just keep uploading more and more and more instead of deleting them.

847
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually increase the limit.

848
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:08,416
Speaker 0: one player can now upload 64 levels total.

849
00:57:09,682 --> 00:57:22,340
Speaker 0: So if you want to make 65 different levels yet to delete one of your levels They're presuming that over time that level will increase as the game because as the player base shrinks more Right, but as of now the game is still pretty hot.

850
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,688
Speaker 0: So 64 is still quite a bit of level.

851
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,013
Speaker 0: I mean I've still.

852
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:27,980
Speaker 1: I'm working on one good one, right?

853
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:33,097
Speaker 0: I so many people make theme levels or quirky levels or all these other.

854
00:57:33,157 --> 00:57:38,160
Speaker 0: I'm trying to make Normal levels that look like they would go in a Mario game.

855
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:49,626
Speaker 0: Yeah also Have some sort of at least game Mechanic gimmick like they go to the end get the feather and then come back without getting hit use a damage boost to go to Some kind of.

856
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:51,920
Speaker 0: I made a level that was just shortcuts, right?

857
00:57:52,060 --> 00:58:02,620
Speaker 0: I put the vine cloud shortcut the pipe underneath shortcut, you know The sideways pipe underneath the cliff hole kind of got a slide along the wall to get in there shortcut, right?

858
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,923
Speaker 0: You know all kinds of different shortcut e bits and that was you know, I mean some idea for the level not just walk to the end.

859
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:14,579
Speaker 1: Yep, the only thing I wish I could do is have a little more control of the enemies.

860
00:58:15,324 --> 00:58:18,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you put the give the enemy, uh, you know You can you can.

861
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:20,591
Speaker 0: so you can customize a lot of things.

862
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:23,020
Speaker 0: you can just about any enemy has a lot of option.

863
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:24,747
Speaker 0: Any item has a lot of options.

864
00:58:24,888 --> 00:58:26,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can give like a even a coin.

865
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:30,640
Speaker 0: you put a coin You can give the coin wings or I can give the coin a parachute.

866
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:32,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can give the coin wings and a parachute.

867
00:58:32,851 --> 00:58:34,520
Speaker 0: you can do all kinds of weird stuff, right?

868
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,086
Speaker 0: So an enemy a lot of enemies.

869
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:37,431
Speaker 0: you give a wings a parachute.

870
00:58:37,773 --> 00:58:40,103
Speaker 0: some enemies have more options than that You know, they could.

871
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:41,027
Speaker 0: you get the thwomps.

872
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:47,420
Speaker 0: you can do a lot of different things with thwomps different directions Different style of flop big thwomps small thwomps, right?

873
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,960
Speaker 0: You can also put guys on top of each other and arrange them in different ways.

874
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:54,611
Speaker 0: So like you can do a you know, there's the king Koopa.

875
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,136
Speaker 0: All right, he's got that little.

876
00:58:56,297 --> 00:58:58,365
Speaker 0: you know, Mario world He's got that little vehicle.

877
00:58:58,405 --> 00:58:59,652
Speaker 0: He flies in right.

878
00:58:59,672 --> 00:59:03,310
Speaker 0: you can make a fire version of that vehicle But like you could put something else in the vehicle.

879
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,134
Speaker 0: That's not king Koopa.

880
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,262
Speaker 0: You could put like a boo in there Right.

881
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,260
Speaker 1: I see a lot of people make big mechs and big like robot looking things.

882
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:14,540
Speaker 0: You can put enemies on top of each other and combine them in different ways.

883
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

884
00:59:15,744 --> 00:59:20,260
Speaker 0: You can also effectively make different things just by arranging levels in a certain way.

885
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:26,392
Speaker 1: I mean people will make a lot of complicated boo logic by having Booze and things all stacked together somewhere.

886
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:27,920
Speaker 1: the player can't see a little try.

887
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:32,400
Speaker 0: So the biggest the biggest new thing in Mario maker 2 is the on/off block.

888
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:43,494
Speaker 0: yeah, basically there will be blocks and you hit them and it switches between red and blue and then you can put in the Level red and blue blocks and when it's in people hit the thing and it switches to blue mode.

889
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:47,948
Speaker 0: all the blue box becomes solid And the red ones become transparent and vice-versa.

890
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:50,677
Speaker 0: and the most common thing people do is make a level.

891
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:59,170
Speaker 0: you run and jump run Jump jump jump and when you jump you hit your head on a switch block and now the platform you're about to land on Becomes solid right?

892
00:59:59,491 --> 01:00:00,496
Speaker 0: It's a blue platform.

893
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:03,169
Speaker 0: You'd fall through it But you you jumped and hit the switch.

894
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:10,100
Speaker 0: it becomes solid before you land on it You run a red platforms coming up, but you run and jump and hit the switch and so on.

895
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:17,266
Speaker 0: That's very popular But lots and lots of people making all kinds of puzzly tricky levels Just with on/off blocks.

896
01:00:17,306 --> 01:00:19,252
Speaker 0: cuz they're new they weren't in Mario maker one.

897
01:00:19,272 --> 01:00:21,600
Speaker 0: I don't believe they weren't in a lot of Mario.

898
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:22,644
Speaker 0: I can't remember.

899
01:00:22,824 --> 01:00:25,233
Speaker 1: So what's new in Mario maker - what slopes?

900
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:26,979
Speaker 1: apparently weren't in Mario maker one.

901
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:35,700
Speaker 1: now You could get slopes that you can slide the Sun but also see saw Swinging claw dry bone shell on/off switch boom boom and parachutes.

902
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, boom boom.

903
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,671
Speaker 0: is the boss from Mario 3 the minivan?

904
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:39,172
Speaker 1: assume?

905
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:40,256
Speaker 1: the listener knows that.

906
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:40,778
Speaker 0: I hope so.

907
01:00:41,623 --> 01:00:47,235
Speaker 0: The on/off switch is the big one That people are using the most but the dry bone shell is really interesting.

908
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:48,520
Speaker 0: It lets you make lava levels.

909
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:54,096
Speaker 0: You can also play dead with the dry bone shell and like fall through spikes like spinning saw blades.

910
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:55,079
Speaker 0: You can all through them.

911
01:00:56,843 --> 01:00:58,555
Speaker 0: The seesaw is kind of interesting, right?

912
01:00:59,984 --> 01:01:00,486
Speaker 0: The slope.

913
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,677
Speaker 0: I actually utilize the slope in a clever way.

914
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:03,320
Speaker 0: the upslope.

915
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:10,145
Speaker 0: You're right people think about the downslope, but the upslope you can't run very fast up the true You can force.

916
01:01:10,185 --> 01:01:14,139
Speaker 0: you can sort of slow the player down with the upslope and put them in tricky situations.

917
01:01:16,984 --> 01:01:19,085
Speaker 0: But yeah The end is the angry.

918
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:20,389
Speaker 0: something is also the angry moon.

919
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:20,891
Speaker 0: actually.

920
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:23,540
Speaker 1: well that the moon lets you change day to night.

921
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,186
Speaker 0: No, no, no the angry moon.

922
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:28,417
Speaker 0: if you touch the angry moon, it destroys all enemies on screen.

923
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,068
Speaker 1: Oh I didn't even notice that I even notice that.

924
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,353
Speaker 0: right but the angry Sun is.

925
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:34,060
Speaker 0: the angry Sun from Mario 3 just kills you.

926
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,965
Speaker 0: Yep That's pretty fun.

927
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:39,500
Speaker 0: putting the angry Sun in places you normally wouldn't.

928
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:41,996
Speaker 0: There's also like these low gravity levels you can make.

929
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:45,874
Speaker 1: those are okay Yeah, or like water levels and you can mix like you can make weird broken crap.

930
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,264
Speaker 0: if you want water levels I don't see a lot of them.

931
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:54,627
Speaker 0: So if you want to make water levels, please do yeah water levels and like Flow based ice levels.

932
01:01:54,687 --> 01:01:54,948
Speaker 1: I don't.

933
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:58,570
Speaker 0: I made a flying fish style level sort of like, you know 2 - 3 from my.

934
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:05,478
Speaker 0: It couldn't exactly make the same kind of flying fish, but I put bridges and fish which is close enough.

935
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:20,420
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, if you like Mario and you're gonna actually play a lot of Mario or make Mario pay $60 for Mario maker If you're not gonna be just gonna play story mode or and that's it or you're not gonna play it a ton.

936
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,631
Speaker 0: $60 is too much and the price probably is never gonna go down.

937
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:26,939
Speaker 0: So then I wouldn't recommend it for you.

938
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,927
