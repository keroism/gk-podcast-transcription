1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,521
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 24th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,975
Speaker 1: We bring you our live panel about podcasting from Toricon 2006.

3
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,057
Speaker 2: let's do this.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,807
Speaker 1: So we're back and we're tired after a long weekend in Rochester.

5
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,873
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, I'm pretty tired.

6
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,044
Speaker 0: Yeah driving how much total driving did I do?

7
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,850
Speaker 0: like 600 something miles you drove?

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,160
Speaker 1: 640 miles plus the driving around Rochester.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,667
Speaker 0: Yeah grumble grumble.

10
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:41,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, screw you I once drove and I say this a lot, but I'm gonna say it again for the perp for all of our listeners out there.

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:50,010
Speaker 1: I once drove from Poughkeepsie Which is by New York City to Lansing, Michigan and then two days later drove from Lansing, Michigan to Wildwood, New Jersey.

12
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,449
Speaker 0: It's cuz you're stupid.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:01:03,509
Speaker 1: Actually was because I finished my co-op and I was technically with IBM and I was technically homeless for a month Not really a month like three weeks almost a month and I could have gone back wherever.

14
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:10,650
Speaker 1: instead I drove out to Michigan to see my family because I hadn't seen him in a while and my brother was going to college And I promised him I'd see him and I couldn't afford to fly.

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,189
Speaker 1: I was poor back then but I could afford to drive believe it or not.

16
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:18,629
Speaker 1: And then I went to Wildwood and lived there with our friend Scott Johnson at his beach house for the rest of the summer.

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you could afford to drive after you know, the repoed car.

18
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:31,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, well see that the repoed car was way when I didn't have money Had money if you didn't spend the driving around like an idiot.

19
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:32,630
Speaker 1: now the driving was real cheap.

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,806
Speaker 1: It was a lot cheaper than flying and I really couldn't not visit my family.

21
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:36,610
Speaker 1: I hadn't seen him in a while.

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,510
Speaker 0: Well, if it were the gas prices what it is now, you'd be in big trouble.

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,912
Speaker 1: You know what?

24
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,398
Speaker 1: The gas prices weren't what they are right now.

25
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:42,663
Speaker 1: In fact, they were quite low.

26
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:44,370
Speaker 0: Yeah now it's what I think.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,770
Speaker 0: It's a paid 312 today at the good gas station.

28
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:49,646
Speaker 1: Yeah now it probably would have been cheaper to fly.

29
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:56,410
Speaker 1: if My life as it occurred many years ago occurred in this today who would have thought that jet fuel would be cheaper than car fuel?

30
00:01:56,752 --> 00:02:00,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think is that the airline industry isn't doing so well on its own.

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:09,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, the jet blue price is actually going up not down but yeah, I got a real cheap flight out to an amazement Which I'm actually looking forward to quite a bit.

32
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,180
Speaker 0: When is that?

33
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:13,393
Speaker 1: Oh beginning of May middle of May sometime Maybe end of May.

34
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:13,956
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

35
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:14,960
Speaker 1: I got a plane ticket.

36
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,563
Speaker 1: So I'm going.

37
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,860
Speaker 1: I got to check and make sure and then We should go looking around.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,553
Speaker 0: Maybe there's like another convention We can go to.

39
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,530
Speaker 0: they're missing maybe like a gaming one or something in the nearby area.

40
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,477
Speaker 1: Well, we can hit kinetic on which I hear is really fun.

41
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,108
Speaker 0: Isn't it like July or something?

42
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:28,710
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,241
Speaker 1: It's not in my con repertoire.

44
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:35,330
Speaker 0: Yeah I pretty much I was like I've been like within a hair's distance of it.

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:45,270
Speaker 0: I think I was at the school with the summer camp the day of the con at one point And I saw like an Inagasha cosplay running around in the field, but I didn't go to the con at all.

46
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:46,475
Speaker 0: I just went home.

47
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:46,976
Speaker 1: Yep.

48
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:51,106
Speaker 1: I mean I go to a lot more cons than you but that's because I started early Like I got hooked.

49
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:59,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just you know I won't go very far put a lot of effort into a into a con unless it's Otacon unless I know.

50
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,904
Speaker 1: yeah Now you should probably come to Katsucon next year.

51
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:17,417
Speaker 1: It's really good Maybe but I digress cuz today's Monday and tech day and not anime day alright, but since our live show that we did at toricon was about podcasting and not about not Podcasting or anime.

52
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,270
Speaker 1: so much it fits, you know tech podcasting.

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,847
Speaker 0: Maybe we should have done a show about anime podcasts instead of I don't know.

54
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:27,144
Speaker 1: Oh, well Yeah, our audience seemed to like what we did.

55
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:38,834
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, so Newsy have in the news New York State had a bit recently and a lot of people are pricing the headline that you can't be fired for surfing the internet While you're at work.

56
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:42,510
Speaker 0: was this the guy who got fired by them by Bloomberg for playing solitaire?

57
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:43,630
Speaker 0: I don't know if I was different guys.

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,770
Speaker 0: I don't

59
00:03:43,791 --> 00:04:07,770
Speaker 1: know if it was him directly, but he is somewhat related to this that this issue came out partly because of him and basically the judge ruled in this suit that he was wrongfully fired the guy whoever the guy was because Surfing the internet and doing computer things is in this day and age no different From making a personal call while you're at work or reading the newspaper or hanging around the water cooler.

60
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:12,350
Speaker 0: But I thought that New York is one of those states so they can fire you for whatever any reason they want.

61
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:15,648
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They can except that one company still.

62
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,785
Speaker 1: If they're not if they could either give no reason at all or they can give a stated reason.

63
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:25,342
Speaker 1: usually there's a company policy and They'll say like we fired you because you broke corporate instruction 916.

64
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,328
Speaker 1: Don't masturbate to pornography in your office.

65
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:36,288
Speaker 0: Hello Well, they can't fire you for discriminatory reasons like you're too old or you're black or we don't like you because you're.

66
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,796
Speaker 1: though Here's a nice bit of trivia there.

67
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:43,350
Speaker 1: There is a list of protected classes and you cannot discriminate based on those classes.

68
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:50,293
Speaker 1: However, you can discriminate all you want openly to anyone that is not in one of those classes for any reason that has nothing to Do those classes?

69
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:59,857
Speaker 1: I don't remember them all but you cannot discriminate based on age gender race religion Sexual orientation, but not in all states.

70
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:04,433
Speaker 1: It's kind of stupid because some people are really backward and prejudice, but I digress Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:14,729
Speaker 1: However, it is perfectly okay to discriminate based on obesity body body odor Um certain types of appearance.

72
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:26,630
Speaker 1: It's complicated with appearance because you could discriminate against a guy who has say a tattoo of a spider across his face Yeah, but maybe not so much if he claimed that was part of his religion and gets all complicated at that point.

73
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,904
Speaker 0: You said to have a spider my face part of our religion.

74
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:30,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, haha.

75
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,420
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think I mean basically a company.

76
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,630
Speaker 1: if they're going to fire you they're going to fire you.

77
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:43,630
Speaker 0: I think that a company should be allowed to fire, you know, pretty much whoever they want for almost whatever they want.

78
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,709
Speaker 1: Yep, and it really is that way in New York.

79
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:50,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, some states it isn't but there aren't many non right-to-work states left in this country.

80
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,950
Speaker 1: the United States not.

81
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,220
Speaker 1: We have a lot of foreign listeners.

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,457
Speaker 1: I really got to not be so Us us us.

83
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like to know what it's like in other countries.

84
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,196
Speaker 0: Can people just fire anyone they want?

85
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,883
Speaker 0: or is it you know their laws about?

86
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,388
Speaker 1: we know how it is in France.

87
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,974
Speaker 1: Nah I mean, I love France.

88
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:10,004
Speaker 1: I'm some would consider me a Francophile, but god damn.

89
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,010
Speaker 1: That's not the thing to protest about.

90
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,157
Speaker 0: I mean if I could see the u.s.

91
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:20,568
Speaker 0: Writing like they're firing us for browsing the web and listen to the podcast.

92
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,150
Speaker 0: Let's a riot.

93
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:26,793
Speaker 1: No, we riot when football team loses For all.

94
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:27,214
Speaker 0: they're right.

95
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:28,479
Speaker 0: when the soccer team loses.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,764
Speaker 1: no, they're right thing they write.

97
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,997
Speaker 1: when their football team loses They play real football.

98
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,570
Speaker 0: Well, they just call soccer football and we call football football.

99
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,009
Speaker 1: Anyway football, I just think the news here is that we here's a judge who?

100
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,761
Speaker 1: Recognizes that the internet is not special.

101
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:56,489
Speaker 1: It's basically become as important and relevant to our lives as the telephone is.

102
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:58,936
Speaker 1: It's something you just.

103
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,189
Speaker 1: it's rare to see a judge who's on top of things.

104
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,958
Speaker 0: Let's find the name of that judge and try to.

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,545
Speaker 0: maybe he's a voted judge.

106
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:06,650
Speaker 0: We had might have to vote for him.

107
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:07,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

108
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,835
Speaker 1: if he'd be in a district where we could vote for him It might be a state judge or something.

109
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:11,256
Speaker 0: I don't know.

110
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:15,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but either way he should become a one-level-up judge.

111
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,218
Speaker 0: Give him a little green and white mushroom.

112
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:21,937
Speaker 1: Doo doo doo doo Yep, yeah, wait till my thing of the day tomorrow.

113
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:22,841
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:23,483
Speaker 0: Okay.

115
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:24,326
Speaker 0: All right.

116
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,150
Speaker 1: So what's your news?

117
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:33,910
Speaker 0: So there's a big news about this Convention in Vegas right now or recently for the National Association of broadcasters.

118
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,545
Speaker 0: hmm, those are like, you know the people who deal with the radio and TV broadcasting and and that shit.

119
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:55,090
Speaker 0: and Apparently a bunch of nerds went there and they came back with some stories and The biggest story apparently is this camera called the big red one or the big red camera or whatever.

120
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:55,667
Speaker 1: Is it red?

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,846
Speaker 0: No, but it on the front of it looks really wicked cool.

122
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:10,010
Speaker 0: Like wow all future II and shit Like there's a bunch of holes to mount stuff on it and it's really really professional like this is not something we will ever buy.

123
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:10,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, granted.

124
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,930
Speaker 1: We are not camera experts by any stretch.

125
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,844
Speaker 0: This is something for like movie crews and film studios and TV shows.

126
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,850
Speaker 1: I read us off the impressive part the specs.

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,866
Speaker 0: Okay Well at first of all The only thing read about it is that it has this red light on the front to make.

128
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,209
Speaker 0: that kind of makes it look like how.

129
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,878
Speaker 0: So I just want to get that across.

130
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,750
Speaker 1: so I'm sorry Dave I will not allow you to film yourself.

131
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,549
Speaker 1: I was gonna make a joke about masturbate.

132
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the DRM.

133
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:35,856
Speaker 0: is that this?

134
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:36,538
Speaker 0: how is in there?

135
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,131
Speaker 0: and if you try to videotape if you because this is a better quality Than your TV.

136
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:46,950
Speaker 0: So if you try to film your TV to copy the video house, like I will not allow you to violate the DMCA.

137
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,347
Speaker 1: That's not actually true.

138
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,309
Speaker 1: Yeah Just making sure.

139
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:57,363
Speaker 0: If it was I'd be great Just for the hilarity.

140
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:57,909
Speaker 0: Anyway.

141
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:04,610
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so there's a company called red digital cinema and the founder is the same guy who founded Oakley the sunglasses company.

142
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:06,314
Speaker 0: So that's what part I think.

143
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:12,070
Speaker 0: why the camera looks so cool is because you know, Oakley sunglasses look cool They ever tell everyone my law of sunglasses.

144
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,822
Speaker 1: You might have but it might not be a recent episode to go nuts.

145
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:20,329
Speaker 0: Oh, so the law just is a little Non sequitur little, you know tangent.

146
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:28,250
Speaker 0: You can go to the like a I don't know the free bins that the Lions have for sunglasses and get sunglasses for free.

147
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:32,227
Speaker 0: You can go to a flea market and get like $2 sunglasses.

148
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:38,577
Speaker 0: You can go to a rest stop and get $10 sunglasses or you can go to like, you know The sporting goods store.

149
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,129
Speaker 0: get Oakley's for like 200 bucks.

150
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:47,288
Speaker 0: You can go to like sunglass Hut and get ray-bans for like 500 bucks, right theoretically the sunglasses I have cannot be gotten for any price.

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,814
Speaker 0: Theoretically, yes.

152
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, I told that story.

153
00:09:50,201 --> 00:10:00,662
Speaker 0: So yeah, but The what reason that sunglasses cost more money isn't because you know a sunglass that cost $100 is any better than the $10 Sunglass.

154
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:09,669
Speaker 0: no, no No that the rule is that The more a sunglass cost the greater a percentage of the population will look good in them.

155
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:16,450
Speaker 0: For example the $5 sunglasses from the flea market only look good in a very specific type of old lady.

156
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:37,709
Speaker 0: The $10 sunglasses from the rest stop only look good on people like me and maybe people like, you know average-looking guys the hundred-dollar Oakley's look good on just about anyone who doesn't weigh more than 200 pounds and The $500 ray-bans look good on anyone with a human face.

157
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,435
Speaker 0: That's that's the reason.

158
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,130
Speaker 0: more expensive sunglasses are more expensive because they look good on anyone.

159
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, though don't don't forget that there is a line about below which sunglasses are not only cheap but dangerous.

160
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:58,890
Speaker 1: If you get like cheapo cheapo sunglasses, they're probably non polarized and they're probably not really protecting your eyes from UV rays.

161
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just talking about the price to look good ratio I don't.

162
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:05,390
Speaker 0: we're not talking about the quality of the lens and its sun protection or any of that.

163
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,718
Speaker 1: Are you ever hear of a sunglass called blue blockers?

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Speaker 0: No.

165
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,062
Speaker 1: All right.

166
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,430
Speaker 1: I have a story about blue blockers that I'll say for another day.

167
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,257
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's the law of sunglasses.

168
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:17,574
Speaker 0: because just because the guy who founded Oakley founded this camera company Let's get to the camera.

169
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,986
Speaker 0: The camera is an HD digital camera a video.

170
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,756
Speaker 0: it can record 11.4 megapixel.

171
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,282
Speaker 0: now I have a. what like a is it?

172
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,686
Speaker 0: it's not even 10.

173
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,511
Speaker 0: It's like a 5 or 6.

174
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:33,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, the camera in my phone is a 1.4 megapixel.

175
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, so My can my digital camera.

176
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:39,922
Speaker 0: you can go to my flicker.

177
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,329
Speaker 0: actually this toricon photos there.

178
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:47,049
Speaker 0: Not many not many though cuz I suck and I don't use my camera enough that I spent so much money on.

179
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:54,181
Speaker 0: cuz I don't Want to be like a photo guy anyway And you can see is a pretty damn good camera like really high resolution pictures.

180
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:55,665
Speaker 0: This is 11.4 megapixels.

181
00:11:55,705 --> 00:12:03,364
Speaker 0: Holy shit, and it can take 11.4 megapixel pictures.

182
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:08,862
Speaker 0: a second 60s like 60 FPS is holy shit.

183
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:15,690
Speaker 0: considering TV is what like 32 Movies are like nothing.

184
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:20,347
Speaker 0: So that's like holy crap pictures of digital.

185
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:25,166
Speaker 1: now I think the really amazing thing here is the cost compared to those specs.

186
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

187
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,835
Speaker 0: So you have this amazing amazing camera that takes like the most beautiful HD imagery ever.

188
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:39,790
Speaker 0: it also comes with you know, the amazing sensor that lets this happen and You know storage to store all that crazy video and all this shit.

189
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:54,236
Speaker 0: Now normally according to I don't know this because I'm not a camera guy But according to these professional camera guys who went there something like this they expect it to cost, you know $250,000 $200,000 something in the house range, you know get a house for $200,000 got bad.

190
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I wear all over the place the cheapest house anywhere near us is at least half a million.

191
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,117
Speaker 0: That's a really fancy house.

192
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,746
Speaker 0: No, no, that's like a four-bedroom or five-bedroom house.

193
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:14,110
Speaker 1: You realize that There's a housing development right near us that has crap.

194
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:18,525
Speaker 1: Oh like subdivision houses the same houses you see in any subdivision suburb anywhere.

195
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:19,950
Speaker 1: six seven hundred thousand.

196
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:21,517
Speaker 0: Well, that's just nuts.

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no cheap houses here.

198
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:26,343
Speaker 1: I would kill if this house cost two hundred thousand right now that we're living in.

199
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,030
Speaker 1: I'd buy it in a second.

200
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,998
Speaker 0: There are two hundred thousand dollar houses.

201
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:30,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, not here.

202
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,275
Speaker 0: Anyway now where we live That's not the point.

203
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,843
Speaker 0: The point is is that two hundred thousand dollars is like a house price.

204
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,861
Speaker 0: this camera costs Car price.

205
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:41,630
Speaker 0: we're talking $17,500.

206
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:49,621
Speaker 1: Yeah, like definitely not low budget But definitely not high budget like by any means.

207
00:13:49,742 --> 00:14:00,050
Speaker 0: in other words if you were setting up Take to make a movie a digital movie and you know, you're gonna use film You just buy a whole shit ton of these instead of buying one of the normal cameras.

208
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:07,609
Speaker 0: yeah, or if you're gonna make I don't know a Really professional video podcast just scoop one of these babies up.

209
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:08,813
Speaker 0: You know.

210
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:13,870
Speaker 1: nice easy independent houses art houses little film houses.

211
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:18,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna see independent movies looking a lot better if this thing isn't fake.

212
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:27,381
Speaker 1: now I'll point out that there is one big problem with that is that When you have a camera that high quality and you're recording at that high quality The all the other factors become a lot more important.

213
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:36,990
Speaker 1: now the makeup has to be a lot better The lighting has to be a lot better Thing and the framing have to be a lot better, but at the same time couldn't you know, I'm not a I'm not an expert.

214
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,850
Speaker 1: So yeah, I know what you're gonna say because I was just thinking that as I was saying since your image is so perfect Can you just bring it back down?

215
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I figure you could just compress it back down and then all the mistakes go away.

216
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,381
Speaker 0: But then you have a really high quality source material to work with.

217
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,510
Speaker 1: Yep, because I know that's how we do it with audio.

218
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:59,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I think this thing's like a 30 millimeter lens, but you can buy a 300 millimeter lens for $5,000.

219
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,330
Speaker 1: Now, of course, there's a tiny chance that this is semi vaporware.

220
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently like it was locked in a cage and shit.

221
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,169
Speaker 0: So no one would mess around with it.

222
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:28,653
Speaker 0: But the pictures of it look wicked awesome and if it's real expect awesome things to start showing up in Independent movie theaters and TV shows and all sorts of stuff expect a lot more HDTV Things of the day.

223
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:34,649
Speaker 1: now many of people who know us realize that we're not particularly into that whole alcohol thing.

224
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,133
Speaker 0: No alcohol not so good Poison.

225
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:44,729
Speaker 1: very few of us drink at all and even the ones who drink I mean, I enjoy wine a lot and things like that.

226
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:57,878
Speaker 1: But we our group of friends really doesn't get into that whole standing there holding a red solo cup Culture yeah, and anything, you know more or Somewhat less or sideways from alcohol.

227
00:15:57,938 --> 00:15:58,580
Speaker 2: No one does.

228
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,962
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone smokes weed or smokes or no one we're really friends with currently does any drugs.

229
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:11,623
Speaker 1: a few people did in the past and Interesting stories as a result, but drugs are bad and gay.

230
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,810
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I mean, I enjoy alcohol.

231
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,905
Speaker 1: I really like wine and sake and that sort of thing now.

232
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:20,643
Speaker 1: I Really don't like dealing with people who are drunk.

233
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,925
Speaker 2: I Don't like being drunk.

234
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,920
Speaker 0: Of course I've never been drunk because I don't drink.

235
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,549
Speaker 0: but yeah, I know I don't like it.

236
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:33,666
Speaker 1: I've been drunk and there's a level of drunkenness that is fun and it is not very much drunkenness because beyond that it is not fun.

237
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,684
Speaker 0: If I'm eating no good, yeah, I mean you vomited everyone's vomited.

238
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,329
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not nice.

239
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:47,192
Speaker 0: So why don't vomit if you if you vomited on by accident or because he ate something bad or because you were sick with like The flu.

240
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:57,235
Speaker 1: Yeah now don't do it on purpose and more importantly don't do to yourself What the guy in the video that is my thing of the day did Don't want to be this guy.

241
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,743
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm never gonna be that guy.

242
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:10,560
Speaker 1: I mean god damn it's funny Because this guy's drunk and he can't stand up and some kid has like a handicam and he's just filming it and The guy just can't stand up.

243
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:11,426
Speaker 1: He's so drunk.

244
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess not being able to stand up is a little better than vomiting.

245
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:28,263
Speaker 0: I imagine whoever he is already vomited copiously Perhaps but perhaps he is such an old Disgruntled drunken hobo that he doesn't vomit anymore.

246
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:32,221
Speaker 1: Haha It just kind of oozes out of him and turns into those clothes.

247
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:34,470
Speaker 1: Hobos wear exactly not hobos winos.

248
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:36,615
Speaker 1: Some hobos are cool.

249
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:39,185
Speaker 2: I think hobos technically are the people who do work.

250
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,290
Speaker 0: So I don't think he was a hobo.

251
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,993
Speaker 2: I think he's a bum.

252
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:43,502
Speaker 1: I think he was just like, uh, you know what?

253
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,589
Speaker 1: He's probably a former college frat guy.

254
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:51,962
Speaker 0: He ended up homeless, how do you go from college to homeless?

255
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,286
Speaker 1: alcohol?

256
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:58,180
Speaker 1: Oh Pund Yeah, I mean definitely we're not prohibitionists.

257
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,546
Speaker 1: We're not against alcohol.

258
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,289
Speaker 1: I hate him.

259
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,694
Speaker 1: Yeah freedom random.

260
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:07,895
Speaker 1: But uh, yeah, if you're like this guy, I'm not going to help you off the street Nor will I respect you?

261
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:08,737
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:15,615
Speaker 0: Yeah or possibly even talk to you or recognize your existence as a worthwhile Living organism.

263
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:20,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, the the the bacteria on my foot might get more respect.

264
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,438
Speaker 1: Perhaps bacteria are dangerous little bastards.

265
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:25,906
Speaker 0: They are they are they don't get drunk.

266
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:26,407
Speaker 0: They're smart.

267

Speaker 2: Yep Not getting drunk.

268
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:33,590
Speaker 0: All right, so I'm sure everyone has played the types of video games.

269
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,117
Speaker 0: You know where you walk sideways.

270
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,182
Speaker 0: and yeah, you beat things up.

271
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:42,150
Speaker 1: Final Fight River City Ransom Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and 3 and Streets of Rage Simpsons.

00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,092
Speaker 0: Oh, isn't it 6?

275
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,190
Speaker 0: It was four for the little one and six for the big.

276
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just the one with two screens.

277
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,570
Speaker 1: that's right and a bunch of nerds with a pile of quarters.

278
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:57,938
Speaker 0: I think there was also a cheap for the cheap.

279
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,905
Speaker 2: arcades had the four-person version.

280
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,209
Speaker 2: We had to crowd around one TV.

281
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one wasn't so good.

282
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,756
Speaker 0: Anyway Some guy made an animation.

283
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:13,598
Speaker 0: It appears to be that he made it with flash, but it's an MPEG if you download it and He created it.

284
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:14,142
Speaker 0: What is this?

285
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:15,410
Speaker 0: an animated short?

286
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,380
Speaker 0: Which is just like one of those games.

287
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,424
Speaker 1: only it's not a game.

288
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,046
Speaker 0: it's not.

289
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,070

Speaker 0: or is it super ever had a battle street fight 2006?

294

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, this I didn't know.

296
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,830
Speaker 0: I Was told the name of this and then I said this better live up to the name.

297
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:59,031
Speaker 1: Yes, two of our listeners sent me links to this last night But since I was dead from Tarakhan I hadn't even looked at him yet and then I Scott showed this to me and then I realized that that's what you'd link me To.

298
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:03,330
Speaker 0: yeah, everyone had seen this already probably while we were away for the weekend.

299
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,909
Speaker 0: But yeah, I would have probably seen it yesterday if I was home.

300
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:14,447
Speaker 0: But you know, we wouldn't do a show till Monday anyway, and even if everyone's seen it This is just so good that even if one person out there has not seen this yet.

00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:14,929
Speaker 2: They got to go.

302
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:26,243

Speaker 0: walk sideways beat-em-up games.

313
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:10,450
Speaker 0: there's a lot of things in here that are total cliches like the video screen in the back with the repeating image of the villain and You know the way the bosses work and the weapons and the special it.

314
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:21,278
Speaker 0: There's a really the thing that keeps you going because it would get kind of boring but they keep doing different special attacks that are all humorous in some way and The graphics are really authentic.

315
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:31,736
Speaker 0: if if monochrome it is definitely an homage Super homage, I mean you'll even notice stuff in there like the Megaman octopus and Such and the Christopher Walken.

316
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,043
Speaker 1: Oh Christopher Walken my hero.

00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,782
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of cowbell in this game too much cowbell.

320
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:47,526
Speaker 1: In fact, so moving on to the main bit We're actually going to play since we realized that we went to torque on over the weekend.

321
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:50,964
Speaker 1: as we've said many times I know I didn't just realize that I went to torque on.

322
00:21:51,045 --> 00:22:00,070
Speaker 1: I realized that The show we recorded live in front of a real audience at torque on Had nothing to do with anime and we basically just talked about podcasting.

323
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so why would we play it on Thursday when we have plenty of things to talk about on Thursday?

324
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,057
Speaker 0: I mean Wednesday as a boat.

325
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:11,554
Speaker 0: Yeah as opposed to Monday when we don't have Ideas awesome.

326
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:17,410
Speaker 1: So I suppose without further ado here it is our live show from torque on entirely unedited.

327
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:18,788
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

Speaker 1: Well, I'm doing a show.

336
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,550
Speaker 1: Katsu khan found out that we were there last year.

337
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:53,629
Speaker 1: We are now guests of katsu khan next year and we're gonna be running part of the video game room possibly Yep, so at least we got a show going there.

338
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:58,010
Speaker 2: Yeah, and all the other conventions that we may or may not go to as we desire.

339
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, uh, we do a podcast.

340
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,750
Speaker 1: now at any you listen to podcasts.

341
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,307
Speaker 1: Any idea what a podcast is?

342
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,050
Speaker 1: ever heard the word podcast?

343
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:15,610
Speaker 1: alright a Podcast is basically just internet radio, which has been around for a long time only done.

344
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:18,189
Speaker 1: Well, it actually works and a lot of people are starting to use it.

345
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,910
Speaker 2: Yeah in the olden days you've wanted to listen to radio on the internet.

346
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,215
Speaker 2: it was pretty much streaming.

347
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:27,929
Speaker 2: you had to go at the time they were talking and push a button and Who knows if it would work or not?

348
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,963
Speaker 2: It was real media and the quality was low and you couldn't hear anything.

349
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:32,926
Speaker 2: Sometimes it wouldn't even work.

350
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:35,924
Speaker 1: It was just terrible Yeah, and it really didn't take off at all.

351
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:43,517
Speaker 1: So Apple and their infinite wisdom decided to push this thing called podcasting which when I heard about it I thought it sounded stupid because I didn't really understand it.

352
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:47,570
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was actually not invented by Apple is the actual technology behind.

353
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,083
Speaker 2: It was made by some other people a little earlier, but no one cares.

354
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:51,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has very little to do.

355
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,416
Speaker 1: You don't need an iPod.

356
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,242
Speaker 1: You don't need iTunes.

357
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,249
Speaker 1: Don't even need to like Apple.

358
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,917
Speaker 2: You just need a computer.

359
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,549
Speaker 1: all it is is syndicated audio or even video.

360
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:11,366
Speaker 1: basically You subscribe to a feed which we could talk on length about that and then anytime whatever the feed is updates you get the mp3 File or whatever file it is automatically downloaded to whatever computer mp3 player you have.

361
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,733
Speaker 1: so gig nights We are four nights a week.

362
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:18,689
Speaker 1: So every weeknight a new gig nights episode appears around midnight one depending on when we finish.

363
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:25,669
Speaker 2: Yet, so it's really just mp3s that you download that someone makes it's really all it is.

364
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:33,582
Speaker 2: Yes with a fancy name with the word pod in it in to make it Harder to get people to listen because they think oh I need an iPod.

365
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:34,987
Speaker 2: No, you don't need an iPod.

366
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:40,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean some of the big podcasts have what 50 60 thousand listeners.

367
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,736
Speaker 2: I think there's some company.

368
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,730
Speaker 2: they said their goal is to get like 500 million total podcast listeners in the world.

369
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,910
Speaker 2: I don't know how close they are to getting that but there's a whole lot of people.

370
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:55,769
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I'd really say that I mean you all know the webcomic boom how mega Tokyo got popular and Exploded and then webcomics exploded.

371
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:02,510
Speaker 1: Podcasts are probably about a year or two right before where mega Tokyo and all that was before webcomics exploded.

372
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,329
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a niche market and it's gonna explode one day.

373
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:11,490
Speaker 2: It's like when it first came about, you know, some people got into it and then iTunes actually implemented podcast support.

374
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:24,050
Speaker 2: So then it exploded some more and now it's kind of gradually growing as like real companies make Podcasts like penny arcade just came out with one that like jumped to number 12. that beats out like ESPN and stuff.

375
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:24,895
Speaker 1: It's Penn Jillette.

376
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,424
Speaker 1: if Penn & Teller has a podcast.

377
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,370
Speaker 1: That's fairly awesome.

378
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,970
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he does like a real radio show one hour every day every weekday.

379
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:38,644
Speaker 2: So he just he got his radio company to start putting those on the internet and he took the ads out Which makes it a lot more pleasant to listen to.

380
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,716
Speaker 1: yep now I mean, it's basically like radio.

381
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:41,862
Speaker 1: Usually it's talk radio.

382
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 1: A lot of people do techno or music.

383
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,341
Speaker 1: There's actually a lot of good music out there like normal radio.

384
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,810
Speaker 1: They'll play techno from South Africa or something cool like that.

385
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,634
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's one.

386
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:53,150
Speaker 2: My favorite podcast is what I think it's Derek the Bandit Sound Republic.

387
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,349
Speaker 2: All it is is electronic music from South Africa.

388
00:25:55,892 --> 00:26:06,010
Speaker 2: This guy's in Johannesburg South Africa taking his techno music and other people's techno music and like every once in a while He makes one big mp3 of it and you get it automatically and then you listen in the car.

389
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,126
Speaker 1: It's great And I mean a lot of the content is creative commons or free or there's no copyright involved.

390
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,990
Speaker 1: so you can just play it Share it whatever and the artists really don't care.

391
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:22,610
Speaker 2: Yeah You get in big trouble if you put like real music like if I went and got like the Beatles music and put in my Podcast and they found out I get sued sued sued sued.

392
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:26,864
Speaker 2: So what you do is there's all these musical artists who are you know independent?

393
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:37,260
Speaker 2: Maybe they're really local to one area and To get you know their music out there in the world is they say hey everyone if you want to podcast my music go for It and it's called pod safe music and that's what most people use.

394
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:40,913
Speaker 2: because then you won't get sued and you help out some independent Artists somewhere.

395
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean we don't play music.

396
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,210
Speaker 1: I don't listen to any of the music podcast.

397
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,489
Speaker 1: We just do a talk show get nights a late-night talk show for geeks.

398
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:53,540
Speaker 1: Think like the late show or late night with whoever whoever only with us.

399
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,599
Speaker 2: And Not so often is there a guest?

400
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, every now and then we get guests.

401
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:02,166
Speaker 1: We really haven't had any big guests yet Though we've had some big names.

402
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,160
Speaker 1: agree to future interviews?

403
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:08,473
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the technology really behind interviews is a little tricky sometimes.

404
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can answer anything like that in questions.

405
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,619
Speaker 1: I don't know how much you care about the technical details of trying to interview someone far off in a way.

406
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:18,099
Speaker 1: Though our best guest so far was how many of you know Mike Pfeffer?

407
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,859
Speaker 1: Alright, how many of you know Jewish wolf would?

408
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:23,650
Speaker 2: Jewish would is Mike Pfeffer.

409
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:27,343
Speaker 1: He doesn't like to be known as Jewish wolf would It actually?

410
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:30,296
Speaker 1: he asked us specifically not to refer to him as Jewish wolf would be

411
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:30,577
Speaker 2: referred

412
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:31,180
Speaker 0: to him as Jewish

413
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,475
Speaker 2: Wolf would only once in the recorded part of the show.

414
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,633
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, we decided to do this partly because we went to RIT.

415
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:39,355
Speaker 1: We both graduated.

416
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:41,160
Speaker 1: I ran this anime club for three years.

417
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,184
Speaker 1: I Founded the cosplay.

418
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:48,319
Speaker 1: that happened right this time the year before Tora Khan was founded the next year by the president after me.

419
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,104
Speaker 1: So we've been around a while.

420
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:54,439
Speaker 1: we both graduated all our friends graduated and we always talked about doing a radio show.

421
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,531
Speaker 1: Well, well friends talked about.

422
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:05,625
Speaker 1: our original idea was a little different Yeah But it was basically we would sit around and talk and people who didn't know us would laugh a lot At the things we said.

423
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:06,629
Speaker 2: looking at some people out there.

424
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they were just it was hysterical to them.

425
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,658
Speaker 1: We couldn't figure out why and people always said you should just record yourselves do a radio show.

426
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 2: So one day, you know when I got my little nano You know actually used iTunes because the stupid work laptop with windows.

427
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:20,924
Speaker 2: Yeah, we don't use windows.

428
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:25,581
Speaker 2: But you know, I discovered how look I'll actually try this podcasting thing and I was like You know what?

429
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:27,991
Speaker 2: It's real easy to make one of these damn podcasts.

430
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:28,914
Speaker 2: Let's freakin do it.

431
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,865
Speaker 1: Yep, and shit talk I love audio and all that stuff.

432
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:36,160
Speaker 1: So I immediately went out and bought a bunch of professional equipment and it's not that professional.

433
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:40,120
Speaker 1: I mean as professional as we're ever gonna get unless we get syndicated by someone with money.

434
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,098
Speaker 2: It's as professional as pretty much anyone needs.

435
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:48,914
Speaker 2: Yeah Yeah, so if you want to make a podcast which you might or might not want to do depending.

436
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:54,000
Speaker 2: all you really need like minimum Is a microphone and a computer an Apple computer?

437
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,040
Speaker 2: It makes it a lot easier if you don't know about technology because then you can use garage band garage band.

438
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,651
Speaker 1: Hit a button your podcast appears in iTunes.

439
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:10,320
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's dead stupid If you have an Apple computer, if you don't have an Apple computer, it's a little bit trickier, but whatever.

440
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,520
Speaker 1: But there are a lot of podcasts out there that are just like one dude ranting about Linux or one, dude.

441
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,865
Speaker 1: There's a podcast for everything.

442
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:17,809
Speaker 1: What was the weird one?

443
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,580
Speaker 1: We found it was a South African housing market.

444
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:21,824
Speaker 2: No, that was the Australian.

445
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,689
Speaker 2: There's an Australian real estate podcast.

446
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,942
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a very popular podcast only about knitting like Knitting.

447
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:34,260
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's it's old ladies talking about knitting and knitting techniques and all this or their freaking radio shows about everything.

448
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,732
Speaker 2: There's one where it's just independent music from Scotland.

449
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,920
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's very very popular.

450
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,226
Speaker 1: It'll make you feel really rich.

451
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,560
Speaker 1: It's this guy and he summarizes the New York Times for you every day.

452
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,364
Speaker 2: Well, it's actually yet.

453
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:48,040
Speaker 2: That's actually made by the New York Times.

454
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,582
Speaker 2: It's a new.

455
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:53,280
Speaker 2: it's an official New York Times podcast and the guy summarizes the front page of every second.

456
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,559
Speaker 1: You've got like a little butler sitting there just reading it to you while you're having your morning coffee.

457
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,320
Speaker 2: The onion radio news is also pretty good.

458
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:08,038
Speaker 2: This guy comes on with like a two-minute podcast every day Just reading like the headline of an onion story in a quick summary and it's much funnier than reading the actual onion.

459
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,319
Speaker 1: because yes The onions I guess is degraded over the years.

460
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:18,520
Speaker 1: Yeah Now they're also videocast which are the same just with video Except it's a lot harder to do video for reasons that a lot of our IT students probably know very well.

461
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,236
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of the popular video podcasts a ninja ask a ninja has a ninja.

462
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,240
Speaker 2: ask a ninja is hilarious.

463
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:27,156
Speaker 1: If any of you've never heard of ask a ninja I recommend checking them out.

464
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:27,839
Speaker 2: ask a ninja calm.

465
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,146
Speaker 1: It's a dude dressed up like a ninja answering questions.

466
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:30,808
Speaker 2: That's it.

467
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,195
Speaker 1: Like ask a ninja.

468
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,078
Speaker 1: How do you kill someone?

469
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:38,299
Speaker 2: Well How fast do you want me to kill them and how painfully you know?

470
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,598
Speaker 2: I look forward to killing you soon.

471
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:50,814
Speaker 2: Yeah But now that homestar runner actually converted to like video podcast format now so you can just subscribe to strong bads email Whenever there's a new strong bad email just it shows up and you watch it.

472
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:51,899
Speaker 2: You don't have to do anything.

473
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:54,954
Speaker 2: You don't have to visit homestar runner every damn day now.

474
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,864
Speaker 1: We'd like to talk a lot about the show We do now.

475
00:30:56,984 --> 00:31:02,820
Speaker 1: I mean we're recording this now and we're gonna put it on the air next Wednesday on anime day Wednesday Wednesday night.

476
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,066
Speaker 2: So it's really Thursday for normal people unless you sit up all night and wait and then it like around midnight 1 a.m Just there.

477
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:13,600
Speaker 1: it is because that was the big idea We had is every podcast updates like Monday morning and it's usually once a week.

478
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:18,118
Speaker 1: So we update at night and you know, it's a late show, but those shows are recorded like Sunday at 11 a.m.

479
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,392
Speaker 1: So we actually record at night mostly because we have jobs and we're lazy.

480
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:29,634
Speaker 2: Yeah, so while our show we say Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night Thursday night It's really Tuesday morning Wednesday morning Thursday morning Friday.

481
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:37,989
Speaker 1: Oh some of our fans I sit there and I'm doing post-production late at night and suddenly right around midnight when I start getting messages Hey, the show's not up yet something wrong.

482
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,239
Speaker 1: Hey, where's my show?

483
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,560
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but actually we're pretty consistent.

484
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,143
Speaker 1: We've missed what one show or something cuz I was at it missed one other show because I screwed up and deleted it after we Recorded it.

485
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,271
Speaker 2: That's right.

486
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,338
Speaker 0: You forget.

487
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:58,387
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, well we did another show But actually that's the worst we lost.

488
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:06,117
Speaker 2: we lost half the show and what we did is we put the half the show we still Had up on the internet and then we put a sorry rim deleted it thing in the other half.

489
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,807
Speaker 1: cuz honestly I mean we just talk and talk and talk.

490
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:14,379
Speaker 1: but imagine if you had to do something like taught to give a speech on the fly And then you had to give it again.

491
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:16,980
Speaker 1: You really don't have the energy to say the same things.

492
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,571
Speaker 1: Like if I crack a joke, I can't crack the same joke again.

493
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,479
Speaker 1: And if I try it just sounds stupid.

494
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:24,780
Speaker 1: So if we lose an episode, we're just done we cry and go to sleep.

495
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,540
Speaker 2: It's our podcast really isn't scripted or written like beforehand so we can't just read it again.

496
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:39,895
Speaker 2: It's you know We just bring up whatever topic it is and then we just talk and then if we've already had the discussion How can we have the same discussion again and have it be so genuine?

497
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:41,160
Speaker 2: It would just be us going.

498
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:43,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep.

499
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:54,832
Speaker 1: So uh, so yeah, that's so we actually force ourselves to not talk about things We're gonna talk about on the show like if there's news about I don't know Microsoft CEO kills Someone and a baby ninja.

500
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:56,160
Speaker 1: I don't know something crazy.

501
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:00,400
Speaker 1: We acknowledge that the news exists, but we won't talk about it till we turn the mics on at night.

502
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:04,019
Speaker 2: We usually what we talked about before is we'll be like, alright Do we want to do this one or that one?

503
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,267
Speaker 2: You know because it's really hard to pick two news stories a day because some days there's like 20 news stories And it's like oh my god, which two are the best.

504
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:13,080
Speaker 2: and some days is like all this news is boring as hell.

505
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, the news that other people that was important people bothers about it until we talk about it.

506
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:20,201
Speaker 1: Yeah like to no end Mmm.

507
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,360
Speaker 1: now we really could talk a lot about how we do the show and the show itself.

508
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:33,352
Speaker 1: But first before we get into that You guys have any questions about podcasting Podcasts everyone is you can come up here and get on the air with us if you like or you can just ask your question And we'll do our thing.

509
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:36,957
Speaker 1: Why don't you?

510
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,122
Speaker 1: we had a mic right here?

511
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:39,589
Speaker 1: We're we're on ball run the ball.

512
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,309
Speaker 0: So I was wondering how long?

513
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,149
Speaker 1: between when you record your?

514
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,950
Speaker 2: Well, okay for us it's different than most people.

515
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,027
Speaker 2: Yeah, we pretty much record it and then rim starts editing it and then he puts it on the internet that night.

516
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,498
Speaker 1: Yep Well, it most podcast.

517
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:08,900
Speaker 1: they'll record over the course of like four hours and they'll do like a show once a week or once a month and then they'll spend hours and hours editing and cutting down until They make like this thing that they can put up.

518
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,690
Speaker 1: We really don't edit.

519
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:14,860
Speaker 1: What do you hear is exactly what we said cutting out like when Scott burps.

520
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,965
Speaker 2: do we cut out burps coughs?

521
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:23,554
Speaker 2: Um, like um, like Yeah, those are big long pauses Anything like that.

522
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,303
Speaker 2: we cut out, but we don't cut out anything.

523
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:26,630
Speaker 2: we say that's English words.

524
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,393
Speaker 1: Now it used to.

525
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,670
Speaker 1: when we first started it took me about two hours to do the post-production.

526
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:40,562
Speaker 1: I mean I had to run all these filters dynamic range compression and normalization, which if anyone wants to know I can go to Excruciating painful detail about and then we bought this machine.

527
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:44,177
Speaker 1: Yes, then we bought this machine here Which took all that out of the equation.

528
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,547
Speaker 1: so now and now I've gotten good at editing.

529
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:54,453
Speaker 1: it takes about 20 minutes total and that includes the time it takes to encode it to mp3 on my slow ass computer that I bought six and Years ago, yeah

530
00:34:54,493 --> 00:35:05,910
Speaker 2: right now the major things that take a lot of time are his slow ass computer and uploading the file and then waiting for the stupid Hosting company to get the file and get it properly set up and then typing up the notes for the show.

531
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:08,769
Speaker 2: So yeah, that's the hard part which isn't hard.

532
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,130
Speaker 1: Normally just we do four shows a week Which is kind of crazy like we have more episodes than friggin any other podcast out there with a few exceptions.

533
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,142
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are podcasts that are like old way older than us.

534
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,471
Speaker 2: how long we've been going since I got since over of 2005?

535
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,478
Speaker 1: it's over 2005 four nights a week.

536
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,409
Speaker 1: So we've got 97 episodes up plus the 11 beta episodes that none of you will ever hear.

537
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:36,530
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're never gonna hear those but their podcast been going since like 2004 which is when it really started.

538
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,250
Speaker 2: But they have like a hundred episodes maybe even less.

539
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,676
Speaker 2: There's something like 20 episodes.

540
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,243
Speaker 2: you do one a month or something like that.

541
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:43,870
Speaker 2: We already we're coming up on a hundred.

542
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:45,261
Speaker 2: Yeah, what number is this one?

543
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:46,410
Speaker 1: This is gonna be 90.

544
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,478
Speaker 1: Well, this is gonna be 101 cuz it'll be later.

545
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:48,658
Speaker 1: Yeah.

546
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,990
Speaker 1: All right any questions anyone you want to come up you wanna.

547
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:56,050
Speaker 1: So we've got Kate here who's walking up toward the state.

548
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,250
Speaker 1: I don't wanna have dead air cuz that means I have to cut it out later.

549
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:01,382
Speaker 1: I really hate having to edit so I try to avoid it at all cost.

550
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:01,784
Speaker 1: Yes.

551
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:03,210
Speaker 1: It's on just talk unless she turned it off.

552
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,129
Speaker 1: Is there any subject that's completely off-limits?

553
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:14,861
Speaker 1: considering the episode we did last Thursday, you know Here's the thing about aim and nothing is out of bounds.

554
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:15,987
Speaker 2: well at least for us.

555
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:18,723
Speaker 2: you see the thing about Podcasting is there's no rating system.

556
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,710
Speaker 2: There's no nothing like that.

557
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:28,440
Speaker 2: But on iTunes specifically there's this explicit tag and you can't really it sucks because you can't put in a split Explicit tag on just one episode.

558
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,427
Speaker 2: your I your podcast is either explicit Which means it's really dirty and you talk about sex and drugs and violence and God knows what.

559
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,090
Speaker 1: there are a lot of.

560
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,136
Speaker 2: There are quite a few.

561
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:40,785
Speaker 2: that sees there does a Nazi podcast out there?

562
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:42,310
Speaker 1: wait Nazi is a neo-nazi.

563
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,383
Speaker 2: No, as in it's a yelling white supremacist guy.

564
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:48,366
Speaker 2: Oh Yeah, and everyone like demanded he'd be taken off a bunch of lists.

565
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:49,130
Speaker 2: It's a crazy story.

566
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,042
Speaker 2: Anyway, there are other podcasts which are just nothing.

567
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:58,066
Speaker 2: they're playing which means they might say shit They might say whatever but you know, they were rated between pg-13 and our.

568
00:36:58,247 --> 00:36:58,990
Speaker 2: yeah for our show.

569
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,564
Speaker 2: Yeah Um, but other shows, you know, we're just mostly normal.

570
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:08,990
Speaker 2: now if your show is guaranteed You're never gonna curse, you know, you're gonna bleep out all the bad stuff.

571
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,918
Speaker 2: You're gonna cut out anything little kids shouldn't hear.

572
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,950
Speaker 2: you can put a clean tag on it and that can't put the clean tag.

573
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,570
Speaker 2: We can't put the clean tag, but we don't put the explicit tag either.

574
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,429
Speaker 1: It's like a magic word.

575
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,415
Speaker 2: Yeah, you see it's not.

576
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:27,542
Speaker 2: if you put on a real radio show the FCC can come down and you like a ton of bricks If you say fuck.

577
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:33,790
Speaker 2: Oh But if you just put an mp3 somewhere for people to download what are they gonna do to you?

578
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,959
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can say whatever the hell you want now.

579
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,843
Speaker 1: I mean it is geek nights.

580
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:37,225
Speaker 1: We're geeks.

581
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:38,350
Speaker 1: We talk about geekery.

582
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:46,682
Speaker 1: so we basically broke it up into four like days of the week and the scary thing is that each one of our days is Pretty much a full-on podcast by itself.

583
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,150
Speaker 1: are like Mondays.

584
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,859
Speaker 1: We do science technology Linux all that sort of stuff.

585
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,009
Speaker 1: Tuesdays are gaming video gaming board games all that.

586
00:37:54,571 --> 00:38:01,441
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are anime and manga and comics and despite the fact that it's just one day of the week for us It's pretty much the biggest anime podcast out there.

587
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,090
Speaker 2: Well, it's not the biggest one out.

588
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, we shuffle between number one number two and number three on Yahoo podcasts for anime.

589
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,770
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yahoo podcasts are just a little sketchy, but another good one.

590
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,357
Speaker 1: I'll recommend them right now and give them a shout out.

591
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,210
Speaker 1: anime world order is really good anime world order.

592
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:19,989
Speaker 2: These people like they're older school fans than we are and they're a little fanboy and fangirl.

593
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,150
Speaker 1: ish.

594
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:24,083
Speaker 2: But at the same time they know everything.

595
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:29,180
Speaker 2: like we did an episode about Lupin and We pretty much got everything wrong except Zenigata.

596
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:38,358
Speaker 2: So the guy sends me this giant email telling me Excruciating details about every other character and all this stuff that we missed and I was like, okay You guys know everything about anime is to know.

597
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,105
Speaker 1: now Thursdays.

598
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:41,510
Speaker 1: We decide we couldn't come up with anything.

599
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,689
Speaker 1: So we decided it's like special topics, which means whatever the hell we want to talk about.

600
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:47,449
Speaker 1: Usually we rant about things.

601
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,179
Speaker 1: Sometimes we do interesting things like last Thursday.

602
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of our most popular Thursdays were like toys of our youth.

603
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:57,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, that episode has been linked to more than other than with one exception is our most linked to episode.

604
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,116
Speaker 2: Yeah, TV shows of our youth.

605
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:00,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked about Thundercats once.

606
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,090
Speaker 2: how not to suck at college.

607
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:02,753
Speaker 2: How not to.

608
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:03,557
Speaker 2: that's one of our things.

609
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:04,280
Speaker 2: how not to suck.

610
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:06,069
Speaker 2: Yeah, how to not suck.

00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,275
Speaker 1: Right grammar captain.

00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:09,559
Speaker 2: grammar captain Graham.

613
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,780
Speaker 2: Mr.

00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,864
Speaker 1: Perry will be all over you.

615
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:12,410
Speaker 2: Maybe you will all right.

616
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:19,309
Speaker 1: It looks like someone in the audience is excited to ask a question So I guess he can come up and grab a mic unless he's not willing to step up to the challenge.

617
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,328
Speaker 2: He's planning on asking a question, but we got him.

618
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,049
Speaker 1: We have always had this question for you.

619
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,950
Speaker 1: Oh, how how do you get that perfect European hair of yours to stay ever so beautiful?

620
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,602
Speaker 1: Well one herbal essences Conditioner - I condition twice.

621
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:39,928
Speaker 2: don't you do something else of the conditioning?

622
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,090
Speaker 1: I'm a homies fan.

623
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:48,510
Speaker 1: I would refer to you to previous Thursdays episode if you want to know more about that topic.

624
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:50,327
Speaker 2: How many times are we gonna beat around this bush?

625
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,494
Speaker 1: That's are you?

626
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:54,097
Speaker 1: that's a rather.

627
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,029
Speaker 1: that's a rather loaded statement.

628
00:39:59,134 --> 00:39:59,963
Speaker 2: I think we'll leave it at that.

629
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,770
Speaker 1: Actually, we put a pseudo explicit tag on that one episode so we wouldn't get in trouble.

630
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,870
Speaker 1: Plus we had disclaimers like every five minutes in the beginning.

631
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:17,210
Speaker 2: Yeah It's another thing that some you got to watch out with some anime podcasts because they won't tell you when they're gonna spoil something.

632
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,710
Speaker 2: We have our thing called the spoiler line.

633
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:25,210
Speaker 2: Like if we talk about a show We'll talk about it and then when we're gonna start spoiling it we say this is the spoiler line.

634
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:29,048
Speaker 2: Stop listening now, if you haven't watched the show, we'll say it like ten times.

635
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,337
Speaker 1: then we're like, yeah Everybody dies at the end of something.

636
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:31,839
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

637
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,470
Speaker 2: Yeah, as soon as you're over that line, it's all your fault.

638
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,250
Speaker 1: Okay, any more questions about podcasting any?

639
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:39,745
Speaker 1: Well, I think we've tapped the well here.

640
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,383
Speaker 2: Well didn't have so much water in it.

641
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,427
Speaker 1: No, not really Can't stop beating this dead horse.

642
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:50,115
Speaker 1: Don't be shy.

643
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:50,779
Speaker 1: don't be shy.

644
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:52,790
Speaker 1: got to keep filling the dead air.

645
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:57,043
Speaker 1: Hold the mic closer to your face.

646
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,015

00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:00,437

650
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:06,696
Speaker 1: Nothing.

651
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:10,690
Speaker 1: All you have to do is submit it have at least five episodes and not be terrible.

652
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:12,356
Speaker 1: Usually someone looks at it.

653
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:18,729
Speaker 1: if your podcast is terrible or your feed is broken or something isn't working I choose the email you and say man you suck go away.

654
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,195
Speaker 2: Yeah, and iTunes is you'd like.

655
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:24,324
Speaker 2: some people complain about them because they do sort of sketchy stuff.

656
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:33,890
Speaker 2: They'll be like they unlisted my feed Those bastards But other times it's like okay your your podcast is like.

657
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,965
Speaker 2: You know bleep bleep bleep in the title and you didn't put an explicit tag on it.

658
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:38,050
Speaker 2: Apple sends them an email.

659
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:41,786
Speaker 2: You better put an explicit tag on it or we're not gonna list you, you know bad about bleep bleep bleep.

Speaker 2: This is a dirty robot podcast.

662
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,209
Speaker 2: Actually, I see it would only made two episodes and then it went away.

663
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:51,876
Speaker 2: That's how I just made it up.

664
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:52,298
Speaker 1: Hmm.

665
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:53,824

Speaker 1: They call it pod fading.

667
00:41:55,332 --> 00:41:57,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate the fact that people come up with these silly.

668
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:03,993
Speaker 1: We've got someone else in the back who's excited which means she is now on the spot to ask a question and she seems No, she's hiding.

Speaker 1: I'm killing that air here again.

675
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:22,808
Speaker 1: Our podcast called geek nights, we've already covered all that.

Speaker 1: nothing what I pod fading.

684
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,297
Speaker 1: for some reason everyone in this it's like webcomic art isn't come up with like names For all their like things.

685
00:42:58,337 --> 00:42:59,421
Speaker 1: and this is the same kind of thing.

686
00:42:59,822 --> 00:43:01,770
Speaker 1: Most podcasts don't make it to ten episodes.

687
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,682
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of you really into it.

688
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:07,720
Speaker 1: They start a podcast They suck they stop and the podcast disappears.

689
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:09,266
Speaker 2: a lot of people get into podcasting.

690
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,370
Speaker 2: They think oh, this will be so easy.

691
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,650
Speaker 2: I'll plug a mic into my laptop and I'll record a show but then they don't really have anything to talk about.

692
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:22,527
Speaker 2: Or they only do it when they feel like it and they don't do it regularly Or the one fanboy talking about his favorite hentai every day.

693
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:28,230
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Those podcasts don't stick around for more than like two episodes and then they die.

694
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:30,610
Speaker 2: But all the episodes are still there in iTunes.

695
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,817
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's called pod fading.

696
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:35,667
Speaker 2: because you'll go around and you'll find this podcast pod fading.

697
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:36,570
Speaker 1: people call it pod.

698
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:37,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right sucking.

699
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:44,983
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you'll go around you'll find some great podcast and then after like seven episodes They'd be like no more and you'll never see another one.

700
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:46,129
Speaker 2: You'd be like god damn it.

701
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,308
Speaker 2: It's like if a TV show just ends and it wasn't canceled or anything.

702
00:43:49,368 --> 00:43:49,590
Speaker 2: just go.

703
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,280
Speaker 1: What was that good video game when you were listening to?

704
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,030
Speaker 2: that disappeared those gamers of jobs radio?

705
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:58,990
Speaker 2: They did 25 episodes and then the the guy went to work for the escapist so they had to stop it.

706
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:00,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really too bad.

707
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:01,949
Speaker 1: I wonder if they should start something up again.

708
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,310
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe because there really aren't any good video game podcasts because they're they all suck except for that one.

709
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:08,792
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: Well, honestly, we did a whole series on anime conventions and gaming conventions and one how to not suck it going to them Because a lot of our friends it's a good running theme how to not suck at things with us.

723
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:55,362
Speaker 1: a lot of people We've known have gone to cons and screwed something up Like the hotel was broken or their friends are all idiots.

724
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:57,190
Speaker 1: They got into a fight or just craziness.

725
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,502
Speaker 2: Yeah, and a lot of people go to cons and then they don't really.

726
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,931
Speaker 2: they don't know how to get the maximum enjoyment out of The con.

727
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,216
Speaker 2: so he did a thing on that too.

728
00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:08,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but ourselves we really only go to cons to do stuff like this.

729
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,540
Speaker 1: I mean I speak on panels at like every con I go to and Once again, I'm here speaking on a panel.

730
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we hang out with our friends and play DS games.

731
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:23,823
Speaker 2: Yeah, the DS is like revitalized the whole convention scene because now every convention is Yeah, pick up the mic.

732
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:33,690
Speaker 1: It's I know again What panels were you guys all All right.

733
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:42,689
Speaker 1: The long story short is that at Ohio con - we all bunch of us went and we went into the anime club summit panel And no one was there to run it.

734
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:51,650
Speaker 1: so being the kinds of people that we are we sat down in the front pretended it was ours and ran it and Then we went to Otacon that year and the same thing happened.

735
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:53,704
Speaker 1: So we sat down and ran it only this time.

736
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:56,195
Speaker 1: the staffers said hey You guys know what you're talking about.

737
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:57,178
Speaker 1: run the panel forever.

738
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,027
Speaker 2: and you ran that panel for like three years.

739
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:02,278
Speaker 1: four years four years And I'm still running it this year.

740
00:46:02,298 --> 00:46:03,404
Speaker 1: I mean my friend Scott Johnson.

741
00:46:03,445 --> 00:46:04,330
Speaker 2: and now we had another panel.

742
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:05,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, anime central.

743
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:06,744
Speaker 1: the same thing happened.

744
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:07,750
Speaker 1: katsu khan.

745
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,133
Speaker 1: I don't speak at it, but one of my friends does and I usually kind of slip my way in Katsu khan.

746
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:14,117
Speaker 1: we're gonna do stuff at like.

747
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:15,562
Speaker 1: I said before toro khan.

748
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,410
Speaker 1: Obviously, we come back every year since we're alums.

749
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,318
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's always a big advantage.

750
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:28,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically we warmed our way in and we just stayed Alright.

751
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:28,617
Speaker 1: back to DS.

752
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,850
Speaker 2: is the DS is like the king of the convention scene?

753
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:39,684
Speaker 2: Yeah, anytime there's a grouping of geeks the DS is like All right, I'm up ripping out.

754
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:41,933
Speaker 1: their DS is All right.

755
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:42,314
Speaker 2: We're all good.

756
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:44,199
Speaker 1: All right, we've got another question.

757
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,087
Speaker 1: This is a Brian of instant classic fame.

758
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:47,448
Speaker 1: Yes.

759
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:50,339
Speaker 1: Hi Is there life beyond podcasting?

760
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:53,050
Speaker 1: Is there anything to strive from now that you're on this level?

761
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,810
Speaker 1: Well, actually there are a lot of directions to go because we're growing at a rate.

762
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,822
Speaker 1: That's kind of scary for one since we didn't start that long ago.

763
00:47:00,923 --> 00:47:01,785
Speaker 1: We haven't advertised.

764
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,290
Speaker 2: Yeah, we haven't advertised at all.

765
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:06,979
Speaker 1: Advertisers tried to make money straight up.

766
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,005
Speaker 1: as in I'm gonna sell my podcast.

767
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,410
Speaker 1: those people have all failed.

768
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,190
Speaker 0: Well, some of them had a little bit of success, but generally like one guy.

769
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:17,670
Speaker 2: He's like some famous British dude, like Ricky Jervis or something like that.

770
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,590
Speaker 2: I don't know, but he had a podcast that was yeah, maybe his podcast was wicked popular and funny.

771
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:24,289
Speaker 2: I never listened to it, but that's not the point.

772
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:31,480
Speaker 2: He decided that since he was so wicked popular starting with like the fifth or the tenth episode He was gonna sell every episode for like five bucks.

773
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:32,927
Speaker 1: That was the end.

774
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:37,806
Speaker 2: Yeah Well, you know his popularity dropped way down, but he made money.

775
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,738
Speaker 2: because you know, okay now I have a hundred listeners instead of a thousand.

776
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:47,684
Speaker 2: but a hundred times five bucks is money, you know Other people sell ads and those people sometimes make money sometimes not.

777
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:49,650
Speaker 2: some of them are trying to cover the costs.

778
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:51,299
Speaker 2: Some of them are trying to profit.

779
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,486
Speaker 2: Yeah, it just very.

780
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:53,290
Speaker 1: there have been stories.

781
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,957
Speaker 1: I haven't heard any specifically like.

782
00:47:54,997 --> 00:48:00,001
Speaker 1: I know the guy where people were picked up by local radio stations or Not really big radio stations.

783
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,210
Speaker 1: yet because they needed voice talent.

784
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,690
Speaker 1: They found someone who was good and just hey come work for us.

785
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,135
Speaker 1: We'll pay you to do what you were doing for free.

786
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:07,605
Speaker 1: whoo in his defense though.

787
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:08,930
Speaker 1: He is the creator of The Office.

788
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:10,115
Speaker 2: I don't know what that is.

789
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:11,280
Speaker 1: So God doesn't watch TV.

790
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,866
Speaker 1: The office is awesome in my opinion.

791
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:15,371
Speaker 1: Well, that's why I'm just Okay.

792
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,937
Speaker 2: Thanks for thanks for the information.

793
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have nothing against him just against his idea of podcasting.

794
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, because our philosophy is that we're doing this for fun and we can afford to cover all the equipment.

795
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:28,461
Speaker 1: So we Refused to advertise on our site refused to make money.

796
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,750
Speaker 1: if we make t-shirts, we'll just sell them at cost.

797
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,412
Speaker 1: The question was how many listeners do we have?

798
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:37,560
Speaker 2: Well, it's hard to measure.

799
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,880
Speaker 1: We have a few hundred currently which isn't too bad considering we just started and considering we've never advertised ever.

800
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:46,560
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there are different ways to measure listeners.

801
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,320
Speaker 2: Like we can tell you how many people downloaded a specific episode, but there's four days a week.

802
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:52,710
Speaker 2: Some people only listen Monday.

803
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:54,040
Speaker 2: Some people only listen Tuesday.

804
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,840
Speaker 2: Some people listen like Monday Thursday, but not Tuesday Wednesday.

805
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:03,302
Speaker 2: Some people listen to every day so the number of listeners is kind of Feed.

806
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:13,880
Speaker 1: we average what like 1.6 new listeners per calendar day Even even days where there are new episodes almost never lost listeners other than that one kid we banned from our forum.

807
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,169
Speaker 2: He said I think he said that he was still listen.

808
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,274
Speaker 2: I think he said he's still listening.

809
00:49:17,314 --> 00:49:18,037
Speaker 2: But so mr.

810
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:21,955
Speaker 2: Flaming geek I guess the guy who wasn't really in Japan and can't speak English.

811
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:22,558
Speaker 2: Yeah.

812
00:49:22,578 --> 00:49:26,720
Speaker 2: Yeah No, but there's also the issue of people's might subscribe to your feed.

813
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:32,860
Speaker 2: So I know that someone is subscribed to like the Monday feed, but they might not download every single Monday episode.

814
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,547
Speaker 2: So it's like he's a listener.

815
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:37,780
Speaker 2: He's not a listener, you know, or some people download and never listen to it.

816
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,820
Speaker 2: They just let their iPods fill up and don't play him ever, you know.

817
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:43,359
Speaker 2: And then eventually they go what the hell is this and delete it all?

818
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,135
Speaker 1: So basically I'd say after about six more months to a year We'll have enough statistics to actually do math and figure out exactly.

819
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:58,700
Speaker 2: but I'd say at least a few hundred Yeah, and then considering we haven't done any pushing whatsoever Like we barely push it, I think we just put it in our signatures and like slash that.

820
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:06,286
Speaker 1: yeah, this is our first public appearance and I think Otakon is gonna be our kind of big tipping point since we're doing a Podcast at Otakon live.

821
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:09,440
Speaker 1: We might be getting all sorts of space at Otakon to do other fun things.

822
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,347
Speaker 1: You're really not sure what the deal is yet.

823
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:14,779
Speaker 1: But I think being in the program book at Otakon is gonna explode us.

824
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, well pretend I never said that.

825
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,426
Speaker 1: Alright we have a question from Kate here.

826
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:25,361
Speaker 1: I just wanted you to break down the costs for overhead and Okay.

827
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:25,723
Speaker 2: Alright.

828
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:28,270
Speaker 2: So the first cost you have is a microphone.

829
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,540
Speaker 2: now if you don't care about being high quality a microphone is 10 bucks.

830
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,805
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we went way overboard.

831
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:34,808
Speaker 1: most podcasts are.

832
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:40,104
Speaker 1: a dude with the crappy microphone that he found in the box his computer came in Plugged into his computer.

833
00:50:40,144 --> 00:50:44,560
Speaker 1: He's recording in like Windows recorder and then encoding and like I don't know Nero.

834
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,007
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Logitech headsets are pretty popular.

835
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:48,813
Speaker 2: the little like come out.

836
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:50,398
Speaker 2: It's got a little microphone a little.

837
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:51,040
Speaker 2: what's it called?

838
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:52,766
Speaker 2: Boom boom little stick.

839
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:56,580
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're usually like the gaming headsets you use if you want to play like counter-strike online.

840
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,260
Speaker 2: But those things like 20 bucks and like some people when they want to add more people to their podcast just buy more headsets.

841
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:14,360
Speaker 1: You know You need some sort of hosting and usually you want some sort of blog or blog software to go along with it Because I know webcomics usually wants some sort of automated system of I upload a comic and everything gets taken care of.

842
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:20,760
Speaker 1: So you need the same sort of thing and there are a lot of cheap cheap cheap services that will offer that though You can do it yourself fairly easily.

843
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:33,760
Speaker 2: Yeah, it all depends on your bandwidth because I mean if your host gives you a hundred gigabytes a month Right, if you only have so many listeners and your podcasts are only so many megabytes Maybe you can you know do it there and not have to pay any more fees.

844
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:42,540
Speaker 2: But what eventually happens to most podcast is since of mp3 is pretty big and you're not bit torrenting it Which some people do actually bit torrent their podcast to save bandwidth.

845
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:48,058
Speaker 2: But most people just let you directly download the mp3 which means lots and lots of bandwidth costs.

846
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,860
Speaker 1: now I won't go to all the hosting details because we've run our own Linux server up in the sky and then we host our feeds with feed burner.

847
00:51:55,141 --> 00:52:04,200
Speaker 1: We host our mp3s with libsyn which I'm gonna recommend them to people who don't have any other option But I don't really recommend them because I don't like them terribly.

848
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:15,446
Speaker 2: Yeah, libsyn isn't the greatest company, but really for like 10 bucks They'll let you do what 200 something megabytes worth of podcasts per month Many down.

849
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:19,220
Speaker 1: if you get a million downloads, you're still good and they'll give you a blog that they'll run.

850
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,399
Speaker 1: It's kind of like WordPress and they'll hate take care of your RSS feeds and all that sort of stuff.

851
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:31,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, the RSS feeds are a little tricky But yeah, we paid total about $80 a month for all of our hosting combined, but that includes other websites we run.

852
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,226
Speaker 2: Yeah, we do other stuff with the hosting.

853
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,033
Speaker 2: So one hostings 40 bucks the line.

854
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,780
Speaker 2: Oh, the libsyn is 20 bucks.

855
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:38,787
Speaker 2: Let's see the mixer.

856
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:40,860
Speaker 1: Yeah only need a mixer.

857
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,400
Speaker 1: See we we have two people on the podcast which is rare.

858
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,420
Speaker 1: Most people who have are either one person or a bunch of people talking over Skype.

859
00:52:48,024 --> 00:52:53,319
Speaker 1: I can't help you if you do the Skype thing because Skype is Complicated in the fact that it's closed source and you can't fiddle with it.

860
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:58,135
Speaker 2: Yeah Gizmo is a little easier because you just open up gizmo call someone and push the record button.

861
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:05,940
Speaker 2: with Skype you either need like two Computers wired together or a crazy wiring configuration or there's a freeware Windows program that lets you record Skype conversations.

862
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:07,459
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of it because I don't use it.

863
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:12,080
Speaker 1: We've spent a little under $200 on equipment, but once again, we went way over the top.

864
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:17,060
Speaker 1: I mean gig nights is one of the highest quality in terms of audio podcasts out there.

865
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:19,731
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's just because we put so much effort into it.

866
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:21,720
Speaker 1: I mean you can get that mixer was like 60 bucks.

867
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,407
Speaker 1: It'll handle a whole bunch of inputs.

868
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:33,320
Speaker 1: We've got a compressor there, which is our newest bit of technology Which I'm not gonna go explain it Unless someone wants me to but basically it reduces the range between the loudest sound and the quietest sound.

869
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:44,808
Speaker 1: So if I get quiet while I'm talking and then I get loud again It kind of evens it all out and more importantly it squishes the audio down so we can record on that crappy laptop right there With yeah crappy crappy sound card is it?

870
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:45,873
Speaker 2: you do need a computer.

871
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,807
Speaker 2: the computer doesn't have to be that good But they should hear the computer.

872
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:51,460
Speaker 2: the you know, you're gonna run into trouble processing.

873
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,482
Speaker 2: It's gonna take forever.

874
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:57,391
Speaker 2: editing will take forever and you need a lot of hard drive space to store all the podcasts.

875
00:53:57,411 --> 00:54:03,407
Speaker 2: because don't trust All your podcasts and then you're screwed.

876
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,980
Speaker 2: plus you want a hard drive lossless like original.

877
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,360
Speaker 1: I mean you'll make an mp3 and upload it but you want to keep the original original WAV file or whatever Because in the future you're gonna want to be able to make a high quality master for whatever reason.

878
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:15,838
Speaker 1: You know.

879
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:25,987
Speaker 1: maybe you wanna put a DVD of your whole podcast someday or you get picked up by a radio station or You just want to re-edit them now that you know how to actually edit Or you want to release your outtakes?

880
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:26,870
Speaker 1: Yes.

881
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,196
Speaker 1: We have we have outtakes.

882
00:54:28,216 --> 00:54:28,839
Speaker 2: We have outtakes.

883
00:54:29,762 --> 00:54:30,425
Speaker 1: Software is free.

884
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:32,754
Speaker 2: The software is free unless you want to get fancy.

885
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:37,239
Speaker 2: the first fancy software That's kind of free is garage band, which isn't really free.

886
00:54:37,581 --> 00:54:39,028
Speaker 2: But if you buy a Mac you get it for free.

887
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:40,113
Speaker 1: garage bands great.

888
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:41,440
Speaker 1: if you have that you're all set.

889
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,378
Speaker 1: You can just podcast now.

890
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:53,886
Speaker 2: Yeah Garage band has like amazing podcast tools for idiots like a Doofus could just click on the podcast button and garage band start talking and click the finish button and it takes care of everything for You considered buying a MacBook just for it.

891
00:54:54,147 --> 00:55:00,130
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's another piece of software that's pretty popular called cast blaster cast blaster Windows, isn't it?

892
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:13,840
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not free but it's very very Fancy and it takes care of everything you need to do for podcasting even typing in your show notes and everything from start to finish Like you push a button in music plays and you push another button for wacky sound effects and the volumes and everything.

893
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:18,038
Speaker 1: Yeah now beyond that there are things like Pro Tools Which if you don't know what that is, you don't need it.

894
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,720
Speaker 1: Even if you know what it is, you probably don't need it for a podcast.

895
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:28,867
Speaker 2: Yeah, Pro Tools is for real radio people and all kinds of fancy production studios who seem to use something called audacity Which is that's that right there.

896
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:29,629
Speaker 1: It's free.

897
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,332
Speaker 1: It's really easy use.

898
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:31,035
Speaker 1: it works in Windows.

899
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:31,697
Speaker 1: It works on Macs.

900
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:32,380
Speaker 1: It works in Linux.

901
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:43,760
Speaker 1: I can't really speak badly of it except for the fact that installing it can be a pain if you're using a Good Linux distribution because we're not gonna talk about this, but the guy who coded this doesn't know what he's doing.

902
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:51,865
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can ask us any questions about non podcasting geekery after the show because we know but I mean most of you will have No problem and it works great.

903
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:55,799
Speaker 1: If you have Linux you can use something called resound re z ou nd.

904
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:56,745
Speaker 2: That's what we use.

905
00:55:56,765 --> 00:55:57,610
Speaker 1: I swear by.

906
00:55:57,711 --> 00:55:59,139
Speaker 1: it's a beautiful beautiful program.

907
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:05,850
Speaker 1: The guy who wrote it isn't the best coder But he knows a lot about audio and he wrote all the algorithms himself and it works really well.

908
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:09,440
Speaker 2: And considering, you know, you don't have too many other Linux options.

909
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:10,303
Speaker 2: That's what we went with.

910
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:16,966
Speaker 1: so you could do a decent podcast on I'd say 20 bucks a month total Plus maybe 50 bucks worth of equipment.

911
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:23,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much and if you spend what we spent you'll have a crazy awesome radio quality podcast Mm-hmm.

912
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:25,588
Speaker 2: Here comes another question watch out.

913
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,472
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

914
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:27,135
Speaker 1: All right.

915
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,100
Speaker 1: Here's a question for you.

916
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,233
Speaker 1: I noticed that you guys have forums on your.

917
00:56:31,795 --> 00:56:32,960
Speaker 1: we do indeed have forums.

918
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:39,256
Speaker 1: Now do you think that first of all, is it necessary to have forums for podcasting?

919
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:42,252
Speaker 1: and second if you do What are some good tips to managing forums?

920
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:44,854
Speaker 2: Well, all right You want to take this?

921
00:56:44,874 --> 00:56:48,300
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure If you have a podcast you generally have a website that goes with it.

922
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,180
Speaker 2: That way people can find your podcast with Google or something.

923
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:58,740
Speaker 2: It's kind of necessary but you know Usually your website can add a minimum contain your show notes and links to your shows at a maximum.

924
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:03,157
Speaker 2: You can try to build a whole community around your podcast, you know forums and all kinds of stuff.

925
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:03,740
Speaker 2: You don't need to.

926
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:07,980
Speaker 2: It's just something that's good to interact with your listeners and all that sort of good stuff.

927
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,960
Speaker 1: Also, it helps you gain momentum because if there's a community there, they'll all stay by you just like in webcomics.

928
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,759
Speaker 1: It's like everything else.

929
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:19,140
Speaker 1: I mean, we know some webcomic artists who stop updating and their fans bother them for like the next five years.

930
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:20,151
Speaker 2: When's it gonna update?

931
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:20,858
Speaker 2: when's it gonna update?

932
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:30,033
Speaker 2: Yeah, the other thing is that you know, if you only get feedback from your listeners via email then you know It comes in when someone really has the urge to email you.

933
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:43,498
Speaker 2: they won't just email you casually But if you can get someone to join your forums Which is about as much effort as getting them to send you one email Once they've joined and once they've gotten used to going to the site They'll just give you feedback constantly and start talking about all kinds of stuff.

934
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:51,372
Speaker 1: Yep Now you're gonna have to watch out for flamers trolls and general spam bots Which is really too complex a topic to get into now.

935
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to say we've had to ban one person already.

936
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:56,530
Speaker 2: Yeah, but technology will solve you most of those problems.

937
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,380
Speaker 1: Yeah and off the air we can tell you exactly how to deal with that.

938
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:01,482
Speaker 2: Yep Anything else?

939
00:58:01,703 --> 00:58:02,526
Speaker 1: any more questions?

940
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:03,610
Speaker 1: What's happening at all?

941
00:58:04,453 --> 00:58:06,500
Speaker 1: I think we've recorded enough for a show at least.

942
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:08,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we have 18 minutes left.

943
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:09,171

Speaker 1: Yeah.

950
00:58:21,216 --> 00:58:22,160

952
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:31,415
Speaker 1: So front row crew calm Yep, and we're out off the air and we'll probably take less formal questions starting now.
