1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,720
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 22nd 2020.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,537
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight on this spooky October Thursday.

3
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,900
Speaker 0: We are talking about ghosts.

4
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:23,392
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:29,911
Speaker 0: So has anything happened to you in the last 48 hours?

6
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:35,993
Speaker 1: cuz I got fucking nothing not much Other than the routine things that are happening.

7
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,680
Speaker 1: and you know the world, right?

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Speaker 1: There's pretty much only two out of the ordinary things that have happened in my personal experience.

9
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,380
Speaker 1: So first, you know for the podcast over these past months, right?

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,400
Speaker 1: I've been using the countryman microphone that we use when we're doing panels.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,729
Speaker 1: You know the same one you see people using for like TED talks.

12
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:03,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, the countryman e6, which is a expensive Omnidirectional microphone that's kind of a pain in the ass to use like it's really intended to be invisible on a stage.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,450
Speaker 0: It's not really pleasant to use like sitting at your desk.

14
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 1: No, it's not so it would like hurt my ear and be kind of annoying.

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,416
Speaker 1: I am using it when I'm streaming while biking because with what a wireless pack?

16
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:14,259
Speaker 1: because that makes sense.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,742
Speaker 0: Video because Even though I have a shotgun mic my apartment has a lot of bare walls Right.

18
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:28,428
Speaker 1: So I think we already talked about the X to you breaking and getting the new audio interface thing Which is really terrific.

19
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,839
Speaker 1: I think I'm very pleased with the audio interface.

20
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,014
Speaker 0: now Welcome welcome to the world of plus four instead of minus ten and someday you'll figure out what that means.

21
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:43,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is Because I have this audio interface I can now just use XLR Devices.

22
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:48,160
Speaker 1: anything with XLR output I can now record on my computer very easily, you know.

23
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:52,400
Speaker 1: So I can pull instead of wearing the stupid thing on my ear to do a podcast.

24
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:57,100
Speaker 1: I can now take this as sm57 that I had in the bin or pull it out.

25
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,427
Speaker 0: I don't think we own any 58.

26
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:04,219
Speaker 1: No, we got the 58 beta or whatever, but I had 57 just lying around.

27
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:04,961
Speaker 1: so I'm like All right.

28
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:05,925
Speaker 1: Let me use this instead.

29
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:11,305
Speaker 1: That's more comfortable than you know, that is the end of third microphone We used for geek nights.

30
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:12,730
Speaker 0: that is fine.

31
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,180
Speaker 1: I'm sure no one listening if I even tell the difference.

32
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:21,691
Speaker 0: No, especially the quality is actually worse lately because we're recording in two different environments So we actually have twice as much background noise.

33
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:22,333
Speaker 0: That is different.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,513
Speaker 0: Oh Two different background noises to get you and there is more noise out of you.

35
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:30,484
Speaker 0: the one problem with the thing you're about to talk About but it doesn't matter.

36
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:31,328
Speaker 0: It's immaterial.

37
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:32,132
Speaker 0: The quality is fine.

38
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:33,980
Speaker 0: It has a noise band.

39
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:40,800
Speaker 0: There's a line of hiss at one very specific frequency that comes from it Mmm filter to remove that.

40
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:48,220
Speaker 1: So the point is is that with the Countryman the Countryman is a microphone that uses phantom power, right?

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,745
Speaker 1: It's like a condensing microphone.

42
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:53,337
Speaker 1: So if the signal that it sends to the computer is plenty loud.

43
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,818
Speaker 1: It's actually too loud You have to turn it down, right?

44
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:07,387
Speaker 1: but you know The the this microphone the sm57 right is a dynamic microphone So it doesn't use the phantom power.

45
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:10,160
Speaker 1: even if the the you know phantom power comes out of there.

46
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:10,783
Speaker 1: it's like.

47
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,151
Speaker 1: well the microphone just doesn't use it.

48
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:23,058
Speaker 1: it ignores it and The signal that goes back to the computer is actually a pretty quiet signal Which means I got to go to the preamp that's in my audio interface and turn it up to get more to.

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 1: this is loud enough for recording.

50
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:26,446
Speaker 1: The problem there is.

51
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,029
Speaker 1: you turn it up.

52
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,018
Speaker 1: You're turning up the noise also.

53
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:40,700
Speaker 1: so The preamp when it's all the way up or really high up, even if you're not saying anything now, there's like this Right, you want the preamp to be turned down as much as possible.

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,948
Speaker 1: That way you hear people talking and not.

55
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:48,580
Speaker 0: but there has to be some amp somewhere because the signal that comes out of a dynamic Microphone is barely perceptible.

56
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:54,515
Speaker 1: Yep, so I bought this thing that was much allotted by the internet and people.

57
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:59,073
Speaker 1: I even talked to some people who said they had One and it was great and it's called the triton fet head.

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:11,120
Speaker 1: There are other products that do similar things with different designs same designs But what it is is it's just a little little tiny guy with XLR input and output.

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,312
Speaker 1: I think there was like a cloud lifter.

60
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:21,459
Speaker 1: That's a similar product as well From a different company and you just stick it in the back of your microphone and then you stick the XLR cable into that.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Speaker 1: So it actually looks like you might not even realize it's a separate product.

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,265
Speaker 1: You might really think that's like oh the microphone just has a thing sticking out the bottom of it Right and it's supposed to be that way.

63
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:37,870
Speaker 1: you mean now like see it in videos and not realize it's being in now recognize it Whereas before you just didn't think about it.

64
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:41,686
Speaker 1: and what it does is well Got dynamic microphone.

65
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,191
Speaker 1: We got this phantom power.

66
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,820
Speaker 1: That's just being thrown out in the garbage, right?

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,133
Speaker 1: Let's take that phantom power and we'll power up these FETs right.

68
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,200
Speaker 1: and then it basically it's an amp.

69
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:53,828
Speaker 1: It's an it but it's a flat amp.

70
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:54,954
Speaker 1: There's no dial on it.

71
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,140
Speaker 1: There's no controls.

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,069
Speaker 1: It's literally just XLR in XLR out the end.

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,015
Speaker 0: It's basically a pre preamp.

74
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pre preamp.

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,139
Speaker 1: It just adds like 20-something decibels to the signal going in one direction.

76
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:10,700
Speaker 0: now You might think why didn't Scott just get a device that has a better preamp in it?

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,063
Speaker 0: And the answer is that is crazy fucking expensive You got.

78
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,131
Speaker 1: yeah, really good preamps cost a lot of money.

79
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:16,974
Speaker 1: This thing was less than $100.

80
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:17,516
Speaker 1: much less, right?

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,763
Speaker 1: And I don't.

82
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:22,207
Speaker 1: now I don't need any more equipment.

83
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,376
Speaker 1: All right, and all of this is just from one USB 2.0 cable.

84
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:38,360
Speaker 1: One USB 2.0 cable goes to this device, which is like a big audio interface An XLR cable then this, you know, FET head thing and then a microphone and it all works great.

85
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:45,272
Speaker 1: So if you have if you want to use an XLR dynamic microphone with your computer You should and it's too quiet.

86
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,619
Speaker 1: Maybe get one of these things.

87
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,549
Speaker 1: It's much better than turning all the volume up everywhere.

88
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:51,496
Speaker 0: and also you might think oh, why doesn't?

89
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:56,380
Speaker 0: why don't you just buy a Non-dynamic microphone like get a like get a modern capacitive.

90
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:05,564
Speaker 0: I cost a lot more and less than $100 like this as beta 87 a that I'm using right here The one that Scott normally uses in the apartment Costs more.

91
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:11,240
Speaker 0: the difference between this and an sm57 is more than what Scott paid for that pre preamp.

92
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:17,739
Speaker 1: Right if I didn't have the sm57 already I may have purchased a different microphone instead.

93
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,754
Speaker 0: Yeah Why didn't rim just stop bike over and give Scott the other beta as every 7a?

94
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,120
Speaker 0: because rim and Emily are doing a separate podcast?

95
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,186
Speaker 0: I need that microphone here.

96
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:27,950
Speaker 0: Why doesn't?

97
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:30,341
Speaker 0: even if you the other Sm57?

98
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:34,320
Speaker 0: because you know where that other sm57 is in my fucking a desk somewhere at work.

99
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:35,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, I left it.

100
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,109
Speaker 1: Even if you gave me one of those beta ones I it would probably still need this thing probably not.

101
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:49,030
Speaker 0: this is a beta 87. a actually outputs a much higher Signal when you just oh, that's good because it's a much better microphone.

102
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,571
Speaker 0: It's modern.

103
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:52,900
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm 57 dates from Lyndon Johnson's presidency.

104
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's old.

105
00:06:54,863 --> 00:07:03,992
Speaker 0: And If you find an sm57 from when Lyndon Baines Johnson was president There is literally no difference between that sm57 and today's sm57.

106
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,539
Speaker 0: Mmm, maybe the plastics made a little better like in the in the capsule, but that's probably about it.

107
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:17,498
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff like, you know, there will be immaterial differences, right, but there won't be any, you know material difference.

108
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:23,134
Speaker 0: Yep So in the news very sad news, I mean this was a long time coming.

109
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:25,842
Speaker 0: the man was 92. like that We could live.

110
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:36,440
Speaker 0: so I'll take I'll take 92 if I was as healthy as James Randi was and as good as in good spirits As he seemed but he was 92. when I'm even like 90 I would take that as a win.

111
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:41,640
Speaker 0: So the amazing Randy and complain has died of age-related complications.

112
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,719
Speaker 0: He just literally died of old age.

113
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:45,064
Speaker 0: The man was the legend.

114
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,453
Speaker 0: the man was very important to the skeptic community.

115
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:58,400
Speaker 0: The man was material in basically Destroying a wide swath of the charlatan industry in the world particularly in the United States and Europe.

116
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are still people who are charlatans everywhere.

117
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:10,148
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know The thing that I think James Randi learned and was internally frustrated by is like yeah You can you can educate people.

118
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,120
Speaker 1: right you can help people but some people cannot be helped.

119
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:20,906
Speaker 0: You would talk about that event horizon Like there's a point in someone's life beyond which no logic can ever reach them again Like they're gone.

120
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,920
Speaker 0: and I just remember seeing an interview from him.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,658
Speaker 0: This interview was like 20 years ago.

122
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:28,094
Speaker 0: But someone asked him like have you ever changed anyone's mind?

123
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,103
Speaker 0: and he thought about it And I just remember.

124
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:35,424
Speaker 0: the saddest thing is he actually paused and he said something to the effect of you know It's never happened once.

125
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:40,799
Speaker 0: the only people I've ever convinced were already convinced and just needed like they needed that final push.

126
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,879
Speaker 0: No one has ever changed their mind because of any of my work.

127
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:48,180
Speaker 0: I only hope is that can prevent people from getting that far in the first place.

128
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:56,836
Speaker 0: I'm obviously paraphrasing from an interview that I heard like 15 years ago from five years before that But that's basically what he said.

129
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:03,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that definitely describes, you know, my experience right is like I. I already sort of knew that.

130
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,980
Speaker 1: You know There are things in the world that are real and there are things that are world that are fake.

131
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,600
Speaker 1: There's people out there lying and trying to scam you in various ways, right?

132
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:17,455
Speaker 1: But then, you know, thanks to his educational foundation and his other works, right?

133
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,664
Speaker 1: I was like, oh Now I understand right.

134
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:22,249
Speaker 1: How do you tell right?

135
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,472
Speaker 1: Oh this fake things.

136
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:30,698
Speaker 1: I wasn't even thinking about right, you know It's just sort of like you already know, but now you really know, right?

137
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,919
Speaker 0: he also made sure like he did a good job of doing the right kind of outreach.

138
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:49,748
Speaker 0: and the thing that I think really struck me was he was very patient with very Very crazy people like he really like he would compassionately talk to them like alright you believe you have this power Let's do a test.

139
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,760
Speaker 0: I will work with you to define this test.

140
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:56,419
Speaker 0: I will bend over backward to help you prove to me that you have powers.

141
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,966
Speaker 0: and Like he never lost his temper.

142
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:01,275
Speaker 0: He he interacted.

143
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:06,319
Speaker 0: I think he was you know I mean, I'm sure he lost his temper off-camera and in his personal life.

144
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:15,029
Speaker 0: But when he was interacting with someone who was trying to prove their stuff he earnestly worked with them because He was trying to convince them.

145
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,060

170
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,752
Speaker 1: I do but why I trying to remember what it was.

171
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:12,997
Speaker 0: Yeah arts.

172
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:13,478
Speaker 1: All right.

173
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,565
Speaker 1: Yes So you may be familiar.

174
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:22,610
Speaker 1: There is a YouTube channel called artsy music and it's not a RTS Why it's a RT Z ie.

175
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:27,005
Speaker 1: and even if you don't know the name of the channel you may have seen it.

176
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:50,119
Speaker 1: they post videos consisting usually of vaporwave future funk ish genre music and Visually, right they take a clip for usually from an anime But not always from an anime a very brief clip usually just a few seconds long and loop it Alright, so you've probably seen like the ursa yotaro one with the you know

177
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:52,989
Speaker 0: For right or right.

178
00:12:53,009 --> 00:13:01,095
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like they all think the three characters lean into each other like one Yeah, three and then it resets one two three, right and you definitely.

179
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,640
Speaker 1: you've almost definitely seen these videos.

180
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,417
Speaker 0: If you're a nerdy, these are like sit there like a tear down in popularity from like lo-fi beats to chill and study - right.

181
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:21,709
Speaker 1: but this channel Which you know if you've only seen its popular videos has been like an institution for quite a few years now For that particular music scene.

182
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:27,989
Speaker 1: right because people are in the scene of you know The the vaporwave genre of music or whatever.

183
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,297
Speaker 1: They're following the artists, right?

184
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,500
Speaker 1: They're band camping They're sound clouding, you know, they're in it, right?

185
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,080
Speaker 1: so they don't need they don't need artsy music, but artsy music was instrumental in Getting that music out there, right?

186
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:58,146
Speaker 1: There's a reason that those people You know can go and fill the pack the clubs when the clubs are open Is because that music became popular because of this one clever YouTube channel that sort of you know improvisationally and copyright-infringingly made Sort of music videos.

187
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:58,387
Speaker 1: Yes.

188
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,430
Speaker 0: Well copyright.

189
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,660
Speaker 0: I mean the car sets music videos this sort of gets.

190
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:05,166
Speaker 0: You're using my words.

191
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:05,770
Speaker 1: It's my word.

192
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,037
Speaker 1: I am using your word.

193
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:07,500
Speaker 1: That's right.

194
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,220
Speaker 0: But they're they're like, you know what?

195
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,805
Speaker 0: These are remind me of a lot.

196
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:19,073
Speaker 0: they remind me of when you go to like a sort of trendy party or like a trendy bar Lounge that isn't playing loud annoying music but has like quiet music in the background.

197
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:34,399
Speaker 0: Sometimes places like that will have like a chill like thing that's looping on TVs around or They'll have like a movie with the sound all the way down just sort of playing in the background While the music's playing like things like that.

198
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:40,505
Speaker 0: It feels like the kind of thing you just put on in the background of a bar and just let it be or like in The back it also.

199
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:43,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also goes towards the traditions of you know.

200
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,640
Speaker 1: And the tropes of this genre of music is that if you do go to the club pretty much any vapor ish artist.

201
00:14:50,282 --> 00:15:03,457
Speaker 1: What they they're usually do is they have behind them typically a projector on the wall behind them And even if they're streaming on Twitch They'll stand in front of a green screen and play behind them some imagery and you'll always see.

202
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,649
Speaker 1: you know DJ with so-and-so.

203
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,118
Speaker 1: here's the tracks they played.

204
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,028
Speaker 1: Visuals by so-and-so like making visuals to go behind DJ's is like a whole thing in and of itself.

205
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:24,560
Speaker 1: So the artsy music channel a while ago had a little bit of drama Involving a fight between I think the person who runs the channel and maybe their partner or something.

206
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:29,520
Speaker 1: There's some drama involving like them stealing the login to the channel and changing the pass.

207
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,009
Speaker 0: I wasn't super clear on what happened and who is.

208
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,120
Speaker 1: if I'm still not clear on what happened or what or what?

209
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:36,652
Speaker 1: That was.

210
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,838
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure out what the heck happened with that either.

211
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:39,519
Speaker 1: there was drama.

212
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Speaker 1: Regardless the new drama is that Despite being super copyright infringing for several years, right?

213
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,688
Speaker 1: Not only were is the music?

214
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:57,734
Speaker 1: almost all the music is heavily sampled music and you know They didn't clear those samples right with the original song creators.

215
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,280
Speaker 0: Of course not, you know.

216
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,680
Speaker 1: They're not paying whoever made right the original songs, right?

217
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:09,207
Speaker 1: If I sample Michael Jackson, right and I you know make us new song Well, it's a very unlikely.

218
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,880
Speaker 1: YouTube will detect that as a Michael Jackson song.

219
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now they're not gonna be even if you know, I monetize like Michael Jackson's not getting the money.

220
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,790
Speaker 1: So there's that level of copyright infringement that was happening.

221
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,560
Speaker 1: There was also just the anime imagery, you know.

222
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:33,341
Speaker 1: so what happened just now recently was that show Pro which is Shoko God, and you know Chagak, whatever sure Asia.

223
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,810
Speaker 1: they just they shortened their name to show Pro in Japan.

224
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:39,190
Speaker 0: You know the big anime company they've come after my youtube channel before.

225
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:40,209
Speaker 1: Yeah.

226
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:48,081
Speaker 1: So show Pro basically came down on artsy with like, you know Copyright and strikes on almost every video.

227
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,747
Speaker 1: that because they're all anime clips, right?

228
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:56,030
Speaker 0: Yep These clips could not in any way impact their monetization of their properties.

229
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:08,465
Speaker 1: No watching Sailor Moon transform like half of the Sailor Moon transformation right at a loop Does not in any way impact the sales of Sailor Moon DVDs the best.

230
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:12,104
Speaker 0: the worst case scenario Is it doesn't impact them more likely or remind someone?

231
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,050
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Sailor Moon Yeah exists anyway.

232
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:19,910
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the copyright thing obviously is bullshit, but the channel is gonna die, right?

233
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,695
Speaker 1: It's still up as of now.

234
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,301
Speaker 1: They're making a new channel.

235
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,550
Speaker 1: You can go to the Twitter to learn about it.

236
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,866
Speaker 1: I guess they're gonna avoid a copyright infringement.

237
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,874
Speaker 0: on the new channel Yeah, we'll see how there are some other.

238
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:34,850
Speaker 1: there are some other channels out there that attempt to do similar thing.

239
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:35,590
Speaker 1: It's like whack-a-ball.

240
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:38,224
Speaker 0: There's so many channels that do stuff like this.

241
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:40,876
Speaker 0: and yeah I guess what says actually this guy?

242
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:41,217
Speaker 0: this was.

243
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:51,049
Speaker 1: this was a popular big one that mattered because it was a platform For you know, like basically making something that was an underground scene and getting it known.

244
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:56,527
Speaker 0: dude That channel is literally how I got into that scene and became interested in that scene.

245
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,553
Speaker 0: was this fucking channel Exactly.

246
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:05,284
Speaker 0: Those other channels that are doing the same thing weren't successful Like I would literally just put it on in the living room while I was like cooking dinner.

247
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was just a fun thing Yep.

248
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:13,009
Speaker 1: So yeah, the channel is probably gonna die soon if it's not dead by the time you hear this.

249
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,211
Speaker 1: and That's.

250
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,418
Speaker 1: it's a sad times and there's so many.

251
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,685
Speaker 1: there's just so many things going on with that.

252
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:26,094
Speaker 1: Well, this even conflict is Conflegration of like anime music YouTube problems.

253
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, right copyright issues.

254
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,887
Speaker 1: Like there's just so many things all coming together into this one story And it's you know, and it segues nicely into my store.

255
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:42,074
Speaker 0: my news Which is twitch is also having these problems now Basically YouTube.

256
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:50,782
Speaker 0: a lot of people have used twitch instead of YouTube partly because YouTube has much more Powerful automated copyright enforcement for music and twitch here.

257
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,448
Speaker 0: there too had not so much.

258
00:18:52,468 --> 00:19:03,411
Speaker 0: and basically back in June there was sort of an apocalypse on twitch where like Millions of DMCA notices all came out at once and a ton of streamers like lost their channels or lost a bunch of their old clips.

259
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,074
Speaker 0: there's big trouble.

260
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:07,869
Speaker 0: a second round of that just happened like a couple days ago.

261
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:20,342
Speaker 0: and Now it's not just people who might have some incidental music It's also a ton of people who have just streamed video games that happen to include Some licensed music in the video game even in small segments.

262
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:21,607
Speaker 1: Oh, it makes sense.

263
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,089
Speaker 1: It makes sense.

264
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:25,362
Speaker 0: Yeah Yep, but it's basically an apocalypse.

265
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:50,550
Speaker 0: huge channels are being taken down people are losing like a Decade of their like VODs and archives with no way to get them because YouTube for all their problems at least does let you fight Back, like if you get a copyright claim as I'm very familiar with because I fought over a hundred of these over the years You can file a DMCA counterclaim and then you can go back and forth and YouTube like facilitates the process of getting lawyers involved.

266
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,585
Speaker 0: That's the reason why our ten of videos are still up because I've done that repeatedly.

267
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,950
Speaker 0: I've had a lawyer involved at least twice.

268
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:58,835
Speaker 0: Twitch is not doing that.

269
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:01,809
Speaker 0: twitch is just deleting any content that gets a copy on a DMCA strike.

270
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,798
Speaker 1: Well, cuz twitch is about live streaming.

271
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,004
Speaker 1: It's not about archiving their VOD feature.

272
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,090
Speaker 1: I could even see them completely removing.

273
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,439
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they still have it cuz it never worked.

274
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,382
Speaker 0: Well, like right.

275
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,049
Speaker 1: I remember originally I like my.

276
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:27,860
Speaker 1: I don't know This is correct But my memory was that originally twitch didn't have a VOD feature and there was a feature instead Where you would get you would use OAuth to connect twitch to YouTube and twitch would save your video to YouTube and wouldn't be saved on twitch.

277
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:41,690
Speaker 1: But yet the twitch VODs like because I don't think people realize that legally speaking at least the United States right using Music on a live stream is actually a different license.

278
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:50,961
Speaker 1: It's a different right royalties payment that using it on a recorded video that can then be played back several times Versus a one-time live stream.

279
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:55,543
Speaker 1: you pay for that differently Through you know through different channels the different amounts.

280
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:57,149
Speaker 1: the money goes to different people.

281
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,113
Speaker 1: So That's it.

282
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,197
Speaker 1: That's a thing, right?

283
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,603
Speaker 1: So it's like you might have.

284
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,294
Speaker 1: actually for example I think I did.

285
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:10,290
Speaker 1: did I talk about the twitch soundtrack app thing that they're coming out with?

286
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,125
Speaker 0: I don't think you did yet cuz we're gonna use that as another house.

287
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:13,969
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about.

288
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:14,977
Speaker 1: okay But yeah, twitch.

289
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:20,930
Speaker 1: twitch has a thing, you know There have been many attempts in the past by various platforms to provide their their creators.

290
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:31,390
Speaker 1: They're you know with libraries of royalty-free Light already or already licensed music that they can play safely without being you know taken down or whatever.

291
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of those are a pain in the ass.

292
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,904
Speaker 1: So they have limited selections.

293
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,723
Speaker 0: or you know They're not great and you can't use it for a VOD for a lot of reasons.

294
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:42,614
Speaker 0: like you use them license music The license expires.

295
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:47,268
Speaker 1: now your VOD is fucked right, but twitch has one that they're coming out with.

296
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:48,030
Speaker 1: it's still in beta.

297
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:54,030
Speaker 1: I don't know why they just don't let everyone use it right away where basically it hooks into your stream right directly.

298
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,710
Speaker 1: So you're using like this music player and it plays the music on your stream.

299
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,824
Speaker 1: There's like an OBS plug-in and everything and it's actually pretty.

300
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:17,930
Speaker 1: it actually solves a technological Problem because normally if I want to play Spotify music on my twitch stream through OBS then in OBS I have to play my desktop audio right because Spotify plays Yeah, and then I capture my desktop audio, which is includes the Spotify audio and route that out to the stream.

301
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,108
Speaker 0: Well, like right now I'm routing my desktop audio to OBS to get Scott's audio into the stream, right?

302
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:27,149
Speaker 1: Sure But let's say that somebody you you forget to turn off.

303
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:32,418
Speaker 1: you know some instant messaging program and Someone sends you a message and it goes didding.

304
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,279
Speaker 1: now that didding goes through to your stream the twitch soundtrack Thing gets around that because you're not capturing.

305
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,270
Speaker 0: there are other ways to get around that but they're not like people.

306
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:42,936
Speaker 0: Don't do it for a lot of reasons.

307
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:44,481
Speaker 1: This is a good and elegant way.

308
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:50,310
Speaker 1: right the twitch thing will actually Take just the music and send it to just your stream.

309
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,885
Speaker 1: You have to listen to the music locally if you don't want to.

310
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:53,609
Speaker 1: all right.

311
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:59,070
Speaker 1: So it's and also the music has all been licensed by you know twitch so that it's safe to play.

312
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:02,190
Speaker 1: That's why they're providing it to you and there's actually a huge selection.

313
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:08,448
Speaker 1: But some of the songs in that library are stream only and not VOD safe.

314
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:16,370
Speaker 1: Yeah So even when twitch does it this, you know the legal and narrow way right to try to set something up for the users.

315
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,034
Speaker 1: It's still not perfect.

316
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,724
Speaker 0: Well the other brother but think about the buried lead of the two stories.

317
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:22,265
Speaker 0: We just did.

318
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:37,661
Speaker 0: what's really happening here is Multiple industries just in the last six months or so have started to get extra-aggressive on copyright enforcement in Really really age uses of their IP like they're going at.

319
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:45,304
Speaker 0: like it was one thing when like the RIA was going after just straight-up Music piracy like I still think music piracy back then was important and changed.

320
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,230
Speaker 0: like there's a lot of discourse to have there.

321
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:51,286
Speaker 0: But I at least understand why the music industry went after Napster.

322
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:52,230
Speaker 0: like that makes sense.

323
00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:00,232
Speaker 0: Napster directly took away their revenue of their product, but none of this stuff does at All.

324
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,256
Speaker 1: these are like people these days Depends on which parts.

325
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:09,197
Speaker 0: background music music that's in a video game That is not uninterrupted to listen to.

326
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:12,910
Speaker 0: that's incidental to a stream cannot take away revenue, but to your point.

327
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:14,636
Speaker 0: I'll just put on.

328
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:18,930
Speaker 0: if I want to hear a song like I think of a random song I'm sitting at my desk like oh I want to listen to X song.

329
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:22,090
Speaker 0: My go-to is just to type it into YouTube and watch some random exactly.

330
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are people though who don't use a Spotify.

331
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:26,690
Speaker 1: They don't use anything.

332
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,587
Speaker 1: They just go to YouTube and they'll make playlists on YouTube and YouTube is their music player.

333
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:39,730
Speaker 1: Yep On Twitch it's like yeah, if some guy has music playing let's say he's a streamer of out of the overwatch, right?

334
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's playing some you know music during his overwatch stream.

335
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,662
Speaker 1: Well, it's like.

336
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:51,952
Speaker 1: on the one hand it's like that is not replacing Listening to that music because you heard a bunch of like pew pew pew Right.

337
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:59,592
Speaker 1: No one's going to that stream to hear the music but that music is enhancing the stream and making it more watchable Right.

338
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:06,196
Speaker 1: So the compensation is really in that case the streamer owes Right the person who made the music.

339
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:11,090
Speaker 0: ah, but think about that old parable of the man who eats the bland rice.

340
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:17,241
Speaker 0: But he lives over a fish restaurant and the smell of the cooking fish Enhances his enjoyment of the rice.

341
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,870
Speaker 0: Does he owe their fish restaurant money?

342
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:21,629
Speaker 1: Well here he's you know, he's eating the fish here.

343
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:24,276
Speaker 0: but is he really eating the fish?

344
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:33,930
Speaker 0: what could could the people who could the Label that made that music make money that they would not have made if that stream didn't exist?

345
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:34,914
Speaker 1: Well, but his thing.

346
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:39,010
Speaker 1: would his stream have as many viewers if it only included the sounds of overwatch?

347
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,281
Speaker 1: Or would it be annoying and less it more painful to watch that stream?

348
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:44,569
Speaker 1: and the music makes the stream easier to watch.

349
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,635
Speaker 1: now He's got more viewers.

350
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:47,929
Speaker 1: He's making more money because he's using the person's music.

351
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:56,022
Speaker 0: but the streaming industry makes so little money to begin with and right well Fully enforced probably would not exist at all.

352
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,433
Speaker 0: Like our streaming culture would disappear Right.

353
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:02,650
Speaker 1: The other example is obviously someone just has a switch channel where they're a DJ and they're just playing music.

354
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that's not it's not.

355
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:06,010
Speaker 1: not all of it is their own music.

356
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,557
Speaker 1: And yeah, that is a replacement.

357
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:09,988
Speaker 1: like you could just not use Spotify and just go to twitch.

358
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,448
Speaker 0: and well I guess what I've noticed is that?

359
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:25,830
Speaker 0: Just in the last six or so months a lot of different IP holders are going after increasingly niche and incidental uses of their property That could not in any way affect their monetization.

360
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:32,530
Speaker 0: No, they got time because they're not doing other things and they might be desperate for revenue because kovat is the world economy.

361
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, no concerts.

362
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:34,617
Speaker 1: I need more.

363
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:35,399
Speaker 1: I need more money.

364
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:36,101
Speaker 0: Yep.

365
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:37,626
Speaker 1: I can't tour right now.

366
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:38,670
Speaker 1: get more and more money go.

367
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:44,909
Speaker 0: But this is just really Not the right path because all this is gonna do like in the modern internet culture.

368
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:47,516
Speaker 0: if Music is not used incidentally.

369
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:48,920
Speaker 0: It's not like the labels.

370
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,563
Speaker 0: make more money.

371
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:54,090
Speaker 0: instead the music that's not being heard disappears from popular consciousness.

372
00:26:55,057 --> 00:27:01,047
Speaker 1: Yes So but also if someone's if someone makes a song you can't pay them with exposure.

373
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,862
Speaker 0: Yep Well, this is the dueling thing.

374
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:15,813
Speaker 0: on one hand we need to be able to support the people who make art but on the other hand we need a Statutory way to protect people who remix and make new works that are using parts of original works like.

375
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:20,984
Speaker 0: we need a Compulsory license for sampling that includes a gratis version for people.

376
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:25,182
Speaker 1: there are there are like compulsory Let's listen to not like a lot of the places just aren't paying.

377
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:25,644
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:26,850
Speaker 1: They're just not doing it.

379
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,171
Speaker 0: That's it.

380
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:44,838
Speaker 0: The compulsory licenses are usually pricing out very small amateur or completely incidental uses Mmm because that attempt to codify that would be an army of lawyers and Congress and like five years of debate minimum like no one's willing to go down that road.

381
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:56,806
Speaker 0: and I think our culture is getting increasingly broken by draconian copyright enforcement by Owners of IP who are going after uses of their IP that do not materially affect their bottom line.

382
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,585
Speaker 1: It's also a smaller Problem in the world of problems.

383
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:01,170
Speaker 1: exactly.

384
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:08,170
Speaker 0: It's something that like I'm mad about and that scene is mad about but some random person on the street is more mad about other things.

385
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:09,720
Speaker 1: There's a pandemic.

386
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,270
Speaker 1: What do I care about copyright infringement?

387
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,721
Speaker 0: It's always been that way even during the good when the good times.

388
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,987
Speaker 0: I'm making quotes here.

389
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:16,750
Speaker 0: We're rolling.

390
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:19,418
Speaker 0: How many people knew what the CBD tPA was?

391
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,442
Speaker 0: how many people still?

392
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,030
Speaker 0: I still know what CBD tPA stood for?

393
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,947
Speaker 0: Because that's how mad I was about it.

394
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:30,148
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah, you know you just get you have to in order to solve those kinds of less important problems.

395
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:30,670
Speaker 0: We had communism.

396
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,100
Speaker 1: Well, you got to make got to solve all the big problems first.

397
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,888
Speaker 1: Then suddenly that will be the biggest problem.

398
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:45,446
Speaker 0: So incidental to this today I saw a Terrible take that's related to this on Twitter and it's news.

399
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:46,290
Speaker 1: I think I saw the same.

400
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:47,349
Speaker 1: I think I saw the same take.

401
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:48,795
Speaker 0: Yeah because I think I even retweeted.

402
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:54,014
Speaker 0: but basically what this person said was I'm gonna quote the tweet first because it gets back to one of the things we just talked about.

403
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:54,395
Speaker 0: quote.

404
00:28:54,937 --> 00:29:03,063
Speaker 0: the real truth is that streamers should be paying the developers and publishers of The games they stream not even music.

405
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,368
Speaker 0: We're talking about the games themselves.

406
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:09,010
Speaker 0: quote They should be buying a license like any real business and paying for the content they use.

407
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,410
Speaker 0: They think that if I'm playing overwatch and I'm streaming overwatch, I should have to pay licensing fees to blizzard for that privilege, right?

408
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:17,996
Speaker 1: Well, there's two.

409
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,410
Speaker 1: there's two angles on this, right?

410
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,906
Speaker 1: So I saw another tweet responding to that person.

411
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:24,934
Speaker 1: Yeah a person Twitter thread, right?

412
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:30,270
Speaker 1: The response is like look if you're a game developer publisher, right?

413
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:38,417
Speaker 1: There is literally no better way to spend your advertising marketing budget than to pay Streamers to play your game.

414
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:38,999
Speaker 1: This is up.

415
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,950
Speaker 1: We're not talking here about like, you know?

416
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,862
Speaker 1: Hey, you know this is for exposure, right?

417
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,389
Speaker 1: This is buying advertising.

418
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,676
Speaker 0: Yeah Here's ten grand.

419
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,270
Speaker 0: play my video game for a month, right?

420
00:29:51,670 --> 00:30:07,551
Speaker 1: If you it that if you have ten grand to spend an advertising your game Giving it to big, you know giving it to convince a big streamer to play your game Translates into more sales of your game than any other way you could spend those ten thousand dollars You know.

421
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:16,024
Speaker 1: putting ads on YouTube putting a booth at a convention You know any kind of anything that you can think of to advertise your game.

422
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:23,270
Speaker 1: radio ads TV ads None of those will work as well as just getting some popular streamer to play the game, right?

423
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:29,950
Speaker 1: So if a streamer playing the game is is literally just advertising the game, right?

424
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:34,281
Speaker 1: It's like why would the streamer pay the person who made the game?

425
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:42,570
Speaker 0: They're doing them a huge never mind the fact that 99.9% of streamers make Dozens of dollars streaming.

426
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:51,478
Speaker 0: There are not many streamers who make real money and most of the streamers you think make real money if you count the hours They put into that bullshit.

427
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,188
Speaker 0: They're not making much money right.

428
00:30:55,291 --> 00:31:03,917
Speaker 1: so yeah on the one hand if you look at it and you say hey the streamer is making their money from these subscriptions and They're using you know, they're.

429
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:06,769
Speaker 1: they're using this artwork that someone else made for free.

430
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:16,170
Speaker 1: Right, if you look at that relationship, it's sort of like yeah the streamer probably, you know, I'm playing Mario and People subscribe to me to watch the Mario.

431
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:25,190
Speaker 1: Then you know, first of all There's the argument that they're there to see me and the Mario to some extent right or they would watch me no matter what?

432
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,516
Speaker 1: I was playing right?

433
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:29,470
Speaker 1: How much are they paying to see the Mario part, right?

434
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:35,269
Speaker 1: So there's some portion of that subscription money that belongs to me no matter what I stream because there's there to see me.

435
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:49,621
Speaker 1: Yep, but even if they're not there to see me, they're mostly there to see the game, you know, okay so some portion of the subscription money could arguably go to Nintendo when I play Mario, but right That's not where the big money comes from.

436
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,158
Speaker 1: even if you're a big-time streamer The subs are not the big money right.

437
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:57,668
Speaker 1: the big money is those side deals the advertising deals.

438
00:31:57,728 --> 00:32:05,330
Speaker 1: people pay you To drink their product and show their ads on your the side of your stream or play their game.

439
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,123
Speaker 1: Right, that's where the big streaming money comes from.

440
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:12,650
Speaker 1: and in that relationship Obviously you aren't paying the advert.

441
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,001
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you paid me to advertise your product now.

442
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,710
Speaker 1: I have to pay you because I'm advertising her your brother.

443
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,573
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't make.

444
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,483
Speaker 0: and especially because what is someone if you sell a game?

445
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,534
Speaker 0: a game is an experience someone interacts with So it can't.

446
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:29,130
Speaker 0: it's by definition not the same experience to watch someone else play that game.

447
00:32:30,512 --> 00:32:30,754
Speaker 1: It's like.

448
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:38,720
Speaker 1: it's like saying like free demos shouldn't exist You can't you know, you're not allowed to give a game away for free Yeah, so this gets like the the yeah.

449
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:56,494
Speaker 0: at the end the the artists working for exposure argument like gets entangled in there and it's you know, and Big part of this is that too many people are trying to squeeze as like this tiny amount of monetization Out of like.

450
00:32:56,514 --> 00:33:05,189
Speaker 0: they're trying to squeeze the last blood out of that stone instead of fixing the more fundamental problem Like the way everyone's exploited in this entire process.

451
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:13,421
Speaker 0: Basically, but the reason why this was notable is that the person who said this was Alex Hutchinson Who is and I don't know that person.

452
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,430
Speaker 0: He's the creative director for Google Stadia.

453
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:21,055
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah Now I did not a little.

454
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:25,490
Speaker 0: not that I was jazzed about Google Stadia, but I'm definitely less jazzed about Google Stadia.

455
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,610
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could be less jazzed.

456
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,748
Speaker 0: I mean you think that but how many times have I thought well 2020 couldn't really get any worse?

457
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:44,709
Speaker 0: and then here Yeah but anyway things Of the day, so I'm gonna try to use another spooky thing in the day.

458
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,925
Speaker 0: So if you're not familiar with the band lemon demon, you should be.

459
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:50,733
Speaker 0: they're a great band though They were.

460
00:33:51,055 --> 00:34:05,141
Speaker 0: they made a bunch of albums and then around 2008 They just kind of disappeared for a long time and then out of nowhere and I want to say 2016 or 2017 they came back with Spirit phone possibly their best album.

461
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:10,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay lemon demon, by the way That's Neil Cisaraga basically because he's literally made everything.

462
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:13,530
Speaker 0: but lemon demons a legit good band like their albums are great.

463
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:24,010
Speaker 0: spirit phone has a song in it about a ghost boyfriend called soft fuzzy man and This YouTube channel has made an animated fan video.

464
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,610
Speaker 0: That is a fan made music video to the lemon demon song soft fuzzy man.

465
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:32,090
Speaker 0: It is both spooky and funny and it's also really well animated.

466
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:34,928
Speaker 0: Okay, that's my thing of the day.

467
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,123
Speaker 1: Alright, so Adobe's convention Adobe maxed is what they call it.

468
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:41,909
Speaker 1: I think it happens every once in a while.

469
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,272
Speaker 1: I don't know.

470
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:43,699
Speaker 1: I'm not pay that much attention to it.

471
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,730
Speaker 1: But that's when they usually make a bunch of announcements.

472
00:34:45,830 --> 00:35:13,330
Speaker 1: They show off all sorts of fancy new features and then the entire Adobe creative suite gets updated for free for everyone for indirect free Cuz you're paying a subscription, but that's when all the updates come out literally every I think creative cloud application got updates vast updates huge ones, but the ones that are really Getting a lot of talk especially amongst people who aren't you know heavy, you know Adobe creative cloud users are the new neural filters in Photoshop, right?

473
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:23,216
Speaker 1: So Photoshop for years now has had the ability to do many many things But you needed to be very skilled to do a lot of these things, you know You need to learn Photoshop.

474
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:26,450
Speaker 1: do Photoshop tutorials practice learn tools, right?

475
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,219
Speaker 1: So for example, you want to make a sad person look happy.

476
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,808
Speaker 1: Photoshop could have done that last year the year before, right?

477
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,175
Speaker 1: But it's hard to do now.

478
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:35,881
Speaker 1: They have literally not.

479
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,125
Speaker 1: this is not an exaggeration.

480
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:45,548
Speaker 1: You can go to neural filters you can check happiness and there's a slider that goes from left to right and you can You just draw a box around the face.

481
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:55,722
Speaker 1: So it knows what face you're looking at and you can make the person happier or less happy or older or more Surprised or make their hair thicker.

482
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:57,409
Speaker 0: it kind of just works.

483
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:04,374
Speaker 1: It's you know, I mean obviously, you know, you know, if you use it Spent, you know correctly.

484
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:08,268
Speaker 1: It's it's kind of amazing what it can do and also kind of scary.

485
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:13,790
Speaker 1: So This person with a YouTube channel that doesn't have too many videos, so I don't know much about them.

486
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:22,996
Speaker 1: But I do notice that their background is a CompUSA logo and all of their shelves are full of PC game boxes.

487
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:26,710
Speaker 1: I have never seen that many PC game boxes in one place.

488
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:38,010
Speaker 1: I've never seen anyone who keeps PC game boxes like back until Even back in the day when I would keep you know console game cases, right?

489
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,285
Speaker 1: It's like the cardboard PC game boxes were useless.

490
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,410
Speaker 0: I would I kept the boxes.

491
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,350
Speaker 0: We had them lined up in a big shelf above the computer.

492
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,799
Speaker 1: It's like you'd buy something like mech warrior 2 and it else.

493
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,510
Speaker 1: a CD jewel case comes out and the cardboard goes in the trash.

494
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:52,007
Speaker 0: Well, most of those boxes were full of a lot of floppy disks.

495
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:59,470
Speaker 1: for me Also, most of those boxes were that large so that they could stand out on the shelves at CompUSA anyway.

496
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,250
Speaker 1: So that's what I know about this person.

497
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,329
Speaker 1: But what this person does is they made a funny video?

498
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:13,430
Speaker 1: where they took a photo of themselves and they went to Photoshop and they really went wild with the Photoshop neural filters to hilarious results.

499
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:17,547
Speaker 1: And it's only two minutes long, but I was I was laughing.

500
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,595
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm gonna try it out on myself.

501
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,201
Speaker 0: Later in the moment.

502
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,485
Speaker 0: We got nothing going on.

503
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,090
Speaker 0: We'll read the tale of Genji at some point.

504
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,294
Speaker 0: We're not reading anything right now.

505
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:29,105
Speaker 0: Our panel from PAX online is just on YouTube.

506
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:29,988
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

507
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:31,336
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

508
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:32,222
Speaker 0: probably next week.

509
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,410
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put up the panel.

510
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:42,109
Speaker 0: We did the short panel at mag West our first appearance at mag West the West Coast iteration of mag fest.

511
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:50,682
Speaker 1: So also I do notice that packs and mag West are both uploading on their YouTube channels Individual videos of various panels not ours.

512
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:52,470
Speaker 1: I think ours would probably be like last in the list.

513
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are uploading some.

514
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:54,990
Speaker 1: they might get to ours at some point.

515
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:59,590
Speaker 0: Ours is on the YouTube channel already, but it's in the like day six stream.

516
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:03,650
Speaker 1: They're cutting them up and splitting them out now slowly over time.

517
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:10,597
Speaker 0: Yeah But what I uploaded is the director's cut that is edited the way we would edit a panel compared to the format I had to use for packs.

518
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:19,273
Speaker 0: There are no material differences though Like I'm not gonna I think like I edited out one more cough and like camera angles and like zoom anything on slides like that Kind of stuff.

519
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:19,917
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

520
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:25,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the only other meta I guess we got to say is come look for us on the internet.

Speaker 0: We did werewolves the other day.

539
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,425
Speaker 0: vampires are too big of a topic like.

540
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,870
Speaker 0: that's a big big topic.

541
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:05,288
Speaker 0: So I figured this is a good one because goes getting back to James Randi.

542
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:08,601
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I didn't believe in Bigfoot.

543
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,849
Speaker 0: Like that was obviously stupid even to my kid.

544
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,709
Speaker 0: brain Didn't believe in a lot of nonsense.

545
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,861
Speaker 0: But when I was a kid, I believe I believed in aliens.

546
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,290
Speaker 0: for I believed in aliens and I believe in ghosts.

547
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:27,345
Speaker 0: And you know why some bullshit on TV that yes, I watch to Mysteries which I thought was a news broadcast even though it said at the beginning.

548
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,630
Speaker 0: This is not a news broadcast.

549
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:34,310
Speaker 0: It looked like one to me and my grandma had a giant pile of Fate magazine.

550
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:36,496
Speaker 0: Fate magazine was in publication.

551
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:38,482
Speaker 0: ever heard of it really since the 40s.

552
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,789
Speaker 0: It was this magazine that is basically.

553
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:43,676
Speaker 0: it Is everything James Randi hated on earth.

554
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:44,318
Speaker 0: it like it.

555
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,010
Speaker 0: an episode an issue would be like new evidence about UFOs.

556
00:39:48,533 --> 00:40:00,505
Speaker 0: Here's a story about a ghost that murdered someone The crystal skull is back and claimed another victim but it was a hundred percent dead serious and presented like real news.

557
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:06,940
Speaker 0: and my kid brain I'd see like Reader's Digest which not a great magazine, but I digress.

558
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:08,846
Speaker 1: actually it was weird.

559
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:19,626
Speaker 1: Like I remember Reading and liking some portion of Reader's Digest when I had access to it at some point in my life It was always in the dentist's offices, but I can't remember a damn thing.

560
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,490
Speaker 1: I ever read in there.

561
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,323
Speaker 0: I remember all of all the I read.

562
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:23,230
Speaker 0: a lot of readers died.

563
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,133
Speaker 0: Not one thing.

564
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:33,049
Speaker 0: both my dentist and my orthodontist as a kid had just piles of like 10 year old I think I liked like the form factor of it like this small thing.

565
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:35,015
Speaker 1: That's all I remember.

566
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:36,883
Speaker 1: all I remember about it was the form factor.

567
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:38,490
Speaker 1: I don't remember anything about the content.

568
00:40:38,552 --> 00:40:47,404
Speaker 0: Not one thing In fact, the other thing I remember is at least in the Midwest a lot of people's houses when I visited them Would have a pile of Reader's Digest in the bathroom next to every toilet.

569
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,010
Speaker 1: We didn't have my house.

570
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,990
Speaker 1: We never had our house weird.

571
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:53,358
Speaker 0: Well, we put it a lot at you're right.

572
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:02,261
Speaker 1: a lot of houses people had Reader's Digest time magazines TV guides all these sorts of things we house.

573
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,726
Speaker 1: We never had any of those.

574
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:04,770
Speaker 0: How did you poop?

575
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,623
Speaker 0: How could you talk?

576
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:08,529
Speaker 0: Could you possibly poop?

577
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:10,139
Speaker 1: We just never had any of those.

578
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:10,882
Speaker 0: We are.

579
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:17,246
Speaker 0: we left in our bathrooms where we had second copies of like Calvin and Hobbes and Bloom County Compilations of comics.

580
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:20,200
Speaker 0: we always left those in the bathroom instead of the Reader's Digest.

581
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:24,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but fake made fake magazine.

582
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:31,060
Speaker 0: Basically, my little kid brain would like see that and see like Newsweek and Reader's Digest and all these things and they were all equivalent.

583
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,265
Speaker 0: They must be real.

584
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,515
Speaker 0: Why would adults publish something that was fake?

585
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:37,334
Speaker 0: So I'd open this thing He'd be like, oh the crystal skull killed someone.

586
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:48,119
Speaker 0: Oh So I kind of just believed ghosts were real until like fifth grade Like fifth or sixth grade is when I think I'd stop believing that ghosts were real.

587
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:51,780
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think I ever actually believed ghosts are real.

588
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,754
Speaker 1: But I always liked ghosts and now and like as I got older actually like ghosts more.

589
00:41:56,854 --> 00:41:59,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like ghost stories a lot Like.

590
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:01,520
Speaker 0: I really like a good ghost story.

591
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:07,857
Speaker 1: So the thing with the ghost right is unlike, you know, the other ones the vampire werewolf, right?

592
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:13,414
Speaker 1: There isn't like this single firm, you know definition of ghosts.

593
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:14,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much like any.

594
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:24,714
Speaker 1: It doesn't even necessarily have to be back from the dead even though it usually is but it's just sort of an incorporeal You know sentient spirit of some kind.

595
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:26,080
Speaker 1: Yeah is a ghost, right?

596
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,460
Speaker 1: You know, this is stereotypical vision of a white sheet that can go through walls.

597
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:37,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, Casper whatever but doesn't have to be that it could just be like, you know, there's this bad juju who's around right?

598
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,632
Speaker 1: You're feeling you know uneasy and something's talking at you.

599
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:43,759
Speaker 1: It doesn't have an actual appearance, right?

600
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:50,248
Speaker 1: Yeah But but then you get like and you get stuff like, you know The Holy Ghost or the ghost of Christmas past.

601
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,515
Speaker 0: there are specific ghosts or you get a D&D.

602
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:56,571
Speaker 0: ghosts and ghasts and ghouls are all different things About D&D.

603
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:57,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

604
00:42:57,237 --> 00:43:02,260
Speaker 0: Yeah But I do really really like a good ghost story.

605
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,871
Speaker 0: It's hard like Pete you need a good storyteller.

606
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:05,534
Speaker 0: a ghost story.

607
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:06,860
Speaker 0: That's just by itself is not great.

608
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:12,660
Speaker 0: It has to be written well and have like the right ramp up of tension doesn't have to lead to a jump-scare.

609
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:16,160
Speaker 0: I like it when they lead leave kind of ambiguous endings.

610
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:24,502
Speaker 0: But I just I love a story that is supposedly true with quote marks about a ghost or a hunt of some kind Right.

611
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:25,485
Speaker 1: Well, I mean cuz that's the thing.

612
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:31,203
Speaker 1: So the ghost, you know an actual ghost like a ghost jumps out at you is not scary Right.

613
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:32,426
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

614
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:35,235
Speaker 1: There's some sort of incorporeal spirit that can't touch me.

615
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:36,218
Speaker 1: What can you do?

616
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:36,980
Speaker 1: make me cold?

617
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:41,700
Speaker 1: It's like if it comes through my body, it's like, you know, they're not actually frightening.

618
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,107
Speaker 0: Well, it depends what kind of goes.

619
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:43,711
Speaker 0: what is it goes?

620
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:49,272
Speaker 0: they can like actually kill you Maybe okay, so usually they're not like most ghost stories.

621
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:51,739
Speaker 0: The ghost can't actually like kill you.

622
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:53,820
Speaker 1: Usually we're not you're not directly.

623
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:00,399
Speaker 0: Yeah Usually when it goes kill someone in a ghost story It's because they the person themselves is so afraid that something else kills them.

624
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:01,886
Speaker 1: Right exactly.

625
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:05,060
Speaker 1: So I think the classic ghost story is like The Shining, right?

626
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's your that's your scary ghost story.

627
00:44:07,468 --> 00:44:10,600
Speaker 0: Those ghosts only do anything to him if they were even real.

628
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:13,931
Speaker 1: But that's that's exactly it is it's.

629
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:16,962
Speaker 1: there's just there were dead people Right.

630
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:25,145
Speaker 1: their spirits though of those dead people are still about despite them being dead and they're probably Upset, right?

631
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:25,567
Speaker 1: They're not.

632
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,314
Speaker 1: they're not happy having a good time.

633
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:33,854
Speaker 1: Casper the friendly ghost, you know They could be right and so it's not about the ghost itself right.

634
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:35,960
Speaker 1: alien is about the alien, right?

635
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,000
Speaker 1: You know zombie movie is about the zombies coming to get you, right?

636
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,589
Speaker 0: Is about sexy ghosts, but that's a.

637
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:57,424
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you are even old enough to have seen ghosts Right, but but a classic ghost story That's a scary horror type one right and not a sexy one or a friendly one is Not about ghosts.

638
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:59,650
Speaker 1: It's about what human is do.

639
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,713
Speaker 1: it's a human story.

640
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:07,991
Speaker 1: But what do humans do in the presence of Malevolent, you know past dead people, right?

641
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:10,278
Speaker 1: It's like it's like an environment.

642
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:21,086
Speaker 1: almost now Here are okay people and they're stuck in a place and that play or you know, not only stuck in a place But they are haunted by Dead people now.

643
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:29,220
Speaker 0: that is why I persist like when I was a little kid I stopped believing in UFOs around like first or second grade, but ghosts hung on for a while.

644
00:45:29,642 --> 00:45:36,260
Speaker 0: But partly because as a kid I made this sort of connection that Obviously most ghost stories are fake like Bigfoot.

645
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:45,460
Speaker 0: But I had this vague idea that maybe it's plausible that like if something happens in the world So strongly it would like leave an imprint on the world.

646
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:52,191
Speaker 0: Probably because like Fate magazine explained ghosts that way at one point and it just seeped into my brain Like I had a kid brain.

647
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:53,759
Speaker 0: plausible explanation for them.

648
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:57,293
Speaker 0: But Bigfoot was even to like a kindergartners brain.

649
00:45:57,313 --> 00:45:59,220
Speaker 0: like that is obviously a guy in a gorilla suit.

650
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:18,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't remember if this was on one of the Like more popular shows like unsolved mysteries or a different show But I remember as a kid seeing a show and the story they told or they retold with actors right reenact Was that this family moved to a new house?

651
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,060
Speaker 1: It was it was out of the house or I think the bunk beds that they bought.

652
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,454
Speaker 0: Wait, I remember a ghost story about haunted bunk beds specifically.

653
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:27,900
Speaker 1: It was it was something like that.

654
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,185
Speaker 1: Maybe it was the same one.

655
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:29,486
Speaker 1: I don't know.

656
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,370
Speaker 1: and what happened?

657
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,001
Speaker 1: the story was that I remember is pretty simple right.

658
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:41,039
Speaker 1: is that they either it was either moving into a house or buying this furniture and They suddenly after they bought it, right?

659
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,966
Speaker 1: Bad things start.

660
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:52,197
Speaker 1: normal, right and not normal, but you know non Supernatural bad things started haunted bunk beds in Wisconsin that tormented the horror account family.

661
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:53,160
Speaker 0: I remember this photo.

662
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:53,844
Speaker 0: I think it's this.

663
00:46:53,865 --> 00:46:58,682
Speaker 1: it could be that it could very well be Sick.

664
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,633
Speaker 0: it was depicted in unsolved mysteries in 1988.

665
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:02,617
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was.

666
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:08,717
Speaker 0: so it was on You and I watched the same fucking episode of unsolved mysteries in 1988.

667
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:11,711
Speaker 1: probably This is the only episode on solve mysteries.

668
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:13,380
Speaker 1: I remember it happens to be a ghost one.

669
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:17,034
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I think I watched a George Washington's ghost in a hotel one once also.

670
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:33,198
Speaker 1: I remember that one, too But that was yeah, but basically like the kids kept getting sick things in the house were breaking basically completely Non-supernatural bad things kept happening and then coincidentally they got rid of the beds and the bad things stopped happening.

671
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:46,200
Speaker 0: Yeah Now obviously in retrospect like the reality is situations like that are usually people making post-hoc correlations because that's what our brains are good at but and also probably exaggerating the bad things that were happening.

672
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:59,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but to a kid brain Or to a non-wise adult brain but also the story someone who is not Aligned with the teachings of the great James Randi.

673
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,173
Speaker 0: Yeah But just like the story of like this object has malevolence.

674
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:10,099
Speaker 0: just like haunted paintings were a thing for a while Remember the hands resist him and the whole early internet like was obsessed with this haunted painting.

675
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,731
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly That sort of thing is like.

676
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:15,220
Speaker 1: that's actually scary, right?

677
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 1: It's like I'm not scared by like a dude in a sheet or like a thing coming around going like whoo.

678
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,329
Speaker 1: It's like that's not scary.

679
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,500
Speaker 0: You're scared by the aura.

680
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:24,404
Speaker 1: It's like right.

681
00:48:24,464 --> 00:48:28,820
Speaker 1: it's like you're living here and just bad shit that's real is just gonna keep happening to you.

682
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,845
Speaker 1: You're gonna keep getting sick.

683
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:31,291
Speaker 1: It's like I'll get me the fuck out of there.

684
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:33,300
Speaker 1: All right, that's a bad bad place.

685
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:34,374
Speaker 1: Don't want to be there?

686
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact a while about a year we were at a wedding.

687
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:42,915
Speaker 0: God it's weird to think back to like pre kovat times when I would like go out to a place.

688
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:55,011
Speaker 0: but we're out of this really really fun wedding and people are hanging around a campfire late at night and a bunch of them were smoking a joint and ever just like super chill and Someone who wants to start telling ghost stories.

689
00:48:55,071 --> 00:49:04,138
Speaker 0: everyone goes around telling ghost stories and the thing I love the most about ghost stories is that almost everyone even if like most people don't believe in ghosts like literally.

690
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:12,631
Speaker 0: but Ask almost anyone and they have at least one ghost story that they can just tell Unprompted like hey, do you know any ghost stories?

691
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:13,334
Speaker 1: Yeah.

692
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:14,560
Speaker 1: Yeah the story of the haunted bunk.

693
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,979
Speaker 1: Oh Is that all you gotta say?

694
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,429
Speaker 0: yeah, I was going anywhere with that.

695
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:29,906
Speaker 1: Okay, like I said The best ghost stories are the ones much like the bunk bed where you don't have to ever.

696
00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:32,922
Speaker 1: when you're telling the ghost story You're like your structure.

697
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:40,711
Speaker 1: the structure is People enter scenario set the scene right bad things start happening Right.

698
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:43,405
Speaker 1: Maybe there are dire consequences.

699
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:44,330
Speaker 1: Maybe people die.

700
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,072
Speaker 1: Maybe they don't.

701
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:45,855
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

702
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:47,481
Speaker 1: but bad things happen to the people.

703
00:49:48,022 --> 00:49:51,956
Speaker 1: right it escalates things are getting worse The people are getting scared right?

704
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,120
Speaker 1: What is what's?

705
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,987
Speaker 1: what is making all these things happen?

706
00:49:55,007 --> 00:50:02,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Discovery right you discover some source of them that could explain the malevolence.

707
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:16,613
Speaker 0: be it, you know The classic racist burial ground story or you know All the dead people who used to work in this Story in scary stories to tell them the dark that scared my kid brain the most which was just about a family moves into a House.

708
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:24,662
Speaker 0: they start one night They hear all this noise in the attic and they go up and a chair is like bouncing around by itself And they're freaked out by it, but they go back to bed.

709
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:26,170
Speaker 0: They're like, whatever that's weird.

710
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:32,870
Speaker 0: And then like it keeps bouncing around they go up again and eventually it like keeps bouncing around in one spot.

711
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:43,970
Speaker 0: So they like investigate the area and they see the floorboards where they pull him up and there's a dead body like a skeleton in there Mm-hmm, and then the family's like well fuck this and they just leave the house.

712
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,656
Speaker 0: That's the end like they don't actually solve it.

713
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:56,930
Speaker 1: But but the point is you're finding some explanation or some reasoning Behind this supernatural source of anger, but you don't need a hard link to link the events to that.

714
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:58,669
Speaker 0: You just need a soft link.

715
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:00,494
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

716
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:05,110
Speaker 1: There's some thing that was upset in the past that is, you know, disturbed.

717
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:05,773
Speaker 1: It is not.

718
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:07,039
Speaker 1: that's why it can't rest.

719
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:07,702
Speaker 1: Right?

720
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:17,766
Speaker 1: It's angry right, you know Someone was mistreated in this area somebody, you know They're whole had a life story like such-and-such and then they died.

721
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:22,089
Speaker 1: and you know There's some connection to this place or this thing, right?

722
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:31,050
Speaker 1: You know something like that and then you can either a resolve it, you know You appease the ghost so we can so we can pass on right?

723
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,013
Speaker 1: Yeah be at peace.

724
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:35,650
Speaker 1: or you you flee or destroy it or you know.

725
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,156
Speaker 1: You got multiple endings to choose from.

726
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:38,822
Speaker 1: you know, choose whichever one you like.

727
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,870
Speaker 1: All right, that's ghost story 101.

728
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:52,251
Speaker 0: now the other thing I really like about ghost stories though, is that if you take like historical ghost stories and legends and even like popular ghost stories, you can usually categorize them into like a Like.

729
00:51:52,271 --> 00:52:20,617
Speaker 0: there's a limited number of categories of ghosts that are pretty common and you can bucket almost all ghost stories into one of those categories But I'm particularly fascinated by the fact that many of those buckets Have a modern like recently discovered like physiological or psychological trigger like we can explain that kind of ghost story when someone Experienced it directly like when someone has the lived experience with a ghost event Like sleep paralysis is one like.

730
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:26,155
Speaker 0: a lot of ghost stories boil down to the symptoms of experiencing sleep paralysis specifically Right.

731
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:29,530
Speaker 1: So somebody at some point in history had sleep paralysis.

732
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,664
Speaker 1: They suffered from it and their explanation from it for it.

733
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:40,672
Speaker 1: not knowing what sleep paralysis was They said I woke up at night and it couldn't move and I heard noises and I was definitely oh my god It was hot Scott.

734
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:41,857
Speaker 0: You realize it's worse than that.

735
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:44,246
Speaker 0: Did you ever experience sleep paralysis or no?

736
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:48,439
Speaker 0: Thank God No, I've read about it's way creepier than you think.

737
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,422
Speaker 0: it's not just.

738
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:50,586
Speaker 0: you wake up and can't move.

739
00:52:51,007 --> 00:53:06,159
Speaker 0: you wake up and can't move And many times like the majority of the times you will sense a presence Floating over you and sometimes even see like a shadow shaped like a person Floating over you or someone standing at the foot of your bed.

740
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:15,890
Speaker 0: It's that specific in its psychological and physiological effects And and you'll also feel a physical has the pressure on your chest that has a physiological cause.

741
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:23,841
Speaker 0: So if you experience that and and you go to a doctor of your time and the doctor says fuck if I know Nothing that must have been a ghost.

742
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:24,929
Speaker 0: I can't explain that.

743
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:27,476
Speaker 0: Can't fault that person for believing in ghosts.

744
00:53:28,299 --> 00:53:29,101
Speaker 1: No, we can't.

745
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:30,204
Speaker 1: you really can't right.

746
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:31,848
Speaker 1: but now we know a sleep paralysis.

747
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:35,838
Speaker 0: Yep Or like in for sound was another one.

748
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:37,643
Speaker 0: like that unexplained feeling of dread.

749
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:42,675
Speaker 0: people would get in places where there were certain loo Like really low frequencies.

750
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:50,296
Speaker 0: There's or ghost orbs that early photographers would talk about and idiot nerds today Still talk about that are literally just.

751
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 0: they don't know how flashes work and they got a bunch of dust.

752
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:56,130
Speaker 1: or you know Straight-up illusions, right?

753
00:53:57,351 --> 00:54:03,121
Speaker 1: You know mentalists are very good at getting people to believe that you know the ghost of their loved one is nearby right.

754
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:13,669
Speaker 1: using various mentalist tricks and seances and those sorts of things are very good at tricking people into like Thinking there's an actual ghost right there by using, you know, technology that creates imagery.

755
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:22,490
Speaker 1: You know, you can go to the haunted house in Disney World and see ghosts and I didn't know that that was just a you know, a trick of mirrors and light or be like

756
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,450
Speaker 0: One time in high school, I actually remember I was out I was out in the woods.

757
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,137
Speaker 0: It's like haunted mansion haunted mansion.

758
00:54:30,177 --> 00:54:32,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was out in the woods just biking like.

759
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:33,070
Speaker 0: that's what I do a lot at night.

760
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,890
Speaker 0: There was like a biking trail through the woods I would bike through in the middle of the night.

761
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,188
Speaker 0: That was just a thing I would do.

762
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:41,569
Speaker 0: and I remember one time I was like biking over toward this place to bike around a bit and then meet some kids.

763
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:42,233
Speaker 0: we're gonna Hang out.

764
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:51,470
Speaker 0: and I saw like this Very clear like orb of light just come down from the sky into the woods and I was like what the fuck was that?

765
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:56,229
Speaker 0: And of course, I'm gonna go straight in to figure like go find that like I'm not just gonna let that go.

766
00:54:56,832 --> 00:54:58,502
Speaker 1: Someone on a helicopter drop the flashlight.

767
00:54:58,683 --> 00:54:59,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

768
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:12,463
Speaker 0: long story short I eventually figured out that there's there's a pond like kind of like in that area in the woods and I went over there Car a car's headlight reflected off cars headlight Reflected like just the right way and made it look like that.

769
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:26,838
Speaker 0: because while I was there it happened again And I figured it out and I was like, okay Because the one thing about all the spooky stuff is that like James ready would often also say I wish this stuff were real like Yes, yes and no, right.

770
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:34,085
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, cuz I do wish it was real because I want to come back and haunt some people But I don't wish it's real because they don't want to get haunted.

771
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:41,829
Speaker 0: Yep Well, like see our friends go Joe would always say if you just find one thing like you find one vampire Nothing's off the table anymore.

772
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,978
Speaker 0: That's true Fact that we've never found even one is very telling.

773
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:50,770
Speaker 1: but uh, yeah, so I guess the last thing right is that.

774
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:58,890
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not the last thing but so because ghosts don't have this like sort of clear definition, right?

775
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like where we're all.

776
00:56:00,135 --> 00:56:04,453
Speaker 0: like everyone knows the rules or vampires or everyone knows the rules Everything.

777
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:12,908
Speaker 1: it's almost like every haunted thing in the world That isn't clearly a vampire a mummy a monster, you know, whatever is a ghost.

778
00:56:13,813 --> 00:56:16,310
Speaker 1: It's like this catch-all of them all.

779
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:22,050
Speaker 1: You know evil things right that that are haunt and horror that aren't you know?

780
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,079
Speaker 1: Visible and corporeal and there they are.

781
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:38,012
Speaker 1: I can see it and define it is goes goes to just like this Yes, catch all hate I hate has gotten you Sure, you know actually that that makes me obviously different cultures and languages have a lot of different views and I'm not Educated.

782
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:47,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, well like Japanese ghost stories very very different from American ghost stories American Southern ghost stories are like this particular genre of ghost story.

783
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:53,010
Speaker 0: But actually I realized another thing about ghost stories that plays off of what you just said.

784
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,657
Speaker 0: I only realized this just now.

785
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:59,289
Speaker 0: a trope of a lot of good ghost stories Is that in the course of the story?

786
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:09,750
Speaker 0: Either the person telling the story because they're telling it quote from memory or like the characters Are trying to figure out the rules of the ghost because there are no preconceived rules.

787
00:57:10,714 --> 00:57:11,980
Speaker 1: No, it's all dependent.

788
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:17,019
Speaker 1: It's dependent on that Discovery of why the spirits are angry.

789
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,430
Speaker 1: It's like ah now we under now we understand this ghost, right?

790
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,390
Speaker 1: This ghost is is such-and-such right but like.

791
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:26,618
Speaker 0: It's like oh, it's a vampire.

792
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,110
Speaker 0: All right garlic don't invite him in whatever werewolf.

793
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:36,274
Speaker 0: There's no werewolf movie where people like figure out that silver is the way to get rid of the vampire Or the werewolf.

794
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:37,157
Speaker 1: It's like right.

795
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:41,570
Speaker 1: It's like oh, this is a ghost who you know, their boss treated them poorly.

796
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:42,215
Speaker 1: We need to.

797
00:57:42,256 --> 00:57:43,809
Speaker 1: we need to murder the boss, right?

798
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,501
Speaker 1: Still alive somewhere so the spirit can be at peace right?

799
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:52,869
Speaker 1: or oh, this is a spirit of somebody Who is an evil person?

800
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,286
Speaker 1: Right, and I guess you know, they can't move on.

801
00:57:57,326 --> 00:58:01,474
Speaker 1: They don't want to go to hell Come up with you know, whatever.

802
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:06,607
Speaker 1: but that that circumstance of the ghost is gonna change the rules of how you deal with it.

803
00:58:06,928 --> 00:58:11,189
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And I was about to say we were talking about with like we did the werewolf show.

804
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:16,062
Speaker 0: Werewolves come go through this cycle of like scary werewolves sexy werewolves.

805
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:17,545
Speaker 0: werewolves really aren't in pop culture.

806
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:18,969
Speaker 0: Just like all monsters do.

807
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:23,550
Speaker 0: Have there been sexy ghosts again since the movie ghost?

808
00:58:24,332 --> 00:58:25,637
Speaker 0: Was that the last time goes?

809
00:58:25,677 --> 00:58:33,179
Speaker 1: I think I mean I. I don't think ghosts occupy all the different categories But you know cute and friendly ghost has always been a thing.

810
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:33,700
Speaker 1: Definitely.

811
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,370
Speaker 0: I mean Casper is a really really old intellectual property.

812
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got you got boo that my favorite.

813
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,250
Speaker 0: who is not friendly?

814
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:42,673
Speaker 1: He is.

815
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,219
Speaker 0: no he's not he's dangerous.

816
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:45,545
Speaker 1: If you just look at him and he goes.

817
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,850
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it closes eyes.

818
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:48,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you look away and he fucking works you.

819
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:51,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't look away.

820
00:58:51,404 --> 00:58:53,769
Speaker 1: Look at the cute ghost It's not that hard.

821
00:58:55,032 --> 00:59:06,850
Speaker 0: But yeah, well ghost and the unfortunate ghost blowjob from the deleted plot from Ghostbusters I guess spirit phone with your fuzzy, man.

822
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah Ghostbusters is a good one, right?

823
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:14,890
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, every time Ghostbusters go they're dealing with something different, right?

824
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:19,050
Speaker 1: You know Slimer is a ghost but he's like a green slime thing.

825
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:23,603
Speaker 1: Same lines beetle juice of Marsha for the space off marshmallow.

826
00:59:23,623 --> 00:59:25,510
Speaker 1: man's a ghost but he's like covering this.

827
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,720
Speaker 1: You know, it was on different beetle juice is a ghost.

828
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,629
Speaker 0: that that whole movie is about ghosts.

829
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:35,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that movie is literally about the rules of ghosts and that's a corporeal ghost.

830
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:39,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, those like you can't see him sometimes right?

831
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:41,810
Speaker 0: Well, he's corporeal, but the other ones really aren't.

832
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,321
Speaker 1: Sort of are but they're just like they're not always.

833
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:47,210
Speaker 1: they're not always corporeal.

834
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,457
Speaker 1: But you know the boys are still dead.

835
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:53,630
Speaker 1: there's still dead people right true better at unrest.

836
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:55,397
Speaker 1: So they can't carry on.

837
00:59:55,457 --> 01:00:02,781
Speaker 1: so that you know some other, you know, wherever this op-ed points out They boo does not help your argument He's the king of booze.

838
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:03,629
Speaker 1: He's not afraid anymore.

839
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,893
Speaker 0: But you know, I'm thinking about this to you that we were talking about Like.

840
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:12,390
Speaker 0: if you find one goes then like the floodgates are open.

841
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,975
Speaker 0: But how that could be a bad thing.

842
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,364
Speaker 0: think about like beetlejuice and Ghostbusters.

843
01:00:16,745 --> 01:00:22,352
Speaker 0: both of those imply They're very like love crafty and existential horror Like Ghostbusters.

844
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:29,210
Speaker 0: basically is a world where these four schmucks figure out that the cosmic horrors of space literally exist in the form of ghosts?

845
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:32,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much Beetlejuice.

846
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:35,400
Speaker 1: the afterlife is a ghostbusters ghosts, right?

847
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,869
Speaker 1: The Ghostbusters ghosts for the most part are not.

848
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:40,556
Speaker 1: I Think some of them are represented.

849
01:00:40,576 --> 01:00:42,742
Speaker 1: It's not like Ghostbusters tried that hard in this.

850
01:00:42,762 --> 01:00:46,836
Speaker 1: Yeah in this regards or I have making their mythology Consist including

851
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:47,662
Speaker 0: the cartoon -

852
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:53,842
Speaker 1: but yes some of the ghosts and Ghostbusters Clearly like there's the librarian ghost is the ghost of like a dead library

853
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:56,895
Speaker 0: or the electrocuted guy in the first in the opening scenes of Ghostbusters -

854
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:59,091
Speaker 1: Exactly.

855
01:00:59,151 --> 01:00:59,693
Speaker 1: That's a yeah.

856
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:04,450
Speaker 0: Most of them are like these jogging existential horrors that came from like Slimer.

857
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,676
Speaker 1: Slimer isn't like someone's dead pet.

858
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:07,439
Speaker 1: That was a mess.

859
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:13,741
Speaker 1: Slimer is some you know, I might have just been a really gross, dude It could have been but it's probably I think.

860
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:19,619
Speaker 0: but that little blue thing with Cordian neck and the big ears that thing wasn't a person.

861
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:24,609
Speaker 1: No wasn't not enough not in a it didn't have a previous life It's always goes.

862
01:01:26,193 --> 01:01:34,244
Speaker 1: So I guess uh, just one brief final thing is you know The aesthetic of a ghost right at the person wearing a sheet?

863
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:44,206
Speaker 1: and I just got to say I really like that Aesthetic of just like this sort of white, you know, not that not because it's white It just just the image like a pac-man ghost right?

864
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:50,941
Speaker 1: Those aren't white Like Charlie Brown where it is ghost costume Exactly like that aesthetic is like.

865
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:51,845
Speaker 1: I just like it.

866
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:52,850

01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,670
Speaker 0: remember in the episode of Captain Tyler where?

869
01:01:58,472 --> 01:02:01,629
Speaker 0: The ghosts are all around and he's dressed like a ghost and there's that whole plot.

870
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:05,525
Speaker 1: Far I don't know.

871
01:02:06,554 --> 01:02:07,138

873
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:08,930
Speaker 0: I think you fell asleep.

874
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,269
Speaker 0: That was the last episode we had at our IT.

875
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:17,550
Speaker 0: We were watching it in my dorm room and I remember you fell asleep and everyone else was watching so you didn't see that episode.

876
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:22,383
Speaker 1: But yeah, but you know just the aesthetic of the classic ghost imagery.

877
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:30,710
Speaker 1: you go to the Halloween store and you're like, you know You got like a string of ghosts on like a garland to hang on your door your side of your house or something.

878
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:33,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, miss lights or in a tree, you know, it's like.

01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:35,150
Speaker 1: That's you know.

881
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's looks it's bad.

882
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:40,085
Speaker 1: Like it's better imagery than like, you know that.

883
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:41,290
Speaker 1: or jack-o'-lantern?

884
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:46,550

885
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:50,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean skeletons also obviously way up there.

886
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,823
Speaker 1: All right, it's pretty much skeleton and ghosts.

887
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:52,565
Speaker 1: Those are the top two.

888
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:58,377
