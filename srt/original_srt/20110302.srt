1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,535
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, March 2nd.

2
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:11,217
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:11,879
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,005
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,009
Speaker 0: Tonight, My Little Pony with the magical friendships and such.

6
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:24,898
Speaker 0: Yep, let's do this.

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,346
Speaker 1: So I recall back in 2007.

8
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,171
Speaker 0: That's a long time ago.

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:30,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,260
Speaker 0: That's, that's like, that's forever.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,216
Speaker 1: And yet we'd been doing Geek Nights for a couple years before that.

12
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:40,751
Speaker 1: But, uh, we reviewed El Hazzard, the original O.A.V.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,000
Speaker 1: and we didn't actually rewatch it.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,319
Speaker 1: We just kind of reviewed it from memory because we'd watched it in the last few years.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,536
Speaker 0: Well, I think I did actually rewatch part of it.

16
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:50,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, part of it.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,450
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I don't remember.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,680
Speaker 1: We watched the whole thing.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,226
Speaker 0: I don't know.

20
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:53,838
Speaker 0: I don't think we did.

21
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,159
Speaker 1: So I'm actually kind of randomly watching it now.

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,002
Speaker 0: The O.A.V.

23
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:58,527
Speaker 0: or the TV?

24
00:00:58,588 --> 00:00:59,458
Speaker 1: Of course the O.A.V.

25
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:00,674
Speaker 1: Watch the TV.

26
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:02,959
Speaker 1: It seems like a trend like that.

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,922
Speaker 1: In Mahou Tsukaitai and all those shows, Tenchi Moyo had the great, like condensed O.A.V that was good.

28
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,319
Speaker 1: And then the TV, there was kind of like a watered down version of the O.A.V.

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,320
Speaker 0: So I wonder what was, you know, what the cause of that was.

30
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,560
Speaker 0: Was it because Pat LeVoir had a similar thing, but the TV was still good.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 0: But it was also watered down a little.

32
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:27,060
Speaker 1: There was definitely at least like some of the creators were, I don't know, too attached to the idea and were like, oh, I got to make more of this.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,864
Speaker 1: This is magic.

34
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,939
Speaker 1: And they never quite recaptured that magic.

35
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:36,216
Speaker 1: But anyway, El Hazzard holds up pretty damn well, having watched it now from 2011, almost 30 year old eyes.

36
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,420
Speaker 1: I think what helps is that Emily's never seen it.

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,539
Speaker 1: So I'm watching it with someone who has never seen El Hazzard.

38
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:57,739
Speaker 1: You know, is it bad that to this day in that show, every single frame of animation that is in the Abba Abba Zoot Zoot music video stands out like a sore thumb in the actual show?

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

40
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:04,100
Speaker 0: And whenever the any bug rooms appear whatsoever, just like up, even though what are they saying in the show?

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,580
Speaker 0: The bug rooms only appearing depends dub or sub in the sub.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
Speaker 0: They say like they say something they say.

43
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:11,359
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

44
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:12,384
Speaker 0: Whatever.

45
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,616
Speaker 0: They make like a noise like hubbub.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,209
Speaker 1: I don't know.

47
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:15,875
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good show.

48
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:16,419
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying it.

49
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:16,961
Speaker 1: It.

50
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:19,912
Speaker 1: it reminds me, though, that I loved that show when I was in a.

51
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,860
Speaker 0: no, it's a bubble bubble bubble bubble.

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,929
Speaker 1: That wasn't the bug room.

53
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,839
Speaker 1: That was that little guy.

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,200
Speaker 1: What little guy in the first episode, that little guy who kind of runs by them or whatever.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,165
Speaker 0: I always remember that guy.

56
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,880
Speaker 1: I was like, fine, you know, they're in the magical world.

57
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:37,117
Speaker 1: And Makoto is like, all right, Fujisawa, which way back home, Mr.

58
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:38,040
Speaker 1: Fujisawa?

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,506
Speaker 1: Since it's obviously no big deal.

60
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,679
Speaker 1: And he's like, I'll just ask the next guy who comes by.

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,959
Speaker 1: And that's when Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Cat Armor and Drunken Teachers.

63
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:55,560
Speaker 1: You complained about what you thought was excessive fan service in Mahoud Skytie.

64
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,485
Speaker 1: Yeah.

65
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,100
Speaker 1: Elazzard times a million.

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,440
Speaker 0: Really?

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,260
Speaker 0: I thought I know how Elazzard had some because Elazzard has a scene where there's sort of like the three goddesses are hanging in some sort of spa.

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,060
Speaker 0: And it's got a scene about 30 percent that it's got the lesbian princess, but that really only comes out all the time.

69
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,293
Speaker 1: All the time.

70
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:17,200
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 1: I mostly remember scenes of fighting because I just watched Mahoud Skytie and I was kind of watching it with a critical eye.

72
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,879
Speaker 1: I noticed things I didn't notice as a kid.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,940
Speaker 1: The people are grabbing boobs in the background all the time.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,972
Speaker 0: Oh, in the background.

75
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:31,114
Speaker 0: Yes.

76
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,140
Speaker 0: You mean the king's court?

77
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,220
Speaker 1: No, no, just main characters.

78
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,760
Speaker 0: Because I you know, if it's just the king's court in Elazzard, that's just realistic.

79
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,259
Speaker 0: That's not I mean.

80
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 1: No, the T&A is off the charts compared to Mahoud Skytie.

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,040
Speaker 0: I'll have to rewatch and compare.

82
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, good show.

83
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,020
Speaker 0: I believe it, though.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Speaker 0: That show definitely had some T&A leanings.

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,020
Speaker 1: The show is definitely very telegraphed, though.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Speaker 1: Emily's pulling the thing that I pulled on you with Gundam Siege.

87
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Speaker 1: She's like, ah, Ifarita, that's probably that one, right?

88
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got this shit.

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,740
Speaker 0: Because they show you all the characters in the opener.

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,360
Speaker 0: Except if I made an anime, the opener would not actually show like anything, any characters that weren't in the first episode or anything.

91
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,839
Speaker 0: It would just be like, you know, be like the the Master Keaton opener with birds flying, you know, and the sun rising.

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,380
Speaker 1: That's actually one of my favorite anime openers ever.

93
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:19,841
Speaker 1: Right.

94
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:24,540
Speaker 0: You know, so nobody will be able to say, oh, I see you put those two characters together in the opener.

95
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,960
Speaker 0: They must be going to get it on.

96
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,198
Speaker 1: Oh, I kind of want to watch Master Keaton again now.

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,740
Speaker 1: Uh, that sucks.

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,623
Speaker 1: Not all of it, though.

99
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:34,840
Speaker 1: I want to watch individual episodes like Caliman of the Desert or the wine episode.

100
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,280
Speaker 1: So there's not a lot of anime news.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,300
Speaker 1: And of course, we're kind of chomping at the bit to get to the main bit here.

102
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,140
Speaker 0: So, oh, God.

103
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:46,860
Speaker 1: Oh, now it starts.

104
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,680
Speaker 1: So I want to talk briefly, just in case no one was aware.

105
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,240
Speaker 1: You all realize that Thundercats is getting a reboot slash remake and Studio 4C is doing it, right?

106
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,040
Speaker 0: Well, there's also going to be a CG movie, I think.

107
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,632
Speaker 1: No, there isn't.

108
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,559
Speaker 0: It looks off now.

109
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,983
Speaker 0: There is.

110
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,040
Speaker 0: It looks like it's the worst.

111
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,052
Speaker 1: There's not going to happen.

112
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:06,580
Speaker 1: It's a rumor.

113
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,540
Speaker 1: Just like that Avatar movie that M. Night Shyamalan was going to make before.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,163
Speaker 0: Right.

115
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,398
Speaker 0: OK, magic exit jokes.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,024
Speaker 0: Not funny.

117
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,299
Speaker 1: Anyway, not a joke.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Speaker 1: Have you seen Avatar?

119
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,851
Speaker 1: It is not a joke.

120
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:17,880
Speaker 1: I'm not laughing.

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, the Warner Brothers is getting together Cartoon Network and Studio 4C to make a pretty badass looking Thundercats.

122
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,459
Speaker 0: Well, badass looking so far.

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,339
Speaker 1: Well, based on everything I've seen, it looks badass.

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,619
Speaker 1: And one big point, Snarf is in it.

125
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,998
Speaker 1: He does not talk.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,460
Speaker 0: You know, the thing is, there are many annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks, right?

127
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,040
Speaker 0: And Snarf is sort of the Jar Jar Binks of Thundercats.

128
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,080
Speaker 0: And many people view him as such, right?

129
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,879
Speaker 0: They want him out of there.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,160
Speaker 0: But unlike Jar Jar Binks, who was like a late and out of place addition, Snarf was always there from the beginning.

131
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 1: I think the reason people don't like Snarf is actually pretty obvious.

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,399
Speaker 1: If you think about it, people who care about Thundercats now are people who were kids when we were kids.

133
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:07,420
Speaker 1: Now, being adults, they watch more hardcore, more real, cool stuff, but they still like Thundercats.

134
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:12,640
Speaker 1: But every time Snarf comes out, it's a Tezuka situation where it kind of takes them out of there.

135
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is so awesome.

136
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,276
Speaker 1: And Snarf, Snarf, Snarf.

137
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,680
Speaker 0: The thing is, Snarf is not anywhere nearly as annoying as those other annoying characters such as Jar Jar Binks.

138
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,700
Speaker 0: So it's like, I'm down with Snarf.

139
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 0: It's not like I'm saying Snarf is my favorite.

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Speaker 1: It's a good thing they never made those prequels to Star Wars with Jar Jar Binks in it.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

142
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:34,660
Speaker 0: I don't really mind that Snarf is going to be quiet because he's still going to be there.

143
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,199
Speaker 0: And he's actually, the design is really cute.

144
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, he kind of looks like a cross between those body armor cats from El Hazzar and a Cabot from Tenchi Muyo.

145
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, I wouldn't have minded that much if he talked either, you know, it's all good.

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,980
Speaker 0: But yeah, the thing is, when I think back to my childhood, you know, there were many things I liked.

147
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,419
Speaker 0: I know you were the Mask guy.

148
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,020
Speaker 1: Mask and Thundercats are my thing.

149
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like for me, it was like, you know, there was He-Man and Transformers and Voltron.

150
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,600
Speaker 1: I don't think, I don't know if I liked He-Man.

151
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,680
Speaker 1: I don't have sentient memories of like He-Man.

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Speaker 0: I had a lot of He-Man toys.

153
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,200
Speaker 1: But I had a lot of He-Man toys.

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,440
Speaker 1: I had Battle Damage Skeletor.

155
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,219
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I still have Battle Damage Skeletor.

156
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:12,839
Speaker 1: His Battle Damage stopped working.

157
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:21,279
Speaker 0: He-Man, Voltron, Transformers, Ninja Turtles, you know, but Thundercats was definitely the most of all of them that I was liking.

158
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,377
Speaker 1: I think Mask was my most, but...

159
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,324
Speaker 0: Not today.

160
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,919
Speaker 0: Today would probably be like Macross or something, but, you know, it was...

161
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,079
Speaker 1: Or maybe a certain other show we'll get today.

162
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,159
Speaker 0: It's not the most.

163
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,958
Speaker 1: No, not yet.

164
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,360
Speaker 1: But also very important, the famous voice, the only voice of Lion-O is in fact going to be doing the voice.

165
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:38,955
Speaker 0: Oh, thank God.

166
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,000
Speaker 1: Yes, Larry Kenny.

167
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,933
Speaker 0: Because if it wasn't him, it would just be like,

168
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:42,799
Speaker 0: "Samoflange.".

169
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaker 1: What the fuck's a Samoflange?

170
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,040
Speaker 0: Have those ever been a thing of the day?

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,460
Speaker 0: Because those are from the year 2000 or perhaps even earlier.

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,158
Speaker 1: I will check.

173
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,440
Speaker 1: Maybe I will just link to them.

174
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,940
Speaker 0: They're ancient.

175
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,780
Speaker 0: Well, no, we could use them for a thing of the day.

176
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,980
Speaker 0: Don't just link to them now.

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,420
Speaker 0: Why not?

178
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,459
Speaker 1: I got a thing of the day now.

179
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,880
Speaker 1: And people are going to look for it anyway.

180
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,229
Speaker 0: Anyway.

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,940
Speaker 1: So have you got any anime related news, comics?

182
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,340
Speaker 0: I got a comic related news.

183
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:09,860
Speaker 0: It's an old news.

184
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,019
Speaker 0: It's from some weeks ago.

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,079
Speaker 0: It's from December, months ago.

186
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,919
Speaker 0: But I don't think I talked about it on the show.

187
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,778
Speaker 0: So I will do that now.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,247
Speaker 0: Haha.

189
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,959
Speaker 0: Look at me bringing up this old news.

190
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,777
Speaker 0: Apparently, right?

191
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:27,779
Speaker 0: If we did a show on it a long time ago, Bone, one of the best comics there is.

192
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,150
Speaker 1: Yep.

193
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,580
Speaker 1: Though, you know, you might want to listen to our review because it's a great comic, but it peters out toward the end.

194
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,534
Speaker 0: Some people disagree.

195
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,419
Speaker 1: But it's a petering out.

196
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,080
Speaker 1: Kind of what I would say is it's a petering out where you go from a 10 to a nine.

197
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,060
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Bone is an amazing comic.

198
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,680
Speaker 0: You should read it.

199
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:51,560
Speaker 0: And the best way to buy Bone right now is the one volume edition, which is a big, giant book that has the whole thing in it.

200
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,934
Speaker 0: You're done.

201
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:52,835
Speaker 0: That's it.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,880
Speaker 0: Do not do because when you put it on the table, it makes a noise.

203
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,120
Speaker 0: But it's black and white.

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,160
Speaker 0: The one volume edition, which is good because it was originally done in black and white.

205
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:16,440
Speaker 0: However, in order to sell more copies of Bone, especially in the Scholastic Book Club market, what they have done is they have been over the past years redoing each chapter of Bone one at a time in a colored format.

206
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,060
Speaker 0: So you could buy Bone right today.

207
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,639
Speaker 0: You could buy the whole thing in color in a bunch of separate volumes.

208
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:31,280
Speaker 0: But now what they are going to be doing sometime in 2011 is releasing the one volume color Bone.

209
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,360
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:44,820
Speaker 0: Hard to hard to make a team to make a two fourteen hundred page color, one volume edition that lays flat when you open it in a in a cardboard slip case.

211
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 0: It's probably going to be like one hundred dollars.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,860
Speaker 0: Who even fucking knows?

213
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,639
Speaker 1: That's fine.

214
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,000
Speaker 0: It's going to be nine and a quarter inches by seven.

215
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,720
Speaker 0: And the spine is three inches.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,500
Speaker 0: So very similar to the current one volume edition.

217
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,319
Speaker 0: It's approaching.

218
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:00,759
Speaker 1: Grymore levels.

219
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:02,191
Speaker 1: Grymore.

220
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,020
Speaker 0: Anyway, but anyway, but yeah, probably going to buy this.

221
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,540
Speaker 0: If anyone wants a black and white one volume edition, I got an extra.

222
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,319
Speaker 1: We could sell it through the Geek Nights merch store.

223
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,757
Speaker 0: I could sell it on Amazon more or better than that.

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,860
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're if you haven't read Bone yet, you know, hold out till the end of the year and you could read the whole thing in color in one volume.

225
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,420
Speaker 1: So the coloring job is actually pretty great.

226
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,980
Speaker 1: Like, you might worry that it'd be like those old colorizations about, oh, no, because this is the original guy.

227
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,200
Speaker 0: You know, he didn't do it himself.

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,037
Speaker 0: He had this guy help him, but he was still, you know, but I mean, I guess you could consider the coloring canon.

229
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:38,840
Speaker 1: by the way they did it.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,202
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

231
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,120
Speaker 1: And it looks fucking fantastic.

232
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,641
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

233
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,720
Speaker 1: So things of the day, I was reading anime news, Nina.

234
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,420
Speaker 1: Well, I was looking for some anime news and I enjoy anime news, Nina.

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,398
Speaker 1: But that's not my thing of the day.

236
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:57,560
Speaker 0: Anime news is weird.

237
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,500
Speaker 0: We've talked about it before, but just quickly.

238
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:04,120
Speaker 1: It is surprisingly biting and realistic about anime fandom.

239
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,720
Speaker 0: Usually when someone makes a comic for the purposes of marketing or advertising or, you know, something like that, it's usually terrible.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,640
Speaker 0: Anime news, Nina, is the only exception I've ever found.

241
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:25,520
Speaker 1: But the current comic that's up there right now, I'll link to it, makes a joke about Family Circus, that terrible old comic that apparently has been running in newspapers for 51 fucking years.

242
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,080
Speaker 0: Always by the same guy or at least credit to the same guy.

243
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,900
Speaker 1: And I remember it as being terrible and insipid and not funny, not in any way funny, not even.

244
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,378
Speaker 1: So I go to the Wikipedia and occasionally Jesus, because we wanted to see, oh, is it really been going for 51 years?

245
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,762
Speaker 1: And yes, that's true.

246
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:48,419
Speaker 1: But funnily enough, on the Wikipedia page, there's a picture of a Family Circus comic from like the 60s.

247
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,859
Speaker 1: And it's actually funny.

248
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:51,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

249
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,487
Speaker 0: And I guess that's.

250
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 0: I guess Family Circus is one of those things where it was originally actually good.

251
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 0: So it's quality lifted it up and it was in every newspaper and then it just became an institution.

252
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,400
Speaker 0: And then once you're an institution, it's like you have tenure.

253
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,220
Speaker 0: So you just suck and they'll keep printing it because it's fucking Family Circus.

254
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Speaker 1: Especially the whole newspaper comic thing where newspaper comics are the most inoffensive, bland, pathetic pablum I've ever seen.

255
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,580
Speaker 0: Garfield is in the same department.

256
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,420
Speaker 0: It's like because he has tenure, no newspaper will get rid of Garfield.

257
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,260
Speaker 0: He doesn't have to actually make it funny anymore.

258
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:24,240
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the oldest of old Garfields might be funny.

259
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:24,986
Speaker 0: You know what?

260
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,199
Speaker 1: I don't know.

261
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,519
Speaker 0: And at least Garfield and Friends is, even if.

262
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's a separate thing.

263
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,039
Speaker 1: We should review that.

264
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,158
Speaker 0: You gotta watch them.

265
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,760
Speaker 1: Thing is, Garfield is actually funniest if you remove Garfield.

266
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, or rearrange panels randomly.

267
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:40,722
Speaker 0: All right.

268
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:47,200
Speaker 0: So there was this video that I watched just fine at work, but for some reason at Rims House, net neutrality prevented me from loading it with any great speed.

269
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,259
Speaker 1: Yet every other, even though it's Fios.

270
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,120
Speaker 1: Every other YouTube video I was watching at the same time was fine.

271
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:55,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, this video loaded horrendously slowly.

272
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,420
Speaker 1: I blame your laptop.

273
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,467
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so.

274
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:58,640
Speaker 0: I blame your files.

275
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,514
Speaker 0: So it's called Valparaiso Polk 2011 GoPro HD.

276
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,499
Speaker 0: So you're probably like, what the fuck is that?

277
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,580
Speaker 0: Well, apparently in Valparaiso, which is pretty sure is in Mexico, but I could be wrong on that.

278
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,080
Speaker 0: They have a downhill BMX race, which is basically don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die.

279
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,883
Speaker 0: And then you get to the end.

280
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:23,539
Speaker 0: But it's in a city on this incredibly narrow course that's roped off with just sort of like streamers.

281
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,417
Speaker 0: And you have to go like on ramps and jumps and stairs.

282
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:30,883
Speaker 0: And it's rough.

283
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:37,140
Speaker 0: Like you would die if you were in this race or at the very least you would keep hitting obstacles and stopping.

284
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,142
Speaker 1: I might.

285
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:41,760
Speaker 1: I mean, parts of it watching it, I could do, but not the whole thing.

286
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 1: I would do them slowly.

287
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:48,320
Speaker 0: So this is yeah, this is actually a qualifying runs.

288
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 0: The guy doing this, you know, is all alone and he does the whole thing on his own without stopping pretty fast.

289
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:59,160
Speaker 0: It's it's and you got a first person view with the helmet cam is pretty exciting, especially the stairs.

290
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,900
Speaker 0: You're like, oh, oh, it's like if you were sitting on the seat going down the stairs, the pole, the bike seat would just shove right up your.

291
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:13,360
Speaker 1: So very briefly, the meta moment we will be not this weekend, but next weekend at the Penny Arcade Expo doing five panels and three panel rooms.

292
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,417
Speaker 1: The first one is Friday night.

293
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,400
Speaker 1: We will also be at Zanko Con the following weekend, 18th, 19th and 20th of March in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

294
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:24,965
Speaker 1: It's a rockin' anime con.

295
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:28,620
Speaker 1: Our friends run it and we're actually doing mostly gaming panels.

296
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,462
Speaker 0: Exciting.

297
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,620
Speaker 1: We're doing brand new PAX panels, actually.

298
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,000
Speaker 0: In April, there's going to be a mocha festival.

299
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,619
Speaker 0: There's going to be an anime Boston.

300
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,638
Speaker 1: We'll be at both of them.

301
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some New York technology stuff going on.

302
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,959
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what the calendar.

303
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,120
Speaker 1: That's a fantastic news there.

304
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:46,460
Speaker 0: Yes, I forgot.

305
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,239
Speaker 1: Scott, I believe what you just said is something's happening in New York.

306
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:51,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:52,956
Speaker 0: Then I forget it's on my calendar.

308
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,840
Speaker 1: The book club book is still Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,659
Speaker 1: We were still waiting for Scott to finish reading it.

310
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,226
Speaker 0: That's all right.

311
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,079
Speaker 0: Hasn't been that long.

312
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,400
Speaker 1: And if you want gig nights merchandise, we haven't talked about this in a while.

313
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,520
Speaker 1: Our old Soviet Union shirt is almost out.

314
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,060
Speaker 0: So if you want one of those, nobody's ordered one in a while, I think because we stopped mentioning it.

315
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:13,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we have our shirt in the e-commerce store.

316
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Speaker 1: Supplies are very fucking limited.

317
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,379
Speaker 0: If you get one, then you can wear it to any of these upcoming conventions and we'll see you.

318
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll be like, hey, thanks for giving me some money.

319
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:30,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then as soon as we sell these out, then we'll probably have a greater incentive to make more new stuff and also reprint the current shirt.

320
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,518
Speaker 1: Yes, new stuff first, though, because if we say we'll reprint these once they sell out, there's no incentive to buy one.

321
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:41,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll only print them, you know, print new ones if there's a strong demand for them.

322
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,180
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do preorders for a second printing or something like that to see if people even want them.

323
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,452
Speaker 1: Also, join our forum.

324
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,100
Speaker 1: It's pretty rocking.

325
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,719
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to say anymore.

326
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,360
Speaker 1: So we heard about to get right into it because people have been asking for an episode on this for a while.

327
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,000
Speaker 0: We heard about my little, but it just hasn't been a Wednesday.

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,980
Speaker 1: Friendship is magic from a multitude of sources over the course of some weeks.

329
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,800
Speaker 0: I mean, it started out when I saw some buzz on Twitter among some anime fans like Gerald and such.

330
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,121
Speaker 0: Right.

331
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,660
Speaker 0: And they were saying, hey, there is a new My Little Pony show.

332
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:11,068
Speaker 0: It's actually good.

333
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,439
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, I'll make a note of that.

334
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:15,220
Speaker 0: And I made a mental note like, oh, there's a new My Little Pony show.

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,603
Speaker 0: It's good.

336
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,280
Speaker 1: Scott was like, yeah, you see that tweet?

337
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, we should watch it at some point.

338
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,512
Speaker 1: And then they say it's good.

339
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:21,439
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do a review.

340
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:21,822
Speaker 1: Yeah.

341
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,100
Speaker 0: And, you know, we just sort of I took a note and I put it aside.

342
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,932
Speaker 0: And then I saw some other tweets and some other information that was like.

343
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:38,780
Speaker 0: this show is made by Lauren Faust, who apparently Craig McCracken, who is a guy who worked at Cartoon Network on many shows like, I think he worked on Dexter's Lab and Samurai Jack and, you know, many other good Cartoon Network shows.

344
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,669
Speaker 0: You know, he is the wife.

345
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,120
Speaker 0: He's the husband of Lauren Faust.

346
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,163
Speaker 0: Lauren Faust is the wife.

347
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:53,080
Speaker 0: And she worked on Powerpuff Girls and also this other show that I never heard of called Something Imaginary Friends, according to Wikipedia, at least.

348
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:56,920
Speaker 1: I also have an interest in Hasbro in general for various reasons.

349
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,620
Speaker 1: So I knew that it was on their new network that they kind of launched with Discovery called The Hub.

350
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,360
Speaker 1: And it's kind of one of the flagship products.

351
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,867
Speaker 0: Well, My Little Pony is on the hub.

352
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,660
Speaker 0: The shows I just mentioned were Cartoon Network shows.

353
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,659
Speaker 0: Lauren Faust, you know, had a reputation for quality animation work.

354
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:11,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,244
Speaker 0: So they came.

356
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:16,480
Speaker 0: What happened is Hasbro bought half of Discovery Kids Network, which is, I guess, terrible.

357
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,827
Speaker 1: Well, it's a joint venture to make this kind of.

358
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,489
Speaker 0: they own.

359
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:22,880
Speaker 1: they own half of their work designed to sell toys via animation.

360
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,060
Speaker 1: They have a remake of like Pound Puppies.

361
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,319
Speaker 0: They got a remake of Pound Puppies.

362
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,460
Speaker 0: They got a Transformers show.

363
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,020
Speaker 0: They got a whole bunch of stuff on this network.

364
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:37,060
Speaker 0: And at night, they even have a show that they have a game shows that are themed after many board games like the Game of Life and shit.

365
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:43,820
Speaker 0: And they got, you know, at night, it's sort of like a Nickelodeon format, like cartoons all day and like old TV shows all night.

366
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Speaker 1: But it's definitely like the original Nickelodeon 24/7 advertisement for their products.

367
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,204
Speaker 0: Exactly.

368
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:52,440
Speaker 1: There was actually some buzz against it.

369
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,439
Speaker 1: Like we shouldn't let a TV company be run by a toy company for children, blah, blah, blah, blah.

370
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,060
Speaker 1: But so we finally got around to it.

371
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,820
Speaker 1: I got a torrent and YouTube and such.

372
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,459
Speaker 1: And we watched the My Little Pony and it's all right.

373
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,443
Speaker 1: It's OK.

374
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 1: It's fucking awesome.

375
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,492
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like, OK, it's not.

376
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:10,519
Speaker 1: it's no cowboy bebop.

377
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,480
Speaker 0: No, I mean, it's not a cowboy bebop or an Evangelion.

378
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,040
Speaker 0: It's not an artistic masterpiece.

379
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:15,662
Speaker 0: Right.

380
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,427
Speaker 0: But it has.

381
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,780
Speaker 0: it has something special about it.

382
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:22,440
Speaker 0: To where everyone basically can't stop discussing it.

383
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,218
Speaker 0: They can't stop thinking about it.

384
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,792
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

385
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:26,318
Speaker 0: it's like crack.

386
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 0: Right.

387
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:27,262
Speaker 0: You can.

388
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:32,180
Speaker 0: you watch it and there are certain parts of the show where you groan or you don't like certain characters.

389
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,020
Speaker 0: You don't like certain episodes or scenes.

390
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:40,260
Speaker 0: You know, it has a lot of flaws, but there's just something about it to where you just want to watch it all the time.

391
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:48,440
Speaker 1: And everybody is crazy about it and arguing about it has spread through our large circle of listeners and friends like a virus.

392
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,040
Speaker 1: I mean, we get Scott and I watched it and we got into it.

393
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,658
Speaker 1: So we made other people watch it.

394
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,862
Speaker 1: I think it culminated.

395
00:18:53,883 --> 00:19:01,480
Speaker 1: we had a big party up in Albany with like our whole crew and a few of us, the ones who were in the know, were like, yeah, my little pony and the rest.

396
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,020
Speaker 1: Everyone else like, what the fuck is wrong?

397
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:10,119
Speaker 0: And at least 75 percent of all talking period was pony talking only among the people who knew.

398
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,819
Speaker 0: And by the time we were done, everyone knew.

399
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,100
Speaker 0: True.

400
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:16,760
Speaker 1: But in the beginning, it was just us and certain other people who were talking about the ponies.

401
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,880
Speaker 1: Everyone else is just like, Jesus, what's wrong with you guys?

402
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,460
Speaker 1: Stop talking about the ponies.

403
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 1: And then we made them watch some ponies.

404
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,840
Speaker 1: And with one exception, they were they were hooked.

405
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's something to this show.

406
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,398
Speaker 1: I really like it.

407
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,244
Speaker 0: I don't know.

408
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,060
Speaker 0: I have some theories, like some sort of subliminal.

409
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:40,480
Speaker 1: That's Emily's theory that that there's some sort of subliminal message that between every frame there are boobies and explosions and guns.

410
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:41,307
Speaker 0: It's possible.

411
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,139
Speaker 0: Bam, bam, bam.

412
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:43,109
Speaker 0: I think there might be.

413
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,100
Speaker 0: We had to slow that shit down.

414
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,259
Speaker 1: Alternate hypothesis.

415
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:46,539
Speaker 1: Rainbow Dash.

416
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:49,943
Speaker 0: Yeah.

417
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,213
Speaker 0: So so his is the deal with this show, right, is?

418
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,020
Speaker 0: I did some investigating.

419
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,420
Speaker 0: Right.

420
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,780
Speaker 0: Because, you know, we were earlier in this episode, we talked about Thundercats and He-Man and stuff like that.

421
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,400
Speaker 0: And, you know, I liked He-Man when I was a kid.

422
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,560
Speaker 0: But He-Man was terrible when I went back to watch it for recent years.

423
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,264
Speaker 0: It's just awful.

424
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,860
Speaker 1: And I did not watch My Little Pony as a kid.

425
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,520
Speaker 1: I saw the movie in the theater.

426
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,820
Speaker 0: I think I might have seen a movie in the theater, but it might have been a Care Bears movie.

427
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,660
Speaker 0: And I don't remember at all.

428
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,360
Speaker 1: But as a kid, I thought My Little Pony was stupid.

429
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,620
Speaker 0: I thought it was stupid.

430
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,700
Speaker 0: I mean, I saw I encountered some of the toys at girls houses and they were not exciting.

431
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,399
Speaker 0: And I never saw the show on TV.

432
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:28,040
Speaker 0: I just knew it existed because I saw commercials for it on TV when I was a kid.

433
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:28,525
Speaker 1: Yup.

434
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,400
Speaker 1: My Little Pony.

435
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

436
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,700
Speaker 0: So I knew My Little Pony existed.

437
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,100
Speaker 0: But now that I like My Little Pony, I researched and all the old My Little Ponies.

438
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,599
Speaker 0: This is G4, by the way.

439
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,041
Speaker 0: Right.

440
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:40,780
Speaker 0: You know, they talk about Generation 4.

441
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,760
Speaker 0: Well, they talk about it the same way with Transformers, right?

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,211
Speaker 0: Except, you know, this Transformers G1, G2, G3.

443
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Speaker 1: Now I point out, the way nerds are talking about this show is very indicative of its mass appeal to nerds.

444
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:52,038
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

445
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:00,880
Speaker 1: I mean, people like us are using the lingo, kind of like how if Batman, the animated series, hadn't been great, like if it had been dumb, we would have called it the Batman cartoon.

446
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:01,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

447
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:02,720
Speaker 1: But because it's good.

448
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:03,140
Speaker 0: BTS.

449
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,662
Speaker 1: Yeah.

450
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,539
Speaker 1: It has an acronym, a canonical acronym among the fans.

451
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:06,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,500
Speaker 0: So this is MLPFIM, which is an initialism, not an acronym.

453
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,297
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

454
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,576
Speaker 0: Anyway, so...

455
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,656
Speaker 1: But I said BTS.

456
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

457
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:19,538
Speaker 0: So my research has determined that My Little Pony's G1 through 3 are awful.

458
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,920
Speaker 0: And Generation 2 and 3 are actually kind of recent-ish.

459
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,540
Speaker 0: Only one is really old, but they're all awful.

460
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Speaker 0: Like completely painful and awful.

461
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:37,659
Speaker 1: And rebooting My Little Pony have been terrible because it was such just a saccharine, "Yay, little ponies, girls can brush their hair and oh my gosh...".

462
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,293
Speaker 1: "Sell the toys, we don't care about making a good

463
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:40,916
Speaker 1: show.".

464
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:45,420
Speaker 0: But My Little Pony Generation 4, Friendship is Magic, is great.

465
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,700
Speaker 0: And what's really scary is if you look on, for example, there's a GIF that's been going around.

466
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,079
Speaker 1: Oh, the YouTube demographics?

467
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it shows the YouTube statistics for the episodes.

468
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,220
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, demographics watching this show.

469
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:05,480
Speaker 0: This show, this video is most popular amongst girls, 13 through 17, men, 20 through 30, you know, 30, men, 30 through 40.

470
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,576
Speaker 0: And it's like, what the fuck did they do?

471
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:16,720
Speaker 1: So had it been older men, like one more generation up, you could have made the argument that it's parents with YouTube accounts showing it to their kids.

472
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,138
Speaker 0: Possible.

473
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,620
Speaker 1: But it is not that.

474
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,080
Speaker 1: It is our generation.

475
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,000
Speaker 0: If you go to any discussion forum that is related to anime, go to our forum.

476
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,579
Speaker 0: How many pages is it now?

477
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:27,539
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

478
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,420
Speaker 1: There are like 700 posts in one of the My Little Pony threads in the Geek Nights forum.

479
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,249
Speaker 0: You go to 4chan, you go to 4chan.

480
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:44,380
Speaker 0: had to like, there was a guy who went through and they had to have pony limiting rules added because there were too many ponies and people who, you know how the firefly people call themselves brown coats.

481
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,500
Speaker 0: Apparently, if you like my little pony or a brony.

482
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least if you're a dude, I don't know to the regular.

483
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,320
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if you're a girl who likes middle pony bumps, whatever.

484
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,600
Speaker 1: Also note that, you know, everything that gets popular among nerds has this kind of mash up fandom that happens.

485
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,039
Speaker 1: But my little pony came to the table pretty quick with that one epic My Little Pony PMV.

486
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,247
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that was.

487
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,519
Speaker 0: they even call it a PMV.

488
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,760
Speaker 0: It's not an anime music video.

489
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,777
Speaker 0: It's a pony music video.

490
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:12,800
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,800
Speaker 1: It's like it's because the fandom is one of the best MVs I've ever seen.

492
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,516
Speaker 0: It's a good MV.

493
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:19,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

494
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,660
Speaker 1: Like it's up there with the old Kevin Caldwell.

495
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,153
Speaker 1: Yeah.

496
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:28,999
Speaker 0: And, you know, on top of this, right, you have Lauren Faust, the creator on DeviantArt, like actually talking to people about the show.

497
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,838
Speaker 0: And of course, on DeviantArt, plenty of people are posting arts, too.

498
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,840
Speaker 0: So the fandom for this is usploding.

499
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 1: Now, what's interesting is that I have been emailed.

500
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:46,440
Speaker 1: I'll keep names out of this, but I have talked to representatives from several companies, both directly and indirectly related to My Little Pony.

501
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,619
Speaker 1: Also, people who run certain conventions we may or may not attend.

502
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:57,940
Speaker 1: And pretty much at one point, I emailed someone and said, hey, My Little Pony fandom will be surprisingly and scarily popular at your convention.

503
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,479
Speaker 1: I know you won't believe me and I know that sounds stupid, but trust me.

504
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Speaker 1: So and I had some suggestions for what they should do to take advantage of that.

505
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,460
Speaker 1: The response was, oh, shit, yeah, My Little Pony.

506
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,420
Speaker 1: The only people who don't seem to get it are the people in charge of Hasbro.

507
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,120
Speaker 1: But I think all the production team of My Little Pony knows what's up.

508
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,099
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

509
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,620
Speaker 0: Well, obviously they do have to talk to people on DeviantArt, right?

510
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,389
Speaker 0: But I wonder how much they do or do not know, because here's some evidence that is going around.

511
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,739
Speaker 0: Here's some things I've seen.

512
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:30,400
Speaker 0: Number one, they're not taking it off YouTube.

513
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaker 0: People are posting it on YouTube, full episodes.

514
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,960
Speaker 0: They're not sending takedown notices.

515
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,126
Speaker 0: At least they haven't yet to.

516
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,258
Speaker 0: they post full episodes like the most recent.

517
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,780
Speaker 0: three or four episodes are just available on the My Little Pony website.

518
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,386
Speaker 0: No problem.

519
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:41,690
Speaker 0: Free.

520
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:42,480
Speaker 0: Just watch them.

521
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,008
Speaker 0: They don't care.

522
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:43,476
Speaker 0: Right.

523
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,159
Speaker 1: Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

524
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:45,621
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:52,959
Speaker 0: You know, in addition, like they you know, they're not so good at making toys, but they have put them out pretty quickly.

526
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,341
Speaker 1: Yep.

527
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,120
Speaker 1: Now, what's said, I got a link to the video.

528
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,520
Speaker 1: I still haven't uploaded it, but the toys look pretty piss poor, to be honest.

529
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,120
Speaker 1: And it bothers me that they're awful.

530
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,045
Speaker 1: I'm used to it.

531
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,060
Speaker 0: Couldn't even like they couldn't even keep the princess white.

532
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,099
Speaker 0: They had to make the princess pink.

533
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,823
Speaker 0: Look at anime.

534
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:10,140
Speaker 1: The crappiest PVC looks like the character, the crappiest one.

535
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,379
Speaker 1: The one you get in a little ball from a gachapon machine looks better than what the Hasbro toys look like.

536
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:23,040
Speaker 1: But our friend Natalie bought all the toys and just by doing their hair actually made them look ninety nine percent awesome.

537
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:23,769
Speaker 0: All right.

538
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:24,319
Speaker 0: How about that?

539
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,682
Speaker 0: Yeah.

540
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:25,971
Speaker 1: But I feel.

541
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:27,320
Speaker 1: but then again, think of it this way.

542
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,020
Speaker 1: They probably didn't expect.

543
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,563
Speaker 1: Here's my guess.

544
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,679
Speaker 1: They did not expect this to happen at all.

545
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:35,179
Speaker 1: So they made the show aimed at kids and the people doing the show.

546
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,144
Speaker 1: You know, Lauren files.

547
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,300
Speaker 1: They decided that, all right, we're given this property.

548
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,619
Speaker 1: We have to do something with it.

549
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:42,600
Speaker 1: Let's make it as awesome as we can.

550
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,403
Speaker 1: God damn make it.

551
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,860
Speaker 1: So as a result, because they're good people, it was awesome.

552
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,680
Speaker 1: And it has this appeal that Hasbro did not anticipate.

553
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:57,640
Speaker 1: And I would hazard that they're leaving the YouTube videos and all this Internet stuff untouched because they're not sure how to take advantage of it.

554
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,179
Speaker 0: Well, because I mean, they're going to quash it.

555
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,043
Speaker 0: They're smart.

556
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:05,078
Speaker 0: You know, they should realize that their goal is to sell toys and they should make better toys.

557
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:05,924
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

558
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:06,992
Speaker 0: Here's the show to be free.

559
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,120
Speaker 1: You didn't let me finish.

560
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:17,660
Speaker 1: I think the reason the toys are pretty weak is that it's a long time from we should make a toy to a physical toys in stores everywhere.

561
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:31,000
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure these toys were long in a pipeline and they came out and it was far too late to do something different by the time they realized that people like me are watching My Little Pony, probably more so than eight year old girls.

562
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,641
Speaker 0: You know what?

563
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,868
Speaker 0: You know, there is.

564
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:36,960
Speaker 0: there has been talk that there are some sort of executive pressures on the show.

565
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,261
Speaker 0: Right.

566
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,300
Speaker 0: She doesn't there isn't like this full creative control.

567
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,180
Speaker 0: For example, the princess was supposed to be the queen, but they call her the princess.

568
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:43,782
Speaker 0: Why?

569
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:48,106
Speaker 0: Well, because, you know, Disney has made it so the princesses are good and queen are bad.

570
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,179
Speaker 0: So you don't want to call her the queen.

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,040
Speaker 1: As a result, it's the principality of Equestria, as far as we can tell, unless maybe it is a kingdom and there's a regency.

572
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:55,967
Speaker 0: We don't know.

573
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:56,635
Speaker 1: We don't know.

574
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,839
Speaker 0: But you also get it going down that road.

575
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,521
Speaker 0: Right.

576
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:11,740
Speaker 0: You know, this show, one of the main reasons that I think it has, you know, so much interest from the nerds is that, you know, on the surface, right, there's sort of like, you know, this painful kind of stuff.

577
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Speaker 0: A lot of the things in the episodes are just sort of, you know, girly and sort of like, you know, like, oh, she's making dresses for everyone.

578
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,782
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

579
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:25,522
Speaker 0: And then at the end of the episode, it's like the like writes a letter to the princess.

580
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:29,880
Speaker 0: That's like incredibly non-subtle moral lesson for children.

581
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Speaker 1: Today, I learned that racism is not a good idea.

582
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, oh, really?

583
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,220
Speaker 0: It's kind of painful for someone who's almost 30 years old to watch that.

584
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:46,660
Speaker 0: But beneath the surface, just lurking there is like this mythology that is being built in an extremely nerdy way.

585
00:27:47,621 --> 00:28:00,719
Speaker 1: The show, we're calling this now, we've coined a term, it's Gandalf's girths, because we way back, we went to see Inception and me and Scott and a bunch of our friends were arguing about what actually happened at the end.

586
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:04,580
Speaker 1: And at one point, Scott says something along the lines of, this is stupid.

587
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,020
Speaker 1: This is like arguing how long Gandalf's dick is.

588
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,017
Speaker 1: There's just no way to know.

589
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:11,980
Speaker 1: And I immediately put forth that, no, his dick is seven inches long.

590
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:17,140
Speaker 1: And we realized that nerds love to talk about Gandalf's dick.

591
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:17,821
Speaker 0: Yeah.

592
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:26,751
Speaker 0: I mean, basically, when you have a world of fiction, right, there's going to be things, you know, when the world is being built, when there is, you know, a Forgotten Realms or any sort of any sort of world

593
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,715
Speaker 1: building correctly,

594
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,240
Speaker 0: any sort of world building, there's going to be things that you know about the world.

595
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:32,145
Speaker 0: Right.

596
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,459
Speaker 0: Baldur's Gate is here.

597
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:37,760
Speaker 0: And, you know, look at the expanded Star Wars universe, this old and this many levels.

598
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Speaker 1: I mean, it's got income, I think, made the X-Wing.

599
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:40,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

600
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:41,619
Speaker 1: Not in the movies.

601
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:42,082
Speaker 1: Nope.

602
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,120
Speaker 0: But there are certain things you do not know.

603
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,540
Speaker 0: Right.

604
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:55,400
Speaker 0: Like how many, you know, as long as Gandalf, how many horsepower does a speeder bike have on Endor after it gets broken a little bit?

605
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:03,760
Speaker 1: You know, nerds will take that question and say, all right, well, if we see it in episode six, it's moving, you know, at this rate relative to the trees.

606
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,203
Speaker 1: So it's good.

607
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,260
Speaker 0: But then if you pull the thing down, it goes even faster.

608
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,579
Speaker 0: Isn't this a higher speed that they don't use?

609
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,540
Speaker 0: And then they, you know, he pulls on the throttle.

610
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,168
Speaker 1: Look, the one stormtrooper that was knocked off of and hit the tree, he hit hard enough to crack his helmet.

611
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,259
Speaker 1: So how strong are the helmets?

612
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:18,842
Speaker 0: Right.

613
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:20,420
Speaker 0: You know, that kind of argument.

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,100
Speaker 0: That's Gandalf's dick, right?

615
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Speaker 0: Because nowhere in the Lord of the Rings does it talk about Gandalf's dick.

616
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,813
Speaker 0: It doesn't even say he has a dick.

617
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,299
Speaker 0: He doesn't pee.

618
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,040
Speaker 0: But he's a man.

619
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,940
Speaker 0: He must have one.

620
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,120
Speaker 1: So how long is it that it is seven inches long?

621
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,820
Speaker 1: Because that is a solid length that is not excessive.

622
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,720
Speaker 1: It's not crazy.

623
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,771
Speaker 1: It's not like 40 feet.

624
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,880
Speaker 1: You shall not pass.

625
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:46,760
Speaker 1: But he wouldn't have a tiny one or even an average one.

626
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,059
Speaker 0: Kidney stone, you shall not pass.

627
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,340
Speaker 1: He's Gandalf.

628
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,040
Speaker 1: He's not going to make it tiny.

629
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,819
Speaker 1: So seven inches is kind of be like like the muscle car.

630
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:00,272
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,380
Speaker 0: But anyway, so, yeah.

632
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,600
Speaker 0: My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is loaded with Gandalf's girth questions, right?

633
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,460
Speaker 0: Like, for example, the old palace is in the Everfree Forest.

634
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:10,805
Speaker 1: Yeah.

635
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:11,259
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

636
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,860
Speaker 0: What's the deal with the Everfree Forest?

637
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,180
Speaker 0: How come the ponies manage all the weather?

638
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,759
Speaker 0: The princess has to make the sun go up and down.

639
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,780
Speaker 0: But the place of the Everfree Forest is the clouds and the weather move on their own.

640
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,380
Speaker 0: And the animals are wild animals.

641
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:34,419
Speaker 0: But the animals who live in Equestria outside of the Everfree Forest, they have to wake the animals up from hibernation and feed them and take care of them because the animals can't manage themselves.

642
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,220
Speaker 0: They're all domesticated.

643
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
Speaker 1: I mean, look at the society.

644
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,300
Speaker 1: There are clearly different like Twilight Sparkle is clearly of the nobility.

645
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,900
Speaker 1: I mean, she lived in a lot and she moves to this kind of backwater town with all these kind of provincial people.

646
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:48,480
Speaker 1: And yet she has magic.

647
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,180
Speaker 1: She's a unicorn and unicorns and Pegasus and earth ponies all have different things.

648
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
Speaker 1: But during the winter wrap up, they weren't allowed to use magic.

649
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,640
Speaker 1: It's their old earth pony tradition.

650
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:01,840
Speaker 1: I get this sense that the earth ponies were there maybe before Equestria.

651
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:05,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, no, the earth ponies founded Ponyville a hundred years ago.

652
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,120
Speaker 0: It said so Equestria is at least a thousand years old because that is how.

653
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,679
Speaker 0: So we can already see the direction this is going in.

654
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,920
Speaker 0: It's totally this crazy fantasy world.

655
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,680
Speaker 0: And if you are a nerd, they drop these tidbits of information all over the place.

656
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,619
Speaker 0: And little girls, I don't know if they notice it or not.

657
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,177
Speaker 0: I hope they do.

658
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,619
Speaker 1: But nerds notice immediately that Fluttershy is one year older than Pinkie Pie.

659
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,319
Speaker 0: That's right.

660
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,220
Speaker 0: They also are like, so where does Pinkie Pie live?

661
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,580
Speaker 0: Oh, she lives in an apartment above the cakes bakery.

662
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,497
Speaker 0: And she works for Mr.

663
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,001
Speaker 0: and Mrs.

664
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:37,339
Speaker 0: Cake baking, you know, and where Rainbow Dash lives in the little cloud palace she made for herself.

665
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:42,799
Speaker 1: And only Pegasus ponies can stand on the clouds, which matters in the episode when they go to Cloudsdale.

666
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

667
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:47,080
Speaker 0: You know, it's actually, you know, incredibly consistent.

668
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:49,620
Speaker 0: There are some inconsistencies, but they are few.

669
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:54,580
Speaker 1: And we have noticed all of that, like the carrot tops head was green in one episode.

670
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,180
Speaker 0: It's like, did she just dyed her hair or there's another carrot girl?

671
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:59,140
Speaker 0: But no, Cutie Mark makes you unique.

672
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,740
Speaker 0: So there's not two people with the same Cutie Mark.

673
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,626
Speaker 1: There's also.

674
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,759
Speaker 1: some people have one Cutie Mark of like one symbol and some have three.

675
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Speaker 1: And it seems like there's different power.

676
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,160
Speaker 0: I think the Derpy Hoops has like five bubbles or something like that.

677
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:12,740
Speaker 0: I don't know.

678
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:13,639
Speaker 0: Or seven bubbles.

679
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,200
Speaker 1: Derpy Hoops.

680
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,247
Speaker 1: But there's some weird ones like.

681
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:16,960
Speaker 1: Twilight Sparkles is kind of different, too.

682
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,018
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of stuff going on.

683
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,778
Speaker 0: Well, Twilight Sparkles is in the same style as so.

684
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,599
Speaker 0: So, yeah, the princess Luna.

685
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,539
Speaker 0: No, the princess Luna has the moon.

686
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:24,917
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:28,319
Speaker 0: And then Princess Celestia has the sun.

688
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:32,440
Speaker 1: Now, Twilight Sparkles is a Pegasus unicorn pony.

689
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,099
Speaker 0: That's right.

690
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:33,899
Speaker 0: She's a Pegacorn.

691
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:37,100
Speaker 0: No, the two princesses are Pegacorns.

692
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Speaker 0: But every other pony is either an earth pony, a Pegasus or a unicorn.

693
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:50,220
Speaker 1: Now, I wonder, I mean, it's almost like if you look at this, like look at the Prince of Nothing with the non-men or something, maybe there's like they're likened unto the gods, the two princesses maybe descended from the gods.

694
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:54,040
Speaker 1: And there were earth ponies that were already there because earth ponies have their shtick.

695
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,319
Speaker 1: I mean, they're skilled or whatever.

696
00:32:55,922 --> 00:33:03,419
Speaker 1: I feel like through interbreeding over the years, if you have royal blood, you get either wings or horns, but for some reason, not both.

697
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,580
Speaker 0: Yep.

698
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,860
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of stuff like that.

699
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,440
Speaker 0: But another another thing related to that right is, remember, this is made by Hasbro, right?

700
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
Speaker 0: Hasbro owns My Little Pony.

701
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,040
Speaker 0: They own Transformers.

702
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,319
Speaker 0: They own a lot of other nerdery things like that.

703
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:16,940
Speaker 1: But let's see.

704
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,900
Speaker 1: Let's see if they can guess the other thing they own.

705
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:24,018
Speaker 1: Let's see if they can guess what has appeared in the show so far other than ponies.

706
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:29,496
Speaker 0: Well, you know, plenty of things, but cockatrice, manticore, dragon, dragon.

707
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,760
Speaker 1: Who owns Dungeons and Dragons?

708
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, OK.

709
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,300
Speaker 0: They own Wizards.

710
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,380
Speaker 0: Hasbro owns Wizards of the Coast, which owns Magic the Gathering and also Dungeons and Dragons.

711
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:49,600
Speaker 0: I do not think it is a coincidence that you are seeing, you know, sea serpents, hydras, griffins and all these sorts of fantasy monsters right appear.

712
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,600
Speaker 0: I mean, manticore, specifically cockatrice, specifically in this show for little girls.

713
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,819
Speaker 1: I will bet the chimera is the next one.

714
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,580
Speaker 0: A chimera is a very likely pick for something to appear.

715
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,359
Speaker 1: I did like how the hydra had one kind of dumb head.

716
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:06,900
Speaker 0: It's a hydra.

717
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:07,640
Speaker 0: That's how it works.

718
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,398
Speaker 1: They always have one dumb head.

719
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:09,829
Speaker 1: Yeah.

720
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:17,359
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, most of the inconsistencies in the show are like, how come she didn't use her teleporting magic right there?

721
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,960
Speaker 1: But there are good arguments to be made as to why she doesn't.

722
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,020
Speaker 1: I mean, it clearly takes a lot of effort and she has trouble with it.

723
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,859
Speaker 1: And remember, when she teleported under duress that one time with Spike, she burned him.

724
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:28,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

725
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,420
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah.

726
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,498
Speaker 0: So this show has a new episode every Friday, and it's strange that the episodes air at one thirty and ten thirty.

727
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,699
Speaker 0: Not that I'm watching it on TV.

728
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:39,639
Speaker 1: I'm watching it on YouTube.

729
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:40,679
Speaker 1: One thirty.

730
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,947
Speaker 0: Who's watching the show?

731
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,600
Speaker 0: at one thirty or ten thirty?

732
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:50,659
Speaker 1: Never in my life have I been home from school at any point from kindergarten through my senior year of high school by one thirty.

733
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

734
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:51,911
Speaker 1: Ever.

735
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,620
Speaker 1: Now, maybe it's the DVR generation.

736
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,599
Speaker 1: Maybe they expect parents to DVR it before the kids get home and they show it to the kids as soon as they get home.

737
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:00,077
Speaker 0: I don't know.

738
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,840
Speaker 0: Maybe they just expect people to watch it on YouTube because they want to give the good time spot to the Transformers.

739
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,700
Speaker 1: But then why the nine o'clock at night?

740
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,999
Speaker 0: Nobody's talking about the Transformers show at all.

741
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:11,580
Speaker 1: Or the pound puppies.

742
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,559
Speaker 0: Oh, good God.

743
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:14,020
Speaker 0: It doesn't look good at all.

744
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,690
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it, but it doesn't look.

745
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,800
Speaker 0: it's not a my guarantee.

746
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,544
Speaker 0: It's not a my little.

747
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,100
Speaker 1: I did like my pound puppies as a kid, though.

748
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,279
Speaker 1: We'll see if I don't know if it's actually good.

749
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:23,377
Speaker 0: You should try it out.

750
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:24,778
Speaker 0: Go back and watch them.

751
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,297
Speaker 1: Maybe.

752
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,460
Speaker 1: So, Scott, I have a really tough question for you.

753
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,060
Speaker 1: Who is your favorite non rainbow dash pony?

754
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,799
Speaker 0: A non rainbow dash pony?

755
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably Twilight Sparkle because she is sciency and she is not crazy.

756
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,300
Speaker 1: She's pretty level headed.

757
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,380
Speaker 0: All the other ones are totally crazy in some way.

758
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,380
Speaker 1: Big Macintosh.

759
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,477
Speaker 0: Big Macintosh is cool, but I mean, he doesn't have enough screen time to be like a favorite or anything.

760
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm actually kind of warm into rarity, though.

761
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:59,240
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I'm warming on rarity, but I mean, she was so far down that a slight warming does not bring her up to above anybody.

762
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:03,080
Speaker 0: Maybe she's above like, you know, Cutie Mark Crusaders.

763
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,737
Speaker 0: That's about it.

764
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:04,860
Speaker 1: I don't mind.

765
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:06,720
Speaker 1: I don't know why you hate the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

766
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,480
Speaker 0: They're just annoying.

767
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,880
Speaker 1: The CMC is not that annoying.

768
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,780
Speaker 1: It's pretty annoying.

769
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,180
Speaker 0: They're just whiny little kids.

770
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,959
Speaker 1: Only be annoying if they get too many episodes.

771
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,979
Speaker 0: They've already got another episode coming next week.

772
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:18,798
Speaker 0: This week.

773
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,400
Speaker 1: I also think they could be saved if we have an episode where Rainbow Dash is taking care of them because she would not take care of them for shit.

774
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,279
Speaker 0: Well, she tried to help out.

775
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,999
Speaker 0: There was the pre Cutie Mark Crusader Apple Bloom episode where Rainbow Dash is trying to give her all sorts of training, trying to help her get her period as fast as possible.

776
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, didn't work.

777
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,939
Speaker 1: I there's the show also.

778
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,500
Speaker 1: It's funny.

779
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,580
Speaker 1: It has moments that are funny no matter what age you are.

780
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like even if the plot of a particular episode is painful, it has legitimate comedy, usually coming from Pinkie Pie's department.

781
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,640
Speaker 1: Pinkie Pie is the only pony who makes me laugh out loud contextually.

782
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's supposed to.

783
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,399
Speaker 0: It's intentional funny jokes.

784
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,580
Speaker 1: But when they all got herpes and Twilight Sparkle had her and I didn't even do this.

785
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:05,177
Speaker 1: This was Emily.

786
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:09,660
Speaker 1: We were watching and she's there and her horns all limp and covered in pustules.

787
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,819
Speaker 1: She's like, oh, my God, my horn.

788
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,320
Speaker 1: And she's talking to Spike and it's kind of waggling around in his face.

789
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:23,680
Speaker 1: And she cracked up long before I did at the obvious phallic reference that could be made to the floppy herpes infected horn on Twilight Sparkle's head.

790
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,479
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a unicorn horn, right?

791
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:31,420
Speaker 0: A lot of people say unicorn horns are originally a phallic thing, but not at least they are.

792
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,440
Speaker 0: They aren't in the show, but you can make anything into a phallic thing.

793
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:37,180
Speaker 1: But note how the fans are also obsessing over.

794
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:47,639
Speaker 1: I mean, on the wiki, people have identified every single motherfucking pony that has been shown at any amount of time for any amount of time in the entire show.

795
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like she's for ponies that are in the background once.

796
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,280
Speaker 0: You know, because think about you're making the show, right?

797
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,440
Speaker 0: It's made in flash.

798
00:37:54,881 --> 00:38:00,020
Speaker 0: So what they do is they just like, OK, we need to have a background with a whole bunch of ponies in it because it's like the town hall meeting.

799
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:00,858
Speaker 0: So what do they do?

800
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,679
Speaker 0: They just make a whole bunch of ponies.

801
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:06,120
Speaker 0: They color them all different and give them just a randomly generated cutie marks.

802
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,720
Speaker 0: Like someone just sat there during like 30 cutie marks and slapped them on.

803
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:17,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now because fans pay attention, notice how they are using the same like core set of side characters, almost Simpsons style all the time in the background.

804
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, Derpy Hooves, they you know, there was the one they accidentally had her give her derp eyes.

805
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:28,219
Speaker 0: So now she keeps reappearing with derp eyes and, you know, and at the same time, you've got like the guy with the hourglass on his ass.

806
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,582
Speaker 1: Dr.

807
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:28,918
Speaker 1: Hooves.

808
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:29,708
Speaker 0: Dr.

809
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:30,099
Speaker 0: Hooves.

810
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:34,880
Speaker 0: You know, you've got who else is appearing frequently?

811
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,920
Speaker 1: Carrot Top.

812
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, the carrot pony.

813
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,720
Speaker 1: Everyone likes the carrot pony.

814
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:39,500
Speaker 0: I like the carrot pony.

815
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,379
Speaker 1: I like the carrot pony, too.

816
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:46,273
Speaker 1: I actually really like Cheerilee, the teacher, just because she shows that picture of herself from the 90s.

817
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,356
Speaker 0: It's totally 80s.

818
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,480
Speaker 1: Like late 80s, early 90s fashion.

819
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's a good one.

820
00:38:52,661 --> 00:39:00,439
Speaker 0: Oh, there's also, you know, it's like, take for example, right, the episode where, you know, the episode where she makes all the dresses.

821
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:00,629
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:01,070
Speaker 1: Right.

823
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,060
Speaker 0: And it's like, OK, you know, the episode itself, you know, had the painful parts.

824
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,120
Speaker 0: Like I didn't like the singing.

825
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,260
Speaker 1: I like the singing.

826
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,299
Speaker 0: I do not like the songs in the show.

827
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,680
Speaker 1: I actually really like the songs.

828
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,919
Speaker 1: The Winter Wrap Up song has been stuck in my head for weeks.

829
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,436
Speaker 0: Winter Wrap Up song is probably the best song, but that's not saying.

830
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:17,280
Speaker 0: that's not saying much.

831
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,639
Speaker 0: That's like saying the least smelly poop.

832
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,339
Speaker 1: I like Pinkie Pie songs.

833
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:22,894
Speaker 0: I mean, some of them are funny, but they're not.

834
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:23,580
Speaker 0: they're not songs.

835
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,600
Speaker 1: I even like the Grand Galloping Gala one because it's just so spastic.

836
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,760
Speaker 1: She's just kind of hopping around.

837
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:29,736
Speaker 1: I enjoy it.

838
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:31,199
Speaker 1: But I like Rarity's song, too.

839
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,878
Speaker 1: I thought it was good.

840
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,600
Speaker 0: Like half the episode is her singing the song twice.

841
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:35,155
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

842
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't half the episode.

843
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,480
Speaker 0: It was a great significant portion of the episode was her singing the song two times.

844
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,379
Speaker 1: Besides, that episode was about tribes, too.

845
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,280
Speaker 0: Well, that's what I'm saying.

846
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,180
Speaker 0: That episode.

847
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:44,838
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,740
Speaker 0: On the one hand was, you know, you know, on the surface level was just sort of like, all right.

849
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,519
Speaker 0: But the message, you know, that an adult would get watching that show is like this twofold message.

850
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,180
Speaker 0: On the one hand, you got the tribes to message, which is let the designer do what they do.

851
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
Speaker 0: They know what's best.

852
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,296
Speaker 0: If you listen to the community, you're just going to ruin your game.

853
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:05,859
Speaker 0: tribes, too.

854
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:16,859
Speaker 0: And also, if you're hiring a freelance designer, don't just, you know, it's basically you could tell that, you know, someone who had, you know, freelance design experience had written this episode.

855
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:25,058
Speaker 1: Emily had a lot to say about that episode after we watched it, especially because we had moments in the past where she will show me a character design for something she's working on.

856
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,220
Speaker 1: And she will say, how does it look?

857
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,720
Speaker 1: And I'll say something like, I don't know, make it like 20 percent cooler.

858
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,358
Speaker 1: I don't know.

859
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,960
Speaker 0: Just needs to be cooler.

860
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:39,380
Speaker 0: And it's like that is how non artists, you know, critique art.

861
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,498
Speaker 0: It's like they don't know what's good, you know, and Fluttershy gets mad points for her rant, too.

862
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,640
Speaker 0: Well, at least Fluttershy had some knowledge about sewing.

863
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but her dress was still awful.

864
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was still awful.

865
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,157
Speaker 0: But I guess it was well made.

866
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:56,467
Speaker 1: And there's a lot.

867
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,920
Speaker 1: I love the show for a lot of reasons.

868
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:04,720
Speaker 1: But some of my favorite moments are surprisingly not the unintentional humors, like in the Zecora episode with the zebra.

869
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:08,918
Speaker 1: I really like the intentional humor when Pinkie Pie tries to sing her song and she can't.

870
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,498
Speaker 1: And she gets Fluttershy to do it.

871
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:19,179
Speaker 1: But I also like the unintentional humor of the fact that Rarity is racist and does not become terribly disabused of her racism by the end.

872
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,258
Speaker 0: No, not really.

873
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,040
Speaker 1: I mean, she's like, oh, she's covered in stripes.

874
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:23,898
Speaker 1: How awful.

875
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:27,700
Speaker 1: And Twilight Sparkle's like, you realize that she was born that way.

876
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:29,376
Speaker 0: And she's like, oh, my.

877
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:32,600
Speaker 1: But yeah, he was born Japanese.

878
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:44,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess the other thing that I really like about the show, right, is that the animation quality is like the production quality as a whole.

879
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:51,420
Speaker 0: Like I might not like the songs, but the singing is actually good and the voice acting is really good, which is really weird because a lot of the voice actors were also bad anime dub.

880
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,679
Speaker 1: This is why I want to interview them, because I have a theory now.

881
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:55,420
Speaker 0: All right.

882
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,640
Speaker 1: No, none of these voice actors were in any way bad voice actors.

883
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,440
Speaker 1: They were poorly directed and given shit scripts.

884
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,940
Speaker 0: Also, maybe I have an additional hypothesis.

885
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,359
Speaker 0: When they were doing the anime, they just didn't give a shit.

886
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,140
Speaker 1: Maybe.

887
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,200
Speaker 0: But when you see because it wasn't their character.

888
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,519
Speaker 0: Right.

889
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,780
Speaker 0: But now this is their character.

890
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:13,384
Speaker 0: It's like they.

891
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:15,180
Speaker 0: whoever it is is Rainbow Dash.

892
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,060
Speaker 0: So they're going to own that.

893
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,380
Speaker 1: It's hard to say, though, because like Lisa Ortiz fucking owned Lisa.

894
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:21,700
Speaker 1: She fucking owned Lena inverse.

895
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that was her character.

896
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,659
Speaker 1: She loved that as far as I could tell.

897
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,939
Speaker 1: And I don't think it.

898
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:41,478
Speaker 1: I think that it's just going to come down to the fact that the production values and the direction in anime dubs is probably pretty poor because this day you play any anime dub other than Cowboy Bebop in another room and ask someone to tell you if it's an anime dub or not.

899
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:41,984
Speaker 1: 100% accuracy.

900
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,298
Speaker 0: Yeah.

901
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,320
Speaker 1: But My Little Pony sounds like people talking.

902
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:47,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds great.

903
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,460
Speaker 0: And, you know, the animation it's done with Flash and it's really, really good.

904
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,479
Speaker 0: And the thing that I find being the most funny in the show aren't so aren't even the intentional jokes while those are good.

905
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:58,140
Speaker 0: Right.

906
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:08,740
Speaker 0: It's usually I find myself most entertained by just very quick, you know, very short moments of a facial expression here or a quip there.

907
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,839
Speaker 0: Just like it's like a whole bunch of really small things, but they're happening constantly and they're all like terrific.

908
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:15,560
Speaker 0: You know what's funny?

909
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,119
Speaker 1: You know, we said the same thing about just to make a point here.

910
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,338
Speaker 1: Mahout Skytie.

911
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,600
Speaker 1: That there were that the visual gags were very well executed.

912
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:35,017
Speaker 1: The animation was very high quality and that the gags and the one offs and the snarks and the facial expressions were being done constantly, even in the background, which My Little Pony also does.

913
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,939
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the example that always comes to my mind is mostly, you know, Rainbow Dash because she's the best.

914
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:40,677
Speaker 0: She is the best.

915
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,300
Speaker 0: But it's like, OK, so when they end in the Sonic Rainboom episode where they pick her up at the end and she's like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

916
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,180
Speaker 0: After she wins the contest and gets the little Greek feathery crown.

917
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:51,576
Speaker 0: Right.

918
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,459
Speaker 0: The way she sort of wiggles is just like it's like eye candy the way she's wiggling there, like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

919
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,300
Speaker 0: And then there's also the time where she kicks the dragon in the face.

920
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:00,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

921
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:04,280
Speaker 0: And the dragon's like the Rainbow One kicked me.

922
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 0: And then she just sort of smiles and nods.

923
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:07,557
Speaker 0: And it's like, hells yeah.

924
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:10,620
Speaker 0: Like the way she smiles and nods.

925
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:12,700
Speaker 0: It's like a fraction of a second of animation.

926
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:13,647
Speaker 0: But it's just.

927
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:15,200
Speaker 0: it's just like so fun to look at.

928
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,700
Speaker 1: Well, Rainbow Dash edges toward the Internet face very often.

929
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,212
Speaker 0: I mean, how are you mad?

930
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

931
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:32,400
Speaker 0: A lot of the times, you know, it's like Rainbow Dash is the best because when, for example, when they're fighting over the grand galloping gala tickets, everyone's like, OK, you know, you can have my ticket.

932
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,158
Speaker 0: I don't want to go.

933
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:37,500
Speaker 0: If it's going to cause you so much trouble and everyone's like, all right, I'm giving up my ticket except for Rainbow Dash.

934
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,737
Speaker 0: She's like, I got the day.

935
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's mine now.

936
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,540
Speaker 0: And then she's like, oh, all right.

937
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,600
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of bender in Rainbow Dash.

938
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, the benderness.

939
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,659
Speaker 1: But Rarity has a lot of moments like that, too.

940
00:44:47,800 --> 00:45:01,920
Speaker 1: She has this face she makes when she's a guest at something where her eyes get really small like, oh, oh, or when they're having the sleepover and Applejack's dares her to go outside in the rain and ruin her hair.

941
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:09,635
Speaker 1: And she just walks out and she's like, oh, oh, oh, the sea serpent, my moustache.

942
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:17,960
Speaker 1: I note that the men in the show all have fascinations with moustaches.

943
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,040
Speaker 1: The one sea serpent is fabulous.

944
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,756
Speaker 1: Moustache like Spike really wants one snips and snails.

945
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,419
Speaker 0: They liked it.

946
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,438
Speaker 1: They like their moustache.

947
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:26,837
Speaker 0: Yeah.

948
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:33,540
Speaker 0: The only thing about this show that has me slightly, you know, scared is the fact that, right?

949
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,191
Speaker 0: When was the last time any show like this was?

950
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,179
Speaker 0: was capturing people to run to watch?

951
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,613
Speaker 0: the next episode immediately was years ago, like 04, 03, perhaps.

952
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,959
Speaker 0: I don't remember exactly the Full Metal Alchemist.

953
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,720
Speaker 1: That was the last show that I was like, oh, shit, next episode.

954
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,357
Speaker 1: Got to watch.

955
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,999
Speaker 0: But where's Full Metal Alchemist now?

956
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,007
Speaker 0: Yeah.

957
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,160
Speaker 0: However, is My Little Pony the next Full Metal Alchemist or does it have the staying power?

958
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,520
Speaker 1: However, I have counterexamples.

959
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,980
Speaker 0: Or is it a flash in the pan?

960
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,280
Speaker 0: A bright flash in the pan, but a flash nonetheless.

961
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,640
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, I watched, for example, Escaflowne and El Hazard.

962
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:14,666
Speaker 1: And Lane and all these anime and one VHS tape would come out every month that had four episodes on it.

963
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,696
Speaker 1: And you can bet that we would go to the store the day it came out, buy it, immediately run home and watch it.

964
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:22,118
Speaker 1: Those shows hold up.

965
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:22,934
Speaker 0: They do.

966
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,280
Speaker 1: Also, I really think that Lauren Faust knows the deal and she definitely knows the deal.

967
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,579
Speaker 1: if no one else, unless Hasbro cocks it up, she will be able to maintain this show.

968
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,179
Speaker 1: And it's got a full twenty six.

969
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,720
Speaker 0: It has twenty six episodes.

970
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,160
Speaker 0: And, you know, it could be renewed forever.

971
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,497
Speaker 0: Right.

972
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,039
Speaker 0: It's possible.

973
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:41,540
Speaker 0: Right.

974
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,139
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really know if it isn't.

975
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,877
Speaker 0: It's like, all right.

976
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,500
Speaker 1: You know what?

977
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,420
Speaker 0: If it was plenty of shows out there to watch.

978
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,020
Speaker 1: But if it wasn't, I would.

979
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,918
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing I would try to invest in to make happen again, because I think it could make a lot of money.

980
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:55,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

981
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,940
Speaker 0: They just we'll see.

982
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:04,280
Speaker 1: I mean, what they need to do is, for example, if they sold Rainbow Dash T-shirts in like Hot Topic, those would sell like hot cakes.

983
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,319
Speaker 0: Probably.

984
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:06,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,600
Speaker 1: I would buy one Rainbow Dash T-shirt if it was high quality.

986
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,577
Speaker 1: It'd have to be the same level of quality, though, as my shirt.

987
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:14,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

988
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,379
Speaker 1: Like that kind of styling.

989
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:19,660
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about My Little Pony?

990
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,900
Speaker 1: Other than Gandalf Gerthing.

991
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,820
Speaker 1: I have a lot of Gandalf Gerthing.

992
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,060
Speaker 0: Yeah.

993
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,316
Speaker 0: I mean, it's basically it's a show that has a target audience of little girls.

994
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,459
Speaker 0: that somehow magic.

995
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:27,879
Speaker 0: Right.

996
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,843
Speaker 0: But, you know, they didn't.

997
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:34,558
Speaker 0: they tried to avoid being a stereotypical bad show, like one good example, Hasbro has a result.

998
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,900
Speaker 1: Guys like Hasbro had one victim.

999
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:39,900
Speaker 1: They're like, all right, we need to have a fashion pony.

1000
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,439
Speaker 1: We need to have a fashion element so we can do whatever marketing we're going to do.

1001
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,139
Speaker 1: So what did the studio do?

1002
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:46,320
Speaker 1: They made Rarity.

1003
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:48,280
Speaker 1: She's not an air headed shopper girl.

1004
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:53,220
Speaker 1: She is a professional world or at least equestria renowned dress designer.

1005
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,740
Speaker 1: They made her a maker and a doer and an expert.

1006
00:47:57,802 --> 00:48:08,880
Speaker 1: And also in general, at least for us, I think, Scott, you're the one who said that watching them is like watching a pony front row crew, because if you notice the ponies that are the main characters are kind of like the leaders of everything in the town.

1007
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:13,200
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, well, the thing is, right, it's like the mayor is kind of incompetent.

1008
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:13,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1009
00:48:13,821 --> 00:48:15,620
Speaker 0: And Twilight Sparkle, who's nobility.

1010
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:15,749
Speaker 0: Right.

1011
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,239
Speaker 0: It's basically Twilight Sparkle went out to Bumblefuck.

1012
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:18,679
Speaker 0: Yep.

1013
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,214
Speaker 0: Ponyville.

1014
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,280
Speaker 0: And she's nobility.

1015
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:22,700
Speaker 0: And she's actually educated because she's an academic.

1016
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:24,298
Speaker 0: So she actually knows things.

1017
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:26,359
Speaker 1: Except about Paris sprites.

1018
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,237
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

1019
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:31,239
Speaker 0: And it's the only basically the few things that she doesn't know.

1020
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,720
Speaker 0: Pinkie Pie is a secret genius and knows every and in the town, even though everyone is much less educated than Twilight Sparkle.

1021
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:40,839
Speaker 0: So she can totally help.

1022
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,620
Speaker 0: You know, she can really run things, helping everybody.

1023
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:44,319
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1024
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:55,139
Speaker 0: Even though they're much less educated, at least, you know, quite a few of the ponies just have a particular skill or three that they are just incredibly they're like superhuman super ponies of that one thing.

1025
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,396
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1026
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:01,720
Speaker 1: Well, the ponies, the main character ponies are definitely more highly skilled than the rest of the ponies on average.

1027
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,475
Speaker 0: Well, at least the other ponies don't demonstrate their skills on screen often, or at least they don't.

1028
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,100
Speaker 0: They also don't use their powers against D&D monsters.

1029
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:11,060
Speaker 0: Like true.

1030
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,481
Speaker 0: Mr.

1031
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:11,883
Speaker 0: And Mrs.

1032
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:19,420
Speaker 0: Cake are probably just as good at making cake as you're probably better at it than Pinkie Pie, because Pinkie Pie also is partying and has partying skills.

1033
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,600
Speaker 1: I saw a pretty good Andrew WK music video to Pinkie Pie.

1034
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:25,760
Speaker 0: Her baking skills are secondary to her partying skills, right?

1035
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:30,280
Speaker 0: So they're probably really good at that, but they're not baking cakes and feeding them to the dragon.

1036
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,951
Speaker 1: There are also incompetent ponies.

1037
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:34,699
Speaker 1: You know, what's his name?

1038
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,498
Speaker 1: The guy who lost the grass seeds.

1039
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:38,140
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1040
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,519
Speaker 1: Or the other guy who went south north to get the southern birds.

1041
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,939
Speaker 1: And don't forget derp and derp.

1042
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,620
Speaker 0: Derp and derp, snips and snails.

1043
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:52,520
Speaker 0: Or the barbell football and basketball ponies.

1044
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:53,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1045
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:54,949
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1046
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,160
Speaker 0: The show also cannot resist a horse related pun.

1047
00:49:59,440 --> 00:49:59,858
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1048
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:00,958
Speaker 1: But they do them.

1049
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:02,539
Speaker 1: I'm going to admit this.

1050
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:03,740
Speaker 1: I don't do it often.

1051
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:12,860
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't do it often, but it happens occasionally when someone in the front row crew will say some pony or every pony instead of somebody.

1052
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1053
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:18,698
Speaker 0: Or there's like, you know, Philadelphia, cloudsdale, trottingham.

1054
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,840
Speaker 0: There's a lot of alliteration going on to plenty of this alliteration and horse related puns nonstop.

1055
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,360
Speaker 0: But you know what?

1056
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,737
Speaker 0: It's weird because usually puns are just like, oh, puns.

1057
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,759
Speaker 0: They're just grown worthy to the max.

1058
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,520
Speaker 0: But these are actually good puns and they don't use them too much.

1059
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:36,597
Speaker 1: Not too much.

1060
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,076
Speaker 0: So it's tolerable.

1061
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:39,407
Speaker 1: So, I mean, the moral of all.

1062
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:41,440
Speaker 1: this week, we're going to we'll talk about the show again.

1063
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,479
Speaker 1: We've obviously tried to avoid the Gandalf questions, which are 90 percent of what I have to say.

1064
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,699
Speaker 1: The show is great for what it is.

1065
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,058
Speaker 1: I highly enjoy it.

1066
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,020
Speaker 0: And it's really enjoyable.

1067
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,946
Speaker 0: But it's like if I had to.

1068
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,940
Speaker 0: it's like, how much do I like it right now?

1069
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,280
Speaker 0: I like it a whole lot more than anything else.

1070
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:59,440
Speaker 0: It's on my mind because it's subliminal powers.

1071
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,520
Speaker 0: But how much do I like it compared to other things I like?

1072
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,218
Speaker 0: Not as much, you know, probably in the expand of my life.

1073
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,399
Speaker 0: So it's just hot right now.

1074
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,759
Speaker 1: How long between when the next episode is available and you watch it as fast as that guy gets it on YouTube?

1075
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:19,080
Speaker 1: It's also kind of a meta thing in the forum.

1076
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,679
Speaker 1: We weren't kidding.

1077
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,599
Speaker 1: My Little Pony thread is like 20 percent of the current activity in the forum right now.

1078
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,220
Speaker 0: And most of it Gandalf gurthing talk, but also plenty of meme generating talk.

1079
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:39,740
Speaker 0: You know, people making fan arts, fan mixes, you know, there's a pony in one fraction of a second in one episode.

1080
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,594
Speaker 0: It was a DJ.

1081
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,706
Speaker 0: So now DJ Pwn-E.

1082
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,660
Speaker 0: They gave it a name and there's plenty of YouTube videos of DJ Pwn-E DJing.

1083
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:52,837
Speaker 0: And it's like, OK, this is way out of control, which tells you that they're doing something right.

1084
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,353
Speaker 1: Yep.

1085
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:57,180
Speaker 1: So if you care about My Little Pony and in particular.

1086
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,540
Speaker 0: And no matter how skeptical you are, some people probably haven't listened this far because they were skeptical.

1087
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,279
Speaker 0: But you know what?

1088
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,717
Speaker 1: Screw you.

1089
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,100
Speaker 1: Everybody we've shown it to with one exception has been turned.

1090
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,959
Speaker 0: If you are a skeptical anti pony type and you've managed to listen this far just because you wanted to be like, what the fuck, guys?

1091
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:12,360
Speaker 0: Really?

1092
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,020
Speaker 0: Are you serious?

1093
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:13,920
Speaker 0: We are serious.

1094
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,640
Speaker 0: It's not a joke.

1095
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,177
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

1096
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,886
Speaker 0: Just you know, we do not.

1097
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,420
Speaker 0: we at geek nights do not knock it if we haven't tried it.

1098
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,979
Speaker 0: However, we try and then knock quite often.

1099
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:29,619
Speaker 0: So if you are knocking right now, just try watch episodes one and two and then knock all you want if you want.

1100
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,119
Speaker 0: But don't knock until then.

1101
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:42,499
Speaker 1: But as I was saying, if you care in particular about the fact that Rainbow Dash is in fact the best pony in Ponyville, you should go to the forum and vote in our which My Little Pony pony is the best pony thread.

1102
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:45,258
Speaker 0: There's only one right here.

1103
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,370
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1104
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,530
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1105
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,950
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1106
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,870
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1107
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,250
Speaker 1: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
