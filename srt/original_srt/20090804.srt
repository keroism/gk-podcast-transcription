Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:15,479
Speaker 0: We talk a bit about the board game.

00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:18,859
Speaker 0: ha Sienna That was stupid.

6
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:35,534
Speaker 0: We're back from Connecticut, and we finally have a break at least a little bit of a break also.

8
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,738
Speaker 1: We live beware.

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,630
Speaker 0: Yes, you could say something like that along those lines.

10
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,858
Speaker 0: We didn't really miss any episodes because we.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,524
Speaker 1: Thankfully much as I think the reason we didn't miss episodes is because I'm not sure if last week was actually supposed to be A Monday Wednesday week.

12
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,872
Speaker 1: we sort of did that for convenience sake.

13
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,980
Speaker 0: it was but we've messed it up previously.

14
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,219
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter yeah.

15
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:04,290
Speaker 0: But I'm very glad that despite the fact that I really wanted to go as I always do that We didn't go to SDCC.

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,470
Speaker 0: that just would have been too much No, but we will go eventually maybe next year.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,634
Speaker 1: Maybe the year after.

18
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,903
Speaker 1: you know the thing is it's so Hollywood.

19
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,839
Speaker 1: I'm not really in a big rush.

20
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:26,200
Speaker 1: You know it's like and if I did go like I wouldn't actually You know because I would just refuse like if I go into San Diego right I'm not gonna waste my time waiting in lines.

21
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,957
Speaker 1: So if I do go to that I'm only gonna go to stuff that doesn't have big lines.

22
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:33,800
Speaker 0: if you don't want to wait in Lines you're not gonna get to see any of the cool stuff.

23
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:41,280
Speaker 1: Well, I get to see all the stuff on the floor But I wouldn't get to see any event type stuff unless I got in line way early, but luckily it does have four days.

24
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,152
Speaker 1: So You sort of do have time to see.

25
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:46,720
Speaker 1: you know to wait in a couple lines.

26
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:53,260
Speaker 1: But yeah, if I plus if I went there it also just want to spend some time in San Diego someplace.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,438
Speaker 1: I've never been where I hear the weather is perfect every day, so yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,399
Speaker 0: But anyway had a more personal note before we get into this.

29
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,409
Speaker 0: My bike got stolen.

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,275
Speaker 0: Oh shit now the worst thing is my whole life I've been biking like basically for as long as I could walk.

31
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,120
Speaker 0: I've always had a bike.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,550
Speaker 1: I've had two bikes stone.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,020
Speaker 0: I always carried a little bike lock.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,493
Speaker 0: I've never had a bike stolen in my life and while I always locked my bike.

35
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:22,466
Speaker 0: I never worried about it I always just thought you know what no one would steal my bike, and I locked it just because you know I kind of did.

36
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:26,390
Speaker 0: it was just this thing and One day you know a couple days ago.

37
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,280
Speaker 0: I rode my bike to the train station in a hurry.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 0: You know I was almost gonna miss my train, and I forgot my bike lock, so I thought you know what?

39
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,699
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna leave it here with all the other bikes.

40
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,045
Speaker 0: What are the odds?

41
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:37,567
Speaker 0: and you know what?

42
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 0: a hundred percent the one time in my life that I ever don't like my bike up.

43
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,158
Speaker 1: It is stolen immediately, so I got some bike stealing stories, right?

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,668
Speaker 0: Well the thing is though.

45
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,207
Speaker 0: I'm Beacons not that big.

46
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,660
Speaker 0: unless some kid just stole it and ditched it in the woods.

47
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:58,669
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see some punk kid biking around on my very obviously mine bike Possibly, but here.

48
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,639
Speaker 1: I got two bike stealing stories, right?

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,500
Speaker 1: I'll tell the less interesting one first even though that's reverse chronological order.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,779
Speaker 0: All right, I was uh I had a bike right let me guess and then it got stolen.

51
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,684
Speaker 1: now it was.

52
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,757
Speaker 1: it was at my house, and I was at summer camp.

53
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:18,560
Speaker 1: right and I was at summer camp, and then we summer camp went on a field trip to Dorney Park.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,824
Speaker 1: I think so.

55
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:25,700
Speaker 1: whenever you're on a field trip at summer camp you always use the payphone to call your parents collect right in those non cell phone days.

56
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:26,543
Speaker 1: Right.

57
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:33,528
Speaker 1: so I did and that's when I found out my bike was stolen while I wasn't there And I had left it locked up.

58
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:39,771
Speaker 1: so that means when I was away somebody else You know did something not so good.

59
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:40,052
Speaker 0: Well.

60
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:40,694
Speaker 0: We had locked up.

61
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:41,637
Speaker 0: We're like at your house.

62
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:42,359
Speaker 1: Yeah my house.

63
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:46,054
Speaker 0: I can't imagine a bike being stolen from someone's house.

64
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:46,395
Speaker 0: Perhaps.

65
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,694
Speaker 1: I should ask my parents again Maybe now they will admit that like they were poor and I don't know they're not.

66
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:56,038
Speaker 1: they were never poor But you know they sold it needed money or gave it away, or who knows what anyway?

67
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 1: Here's the more interesting story right You Know back in the olden days when he's to hang out with the kids on the block We all rode the bikes around like a bicycle gang, but there was no other gang.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,831
Speaker 1: It was just us and just three streets, and that was it.

69
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,880
Speaker 0: we had a rival gang and we had like eight streets.

70
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:27,353
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's suburbia, so We you know I dropped the bike on the lawn, and I went in the house was playing some video games Heard some noise outside looked out the window saw some people biking past.

71
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 1: that were not anyone we knew But I didn't pay much attention to it.

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,660
Speaker 1: I just sort of noticed it cuz you know it was a quiet weekend day nice and sunny out right.

73
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:40,100
Speaker 1: Then we sort of realized bike was missing and my friend's bike was missing, too.

74
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:46,360
Speaker 1: He also left his on his lawn And it was like what the hell some kids must have come down our street and took all our bikes and then biked away.

75
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:50,680
Speaker 1: So you know I guess you know there was some police call-in action.

76
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:54,778
Speaker 1: Whatever it was like in the days that were police would actually respond to a stolen bike.

77
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,260
Speaker 0: they respond.

78
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,773
Speaker 0: I went to the beacon police station.

79
00:04:56,793 --> 00:05:04,887
Speaker 1: I filed a report Like this was like you know respond as in a bunch of cops getting cars and start driving around Response looking for him.

80
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:11,360
Speaker 0: I'll bet if I'd been a kid as opposed to me I could have gotten the police and beacon to do that, but my dad also drove around.

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,890
Speaker 0: Dad beat up some kid get your bike back.

82
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:14,633
Speaker 1: Well.

83
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,979
Speaker 1: He definitely got the bikes back.

84
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,806
Speaker 1: Bet my handlebars.

85
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:25,840
Speaker 1: I don't know if he beat anyone up, but I think he was like chasing them And then like the cops came from the other direction and the kids like jumped into the woods.

86
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,892
Speaker 1: You know it was a situation Wow.

87
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:38,239
Speaker 1: so even living in Detroit I never had anything like that, but well That's the thing is that it was such a non-crime place that you know a stolen bike was like cops are like hell's.

88
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,894
Speaker 0: yeah I work to do, but bike never gets stolen in like Detroit.

89
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:45,774
Speaker 0: You know leaving it outside like the One wants a freaking bicycle.

90
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:46,700
Speaker 0: Are you kidding one day?

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,854
Speaker 0: I was riding my bike to work and a gang of kids Attacked this other kid across the street beat him up and took his bike.

92
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,939
Speaker 1: wow yeah They must just not like the kid, why would they want the bicycle?

93
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,743
Speaker 1: I mean they give.

94
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,428
Speaker 1: they're gonna do that.

95
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:01,278
Speaker 1: you can beat up someone to take a motorcycle Right if you're willing to beat someone up.

96
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,783
Speaker 0: So well the thing is the kid was like seven and the kids have beat him up or like 14.

97
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,059
Speaker 0: They're not gonna be beating anyone up who owns the motorcycle.

98
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:13,521
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I don't understand though is like if you're willing to beat someone up to take something right you're already gonna be.

99
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:28,206
Speaker 1: you're already basically guilty of you know assault and robbery and such and such right and That that assault charge doesn't change depending on what you steal only the stealing burglary robbery large Changes based on what you steal.

100
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,172
Speaker 0: well it depends.

101
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,837
Speaker 1: so at least as far as I know.

102
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,106
Speaker 1: not being a lawyer It's got any way shape or form.

103
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:38,169
Speaker 0: I've always you know when I think about committing crimes all the time It's the engineer's mind.

104
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 0: you look at the armored car And you know all geeks look at it and think I could take that I wanted out.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,129
Speaker 1: You know an armored car heist is like.

106
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:46,857
Speaker 1: I just want to do it to prove.

107
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:47,400
Speaker 1: I could do it.

108
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,700
Speaker 0: See that is that is the edge of the line.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,464
Speaker 0: You know it's like.

110
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,460
Speaker 1: I just want to be in the armored car and have them open the door and be like I dude it.

111
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,435
Speaker 0: It's just like that scene in Dominion tank.

112
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,803
Speaker 1: I don't want the money I just want to prove.

113
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:59,772
Speaker 0: I dude it where the head of the tank police like.

114
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,540
Speaker 0: what kind of world is this for the criminals?

115
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:02,936
Speaker 0: Blah blah, you know what?

116
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,763
Speaker 0: Why don't we just run?

117
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,391
Speaker 0: I mean let you look around a bank.

118
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,616
Speaker 0: I've always wanted to.

119
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:08,440
Speaker 0: I've just been keeping myself.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,991
Speaker 1: I mean you look at that armored car.

121
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:14,553
Speaker 1: It's this big metal box That's meant to keep you out, and you're like I can fucking get in there.

122
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:14,874
Speaker 1: Hells.

123
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:21,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be so fucking awesome You're not so they do everything they possibly can to keep you from getting in there.

124
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,767
Speaker 1: if you can get in there What's more badass than that?

125
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,400
Speaker 0: It's like a rabbit that lives with a lion.

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,804
Speaker 0: Exactly anyway I just I can't believe.

127
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,569
Speaker 0: you know faith in humanity mine is.

128
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,017
Speaker 0: mine is that my whole life bike never gets stolen.

129
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:40,220
Speaker 0: the one time ever I leave it unlocked for like nine hours amidst a bunch of other bikes.

130
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,896
Speaker 0: So that means that someone went up there and was looking for an unlocked bike.

131
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:52,498
Speaker 0: Yep Oh Well, but Kineticon we were there last weekend, and we're not really gonna talk about it tonight because you know what.

132
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,887
Speaker 0: it's not a gaming Con it's not an anime con.

133
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:56,233
Speaker 0: It's a generic on.

134
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:57,780

135
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:02,600

Speaker 0: I got a ton of ideas.

137
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,500
Speaker 0: you just never want to talk about him.

138
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:09,838
Speaker 1: It's a cop-out, but it is a totally valid cop-out, and it fills a Thursday episode.

00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:15,700
Speaker 0: hooray We got to cover Kineticon right away, but yeah anyone who was in panel five that was our room.

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:51,100
Speaker 1: you know a week or two after Otacon It's not gonna be the same weekend as Otacon or San Diego right it's probably gonna be the week after those.

Speaker 1: No, it's you know.

155
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,094

00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:14,897
Speaker 0: We're there.

157
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 0: and second reason I'm there Action Castle.

158
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,711
Speaker 0: I think Action Castle was the second most popular thing at the con after art fight.

159
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:29,924
Speaker 0: It's pretty popular all things considered alright, but anyway Gaming news.

160
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,209
Speaker 0: we got a little bit of gaming news.

161
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,113
Speaker 0: Let's talk about packs.

162
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,740
Speaker 1: It's strangely light on gaming news.

163
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,788
Speaker 1: I think everyone's saving for packs.

164
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,940
Speaker 1: in fact that is my my guess, but anyway packs.

165
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:43,134
Speaker 1: Due to the fact that there's still a little gaming news everyone saving it for packs.

166
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:53,080
Speaker 0: Let's just talk about packs Penny arcade expo which is pretty much the best gaming convention in the world in Seattle every year over Labor Day weekend.

167
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:54,157
Speaker 1: You know what I did today?

168
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,562
Speaker 0: Thought about packs.

169
00:09:55,602 --> 00:10:00,257
Speaker 1: well and my little tweets on my iPhone right I can have columns for tweet searches right.

170
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:05,220
Speaker 1: so I had a tweet search For Otakon so I would see everyone talking about Otakon even if I wasn't following.

171
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,982
Speaker 0: You know as far as I can tell more people have tweeted about packs in the last month and tweeted about Otakon while Otakon was Going on.

172
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:14,656
Speaker 1: so then I you know I deleted that column and I created Kineticon column.

173
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,040
Speaker 1: then I today I deleted the Kineticon column and made a packs column.

174
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,950
Speaker 1: So you know when I'm making a column for it that it's coming up.

175
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,227
Speaker 1: so at packs we me and rim are doing three Three five is right out.

176
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,154
Speaker 1: three panels three.

177
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:34,711
Speaker 1: they are beyond D&D Which is the same exact thing that we ran yes last year.

178
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 1: only we are more practiced at it.

179
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,217
Speaker 1: So it is slightly better, but it is the same material.

180
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,645
Speaker 0: Captains you're making this your news.

181
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,790

Speaker 1: you don't know all right.

185
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,951
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter beyond dungeons and dragons.

186
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,647
Speaker 0: We're reprising it on Sunday Sunday up.

187
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,715
Speaker 0: don't get sued in the Raven theater.

188
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:57,106
Speaker 0: Raven did One day back on Saturday.

189
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,110
Speaker 0: We're doing our new panel.

190
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,760
Speaker 0: losing should be fun at 1030 in the Wolfman theater.

191
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, we practice that at Kineticon pretty good and beyond.

192
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:08,260
Speaker 0: Candyland is Friday at 1130 a.m.. In the Raven theater again.

193
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,710
Speaker 1: I wonder about that Friday 1130.

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,055
Speaker 1: I hope it does not conflict.

195
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:17,740
Speaker 1: wait 1130 a.m Yeah, Wow packs didn't even start until like like what two or three last year, right?

196
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:21,000
Speaker 0: This is the tentative schedule, and they have not published the official schedule.

197
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,714
Speaker 1: They might be starting earlier this year.

198
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:29,924
Speaker 1: That's interesting, but anyway I hope that does not conflict with any of the things I would like to see such as Keynote etc.

199
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:30,386
Speaker 1: etc.

200
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,672
Speaker 0: thing is other than the keynote.

201
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:40,540
Speaker 0: I go to the concerts because they're awesome But the who what could someone possibly ask in the Q&A that will top last year's Q&A only really need to see that one?

202
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,140
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

203
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,206
Speaker 1: It's the only thing I'm concerned with Conflicting with is the keynote.

204
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:44,387
Speaker 1: like.

205
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:48,987
Speaker 1: I'd like to go to many of the other main events and things But I won't be like.

206
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:49,509
Speaker 1: you know.

207
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,800
Speaker 1: I'd rather do my panel than do say I you know gave and taiko Q&A or the draw a comic panel which I missed last year.

208
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 0: I do want to go to the Q&A just to continue the trend that we started last year.

209
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:06,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I do not want to miss the keynote for anything, so I hope that we do not conflict with it.

210
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:12,380
Speaker 0: But that aside don't forget that the penny arcade Expo East Coast is going to be in March in Boston.

211
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,112
Speaker 1: Is it the week before or the week after anime, but I don't know.

212
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,920
Speaker 0: I haven't even figured out our schedule for panels yet.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to figure out how I can stay in Boston for a whole week.

214
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,470
Speaker 1: Hello friends who live in Boston get a couch ready.

215
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,456
Speaker 0: I'll probably just stay in a hotel.

216
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,204
Speaker 1: Maybe for a whole week I got money.

217
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,513
Speaker 1: It's a lot of money.

218
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaker 0: It's not that much.

219
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:38,244
Speaker 1: Maybe we can stay in a hotel during the con you know like right next to the convention center But then like the Monday through Thursday in between staying like a motel like a little bit out of the ways Mad cheap.

220
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:44,365
Speaker 1: It's a possibility some free internet as opposed to the expensive hotels Which usually don't have.

221
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,398
Speaker 0: my only debate is whether or not to take an entire week of vacation or?

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,189
Speaker 0: To see if I can work quote unquote from home.

223
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,539
Speaker 1: That was my plan to work from quote unquote.

224
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:54,005
Speaker 1: Boston thing is.

225
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,958
Speaker 0: I'd rather just not work and just have a vacation on the West Coast.

226
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,648
Speaker 1: I Mean I it's on the East Coast.

227
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,431
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Boston.

228
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,263
Speaker 0: I want to take a week off on the West Coast - yeah I liked it.

229
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:10,539
Speaker 1: well if I can get my work to let me go to Django con which is the week after packs then maybe I get to stay on the West Coast after packs.

230
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,472
Speaker 0: and Except you already bought your plane ticket non-refundable back after packs didn't you?

231
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:16,875
Speaker 1: That's fun.

232
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can deal with that Can you?

233
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,248

Speaker 1: You know how you do?

236
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,325
Speaker 1: No, it's not that bad.

237
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,549
Speaker 0: It's a hundred bucks though.

238
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:26,975
Speaker 1: It's not that bad.

239
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,460
Speaker 0: It's not that bad, but it's a hundred bucks.

240
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,654
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a hundred bucks.

243
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:39,012
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Whatever doesn't matter.

244
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:39,799
Speaker 0: That's how it works.

245
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,493
Speaker 1: Hey my company if I thing is I'm staying out there as soon as PAX is over.

246

251
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:11,823
Speaker 0: Namco's Sales figures are out, and they're this longer part of all these things No one cares about.

252
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,051
Speaker 0: but for a quarter 1 2010 you know what.

253
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:19,248
Speaker 0: the top selling game that they made was Far and away almost double anything else.

254
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,980
Speaker 1: I'm guessing like Pac Man iPhone or something afro samurai.

255
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:24,825
Speaker 1: Wow, they're not doing too.

256

Speaker 1: I mean usually games.

261
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,619
Speaker 1: You know they need like a million sellers.

262
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,137
Speaker 0: But third down on the list is Dragon Ball Z Attack of the Saiyans in Japan only on the DS.

263
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,547
Speaker 1: Wow That's and that was less than a half million.

Speaker 0: Yeah, and the other two big games were we ski and snowboard and we ski I Didn't even know there was were two different games.

265
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,331
Speaker 0: No.

271
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,683
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

272
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,640
Speaker 0: I just remember that I got that get way back when I didn't know how stuff worked.

273
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:19,300
Speaker 0: I basically thought games were free and then when I realized the games weren't free and my friends were just pirating them and giving me Copies yeah, I went to the store, and I bought what ended up being actually a bootleg collection that was sold semi legitimately.

274
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,538
Speaker 1: We actually had a legitimate Microsoft best of entertainment pack.

275
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,020
Speaker 0: no I had this like 35 games pack that we bought at like electronics boutique got chat with chat.

276
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,899
Speaker 1: I have a legitimate copy of chips challenge.

277
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:35,916
Speaker 0: I have a bootleg copy of chips challenge, and I bought at an EB, and you know what.

278
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,320
Speaker 1: we can't possibly tell the difference.

279
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,288
Speaker 1: It's just ones and zeros that are exactly the same.

280
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,438
Speaker 0: of course nothing ever be just ball.

281
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,080
Speaker 0: no I just ball also legitimately But more and more we haven't talked about this.

282
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,410
Speaker 0: I do want to bring it up at least a little bit that you know.

283
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:56,469
Speaker 0: the boy and his blob game is coming that the remake of a boy and his blob and It's looking more and more fantastic.

284
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen everything I've seen.

285
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:58,636
Speaker 1: if it tells me.

286
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:02,043
Speaker 1: That's the awesome win I mean it really looks like Co-op though.

287
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,392
Speaker 1: or one person can be the blob and one person can be the bull.

288
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:13,977
Speaker 0: all they did was take the concept and then Just fix every bad game academy because the boy in his blob was an unbeatable impossible Horrifying game back in the day.

289
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:17,880
Speaker 1: yeah But the idea of having a blob follow you and give it a jellybeans is a great idea.

290
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:22,360
Speaker 0: The only thing they kind of took away that I'm a little bit sad about is that they made the game cartoony and cute.

291
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,878
Speaker 1: They made it not more Indiana Jones like it used to be.

292
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:25,722
Speaker 0: well No, it's just.

293
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:28,129
Speaker 1: it used to be all Indiana Jones pitfall night.

294
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:34,491
Speaker 0: It's cool cool and cute, but the original styling of the game was Vaguely just disturbing and dark.

295
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,760
Speaker 1: We it was Indiana Jones pitfall.

296
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,571
Speaker 0: No, look at the graphic design of the original game.

297
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,354
Speaker 0: It's just very.

298
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:44,220
Speaker 0: the whole thing was dark and absurd and kind of frightening.

299
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,595
Speaker 0: It was Indiana Jones and pitfall and you realize only a tiny bit of it was that.

300
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,000
Speaker 0: and then the rest was our candy corn.

301
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,033
Speaker 1: Well the candy corn was something else.

302
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 0: that was the real game.

303
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,637
Speaker 0: The first part of the game was just get the treasure to buy the vitamins to get to the real game.

304
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,533
Speaker 0: Yeah That was that was it and I don't recall Indiana Jones swimming with bubbles.

305
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,625
Speaker 1: He's fine with the barber spikes Within the snakes.

306
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:07,392
Speaker 0: there weren't so many snakes.

307
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:08,536
Speaker 1: Hey snakes.

308
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:09,137
Speaker 0: I know.

309
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:13,289
Speaker 1: okay Yeah, I'm looking forward to this and I'm actually hoping that we see.

310
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,569
Speaker 1: you know.

311
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,499
Speaker 1: firstly the body commando rearmed right which is basically a Remake of the original bionic commando.

312
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:25,359
Speaker 1: But this is taking an old concept and from a game that didn't have a lot of polish.

313
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,670
Speaker 1: I'm so sad again with modern polish.

314
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,919
Speaker 0: the original remake of the original game was great But the new game they made based on the concept the actual 3d bionic commando.

315
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,470
Speaker 0: It was pretty weak sauce as far as anyone could tell.

316
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,097
Speaker 0: it was just sold so poorly.

317
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:38,820
Speaker 1: No one's buying it.

318
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,619
Speaker 0: It was a terrible game.

319
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:52,115
Speaker 0: It is a terrible game But it says something for the game industry that if they just take is some old game That was known to be good or at least had a good concept and just remake it with modern technology But still make it a 2d.

320
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:01,049
Speaker 1: There are a lot of things out in this world right that only failed not just in video games But in general there are a lot of failures out there.

321
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:08,160
Speaker 1: that only failed because they lacked the necessary Surface polish and they have some valuable good meats on the inside.

322
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,003
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

323
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,706
Speaker 0: the bionic commando?

324
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,653
Speaker 0: that game was hugely popular in the u.s..

325
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:18,407
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not talking about bionic commando I'm just talking about the remake of that, but you know You know the boy in his blob right.

326
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:21,597
Speaker 0: they took these old good night game was actually also pretty popular.

327
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,268
Speaker 0: as far as I recall It sold really well.

328
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,659
Speaker 1: I don't know how well it sold.

329
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,296
Speaker 0: Anyway consider how much of an enduring legacy it has that people remembered that game and talked about it.

330
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:31,580
Speaker 1: people remember a lot of things.

331
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,987
Speaker 0: It didn't sell at all So but they remember it and liked it.

332
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,740
Speaker 1: plus people remember Zelda CDI just as much as they remember.

333
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:42,883
Speaker 0: Actually as far as I can tell the vast majority of people didn't even know Zelda CDI Existed.

334
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,672
Speaker 1: the vast majority of people don't even know.

335
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,340
Speaker 1: the point is blob exists now But I think game you don't even know earthbound exists.

336
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,540
Speaker 0: I think gamers more knew more about earth down in a boy in his blob than they did about the Zelda games.

337
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,243
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.

338
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:55,644
Speaker 1: anyway.

339
00:18:55,684 --> 00:19:02,282
Speaker 1: the point is is that I hope there are more remakes of old good yet unpolished Game.

340
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:09,551
Speaker 0: I point out that there was basically zero buzz about the CDI games on the internet Until the AVGN covered them.

341
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,918
Speaker 1: no he wasn't.

342
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,370
Speaker 1: There were buzz about them way before.

343
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,324
Speaker 0: he covered them occasional tiny buzz But it never got out there.

344
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,167
Speaker 0: most people didn't know.

345
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:22,500
Speaker 0: hardly anyone in our friend group had ever heard of these games and our friends Are gamers and I knew about them for so long.

346
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:26,113
Speaker 0: Yes But everyone knew boy is blob and everyone knew bionic man.

347
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,980
Speaker 1: the point is is a ton of games out there.

348
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,448
Speaker 1: I can come up with a whole bunch like monster party.

349
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,655
Speaker 0: I wasn't a game monster party.

350
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,157
Speaker 1: Oh come on.

351
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,421
Speaker 0: That was a terrible game Dr..

352
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:37,291
Speaker 1: Chaos, okay silver surfer terrible game.

353
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:42,129
Speaker 1: right these games if they just repolish them They'd be great silver surfer.

354
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,697
Speaker 0: That's just saying make a shmup.

355
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,485
Speaker 1: now It's got to be the silver surfer.

356
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,770
Speaker 0: why the core concept?

357
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,039
Speaker 0: silver surfer is better off not being a shmup?

358
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,450
Speaker 1: No, it's better the silver surfer has got to be a shmup.

359
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:52,394
Speaker 1: What else could it be?

360
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:56,774
Speaker 0: besides you're forgetting There's only one game that really needs to be remade other than tie fighter.

361
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,472
Speaker 0: There's an already being remade Well actually and that is metal marines for the s.

362
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,120
Speaker 1: Oh metal marines the other good choice?

363
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,723
Speaker 1: No, actually you know lucas arts is starting to do a lot of remakes They're doing.

364
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:09,239
Speaker 1: they did the monkey island doing some other action, right?

365
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:17,620
Speaker 1: Somebody asked them about the tie fighter and the x-wing and the lucas arts person said I can't say anything yet.

366
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,813
Speaker 1: Just wait dot dot dot something something.

367
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,483
Speaker 1: maybe the problem is that wink nudge That is all.

368
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:31,892
Speaker 0: that is equally code in marketing for we have something, but we can't announce it yet, and We haven't done anything, but we're pretending.

369
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,539
Speaker 0: We might have to gauge interests.

370
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,318
Speaker 0: Either way is good by me.

371
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,246
Speaker 0: I don't know how much interest there is.

372
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:45,855
Speaker 0: it's a chicken and egg situation where there's there's just now that flight stick Which is weird because that basically a coincidence.

373
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,704
Speaker 0: a chicken appears Conspiracy.

374
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,654
Speaker 0: a chicken appeared, but there was no eggs.

375
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,719
Speaker 0: suddenly there was a chicken.

376
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,700
Speaker 1: There's a but there's a chicken and there's a wink for an egg.

377
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,351
Speaker 1: There's a wink and a nod suggesting that there's the hens gonna lay an egg Which is which is more than we've had in since.

378
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:01,732
Speaker 1: Lizzie.

379
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:04,260
Speaker 1: when did tie fighter come out over a decade?

380
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,732
Speaker 0: No, there was x-wing alliance was it was a fantastic come out.

381
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:19,640
Speaker 0: I don't even know but after tie fighter And to be a long time ago and after x-wing versus tie fighter, which I can only describe in one word abortion.

382
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:29,671
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter I have Actually, I don't really care because even if this game comes out by the time it comes out I'll just be playing ns2, and we'll give a shit.

383
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,199
Speaker 0: That's the only game that matters right?

384
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 1: so?

385
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:39,863
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:40,588
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

387
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,158
Speaker 1: So you know people like to do versus right.

388
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,720
Speaker 1: they do like.

389
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,243
Speaker 1: I don't know.

390
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,996
Speaker 0: Voltron versus Messenger like a fanboy.

391
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,725
Speaker 1: see Star Wars very Star Trek or Superman vs.

392
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,210
Speaker 0: Batman right all right.

393
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,938
Speaker 1: Are you ready for the ultimate versus?

394
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,430
Speaker 0: I've already seen Megaman versus Donkey Kong.

395
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,467
Speaker 1: Henry Rollins all right versus techno.

396
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,857
Speaker 0: Viking Rollins Definitely Rollins.

397
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,170
Speaker 1: well no, but there's basically this is video.

398
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,400
Speaker 1: They mashed up Rollins complaining about techno music and techno Viking.

399
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:20,989
Speaker 1: they took the two videos and put them together in a funny way in fact in a way that creates a techno song And I enjoy this very much.

400
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:24,030
Speaker 1: So I hope you enjoy it very much.

401
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:24,953
Speaker 0: So who would win then?

402
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:29,730
Speaker 0: Rollins in a Cosby sweater or Bruce Campbell in a Cosby sweater?

403
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,378
Speaker 1: What's what's the competition?

404
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,290
Speaker 1: I mean is it chess chess boxing?

405
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,175
Speaker 0: shooting eating Puddin pops Puddin pops We'll talk about.

406
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:42,530
Speaker 1: we know that when you wear a Cosby sweater you have infinite Puddin pop eating powers.

407
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,710
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that on a Thursday, but suffice it to say Cosby sweaters were a big part of a kinetic on.

408
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:58,269
Speaker 0: So oh yeah You know in old Cartoons when like there'd be a mouse or something talking really quickly like in Tom and Jerry and everything

409
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:05,176
Speaker 1: Or in like peanuts or like the teacher Particularly

410
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:12,915
Speaker 0: with Chip and Dale and Apparently with Popeye all they would do is get someone to say something and then speed it up And then use that as the audio.

411
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,600
Speaker 1: well good idea.

412
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:23,110
Speaker 0: one thing you can do that is very clever because you know the way audio works Is slow it down, and you can hear what they're actually saying and usually it's something lame.

413
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,421
Speaker 0: But what I have here from College Humor is a gem.

414
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:29,733
Speaker 0: This is a 1952 Popeye Shut-eye.

415
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:30,455
Speaker 0: Popeye.

416
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:31,959
Speaker 0: Popeye is trying to sleep.

417
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,263
Speaker 1: I like me some Popeye.

418
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,470
Speaker 1: I was actually thinking about getting this Popeye box set.

419
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:38,570
Speaker 0: I only like the old racist black-and-white Popeye.

420
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,676
Speaker 1: What are the Popeye would you watch?

421
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,960
Speaker 0: like Popeye Aladdin?

422
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,424
Speaker 0: just him basically be.

423
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,470
Speaker 1: what other kind of Popeye is there?

424
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:58,795
Speaker 0: It's just this scary saddled sailor with Tourette's beating people up exactly, but Popeye He's trying to sleep in his garbage can And the mouse.

425
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,025
Speaker 0: you know the mouse wants to sleep and Popeye snores.

426
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:01,869
Speaker 0: the mouse yells at him.

427
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:10,328
Speaker 0: But if you slow it down it as far as I can tell it's this voice actor saying Yeah, give me some lines to say I can't really read this goddamn.

428
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:16,148
Speaker 0: Whatever No, it's just some guy saying that kind of pissed off, and that's the audio they used.

429
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,604
Speaker 0: apparently Maybe they got some bum off the street handed him a script.

430
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,227
Speaker 0: That was it.

431
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty interesting though to like uncover like these hidden data It's sort of like.

432
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:26,916
Speaker 1: remember how they were.

433
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:38,616
Speaker 0: you know what it's sort of like the that infamous picture on eBay of someone selling a teapot and in the reflection of the teapot if you use a Photoshop filter to Deprospective it from the teapot surface.

434
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:40,683
Speaker 0: There's a naked guy holding a camera.

435
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:41,265
Speaker 1: Yep.

436
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:41,867
Speaker 1: Well.

437
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:42,830
Speaker 1: No it's sort of like.

438
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:44,756
Speaker 1: Remember they were doing those studies.

439
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:51,541
Speaker 1: or if you take old pottery and sort of run like a record needle across it You know because of the pseudoscience mostly Scott.

440
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:53,750
Speaker 0: I know almost entirely pseudoscience.

441
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,745
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone legitimate has ever read anything into that.

442
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:03,145
Speaker 0: I know but Like it's like the same idea it is except one idea is made up and one idea works.

443
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:04,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the same idea?

444
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:10,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's it alright, so We got to do a show on gaming.

445
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,810
Speaker 1: No one's been playing any video games.

446
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,901
Speaker 1: We definitely haven't been playing the same video games.

447
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:27,779
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think you played any blood Bowl, but Despite being at Connecticut and basically you know running 20 like 38 hours worth of panels We did manage to play one board game.

448
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,203
Speaker 0: we played two games.

449
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:31,409
Speaker 0: we played one all right.

450
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:32,998
Speaker 1: wow We should talk about you once about both of them.

451
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,124
Speaker 1: I forgot about the other one.

452
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:36,054
Speaker 0: we played well We played the sword.

453
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,158
Speaker 0: well, okay.

454
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not a board game.

455
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:39,968
Speaker 0: I didn't say board game.

456
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:40,510
Speaker 0: I said game.

457
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:41,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

458
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:47,387
Speaker 0: We played the sword and pretty epically mostly because I won and you lost your strategy that you've been telling me.

459
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,798
Speaker 1: basically Scott I didn't get to use the full extent of my strategy.

460
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:54,130
Speaker 0: Scott told me this strategy a long long long time ago.

461
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,135
Speaker 0: He's like I can win the sword.

462
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,850
Speaker 0: I just have to be the elf and I punked him as the rat.

463
00:25:58,771 --> 00:25:59,254
Speaker 1: That's all right.

464
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:03,621
Speaker 0: partly because Luke crane told me how to win as the rat I just did exactly what he said and do anything.

465
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:09,802
Speaker 0: you just sat there while I got stabbed Basically, I took whoever's side was winning at all and I waited until everyone was.

466
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,484
Speaker 0: I made a.

467
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:17,162
Speaker 1: I made one flaw in In in trying to appeal to you and not appealing to the human.

468
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,610
Speaker 0: I paid me, so I didn't give a shit anymore.

469
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had to get you out of the way so that the only one.

470
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:30,862
Speaker 1: cuz if I if I can't get at The team no no no no no strong against the door, but the rat is in the way I have to move the rat aside to get the door.

471
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,083
Speaker 0: No.

472
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,169
Speaker 0: There's a better way.

473
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:33,679
Speaker 0: Uh-huh tell the dwarf.

474
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:34,465
Speaker 0: You know what fine.

475
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,189
Speaker 0: You can have it.

476
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,918
Speaker 0: I give up my claim to the sword.

477
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,430
Speaker 0: let him and the rat fight and then take the sword.

478
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:41,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so good.

479
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,354
Speaker 0: That'll work Every time.

480
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,839
Speaker 1: no because the elf has the.

481
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,906
Speaker 1: you know when someone is hurt.

482
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:47,949
Speaker 1: You know sue them.

483
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,348
Speaker 0: Yes, sue them with a sword.

484
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,701
Speaker 1: I don't know how soothing the sword is anyway.

485
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:55,270
Speaker 1: We did play two board games.

486
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:56,461
Speaker 1: I got both or just one.

487
00:26:56,482 --> 00:27:01,410
Speaker 0: talk about both But we should talk about hacienda in a little bit of depth though the thing is it's a board game.

488
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,697
Speaker 0: That's simple enough to where.

489
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:03,823
Speaker 0: don't have a lot to say about it.

490
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,029
Speaker 0: Just it's a good game right.

491
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:08,121
Speaker 1: well Hacienda, let's talk about that first cuz it's fresh in the mind right.

492
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:13,270
Speaker 1: I knew how to play hacienda from back in the day because of the website spiel by web.com.

493
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,499
Speaker 1: S-P-I-E-L-B-Y-W-E-B.com.

494
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,296
Speaker 1: you know you can play by web in German where you can play Hacienda online for free.

495
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:28,770
Speaker 1: and they have a bunch of other games too like reef encounter and Santiago which I don't know how to play and a few others.

496
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:34,709
Speaker 1: I'm an ray right which I do know how to play and I used to go on this website a whole bunch and I'd always Be playing it back in the day.

497
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:39,410
Speaker 1: But I sort of stopped after a while just because they didn't add me new games, and I was sort of eh.

498
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:43,250
Speaker 1: But then I knew that you know rim never played these games.

499
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,510
Speaker 1: You know pretty much no one else, but me had ever gone to spiel by web and played there.

500
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,810
Speaker 1: I think Alex might have anyway.

501
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:53,950
Speaker 1: We were at Connecticut and we finally had a chance to play a board game, and I saw Hacienda there, and I was like all right.

502
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,821
Speaker 1: Actually, that's a great choice because I kind of know how to play.

503
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:09,438
Speaker 1: and the thing is when you're at a convention like this If you pick up a board game You've never played before and you're good to take like two hours or an hour just to read the rules and figure it out And set it up and teach everyone how to play.

504
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,450
Speaker 1: and you don't have a lot of time at a convention time is you know?

505
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,012
Speaker 1: Precious.

506
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:18,579
Speaker 1: so a game that I knew how to play from playing it online already And I only had to review the rules quickly.

507
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,970
Speaker 1: that was a very good choice.

508
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:26,110
Speaker 1: So we played Hacienda and then me and rim started an online game of Hacienda today.

509
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,624
Speaker 0: So Hacienda is pretty much this game it up.

510
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:32,361
Speaker 1: it has a theme nominally of the theme is not a it doesn't go.

511
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:51,257
Speaker 0: so it has a theme nominally of Haciendas basically out in the prairie build you know taking land getting the famous giant bone getting animals out in the land Driving them to the market, but the game mechanics backing up this theme are so So shallow pretty much.

512
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,021
Speaker 1: the game is a combination of two things.

513
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:53,683
Speaker 1: number one.

514
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,230
Speaker 1: It's Tron like through the desert right.

515
00:28:56,331 --> 00:29:03,024
Speaker 1: It's that game plus Resource management sort of like to call where you have action points and also resources.

516
00:29:03,084 --> 00:29:05,090
Speaker 1: right and that is Hacienda.

517
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:19,313
Speaker 1: It's all you do is you have resources you have every turn you have three actions and you have money and you have cards and you can buy cards the money gets turned into cards cards turn into stuff stuff turns into money and Victory points.

518
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:24,289
Speaker 1: and then you use the money to buy more cards to get more stuff to get more money and victory points.

519
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,002
Speaker 1: and you Get this cycle going on and the stuff goes on the board.

520
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:31,635
Speaker 1: and when you put the stuff on the board you try to put It out Tron style.

521
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:40,030
Speaker 1: you're blocking the other guy off and surrounding things And you know you're trying to get really good layouts to to get in the other guy's way.

522
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:47,934
Speaker 1: You're competing over the territories to get you know big long strings of land or strings of Animals and herds.

523
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,619
Speaker 1: you know that without getting them blocked.

524
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:50,641
Speaker 1: It's longer the better.

525
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:53,610
Speaker 0: It's a game of getting you know physical combos.

526
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,223
Speaker 0: There's restrictions where you can put stuff, so it's it's through the desert.

527
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:03,507
Speaker 0: Which is camel Tron, but with Almost less of a theme, but more mechanics to beef it up.

528
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,813
Speaker 1: Yep The thing about this game I sort of it's.

529
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:10,422
Speaker 1: it's sort of weird because it's like the the.

530
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:12,067
Speaker 1: it's not that complicated right?

531
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:16,844
Speaker 1: you look at like a lot more Complex games like Puerto Rico's more complicated teeny right.

532
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:18,490
Speaker 1: this really isn't that complex.

533
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,390
Speaker 1: It's in fact is less complex than even like El Grande.

534
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:34,338
Speaker 1: Maybe I'd say it's slightly more complex than Carcassonne right yet You know it's also so straightforward, and it's pretty much get action points Spend you know get stuff.

535
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,911
Speaker 1: It's just your decisions are so Distinct.

536
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:41,723
Speaker 1: you think oh, I should be able to solve this and just have a perfect play.

537
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,870
Speaker 1: right, but it's actually for some.

538
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,593
Speaker 1: You know it's it's.

539
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,380
Speaker 1: it's not easy to get a perfect play.

540
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:46,943
Speaker 0: well now.

541
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:50,062
Speaker 0: I would disagree that in a vacuum It's kind of like it's an Agricola.

542
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:50,870
Speaker 0: sit in a vacuum.

543
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,093
Speaker 0: Yes, well as in.

544
00:30:52,194 --> 00:31:01,367
Speaker 0: it's the same thing with Agricola where the first couple of plays you're figuring out kind of the optimal means of Generating victory points the optimal means of controlling things you need to control.

545
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:06,263
Speaker 0: but Much like an Agricola the real game is not making the factory work.

546
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:08,650
Speaker 0: the factory working is the trivial solution.

547
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:16,221
Speaker 0: The problem is interacting with the other players such that you get what you need and you can make your machine work within the construct Of their machines.

548
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:26,890
Speaker 1: that's one thing I think is very good about this game is that there are multiple ways to get victory points and they balance each other out quite Nicely like let's say you try to connect to a bunch of different markets.

549
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,097
Speaker 1: that's one way to get a lot of victory points right.

550
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:40,779
Speaker 1: if you're cut off from that you can still get just as much points doing say haciendas or water or strings of land Or any of the other victory point.

551
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:47,242
Speaker 1: machines are equally fruitful if you milk them enough And you can never milk all of them equally unless it's like a two-player game.

552
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:52,723
Speaker 1: There's basically no fighting over resources whatsoever In a three four or five player game.

553
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:54,090
Speaker 1: It's two to five right.

554
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:01,190
Speaker 1: there's a lot more competition for the resources on the map and You're not gonna be able to get the victory points in all the different categories.

555
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,527
Speaker 1: So you're just gonna have to pick a few of them and go all out and it's a good idea To go for ones that other people are not going for.

556
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:08,672
Speaker 1: so there's less Competition.

557
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:15,152
Speaker 1: if you try to go for a big string of land and someone else is going for a big string of land Good luck with that You know.

558
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:24,200
Speaker 1: if you try to go for you know just connect to a lot of different Markets all over the place and someone else goes for a string of land You're probably both gonna be able to make it happen.

559
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:29,002
Speaker 0: kind of the two-player game is fun And it definitely won't run out on us now.

560
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,854
Speaker 0: We're playing it halfway through and it's a pretty Even match.

561
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:37,032
Speaker 0: we're both using different strategies, but I'm enjoying it, but it has the same I don't know.

562
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:43,076
Speaker 0: little effort needed to jump in and play not that much setup and yet Enough variation.

563
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,281
Speaker 0: the two-player doesn't get stagnant.

564
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,510
Speaker 0: that I think it's the same reason I like tempest so much.

565
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,005
Speaker 0: I can just sit down and play tempest.

566
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:51,283
Speaker 1: yep It's also another game where you can vary the map a lot.

567
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,774
Speaker 1: the default map is the dog bone But you can.

568
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:58,702
Speaker 1: there's a map on the reverse side and if you play online There's a ton of maps you can play on.

569
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:08,350
Speaker 1: I'm sure some of them are stupid But you know in case you really do get bored with the bone map and you sort of figure it out You can try all sorts of different stuff which might be a lot more interesting.

570
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,336
Speaker 1: You know at least to mix it up some.

571
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:21,337
Speaker 1: the other thing is the game does have that sort of lots of little decisions Mechanic the same thing that ticket to ride has where instead of people having very long turns We do a lot of things.

572
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,250
Speaker 1: everyone has little tiny turns.

573
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:32,479
Speaker 1: So you're always doing something and you're always making very small decisions that all add up to each add up in the long run Which makes for you know a more fun play.

574
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,087
Speaker 1: as you know it's your turn more often.

575
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:39,025
Speaker 1: turns are quick You don't have to think about a whole lot to get your turn done.

576
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,010
Speaker 1: people bevagon.

577
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:44,729
Speaker 0: Well it has a very important, you know it has that I love the mechanic the end of a gun.

578
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,570
Speaker 0: sorry Yeah, it has two really cool mechanics.

579
00:33:47,710 --> 00:34:00,450
Speaker 0: One is the end decker of risk management and that you can basically always you'll buy a known Animal or a known land like a known card for one amount of money or buy one unknown from the top of the stack.

580
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,398
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's the same thing.

581
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:05,190
Speaker 1: you see and take it to ride and also turn in taxes.

582
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:05,913
Speaker 1: Right is the?

583
00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:10,690
Speaker 1: is the the draft where there are face-up cards and also you can also get the face-down card.

584
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,125
Speaker 1: So it's like do you want to get the face-up card and know what you're getting?

585
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:14,908
Speaker 1: or do you want to?

586
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,545
Speaker 1: Risk it and get the face-down card in which case you don't know what kind you're gonna get.

587
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,650
Speaker 0: it's a great mechanic.

588
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,638
Speaker 0: I just I love it.

589
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:21,947
Speaker 0: I absolutely love it.

590
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:23,510
Speaker 1: It's really I think a lot.

591
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,996
Speaker 1: I think you know a lot of other games that have draw from card We can't draw from a deck.

592
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:31,270
Speaker 1: mechanics would do well to incorporate this.

593
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,773
Speaker 1: I mean magic.

594
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:34,369
Speaker 1: the gathering would even do well to incorporate something like this.

595
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,819
Speaker 1: You know, but you know, that's never gonna happen.

596
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,730
Speaker 0: And the other part is has a really cool ebb and flow.

597
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,062
Speaker 0: It's that that's something that actually isn't in a lot of games and it's not.

598
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:43,864
Speaker 0: it's almost.

599
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:49,684
Speaker 0: it's not really a mechanism design thing It's just the way the rules will the way people will play will come.

600
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:58,399
Speaker 0: you can move between Building victory points or building money or something like that where you have two or three different directions to go but going in any one direction.

601
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,164
Speaker 0: the more you go in.

602
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:04,270
Speaker 0: it kind of Forces you to need the thing in the opposite direction more and more and more and more.

603
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,806
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like if you start building a ton of stuff right.

604
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:11,030
Speaker 1: first of all You want to build faster than the other people because you're fighting over this territory.

605
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,570
Speaker 0: But you can't build faster than you run out of cards.

606
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:16,090
Speaker 0: No, because everyone has the same constraint.

607
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:23,270
Speaker 0: So no matter how much you pull in one direction You can't get ahead in an absolute sense not counting victory points of anyone else.

608
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,679
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of when do you build?

609
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,823
Speaker 0: when do you save?

610
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:28,147
Speaker 0: when do you harvest all the?

611
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:28,850
Speaker 0: it's all the way.

612
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,090
Speaker 1: You got to build before the other people but if you build before then you run out of cards.

613
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,763
Speaker 1: That means you're gonna be you know one.

614
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:39,550
Speaker 1: you'll be like, yeah Yeah, yeah, you're building stuff and you're like surrounding something the other guys getting blocked off.

615
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,597
Speaker 1: You're like fuck you I win.

616
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you run out of cards.

617
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:48,938
Speaker 1: So you spend a few turns spending your money to buy some cards and during those turns The other guy starts playing all the cards.

618
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,304
Speaker 1: He was buying when you were building.

619
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:54,710
Speaker 1: You're like no no, no No, no, no, and then he runs out of cards.

620
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,049
Speaker 1: You start building with the cards you just bought and it goes back and forth like that.

621
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:02,644
Speaker 1: Sometimes you're building at the same time and sometimes you're mixing up the building.

622
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,670
Speaker 0: Well, that's especially with the three and four player game.

623
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,390
Speaker 0: It's the ebb and flow of knowing when to capitalize.

624
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,228
Speaker 0: It adds a lot of tactical elements to the game that would otherwise be lacking.

625
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:18,950
Speaker 1: one thing I definitely learned though is you don't want to do like, you know, I mean you think okay Why don't I just every turn buy a little bit and build a little bit?

626
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:29,665
Speaker 1: well Because then sometimes you need to build like two or three things at a time in order to get a lock and if you build One piece of land then the other guy knows where you're going and he'll cut you off over there.

627
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,834
Speaker 1: and now you wasted that build Right where.

628
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:39,989
Speaker 1: if you would have built land animal animal you would have gotten your mood You would have gotten in there all at once and you wouldn't have foreshadowed your move before you executed it.

629
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:43,066
Speaker 1: So it's sort of the game sort of forces you to.

630
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:48,050
Speaker 1: you know Do the big moves instead of doing lots of little ones in terms of building?

631
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,393
Speaker 1: So you tend to.

632
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:56,409
Speaker 1: you tend to do lots of similar actions, you know, bye-bye-bye build build build take card Take card take card all at once.

633
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:58,215
Speaker 0: I also really like.

634
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:07,099
Speaker 0: I like the fact that you have all these different mechanisms to get money and mechanisms to get victory points and They feel like unfair combos the first time you play.

635
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,890
Speaker 0: like you look at how scoring works to get money from animals And you think well, what if I just like build all the way around that market?

636
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,063
Speaker 0: I'll score it every time but everything in the game is like that.

637
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:17,464
Speaker 1: Yep.

638
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:22,723
Speaker 1: The other thing is that You know, it's I forgot what I was gonna say, right?

639
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:23,205
Speaker 0: All right.

640
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,109
Speaker 0: Well here are two other things.

641
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:32,290
Speaker 0: one Most games, you know older German games tended to have these scoring rounds mechanic as opposed to continuous I was gonna say or in-game scoring.

642
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:38,110
Speaker 0: Like I remember Al Grande had the neat you go turn turn scoring around turn turn scoring around turn turn scoring around.

643
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:43,039
Speaker 0: This is basically the college class Semester version of that.

644
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:48,966
Speaker 0: there are two scoring rounds Once when the animal deck is depleted the first time and once when the animal deck is depleted the second.

645
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:52,560
Speaker 1: you basically cut the animal Deck in half and when it runs out you score.

646
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,460
Speaker 1: and when it runs out again you score on the game's over and you score The same way both times.

647
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:57,247
Speaker 0: It's amazing.

648
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:04,682
Speaker 0: You have to either I just count how many victory points I have and how many victory points the other person has Every round and just keep it in my head.

649
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,120
Speaker 0: Yep, but You have to be ready.

650
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,510
Speaker 0: Like right now we're playing the game.

651
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,609
Speaker 0: There are four animal cards left in the deck.

652
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:17,906
Speaker 0: If anyone buys an animal card, the other person has the ability to force scoring immediately.

653
00:38:17,926 --> 00:38:23,970
Speaker 0: Yep, and The ebb and that's why I did not buy an animal card my last turn because I want to leave it at four.

654
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,489
Speaker 0: We're in an interesting situation to where Scott has no cards left at all.

655
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:30,097
Speaker 0: None, no animals.

656
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:31,785
Speaker 1: No thing, but I have a shit ton of money.

657
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,339
Speaker 0: you do so you can buy stuff But then I can force the scoring ground.

658
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,010
Speaker 0: Yep, and I go second.

659
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:38,530
Speaker 0: So as soon as I force it you don't get to do anything.

660
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,433
Speaker 1: The thing is instead of you know buying cards on my turn I can buy water.

661
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:46,447
Speaker 0: You can buy water, but I can buy animals.

662
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,862
Speaker 1: That's true Anyway, so yeah, the thing is with this game right is?

663
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:52,850
Speaker 1: it's sort of easy to get a lot of money?

664
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:56,730
Speaker 1: Right, but getting a lot of money doesn't necessarily get you a lot of victory points.

665
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:04,570
Speaker 1: Like you could just surround a market with animals and you get a pile of money But you won't really get a lot of victory points for that because it's only one market.

666
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,355
Speaker 0: Well, here's the unique part of this game.

667
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:11,170
Speaker 0: It is possible to remove yourself effectively from the game.

668
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:12,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is also it.

669
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:14,115
Speaker 0: well Here's an example.

670
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:21,030
Speaker 0: you can basically if you are stupid or if you're trying Put yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to buy any cards.

671
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:31,281
Speaker 0: You have already played all of your cards And you cannot use any of the existing mechanics in the game to get any more money Mm-hmm, and there there's no way in the rules to recover from that.

672
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:32,827
Speaker 1: not that I know of there's.

673
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:33,830
Speaker 0: I read the rules.

674
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,738
Speaker 0: There's no way to recover.

675
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,090
Speaker 0: It's just you're done.

676
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:37,197
Speaker 1: The other thing.

677
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:39,290
Speaker 0: I think rare to see a game like that like in Puerto Rico.

678
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:44,209
Speaker 0: There is no way to make yourself 100% destitute because there's the prospector.

679
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,738
Speaker 0: Yes, there isn't even a prospector.

680
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:50,550
Speaker 0: if you've harvested you're like one plantation and then you spend all that money.

681
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:57,097
Speaker 1: Even if you're playing Puerto Rico without a prospector the balloons will pile up on the thing nobody wants and you can take that thing.

682
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:57,478
Speaker 1: the

683
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:13,450
Speaker 0: thing is it's interesting that this trap is here because it's the equivalent of the Platform that you can't jump off of in a Mario game where the only way off is to wait for the time it'll run out Or to jump in the pit Mmm, and usually that is the hallmark of poorly thought-out design.

684
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:17,610
Speaker 0: I wonder if they anticipated it or they just assume that no one would be stupid enough to do it.

685
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:23,757
Speaker 1: I mean It's so easy to get money and they start you off with so many so much stuff That it's kind of it's.

686
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:25,385
Speaker 1: it's kind of hard for it to ever happen.

687
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,310
Speaker 1: It's you're really dumb.

688
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:29,449
Speaker 0: It's trivial if you go for it, though It is true that you go for it.

689
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,170
Speaker 0: You can go for it and just be out of the game.

690
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:37,575
Speaker 1: the other thing about the game though, is that it's trivial to get money right but It's you.

691
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:38,037
Speaker 1: actually.

692
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:40,470
Speaker 1: the actions are a scarcer resource than the money.

693
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,534
Speaker 1: It's like you can't spend all your money unless you spend it all on Haciendas and water.

694
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:53,784
Speaker 1: if you spend all your money on cards and actually use the cards to get more money You're just gonna have so much money that you're not gonna know you can't spend it all.

695
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,570
Speaker 1: so it's like money isn't really a limitation.

696
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,700
Speaker 1: But even so you're still.

697
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,830
Speaker 1: you think money isn't a limit, right?

698
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,951
Speaker 1: So I should just concern myself with my actions and not worry about how much money I have and that's true to an extent.

699
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:15,984
Speaker 1: but more money is more victory points because every ten dollars is a victory point and while money means more I You know, if you have a big lineup, you can get ten dollars.

700
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:19,146
Speaker 1: with like one card play Like you play one animal you get ten bucks.

701
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:24,849
Speaker 1: So That's a whole victory point, which is kind of a big deal when they add up turn after turn.

702
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:30,757
Speaker 1: That's the other interesting thing, you know, so even though you don't need more money You're still gonna be trying to get more.

703
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:33,045
Speaker 0: be difficult to fall into trap of.

704
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:34,390
Speaker 0: I'm out of the game is there.

705
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,176
Speaker 0: There's also the subtler trap of.

706
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:43,160
Speaker 0: it's very easy to for a novice player to get focused on Generating money and kind of forget to generate victory points.

707
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:46,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, a novice player would definitely make that mistake.

708
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:52,761
Speaker 0: I feel like what would add to the game is to Have a scoring chart and just keep your score up to date all the time.

709
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:56,315
Speaker 1: like the online version has a checkbox You can check.

710
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,545
Speaker 1: that will keep score every turn.

711
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:00,058
Speaker 1: Yep So if you want to do you can also.

712
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,910
Speaker 1: there's nothing stopping you from doing that.

713
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,598
Speaker 1: I mean the game, you know has the standard scoring track around the board, you know You can just move your guys every turn.

714
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:10,830
Speaker 1: if you really want to know nothing stopping you from doing it.

715
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I feel like you should.

716
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:12,740
Speaker 0: I think it would make it.

717
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,148
Speaker 0: otherwise it just adds the.

718
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:20,110
Speaker 0: you know A lot of earlier German board games will have the memory mechanic where things aren't hidden from the players.

719
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,755
Speaker 0: but you have to remember it all and I Like Tigers and Euphrates.

720
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:29,110
Speaker 0: once I started counting who needed what color I did a lot better in the game.

721
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:31,520
Speaker 0: And it like is in El Grande.

722
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,923
Speaker 0: if I just counted how many stupid people are in the Castille It's almost trivial to win if no one else is counting.

723
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:38,630
Speaker 0: Yep, and other people never count.

724
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:53,330
Speaker 1: yeah, and the thing is I do kind of like the The halfway through scoring because it sort of makes you think about like, you know, okay You know if I do something in the first half of the game, it'll get scored twice, right?

725
00:42:53,871 --> 00:43:01,770
Speaker 1: so but if I do something in the The second half of the game, it'll only get scored once right?

726
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,893
Speaker 1: It's like save your hacienda.

727
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:06,726
Speaker 1: right that hacienda will count double if you buy it early enough in the game.

728
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:11,943
Speaker 1: So it's sort of Scoring twice makes you sort of.

729
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:18,210
Speaker 1: but you know, it's like ah shit I gotta buy the hacienda now early in the game to get more points instead of later in the game.

730
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:19,747
Speaker 1: Yeah.

731
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:30,924
Speaker 1: So it's sort of it adjusts your purchasing patterns based on how if the animal decks about to run out and stuff Wouldn't happen if you scored every turn how's the end is it?

732
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:32,010
Speaker 0: You know, it's a pretty good game.

733
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,503
Speaker 0: It's worth the money if you're a German boarding fan, and I'll just buy it.

734
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:35,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's it's.

735
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,734
Speaker 1: you know It's a normal.

736
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,646
Speaker 1: I think it comes in the same style box as Attica, right?

737
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,570
Speaker 1: I think yeah same company.

738
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,530
Speaker 0: I feel like it has the same level of staying power as like.

739
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:50,430
Speaker 0: It's better than a game like to call that's for sure our Maya or Mexico or all those games.

740
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:53,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like a night.

741
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,761
Speaker 1: It's not like an a-plus game.

742
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,910
Speaker 1: It's like a solid b-plus a-minus game.

743
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,818
Speaker 1: You know that you'll keep on your shelf.

744
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,185
Speaker 1: You'll bust it out once in a while.

745
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:01,612
Speaker 1: really good It's.

746
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:19,368
Speaker 1: it's really good for people who are not like super German board gamers and they'll learn a lot of basic German board game mechanics like, you know buying resources using action points Drafting from a from a draw pile and positioning on a board Tron style, you know,

747
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:20,010
Speaker 0: you know what?

748
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,274
Speaker 0: I don't know why it's it.

749
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:25,350
Speaker 0: I can't really articulate why I feel this way, but I realized it.

750
00:44:26,072 --> 00:44:35,159
Speaker 0: It reminds me a little bit of Lachita, but not game mechanic wise just in terms of I think it has the exact same Staying power before we'll get sick of it that Lachita does.

751
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:43,971
Speaker 1: it has some similarities to Lachita in terms of the positioning on the board with the hex tiles So and also the politics cards draw Drafting.

752
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:50,110
Speaker 0: but at the same time Lachita is so much more limiting and it has the influence factors and all the completely separate different game.

753
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:57,160
Speaker 1: I think what I like about Hacienda is that it just sort of takes all these like extremely Fundamental and basic German board game mechanics.

754
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,143
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a stick.

755
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:00,130
Speaker 1: It doesn't have anything fancy, you know.

756
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,309
Speaker 1: It's totally just bread and butter.

757
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,784
Speaker 1: But it's like that really good bread and butter you get when you sit at when you.

758
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:11,530
Speaker 1: they serve you before you eat a meal At a fancy restaurant, you know, nothing special, but it's just solid.

759
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:17,690
Speaker 1: Does the basics really really well with really nice polish, you know, and it comes out a very nice game.

760
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:19,918
Speaker 1: Very happy with the haciendas.

761
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,550
Speaker 0: So should we even bother talking about another game at this point?

762
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:22,971
Speaker 0: I don't know.

763
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:23,615
