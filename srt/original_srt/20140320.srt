1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,418
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, March 20th, 2014.

2
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:12,421
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:13,825
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:15,409
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,163
Speaker 0: Tonight, air travel, because I can't believe we never did a show on this.

6
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:19,866
Speaker 1: Or we did.

7
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,171
Speaker 0: And we're bad at this.

8
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're kind of phoning it in.

10
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:32,863
Speaker 1: We got Anime Boston tomorrow and unlike- We're lucky we're even doing a show at all.

11
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,325
Speaker 1: Yeah.

12
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:34,269
Speaker 1: It's the crab people.

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,572
Speaker 1: In fact, I showed up late- We also have no show ideas lately and you guys aren't exactly helping either.

14
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:39,094
Speaker 1: Yeah.

15
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:40,621
Speaker 0: And I showed up late tonight.

16
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:43,314
Speaker 0: Like, Scott was here waiting at the studio when I was late.

17
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:45,383
Speaker 0: Partly because I was trying to book a flight.

18
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,151
Speaker 0: So, going to talk about that.

19
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:47,974
Speaker 0: Oh well.

20
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,583
Speaker 0: But, Anime Boston.

21
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,406
Speaker 0: It's very rare.

22
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,501
Speaker 0: You know, in the old days, we always would show up to a con Thursday.

23
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,505
Speaker 0: That was like the thing.

24
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:57,891
Speaker 0: You show up at noon on fucking Thursday.

25
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:59,738
Speaker 1: Anime Boston Reg has already started.

26
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:00,300
Speaker 0: Yeah.

27
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:02,548
Speaker 1: People have badges right now.

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,945
Speaker 1: We still do that for- There are cosplayers in Boston eating as we speak.

29
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,432
Speaker 0: I remember every year we had a tradition.

30
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:08,858
Speaker 0: We'd get up at like 6am.

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,062
Speaker 0: We'd drive to Otacon.

32
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:14,397
Speaker 0: Our goal was to be in Baltimore by noon on Thursday.

33
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,822
Speaker 0: Get badges.

34
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:20,020
Speaker 0: Break into the- Usually sneak around somewhere we weren't supposed to be because no one stops us.

35
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:22,271
Speaker 0: And then swim in the pool all night and hang out.

36
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:25,743
Speaker 0: And we really only do that for gaming cons now.

37
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:32,123
Speaker 0: Anime cons, we tend to show up like noon on Friday and leave at like noon on Sunday.

38
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,747
Speaker 1: The few anime cons we go to.

39
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:35,814
Speaker 0: We go to two anime cons a year now.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,523
Speaker 0: Well, and one third.

41
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:41,531
Speaker 0: Two and a third because Kineticon is one third anime con.

42
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,773
Speaker 1: Well, Kineticon is one third everything.

43
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,336
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's it.

44
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:50,560
Speaker 0: It's con season.

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's getting slightly warmer.

46
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,474
Speaker 1: Today is the first day of Le Spring.

47
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,278
Speaker 0: Warm today.

48
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,926
Speaker 1: Haha, you Australians take that winner.

49
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,816
Speaker 1: Getting a little cold, aren't you?

51
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,080
Speaker 0: That's a shame.

52
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,521
Speaker 0: Because PAX got moved back, when I go back to Australia this year, it's gonna be fucking summer.

53
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,925
Speaker 0: Fuck yeah.

54
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:12,940
Speaker 0: I'm taking back my summer days because last year I went to PAX Australia.

55
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,020
Speaker 0: I missed a week and a half of summer here to get a week and a half of winter there.

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,683
Speaker 0: So now I'm taking it back.

57
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:20,104
Speaker 1: Yeah.

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,578
Speaker 0: So yeah, I got a news that is interesting.

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,630
Speaker 0: So many of you know, a while ago, our book club book was The Player of Games.

60
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,104
Speaker 0: Ian M. Banks, the Geek Knights book.

61
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:35,412
Speaker 0: that isn't The Prince of Nothing, The Player of Games.

62
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,042
Speaker 0: That book is legit.

63
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,998
Speaker 1: There are a lot of books that are The Geek Knights book, but those are them.

64
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, Player of Games, The Prince of Nothing.

65
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:53,285
Speaker 0: Very few things come close, but I read all the other culture books because they're delightful and I love just about everything about them, but one of them.

66
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:56,139
Speaker 1: It's all you can do considering you can't actually live in the culture.

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,581
Speaker 0: I know.

68
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,264
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

69
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:58,188
Speaker 0: I want to live in the culture.

70
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,628
Speaker 0: Thing is the culture's awesome in the sort of awesomely boring way.

71
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:06,143
Speaker 0: I'd almost want to be in the special circumstances where suddenly I'm risking death.

72
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:07,266
Speaker 1: Go for it.

73
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:09,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I digress.

74
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:31,885
Speaker 0: One of these books is called Surface Detail and not to spoil anything about it, but the conceit is that in these highly advanced future societies like galaxy spanning societies with incredible computing technology and VR technology, it becomes eminently feasible to literally recreate your religion or literally create a hell.

75
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:36,980
Speaker 0: that when people die, you take their consciousness and put it in hell forever.

76
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:41,034
Speaker 1: So even though there is no hell, you make a real hell.

77
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:45,051
Speaker 1: And then when someone's about to die, imagine like ghost in the shell, right?

78
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,149
Speaker 1: You can just turn someone's brain into like, you know, computerize it, digitize their brain.

79
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,696
Speaker 1: Okay, you're about to die.

80
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:55,554
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll take your digitized brain and put it in a digital virtual hell.

81
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:57,039
Speaker 1: So yeah, there is hell.

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,929
Speaker 1: I put you in it and now it is real.

83
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:00,973
Speaker 1: It's in this computer.

84
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:05,250
Speaker 0: The book Surface Detail talks about the ethics of that, the ramifications of that.

85
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not cool.

86
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:09,488
Speaker 0: Well, heavens exist as well, so there's one funny sort of side story.

87
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:10,392
Speaker 1: That's kind of awesome.

88
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:10,854
Speaker 1: Do that.

89
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

90
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,988
Speaker 0: So heavens end up having their own problems and then the debate comes down to whether or not it's any different from just still being alive.

91
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:19,712
Speaker 1: It isn't.

92
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:28,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's one society where they create their afterlives and then billions of suicides as people are like, "Fuck this.

93
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,326
Speaker 0: I'm just going to heaven

94
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:29,627
Speaker 0: now.".

95
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,193
Speaker 0: Hell yeah.

96
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:34,145
Speaker 0: So then the people who run heaven are like, "Yeah, fuck this.

97
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,210
Speaker 0: You're all going to hell.

98
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:35,391
Speaker 0: No

99
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:35,934
Speaker 0: suicide.".

100
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:37,541
Speaker 1: You can't force me.

101
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,264
Speaker 1: I can do what I want.

102
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,394
Speaker 0: No, they have all the power.

103
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,137
Speaker 1: You know what I would do?

104
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,677
Speaker 1: I would just make my own heaven in my own computer and go into it myself.

105
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:45,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, then someone turns it off.

106
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,773
Speaker 1: I would give it to like a bank or something.

107
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also talks about virtual war and all this stuff.

108
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:56,966
Speaker 0: So the reason I give you that sort of backdrop is that there's a story on Slashdot.

109
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,012
Speaker 1: A true story of the real world.

110
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,718
Speaker 0: That's kind of terrifying.

111
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:34,744
Speaker 0: Basically, the idea is there are scientists and doctors legitimately researching and kind of seriously proposing that one way we could deal with prisons is to basically dilate time in people's brains using technology like chemicals or transcranial stimulation or whatever to make them live out the equivalent of thousand year sentences that take a matter of weeks or months to sufficiently punish them for their crimes while at the same time pragmatically being able to release them sooner.

112
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:42,811
Speaker 1: That is, I mean, so being able to do that is totally awesome and we should totally research how to do that.

113
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:49,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, put me in prison for a thousand years if that time dilation is me experiencing a thousand years of consuming all human media.

114
00:05:51,340 --> 00:06:03,234
Speaker 1: No, I mean, that's a very important thing to research and I'm sure such scientific research will bear much fruit that is valuable to humanity, but using it in that way is just evil.

115
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:08,087
Speaker 0: Scott and I, if you haven't, are very...

116
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,698
Speaker 1: I mean, prison's evil to begin with.

117
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,524
Speaker 1: You're basically just making it more evil.

118
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,046
Speaker 0: Yup.

119
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:21,554
Speaker 1: So this article, you're just a vengeful piece of shit is the purpose of the purpose of criminal justice isn't vengeance.

120
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,786
Speaker 0: Well, that is the purpose for most people, right?

121
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,112
Speaker 1: Well, those are the evil people.

122
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:26,695
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

123
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:27,077
Speaker 0: Yep.

124
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,868
Speaker 1: Or they should be like, we should get vengeance upon them.

125
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,970
Speaker 0: They might just be ignorant and fearful, which is the same thing as being evil has the same effect.

126
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:36,592
Speaker 1: Yeah.

127
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:37,916
Speaker 1: So fuck them too.

128
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:38,498
Speaker 0: Yup.

129
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:47,035
Speaker 0: But it's interesting that so many people like this whole article and this whole debate is predicated on the idea that the primary purpose of prison is punishment.

130
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:48,421
Speaker 0: You like that alliteration there?

131
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,068
Speaker 1: Stan Lee would be proud.

132
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,977
Speaker 0: Which is kind of the worst possible thing.

133
00:06:54,037 --> 00:07:01,326
Speaker 0: So we'll take someone who is going to be in jail for 90 years cause they like raped a bunch of babies, put them in jail for five minutes.

134
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:06,163
Speaker 0: They experienced 90 years of jail and then they're back out on the street.

135
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:07,790
Speaker 1: Great.

136
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:10,160
Speaker 0: And they're going to live as long as they would have lived before.

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,670
Speaker 0: Anyway, I suspect baby raping will continue.

138
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:18,586
Speaker 1: No, you don't say he just went a thousand years without raping a baby.

139
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,415
Speaker 1: He wants a baby more than ever.

140
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:24,425
Speaker 0: You gave him infinite babies in that virtual hell.

141
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,492
Speaker 0: Then maybe he'd baby himself out.

142
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:27,094
Speaker 1: Great.

143
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,900
Speaker 1: He'd move on to fetuses.

144
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,602
Speaker 1: Fetus ravers.

145
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:53,814
Speaker 0: So everything in this is predicated on that idea when in my opinion, and not to belabor the point cause this is not what the show is about, the primary purpose of a judicial system and a punishment structure should be one, if possible, to undo damage that was done, secondarily to prevent if possible and reasonable future harm.

146
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:54,936
Speaker 1: That's it.

147
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,127
Speaker 1: So, I mean, it's really, it's only the second one.

148
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,136
Speaker 1: You can't change the past, right?

149
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:08,310
Speaker 0: But the judicial system, like for example, say I rob you and you get arrested, maybe they take your assets and give them to me to replace what I lost.

150
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:08,692
Speaker 0: Yeah.

151
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:09,113
Speaker 1: All right.

152
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:10,318
Speaker 1: That's not undoing.

153
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:12,225
Speaker 1: That's simply rectifying.

154
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's rectified.

155
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:17,826
Speaker 0: But it's undoing it in a sense that it mitigates not undo like Photoshop.

156
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:18,046
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:22,142
Speaker 0: But I guess goal one should be as much as possible repair the damage.

158
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:27,589
Speaker 0: Like if you stab me, the judicial system should make sure that I get unstabbed as much as medical science allows.

159
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,831
Speaker 1: Right.

160
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,661
Speaker 0: But not the number two, it takes away your knife.

161
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:29,862
Speaker 1: Right.

162
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,732
Speaker 1: But stabbing the stabber doesn't help anyone.

163
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,116
Speaker 1: They both just frickin.

164
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:38,936
Speaker 0: if there was evidence that it did, I would be more okay with there isn't.

165
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,962
Speaker 1: It's just Hammurabi barbarianism.

166
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:41,243
Speaker 0: Yep.

167
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,272
Speaker 1: Now there are for you on enlightened.

168
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:53,651
Speaker 0: There are instances where certain combinations of likelihood of being punished and severity of punishment is a deterrent to certain crimes, but not all crimes.

169
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:54,394
Speaker 0: Probably not.

170
00:08:54,474 --> 00:09:01,783
Speaker 1: You think if these drugs were perfect and had no side effects and worked as exactly as they would provide any extra deterrent?

171
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:02,686
Speaker 0: No, that's the thing.

172
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,454
Speaker 0: This is both evil and misguided.

173
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:11,909
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that, for example, if there is a punishment, if you're not in order to deterred by prison, you're not going to be deterred by drug prison.

174
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:18,061
Speaker 0: Like if there's a punishment for littering and that was actually enforced, a lot of people would probably not litter who otherwise would litter.

175
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:34,909
Speaker 0: But studies show time and time again that the punishments for murder don't really prevent the kinds of people who murder from murdering because the reasons they murder, if someone, most people who decide I'm going to murder someone, they're not really thinking about the likelihood of the death penalty.

176
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,663
Speaker 0: They're not like, well, is this worth 20 years in prison?

177
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,062
Speaker 0: If they got to that point of asking that question, they're probably not going to murder.

178
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:48,246
Speaker 0: Or it's going to be one of those situations like in the old days in Texas where the judge will be like, not guilty.

179
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:49,429
Speaker 0: He had it coming.

180
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:58,480
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this is a fascinating article about a lot of people who are effectively evil, even if they don't realize they're evil.

181
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:03,103
Speaker 1: Well, they could be doing valuable research, though, as long as they don't use it for what they want to use it for.

182
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:11,095
Speaker 0: Yes, seriously, the research of put me to sleep, I wake up in Boston for PAX, and along the way I watched every movie humans have ever made.

183
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:14,610
Speaker 0: I would pay it for a small fee for that service.

184
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,514
Speaker 1: It's called The Matrix.

185
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,578
Speaker 1: I know kung fu.

186
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:17,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

187
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,344
Speaker 1: I want that very badly.

188
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,111
Speaker 1: It's pretty high on the list.

189
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,540
Speaker 1: Top five of things I want very badly.

190
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what that is?

191
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:24,608
Speaker 1: Not number one.

192
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:26,256
Speaker 0: That gets real close to the culture.

193
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:31,560
Speaker 1: Oh, look, I know every language that humans have ever spoken, even lost and forgotten languages.

194
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,643
Speaker 1: How useful is that?

195
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:38,598
Speaker 1: All right, so this is a completely unrelated news, sort of a...

196
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,964
Speaker 0: I would assume so.

197
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:43,018
Speaker 0: How many news can there be related to real world hells?

198
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:50,845
Speaker 1: Right, it's also sort of a self-centered news, but whatevs, it is somewhat important to anyone who's nerdy and cares about technology.

199
00:10:51,046 --> 00:11:07,338
Speaker 1: So the camera that I have right now that I've been using for Netrunner videos and taking photos at cons and pretty much everything I do is a Panasonic GF2, which some people call the GF series the girlfriend series.

200
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,947
Speaker 1: And basically it's a micro four thirds system.

201
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:17,594
Speaker 1: So people don't know, micro four thirds camera is a camera where you take the lens off, just like a real serious DSLR, right?

202
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:22,269
Speaker 1: But there's no mirror in between the lens and the sensor.

203
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,777
Speaker 1: So the camera is much, much smaller.

204
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:35,015
Speaker 1: The other thing is the sensor is much, much smaller, not much smaller to where it's like as small as your point and shoot or your phone, but smaller than a full frame DSLR.

205
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,772
Speaker 0: Small enough where I can carry it around running without much difficulty.

206
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:50,293
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's basically this weird balance between I want a smaller, lighter camera, but the sensor is still big enough to where, wow, the quality is that much better than a phone.

207
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,381
Speaker 1: It's actually worth having this camera.

208
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:53,404
Speaker 0: Such quality.

209
00:11:53,705 --> 00:12:04,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not as, it's not as quality as the full for real DSLRs, but it's such quality that it's way better than your phone to where it's actually worth carrying this extra thing.

210
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:08,160
Speaker 1: If you care about photo quality or videoing, anything of consequence.

211
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,739
Speaker 0: I basically have a moderately newer version of what essentially is the same line.

212
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:27,415
Speaker 1: I have the GX one, the GX seven, I guess is the newest of that line is also a G. They still make the GFS, but basically after the GF two, the GF series started basically becoming, you know, the dumb cameras, you know, but they all take the same lenses, whatever.

213
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,703
Speaker 1: So they announced recently.

214
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:36,000
Speaker 1: the GH for the GH series is like the, wow, it looks like it's a DSLR.

215
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:42,485
Speaker 1: It's got the grip on it and it has a bunch of buttons and it's like super pro and super fancy look and take the same lenses.

216
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:50,554
Speaker 1: Uh, but it's like serious business, still way smaller than a DSLR though, way smaller, but serious business.

217
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:56,599
Speaker 1: And a lot of people were using GH twos and GH threes for video because they're totally fucking awesome for video.

218
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:01,777
Speaker 1: If you're doing 10 ADP videos, GH twos and GH threes are still super awesome cameras.

219
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:15,089
Speaker 0: The only reason I don't use mine for video at conventions is that due to the quick setup, tear down nature and the variability of access to things like power, I use a camcorder like a handicam with a hard drive and giant batteries in it.

220
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:21,417
Speaker 0: that's not as good from a video standpoint, but much better from an actually using it to record multiple hours in a row.

221
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:27,550
Speaker 1: So the GH four, see like if you're just going to make some 10 ADP videos, you're probably going to be able to get a GH three mad cheap.

222
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,882
Speaker 1: People will probably be selling them used on eBay and stuff.

223
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:35,384
Speaker 1: So I might even just pick one up if it's cheap enough or even a GH two cause one extra camera can't hurt.

224
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:35,645
Speaker 1: Right.

225
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:45,456
Speaker 1: Uh, but the GH four is super insane and it's, you can preorder it now and it'll be out like beginning of may.

226
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:50,338
Speaker 1: So not in time for these conventions of course, but in time for every other convention after that.

227
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:55,155
Speaker 0: And why is it in time for a really stepping up the game of our own video production?

228
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,725
Speaker 1: So why is this camera such a big deal?

229
00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:05,010
Speaker 1: Just another upgrade in the series of existing cameras because this camera can do four K videos.

230
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:06,534
Speaker 1: Oh my glob.

231
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,720
Speaker 1: And it's only, it's still expensive.

232
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 1: It's not a cheap piece of equipment, but it's $1,800.

233
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:21,590
Speaker 1: Now in terms of other cameras that can do four K video, you've got the GoPro three, which is only a few hundred dollars, but that doesn't really, that doesn't do it right.

234
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,721
Speaker 1: That's not the same kind of video we're talking here.

235
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:29,642
Speaker 1: Other cameras that do four K are like for real cameras that cost tens of thousands of dollars.

236
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:41,877
Speaker 1: So suddenly you're getting the equivalent of like, you know, something that is definitely capable of doing for reals pro video four K for less than $2,000.

237
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:52,140
Speaker 0: Of course now you start to run into the, the issue, not the issue, but the reality that a lot of the infrastructure around doing four K has nothing to do with the camera, right?

238
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,435
Speaker 1: I mean, the red camera was a big deal in that, you know, it basically was the equivalent of a multi hundred thousand dollar camera for only tens of thousands.

239
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:09,422
Speaker 1: And now they've got the GH four, which is the equivalent of a tens of thousands of dollar camera for under 2000s.

240
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,244
Speaker 1: is going to be crazy.

241
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,028
Speaker 1: And all my existing lenses work on it.

242
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:12,609
Speaker 1: So I don't have to like.

243
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,298
Speaker 1: if you look at like the features of this thing online, it's pretty ridiculous.

244
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,132
Speaker 1: Oh, in body stabilization that doesn't have embodies.

245
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:25,519
Speaker 1: That's the only thing it doesn't have.

246
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,265
Speaker 0: This review says it does.

247
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,333
Speaker 1: That review is wrong by Panasonic.

248
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:30,979
Speaker 0: The G seven incorporates seven.

249
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,943
Speaker 1: The G X seven does.

250
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:34,429
Speaker 1: The GH four does not.

251
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,902
Speaker 1: Ah, uh, it seems to be a big deal for a lot of people.

252
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:45,274
Speaker 0: The in body stabilization, if you get, if you want a lens, if you want the camera to do it, you have lenses that don't do it, but then right.

253
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,865
Speaker 1: The only way to do it would be, I guess, in post.

254
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:48,407
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:54,757
Speaker 1: Or you only really need the stabilization if you're, if you're like running around with the camera while videoing or something like that.

256
00:15:54,777 --> 00:16:00,942
Speaker 0: Well, I need it a lot because a lot of the pictures I take even are in pretty low light conditions and zoomed in.

257
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,936
Speaker 0: And with those combined, the stabilization really helps me out.

258
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,920
Speaker 1: That does help you out.

259
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,935
Speaker 1: But yeah, most of the Panasonic lenses have it built into the lens.

260
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:15,059
Speaker 1: The thing is the one built in the lens is good, but not as good as the in camera ones that like Olympus has.

261
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:15,943
Speaker 1: They're really good.

262
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:21,664
Speaker 1: But if you're serious, you're just getting like a steady camera, some shit if you really need it.

263
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:22,126
Speaker 1: Right.

264
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,222
Speaker 1: But anyway, the thing is, you might be saying, well, even so, why do I need?

265
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:30,092
Speaker 1: why is a 4K camera even no matter how cheap a big deal?

266
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,742
Speaker 1: No one has a 4K TV right now.

267
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:40,327
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, it's future proof, which is nice, but why not just buy a 4K camera later when everyone has 4K TVs?

268
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:41,752
Speaker 1: And there's some truth to that.

269
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,264
Speaker 1: But recording 4K video is a bigger deal for other reasons.

270
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:51,321
Speaker 1: For example, I can record a 4K video of us up on a stage doing a panel.

271
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:55,573
Speaker 1: And when I zoom in to just my face, that'll be 1080p.

272
00:16:56,877 --> 00:17:01,017
Speaker 1: Right now, we record 1080p if we zoom into one person's face, that's less than 1080p.

273
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

274
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:09,053
Speaker 0: Also, every time it's like you have multiple cameras for the price of one camera, we need more cameras to have more camera angles at these conventions.

275
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:13,290
Speaker 0: So might as well, every time I buy a camera, buy the most future proof one out there.

276
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,894
Speaker 1: That's also true.

277
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,666
Speaker 0: So that eventually our cheapest camera is only the backup.

278
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:24,570
Speaker 1: Another thing you can do is instead of like taking photos, you can just take 4K video, right, of everything.

279
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:30,693
Speaker 1: And then when you get home, look through the 4K video, find the single frame that is the photo you wanted.

280
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:36,899
Speaker 1: And that's an eight megapixel photo, which is, you know, you couldn't print like a super fancy magazine with that, probably.

281
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:37,884
Speaker 1: But that's still.

282
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,993
Speaker 1: eight megapixels is definitely enough to print.

283
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,744
Speaker 0: Storage and power considerations notwithstanding.

284
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:44,367
Speaker 1: Right.

285
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:44,648
Speaker 1: Yeah.

286
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:54,675
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, that's definitely a process that a lot of people are switching to is don't take photos, just take video of everything and then pick out the frames, you know, because the video is good enough for whatever you're doing.

287
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,367
Speaker 1: You don't need, you know, it has a 16 megapixel sensor.

288
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,897
Speaker 1: Well, what if I don't need a 16 megapixel photo?

289
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:00,861
Speaker 1: I just need eight.

290
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,468
Speaker 0: So also you've got this.

291
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:11,004
Speaker 1: What are the odds that I'm going to push this button at the exact right moment of this sporting event versus the camera button is always pressed and I'll just find the awesome frame later.

292
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:23,521
Speaker 0: So software stabilization can be way better because if I'm if I'm producing 1080 video and I've got a 4K source wide, I can stabilize the ever living fuck out of that.

293
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:27,677
Speaker 1: And after effects, that is absolutely another thing that I was about to mention.

294
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:39,462
Speaker 1: So, you know, if you're someone out there who does photos or videos like this camera is, you know, there are other cameras that beat it in pretty much a lot of different categories like low light photography.

295
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:47,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, a Nikon D4S is going to just crush you because it goes up to like ISO 256,000 or something like that.

296
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:54,185
Speaker 1: And the smaller sensor, you know, like once you go above ISO, maybe 6400, it's not good anymore.

297
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,733
Speaker 1: Even 6400 might not be good.

298
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,506
Speaker 0: I still gotta go through all those pictures we tried to take of the stars that one night.

299
00:18:58,526 --> 00:18:59,149
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

300
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,448
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, in each area, this camera is deficient in some way compared to others.

301
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:19,315
Speaker 1: But overall, like this thing is is game changing, not just for people like me who change, who are already like invested in the micro four thirds camera system, but just cameras, videos and photos in general.

302
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,163
Speaker 1: This thing is pretty significant.

303
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:29,525
Speaker 1: So also, you know, even if you don't care about this individual camera, it's basically pushing the whole market.

304
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:35,063
Speaker 1: Now, almost every other camera maker now has to come out with some sort of 4K thing.

305
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:45,647
Speaker 1: So 4K recording is going to be available in general to the average prosumer population within a year or two.

306
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:46,570
Speaker 1: Right.

307
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:48,896
Speaker 1: And YouTube already supports 4K.

308
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:55,023
Speaker 1: And I do know at least one or two people that have 4K TVs.

309
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,624
Speaker 1: So watch out.

310
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,525
Speaker 1: It's happening.

311
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:58,386
Speaker 1: It's happening.

312
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,796
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

313
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:07,599
Speaker 0: Got a thing of the day?

314
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,670
Speaker 1: Well, you know, baseball, the spring training is going on.

315
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,034
Speaker 1: A lot of people are paying attention to that.

316
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:18,817
Speaker 1: baseball and the the college basketball tournament, I think, starts like now or tomorrow.

317
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:21,044
Speaker 1: It's starting basically now ish.

318
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:23,332
Speaker 1: So that's pretty much taken up all the U.S.

319
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:24,055
Speaker 1: sports.

320
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:24,376
Speaker 1: Right.

321
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:26,685
Speaker 1: And even NBA is getting tons and tons of coverage.

322
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:29,374
Speaker 1: People forget the most important sport of all ever.

323
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,605
Speaker 1: Ice hockey is still happening right now.

324
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,432
Speaker 1: It is still the ice hockey season.

325
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:35,838
Speaker 1: Just no one's paying attention to it.

326
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:36,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

327
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,750
Speaker 0: Partly because Red Wing is not doing so well.

328
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,057
Speaker 1: The only reason not doing so well anyway.

329
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:50,058
Speaker 1: So to remind people that the most important sport ever, ice hockey, is still happening as we speak.

330
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,125
Speaker 1: Here is a hockey video.

331
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,670
Speaker 1: It's not actually an NHL video.

332
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,950
Speaker 1: It's from the LNAH, which is, I think, something some Canadian league, whatever, minor league hockey.

333
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,097
Speaker 1: But it is a hockey fight.

334
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,452
Speaker 1: And from the start, it looks like a pretty good hockey fight as far as hockey fights go.

335
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,818
Speaker 1: But watch till the end.

336
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,121
Speaker 1: Trust me.

337
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,147
Speaker 1: Watch till the end.

338
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,390
Speaker 0: Not even going to spoil it.

339
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,133
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

340
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,879
Speaker 1: Watch to the end of this video.

341
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,970
Speaker 1: This shows you why hockey is the best sport.

342
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,277
Speaker 1: Ignore that basketball bullshit that's happening.

343
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:22,420
Speaker 1: It's worthless.

344
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:28,740
Speaker 0: So we've talked about this before, but John Green's Crash Course is amazing.

345
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:29,904
Speaker 0: The Green Brothers.

346
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:30,667
Speaker 1: Your favorite thing.

347
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:31,671
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an amazing thing.

348
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,937
Speaker 0: Have you watched any of it, Scott?

349
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:33,981
Speaker 1: No, I still no.

350
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:34,945
Speaker 0: You really should.

351
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:36,110
Speaker 1: I got better shit to do.

352
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:37,334
Speaker 0: They're short.

353
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:38,921
Speaker 0: They're like 12 minutes long.

354
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:39,885
Speaker 1: I ain't got time for that.

355
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,130
Speaker 0: And they teach you stuff.

356
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,097
Speaker 0: They're better than any documentary.

357
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:45,420
Speaker 0: They're brilliantly done.

358
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,980
Speaker 1: These are the template for how to do informative, engaging, interesting content on YouTube.

359
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,590
Speaker 0: Also, I would kill to have their studio.

360
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,077
Speaker 1: Would it be better if they recorded in 4K?

361
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:58,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

362
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:04,356
Speaker 0: They do the whiteout background, which we cannot do for lack of space.

363
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:11,901
Speaker 0: So they have started up a couple of new series because they've gone like American history, world history, all these things.

364
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:13,990
Speaker 0: So I want to particularly highlight.

365
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:20,249
Speaker 0: John Green has restarted the literature one, which very famously did The Great Gatsby.

366
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:25,369
Speaker 0: A lot of Geek Nights listeners enjoyed that multi-part commentary on that book and how great it is.

367
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:29,562
Speaker 0: But he started with The Odyssey and Hamlet.

368
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,227
Speaker 1: I have pop-up Odyssey.

369
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,754
Speaker 1: I know everything there is to know about the Odyssey with my pop-up book.

370
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:34,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, the moral.

371
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,724
Speaker 0: Odysseus was kind of a dick.

372
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,650
Speaker 1: No, you don't say.

373
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:39,975
Speaker 0: This video is just delightful.

374
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:43,989
Speaker 1: You could have called him Odysseus if you wanted to.

375
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:48,843
Speaker 0: The only person more of a dick than him is Poseidon.

376
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:50,448
Speaker 1: The king of all dicks.

377
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:51,551
Speaker 0: You know what, Poseidon?

378
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:52,896
Speaker 1: Is the awesomest.

379
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:57,270
Speaker 0: Poseidon, I do not mean that as anything other than a compliment.

380
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,315
Speaker 1: Well, no, because think about it, right?

381
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,382
Speaker 0: Please don't drown me.

382
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:00,851
Speaker 1: It's like they're both dicks, right?

383
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:04,546
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, it's like there's different kinds of dicks, right?

384
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:06,133
Speaker 1: Odysseus is like, "Wow, what a dick.

385
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:06,595
Speaker 1: Fuck that

386
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:06,877
Speaker 1: guy.".

387
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,709
Speaker 1: And Poseidon is like, "Wow, what a glorious

388
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:09,809
Speaker 1: dick.".

389
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,158
Speaker 1: Holy shit, that is amazing.

390
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:15,025
Speaker 0: Oh, you're disrespecting me?

391
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,110
Speaker 0: You wanted to go home?

392
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:19,776
Speaker 1: Oh, you're in a ship.

393
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:24,790
Speaker 1: Why are you disrespecting me when you're in my house?

394
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,495
Speaker 1: How stupid could you be?

395
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:30,670
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen a lot of stupid people out here in my house before.

396
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:35,624
Speaker 1: You are by far, by far the dumbest.

397
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:38,412
Speaker 0: I mean, even Athena is like, "Yeah, I don't piss him off, guys.

398
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:39,577
Speaker 0: I don't want to piss him

399
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:39,858
Speaker 0: off.".

400
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,088
Speaker 0: Even Zeus is probably like, "Yeah, just let him

401
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:42,269
Speaker 0: be.".

402
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,200
Speaker 1: Listen, the ocean, there aren't a lot of people out here in total.

403
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:52,101
Speaker 1: I can pay a lot of attention to you, and I don't really have much else going on right now.

404
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:55,172
Speaker 1: I mean, some fishes over here and some waves over there.

405
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,616
Speaker 0: Charybdis just hanging out.

406
00:23:56,676 --> 00:24:01,169
Speaker 1: I'm kind of bored, so I got no problems fucking you up.

407
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,680
Speaker 1: I mean, them other gods, they might be real busy.

408
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,126
Speaker 0: This gave me an idea.

409
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:11,411
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing that I don't want to make because it'd be too much effort, but I want to see a skit at a convention, right?

410
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:21,142
Speaker 0: Where there's a guy dressed up as Poseidon, and on Thursday morning, he picks one dude and ruins his entire con over the course of four days.

411
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:27,350
Speaker 0: It just follows him everywhere, knocking food off the table, stealing his cosplay, interrupting his panels.

412
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,230
Speaker 1: Go to the bathroom, fill a bucket with water, splash it on him.

413
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,032
Speaker 0: Yeah.

414
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,988
Speaker 0: In the meantime, the Book Club book is Wool by Hugh Howrey.

415
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,516
Speaker 0: I've read the first few chapters.

416
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,890
Speaker 1: I read the whole thing.

417
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm burning through it pretty quickly.

418
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:51,614
Speaker 0: All I want to say, the first set of chapters, like the very first story that kind of ends effectively, it reminded me a lot of a Ray Bradbury short story.

419
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:56,850
Speaker 0: That stood on its own as a great short story with the correct twist.

420
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,038
Speaker 1: But am I not correct?

421
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,190
Speaker 1: Did you get the Logan's run feel?

422
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,357
Speaker 0: Got the Logan's run, got the paranoia.

423
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,170
Speaker 1: Did you get the paranoid feel, the fallout feel?

424
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:02,653
Speaker 0: Yep.

425
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,481
Speaker 1: All right.

426
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:04,209
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

427
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:08,889
Speaker 0: There's some other feel that I'm not quite sure about yet going on.

428
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:10,299
Speaker 1: There's some other feels in there.

429
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,430
Speaker 0: I haven't read too far in yet.

430
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,432
Speaker 1: I know everything.

431
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:12,894
Speaker 0: Yep.

432
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:19,180
Speaker 0: Problem is, the author has a lot of sentences that have the same word too many times.

433
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:20,130
Speaker 1: Okay.

434
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,745
Speaker 1: Let's just do the whole Book Club episode now.

435
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:23,250
Speaker 1: I've finished it.

436
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,441
Speaker 0: She stood before the door before.

437
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:26,969
Speaker 0: She was like, "No, don't say before

438
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:27,210
Speaker 0: twice.".

439
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,990
Speaker 0: That's the kind of person I am when I read books.

440
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,574
Speaker 1: Okay.

441
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,764
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

442
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:34,430
Speaker 0: It's a Book Club book.

443
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,740
Speaker 1: Save it for the Book Club episode.

444
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:35,881
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,890
Speaker 0: Well, I got to finish reading it.

446
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,705
Speaker 0: We are going to be at Animu Boston.

447
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:40,550
Speaker 1: Tomorrow.

448
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,112
Speaker 0: Yeah.

449
00:25:41,132 --> 00:25:42,101
Speaker 0: We're taking a bus.

450
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,069
Speaker 1: We're going to be there at noon.

451
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,360
Speaker 1: So you can come see us there.

452
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,145
Speaker 1: We got some panels.

453
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,030
Speaker 1: What panels are they?

454
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,240
Speaker 0: Friday, 2 p.m Panel 309.

455
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,406
Speaker 0: Fundamental anime.

456
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:52,330
Speaker 1: It's anime you should see.

457
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,255
Speaker 1: We retitled it.

458
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:53,920
Speaker 1: Don't come.

459
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 1: if you've seen anime you should see before.

460
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:59,209
Speaker 0: Tell your friends who watch shit anime to go see it.

461
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,691
Speaker 0: Yeah.

462
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,463
Speaker 0: Saturday at noon.

463
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,279
Speaker 0: The secret guide to running panels.

464
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,110
Speaker 1: We've done that a hundred times.

465
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,938
Speaker 1: You can even just watch it on YouTube.

466
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:08,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

467
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,530
Speaker 0: When we recorded it from our living room.

468
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,850
Speaker 1: But maybe if you know, you need that extra kick in the ass to do some panels at a con.

469
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,716
Speaker 0: So guys, when we do panels like that, how to run an anime club, like how to panel, we don't fuck around.

470
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:26,793
Speaker 0: Like we'll take some questions and we're going to give you real answers.

471
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,999
Speaker 0: You might not like the answers.

472
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,761
Speaker 1: More real than like people say they're going to give you the real deal and they don't.

473
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:32,850
Speaker 1: Ours is too real.

474
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,777
Speaker 0: Here's an example.

475
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:34,830
Speaker 1: So real people can't handle it.

476
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:45,330
Speaker 0: We've never put up a video of when we do those, like how to run an anime club panels, but we give advice like have a democracy, but on the inside you need to be super corrupt.

477
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:46,877
Speaker 0: And here's how to be corrupt.

478
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:49,470
Speaker 1: Make an autocracy that looks like a democracy.

479
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,660
Speaker 1: Rig the election if necessary.

480
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,050
Speaker 1: Take everyone's votes and then just announce the winner is the person you wanted all along.

481
00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:01,590
Speaker 0: You are grooming people in advance, like strategies on how to get rid of that guy, like how to make that guy stop showing up to your anime club.

482
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:03,005
Speaker 0: Yup.

483
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:03,290
Speaker 0: Anyway.

484
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:04,292
Speaker 0: Yeah.

485
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:06,301
Speaker 0: Saturday at 2 30, panel 3 0 9.

486
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,450
Speaker 0: Not all anime are what they seem.

487
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,181
Speaker 1: A panel we came up with to fill the schedule.

488
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,790
Speaker 0: And it ended up being a pretty good panel.

489
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:14,643
Speaker 0: There's a section in the middle, a little bit trolly.

490
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:15,549
Speaker 0: You guys might enjoy it.

491
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,362
Speaker 0: And then Saturday, 7 30 p.m.

492
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,029
Speaker 0: in the constitution room.

493
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,405
Speaker 0: Judge anime by its cover.

494
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:24,350
Speaker 1: The good panel.

495
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,790
Speaker 1: People loved it last year, so let's just keep it going and do it every year.

496
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,130
Speaker 0: I think we'll do it every year because it self-populates.

497
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,384
Speaker 0: And by definition, we cannot prepare for it.

498
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:36,890
Speaker 0: Preparing for it ruins it.

499
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:38,839
Speaker 1: That's right.

500
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:46,266
Speaker 0: All the prep I do is I take all the shows on the chart, put them in a slideshow, and I do a Google image search on like five random ones just to see.

501
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:46,629
Speaker 0: And that's it.

502
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,151
Speaker 1: Yup.

503
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,089
Speaker 0: It's super fun for us to do, too.

504
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,377
Speaker 0: So I'm digging this.

505
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,310
Speaker 1: And people liked it last time, so why not?

506
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,851
Speaker 0: Yeah.

507
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:53,655
Speaker 0: So come say hi.

508
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:54,399
Speaker 0: Come to our panels.

509
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,336
Speaker 0: Mike Tool, all the other cool kids are going to be there doing panels.

510
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:57,497
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:27:57,537 --> 00:28:02,029
Speaker 1: Go to Anime How, go to Dubs of Time Forgot, go to all the... There's a panel that we can't go to.

512
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,282
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to bring this up in my guidebook.

513
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:04,604
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

514
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:05,450
Speaker 0: There's a panel we can't like.

515
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,990
Speaker 1: There's a panel that's conflicting with our panel.

516
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:08,861
Speaker 0: Well, I'll go to it.

517
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:09,430
Speaker 0: You do the panel.

518
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:10,496
Speaker 1: That is... Hold on.

519
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,895
Speaker 0: You had to run that Nightrunner panel by yourself at Kineticon because I had to go deal with a bunch of stuff.

520
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,790
Speaker 1: Japan Ice Hockey and the Asia League.

521
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,291
Speaker 0: What?

522
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:24,961
Speaker 1: This panel, look inside the world of ice hockey as it pertains to Japan.

523
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:26,109
Speaker 0: Who the shit is running that?

524
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,441
Speaker 0: Because we're getting them on geek nights.

525
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:28,410
Speaker 1: We can't go to it.

526
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,790
Speaker 1: No, we're going to... It's at 2.30.

527
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,600
Speaker 1: It's right on top of fundamental anime.

528
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:37,550
Speaker 1: So we can actually, if we run out of fundamental anime, no, it's only a half hour long, their panel.

529
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:40,528
Speaker 1: No, their panel is a 15 minute panel.

530
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:40,769
Speaker 0: What?

531
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,481
Speaker 1: Guidebook is fucked up.

532
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:43,029
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever.

533
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,737
Speaker 1: Their panel and fundamental anime both end at three, but theirs starts at 2.30 and ours starts at two.

534
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,090
Speaker 1: So we can't see it at all.

535
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,630
Speaker 1: We can ask Lou who's running it and find that person.

536
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:52,976
Speaker 0: Yes.

537
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:55,670
Speaker 0: You might say that's in our wheelhouse.

538
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,333
Speaker 0: Maybe.

539
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

540
00:28:58,325 --> 00:28:59,070
Speaker 1: Go to that panel.

541
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:00,213
Speaker 0: Yeah.

542
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,082
Speaker 0: We're also going to be at PAX East.

543
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,870
Speaker 0: We're also going to be at Zenkai Con.

544
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,159
Speaker 0: We're also going to be at Kineticon.

545
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,450
Speaker 0: We're also going to be at PAX Prime.

546
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:07,417
Speaker 0: PAX Dev.

547
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,230
Speaker 0: I'm going to be at PAX Australia.

548
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,937
Speaker 0: Shit's happening in the future.

549
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,290
Speaker 0: Forum, YouTube, watcher stuff, whatever.

550
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,577
Speaker 1: Our IRC channel.

551
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:18,161
Speaker 1: We have one.

552
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:19,449
Speaker 1: People are in it.

553
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,857
Speaker 0: So I hope we didn't do a show on this.

554
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,249
Speaker 1: We almost definitely did a show on this.

555
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:24,932
Speaker 0: Yeah.

556
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:25,795
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

557
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:29,290
Speaker 0: I kept searching and all I kept finding was flying ghost shit.

558
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,931
Speaker 1: Right.

559
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:30,714
Speaker 1: I found that also.

560
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,279
Speaker 1: This is one of those things where it's like, we've discussed it.

561
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,450
Speaker 1: This is the hard part, right?

562
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,690
Speaker 1: It's like you've discussed a topic on tons of shows.

563
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,977
Speaker 1: And if you went back through all our shows and cut out all the pieces, we've talked about this.

564
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,530
Speaker 1: We've probably discussed.

565
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,870
Speaker 1: We're probably just going to be repeating ourselves, but it's never actually been the main bit of an episode.

566
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,517
Speaker 1: So it'll be consolidated.

567
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:52,401
Speaker 0: You can link to it.

568
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,170
Speaker 0: You can discuss it.

569
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,539
Speaker 1: And it helps us get away with the show.

570
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:01,161
Speaker 0: Partly because I fly a lot these days, both for work and for geek nights.

571
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:06,970
Speaker 1: I mean, I've always flown a moderate amount more than most people, but never the crazy amount that a business traveler does.

572
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,222
Speaker 0: So as a kid, I didn't fly often, actually.

573
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,550
Speaker 0: I never flew anywhere.

574
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,273
Speaker 1: It's weird.

575
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:14,270
Speaker 1: I didn't fly, didn't fly, didn't fly, didn't fly for the longest time.

576
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,490
Speaker 1: And then once I started to fly and I flew like crazy.

577
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,930
Speaker 0: I think that's a consequence of living in the Northeast or the Midwest.

578
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,890
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the only place we ever went as in my childhood that was worthy of flying was Florida.

579
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,483
Speaker 1: And my parents would like, first we drove there.

580
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:28,690
Speaker 1: Then we drove there again.

581
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,580
Speaker 1: Then we took the auto train there.

582
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,270
Speaker 1: And then we started flying.

583
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:33,134
Speaker 1: Right.

584
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:38,825
Speaker 1: It took like three times of doing it the inexpensive way before giving up and doing it the fast, least superior way.

585
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,378
Speaker 0: We were always a road trip family.

586
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,870
Speaker 0: Like we would prep the fuck out of road trips.

587
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,490
Speaker 0: We would like the days before we'd be like filling the car with stuff, making like getting the cooler like situated.

588
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:51,399
Speaker 0: Yep.

589
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:52,458
Speaker 1: Road trips.

590
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,129
Speaker 1: That's an episode.

591
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:53,838
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

592
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,409
Speaker 0: We'll do a show on that.

593
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,490
Speaker 1: That's an episode we definitely haven't done.

594
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,550
Speaker 1: You know, and then like once I went to college, I was using JetBlue to fly home to JFK.

595
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:01,662
Speaker 1: It's like a 45 minute flight.

596
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:08,130
Speaker 0: I was driving because there aren't cheap flights to Detroit from Rochester.

597
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,029
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

598
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,590
Speaker 0: Which was fine because we're not talking about road trips.

599
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:15,550
Speaker 0: So I didn't fly a lot as a kid.

600
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:25,370
Speaker 0: And the first time I flew other than in like a Cessna or something was when I flew to Florida with the marching band for like a marching competition in the orange bowl or citrus bowl or whatever.

601
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,389
Speaker 1: Usually schools will use buses for that and won't use planes.

602
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:28,911
Speaker 0: Yeah.

603
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:30,382
Speaker 0: We're not taking buses to Florida.

604
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:31,370
Speaker 0: Fuck that noise.

605
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:32,209
Speaker 1: People do it.

606
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't.

607
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:34,930
Speaker 0: We flew there and then we took buses around.

608
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,989
Speaker 0: I was gone for like two weeks.

609
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,910
Speaker 0: It was like over New Year's and everything.

610
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,749
Speaker 0: It was actually kind of awesome.

611
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:42,709
Speaker 0: So I started flying a lot, mostly for conventions.

612
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,274
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,509
Speaker 0: Because, but.

614
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,510
Speaker 1: You can't get to PAX without a plane, at least not easily.

615
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,051
Speaker 0: I did.

616
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:52,284
Speaker 0: I never had to fly to conventions regularly until I got sick.

617
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,670
Speaker 0: Although there's one time we flew to Boston.

618
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:57,368
Speaker 1: Yep.

619
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,990
Speaker 0: Because we just didn't want to deal with other transit.

620
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,890
Speaker 0: And it's basically not faster than taking the train.

621
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,110
Speaker 0: If you take into account security and cabs.

622
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,949
Speaker 1: It's also really cheap to take a short flight like that.

623
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,130
Speaker 0: But now I fly all the time for work.

624
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,710
Speaker 0: And we also fly to most of the bigger conventions we go to, except for the ones that are right here on the East coast.

625
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:21,550
Speaker 0: But most of the conventions we go to are an easy drive.

626
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,890
Speaker 0: It's more convenient to drive than to fly.

627
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,850
Speaker 0: The only times we don't drive is because driving ends up being more expensive.

628
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,372
Speaker 1: Yep.

629
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,348
Speaker 1: Because we don't have a car.

630
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:34,030
Speaker 0: And also gas is expensive and parking costs every dollar.

631
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:34,352
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:34,950
Speaker 1: Like Boston.

633
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,604
Speaker 1: The amount you pay for parking in Boston, if you're there for an extended period, will just be the cost of the plane ticket.

634
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:41,330
Speaker 1: you should have just flew.

635
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,130
Speaker 0: DC was easier because we'd park way outside and take the metro.

636
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,351
Speaker 0: Yeah.

637
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:47,810
Speaker 1: We parked in this way far the fuck away.

638
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,352
Speaker 1: Yeah.

639
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:49,249
Speaker 1: Not in the city.

640
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,950
Speaker 0: So I have an observation.

641
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:59,550
Speaker 0: I think that most people in America have never flown before and are somehow always at the airport and not in front.

642
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:01,589
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you got to consider, right?

643
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,110
Speaker 1: The people who know how to fly and fly often, right?

644
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,490
Speaker 1: Go to the airport and breeze through.

645
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,570
Speaker 1: So most of the people who are still in the airport going slow are people who don't fly often.

646
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,950
Speaker 1: And any given flight, you got to imagine, right?

647
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:20,070
Speaker 1: So take a random jet blue flight, like, I don't know, New York to, I don't know, West Palm, right?

648
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:25,790
Speaker 1: What percentage of that flight are people who fly all the goddamn time and know what the fuck they're doing?

649
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:30,729
Speaker 0: But when I was a kid, you know, because I remember the time when the TSA didn't exist.

650
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,929
Speaker 0: Like I would just fucking walk on the plane, go through a metal detector, put my bag in the extra, that was it.

651
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:36,809
Speaker 0: I could put whatever I wanted in my carry on.

652
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,230
Speaker 0: And it was always super easy and no one was ever in my way.

653
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,310
Speaker 1: The TSA has definitely made things worse, right?

654
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,389
Speaker 0: But like boarding planes was just like, go, go, go.

655
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,149
Speaker 0: Like no big deal.

656
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:55,670
Speaker 1: Listen, when the TWA terminal opened in JFK, my parents just went and you could just walk in off the street with no plane ticket or anything.

657
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,669
Speaker 1: And watch planes take off out the window.

658
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,809
Speaker 1: But I guess it's the can't go to the gate now.

659
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:06,869
Speaker 0: What amazes me is that every time I fly and I have to check in at the desk, because, you know, you can't always do some sort of auto check in.

660
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:15,870
Speaker 0: There's always every single person in front of me stands there at that check in thing for like five plus minutes.

661
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:16,347
Speaker 1: Yup.

662
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:21,766
Speaker 0: And there's always some problem like, and I can never figure out what these problems are.

663
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,550
Speaker 1: The problem is they're incompetent, but like they're always getting angry.

664
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:28,690
Speaker 0: The person there is just typing forever and typing forever.

665
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:34,110
Speaker 0: And then they like call the manager over there and he stands there watching while they keep like, what the fuck are they doing?

666
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,389
Speaker 0: How do you fuck this up?

667
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,429
Speaker 0: Because every time without fail, when I get up, I hand them my passport.

668
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,369
Speaker 0: They hand me my boarding pass and I immediately walk away.

669
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:42,942
Speaker 1: Yup.

670
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,770
Speaker 1: It's because people, you know, when you don't do something often, right?

671
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,510
Speaker 1: You got to imagine this person flies once every few years, if that, right?

672
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,188
Speaker 1: You don't know what the fuck to do.

673
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,309
Speaker 0: The first time I flew, I figured it out.

674
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:57,668
Speaker 0: It's not hard.

675
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,589
Speaker 0: Pack everything in a bag.

676
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,690
Speaker 0: Pack the stuff in a smaller bag you want with you on the plane.

677
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,848
Speaker 0: Bring some books.

678
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:06,188
Speaker 0: That's it.

679
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:06,830
Speaker 0: Like what?

680
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,969
Speaker 0: How do you fuck this up?

681
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,270
Speaker 0: You already bought your plane ticket.

682
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,550
Speaker 0: I'm convinced that most of the people in front of me in line aren't actually trying to fly anywhere.

683
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,550
Speaker 0: They just wandered into the airport by accident.

684
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:17,424
Speaker 1: I don't know.

685
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,450
Speaker 1: Maybe they bought a plane ticket that was wrong.

686
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:27,930
Speaker 1: They came at the wrong day or the wrong time, or they came too late, or they brought too much stuff and they're, you know, they didn't realize they couldn't bring that much stuff.

687
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,270
Speaker 0: Everyone in line seems to have a cart covered in like a hundred suitcases.

688
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,250
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I can understand the families, right?

689
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,210
Speaker 1: So you have five people.

690
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,870
Speaker 1: They got like five suitcases and they, you know, pushed them around.

691
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,529
Speaker 1: It's like, okay.

692
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:44,969
Speaker 1: But then you see these people, it's like, they got suitcases are like enough to carry every clothing I own.

693
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:47,670
Speaker 1: And it's like, where are you going and for how long?

694
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:47,970
Speaker 1: Yeah.

695
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:52,050
Speaker 0: If I'm going somewhere that long, I actually pack less because I do laundry.

696
00:35:52,512 --> 00:36:00,790
Speaker 0: In fact, the only time I pack a lot of clothes is if it's a weird trip where I'm going somewhere just long enough to need a lot of clothes, but not long enough to do laundry.

697
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:05,250
Speaker 1: It's just, people just don't know how to, how to do anything.

698
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,150
Speaker 0: I've also noticed something that really annoys me lately where they call for boarding, right?

699
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,290
Speaker 0: And they always call like Rose 50 through 80 can board now.

700
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:22,570
Speaker 0: And what I've noticed is that without fail, when they announced the first boarding group, pretty much everyone just stands up and tries to get on the plane.

701
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:26,909
Speaker 0: And the airlines don't actually stop anyone who wasn't supposed to board then.

702
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,390
Speaker 0: So the boarding just is a clusterfuck.

703
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,089
Speaker 0: There's the one fat slow lady blocking row two while everyone else is trying to get to the back.

704
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 0: So I was on a flight, not that long ago, right?

705
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,490
Speaker 0: I was in London and they did that.

706
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,770
Speaker 0: They called like the last X Rose.

707
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:48,909
Speaker 0: So I get in line behind a million people and the lady at the front turned away almost every single person.

708
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,250
Speaker 0: She actually turned away.

709
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,329
Speaker 0: People weren't supposed to board yet.

710
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,669
Speaker 0: They got so mad.

711
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,630
Speaker 0: One lady's one girl woman started like screaming at this attendant.

712
00:36:57,871 --> 00:36:58,510
Speaker 0: Like, what do you mean?

713
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,190
Speaker 0: I can't get on the plane.

714
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,590
Speaker 0: My ticket says, and she was like, do I have to call security?

715
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:04,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have pulled a conductor.

716
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,147
Speaker 1: Go for it.

717
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:06,708
Speaker 0: I wish every airline did that.

718
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:11,948
Speaker 0: The sheer joy I experienced watching these extremely want to fly that airline.

719
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:17,430
Speaker 0: angry, but it's almost always middle-aged ladies who are in line trying to board her.

720
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,188
Speaker 0: And they're not supposed to.

721
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:21,810
Speaker 0: It's never like the business traveler by himself.

722
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,333
Speaker 0: It's never.

723
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:29,370
Speaker 1: the airlines are one of those things where I wish, I think somebody could, you know, make a lot of money or I hope they could make a lot of money.

724
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:36,550
Speaker 1: They would definitely get my money if they would just make jerk airline, which is basically this airline is for people who know what the fuck they're doing only.

725
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,329
Speaker 1: And basically the rule would be if no soup for you.

726
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:39,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

727
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,230
Speaker 1: If even no soup for you airline, it's like, oh, you fucked up.

728
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:43,848
Speaker 1: Guess what?

729
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:44,969
Speaker 1: You're just going to suffer.

730
00:37:45,591 --> 00:37:45,847
Speaker 1: Right.

731
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:49,409
Speaker 1: Oh, you tried to get on the plane when you weren't supposed to.

732
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,310
Speaker 1: Next flight.

733
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,409
Speaker 1: You can't even get on this flight.

734
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:52,548
Speaker 1: Tough shit.

735
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,530
Speaker 1: Oh, no refund either.

736
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:55,349
Speaker 1: Oh, you need to reschedule.

737
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,110
Speaker 1: Well, you're not getting your refund for that ticket.

738
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:57,706
Speaker 1: Got to buy another one.

739
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,448
Speaker 1: Tough shit.

740
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,990
Speaker 1: You should have planned your fucking schedule in advance.

741
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,650
Speaker 0: You know, there is a jerk airlines.

742
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,808
Speaker 0: It's called spirit air.

743
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:05,890
Speaker 1: But that's just a jerk to everyone.

744
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,109
Speaker 1: Even the people who know what they're doing.

745
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:07,690
Speaker 0: Yeah.

746
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,070
Speaker 1: That's the discount.

747
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:10,757
Speaker 1: Like Dr.

748
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:11,469
Speaker 1: Nick airline.

749
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:12,990
Speaker 0: Hi everybody.

750
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:13,548
Speaker 1: Yeah.

751
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:23,230
Speaker 1: No, this should be like, if you are good and actually do what you're supposed to do and obey all the rules and are fast and get on the plane right away, it should do, it should actually reward you, right?

752
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,830
Speaker 1: You need the stick and the carrot.

753
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,030
Speaker 0: I'd make it like a Japanese game show.

754
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:35,709
Speaker 0: If you get from walking out of the plane into your seat with your luggage, put in the overhead bin and your seatbelt buckled within 45 seconds, your flight's free.

755
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:40,190
Speaker 1: The whole flight would be free because only us people would be on there.

756
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,489
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it would.

757
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:45,450
Speaker 0: No, the thing is you subsidize this by letting a third of the people on the plane.

758
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:46,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

759
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,289
Speaker 0: Who think they can do this, but can't like what I?

760
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:54,130
Speaker 1: Oh, if you can't lift up your carry on over your head, we take it away from you and we put it on the next flight.

761
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,810
Speaker 1: So you'll actually, not only will you not have it with you on the plane, you won't have it with you until like the day after you get where you're going.

762
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:07,249
Speaker 0: Unless you pre-certify with us that you are handicapped or elderly and you physically can't do it so that we can have someone help you.

763
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:07,810
Speaker 1: Right.

764
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,890
Speaker 1: But that's, you know, that's obvious.

765
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, it should be.

766
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:15,250
Speaker 1: You'll still get on the plane as fast as you can, given your condition.

767
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,803
Speaker 1: I see.

768
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:21,330
Speaker 1: Listen, and the other thing is, right, it's not people, right, that with handicaps and whatever that are the problem, right?

769
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,110
Speaker 1: Those people just pre-boarding and they get on pretty damn fast.

770
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,490
Speaker 1: Even the old people, they go, they're pre-boarding.

771
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,028
Speaker 1: By the time I get on a plane, the old people are already seated with the shit above their heads.

772
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,050
Speaker 1: It's these other people, right?

773
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,030
Speaker 1: Who just have carry-ons that are way, that are too big.

774
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,289
Speaker 1: I don't know why they let them bring it on.

775
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,389
Speaker 0: I saw a couple of airlines.

776
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,729
Speaker 1: Or too heavy, they can't pick it up.

777
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:45,349
Speaker 0: Three weeks ago, a couple airlines suddenly instituted a zero-tolerance policy on oversized bags.

778
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:50,310
Speaker 0: And it caused disaster and complaints and they're basically like, yeah, well, fuck you.

779
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:50,862
Speaker 1: Yeah.

780
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,629
Speaker 1: Whatever airline that is, I like it.

781
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:52,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

782
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:55,170
Speaker 0: I saw news stories about it while I was in the airport.

783
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:55,968
Speaker 1: A-plus.

784
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:56,903
Speaker 1: A-plus.

785
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,110
Speaker 0: But like, these people bring these giant bags carry-on.

786
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:01,234
Speaker 0: Why?

787
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:04,750
Speaker 0: It's not like you can even get into that thing.

788
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,370
Speaker 0: It's so big.

789
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,209
Speaker 1: What are you going to do with it?

790
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,128
Speaker 1: There's a human body in there.

791
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

792
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:08,769
Speaker 1: That's the only explanation.

793
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,190
Speaker 0: I blame the TSA for most of this, though.

794
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:16,470
Speaker 1: And TSA, I mean, the TSA basically slows down even the fast people, right?

795
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,270
Speaker 1: Which is the problem.

796
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,970
Speaker 1: If the TSA was gone, everyone would be sped up, you know, across the board.

797
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:26,190
Speaker 1: But even without the TSA, there's still a lot of slow garbage, mostly from people.

798
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,149
Speaker 0: It's mostly just people.

799
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,750
Speaker 0: It's like they move so slow in their lives.

800
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 0: Like, if you all moved a little faster.

801
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:42,970
Speaker 0: I did an experiment a couple months ago and what I did is on my way to and from work for several days, I started to stop watching my phone and I tried two ways.

802
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,850
Speaker 0: One, I tried walking at the pace that whoever's in front of me is walking.

803
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:50,329
Speaker 0: Not like trying to fight my way past people.

804
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:56,945
Speaker 0: And then I recorded it on weekends, like on similar routes, when there was no one in my way.

805
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:06,470
Speaker 0: If I didn't have to deal with slow people just being slow in front of me, I would save multiple hours per month.

806
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,050
Speaker 1: Yeah.

807
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,050
Speaker 1: I mean, people are like, why are you in such a hurry?

808
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,810
Speaker 1: Stop and smell the roses, whatever.

809
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,490
Speaker 0: But it's like, I don't want to smell the hobos in the subway.

810
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,490
Speaker 0: Get the fuck out of my way.

811
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:22,390
Speaker 1: It's like, do you realize like people don't realize that by going slow, just how much time you're losing to do other things.

812
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,410
Speaker 0: Stop to smell the roses.

813
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:24,129
Speaker 0: I'm in the subway.

814
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,590
Speaker 0: I'm on my way to the roses.

815
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:35,469
Speaker 1: Are you the same person who's complaining like, oh, I don't have time to do these extra activities and oh, there's just, you know, I can't, I can't add this extra thing to my schedule.

816
00:41:35,671 --> 00:41:38,650
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, cause you're fucking slow as balls, right?

817
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,269
Speaker 1: It's like, why do you think I can do all the shit that I do?

818
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:46,546
Speaker 1: Podcasting, you know, it's just running, sleeping properly, cooking dinner, right?

819
00:41:47,610 --> 00:42:04,609
Speaker 1: A lot of that actually, not all of it, you know, most of it's just good time management and scheduling, but a lot of it comes from just like walking fast and doing things that don't and I don't need to stop and smell as quickly as I possibly can and actually trying to hurry.

820
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,490
Speaker 1: Not like running out of breath fast.

821
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,328
Speaker 0: Well, what's the phrase?

822
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,209
Speaker 0: Let us hurry so that we do not have to rush.

823
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,069
Speaker 1: That's right.

824
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,048
Speaker 1: Exactly.

825
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:14,927
Speaker 0: So I got places to be.

826
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:23,750
Speaker 1: Get shit, get somewhere on time and then take my time at the time at the doing the thing I actually care about doing and then hurry up and get to the fucking next thing.

827
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:25,869
Speaker 1: Don't waste my time on a plane.

828
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,850
Speaker 1: I don't want to be on the plane.

829
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,708
Speaker 1: I want to be on the beach.

830
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:34,049
Speaker 1: Let's get the plane into the air as quickly as possible because then I'll be on the beach 20 minutes sooner, 20 minutes more beach.

831
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:39,229
Speaker 0: I also run into kind of a technological disconnect problem that Scott has the same problem, I assume.

832
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:46,330
Speaker 0: So we have fancy insertion airbuds that block outside sound and are really high quality.

833
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:54,489
Speaker 0: If I plug that shit into the entertainment system on a plane, one, the lowest volume setting is loud enough to injure me.

834
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,149
Speaker 1: That's true.

835
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:59,790
Speaker 0: And two, the announcements from the pilot are loud enough to deafen me.

836
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:01,930
Speaker 1: It depends on the plane.

837
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,870
Speaker 1: Some planes, I can't even plug it in without a weird adapter to the pitchfork.

838
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,590
Speaker 0: Or even if you do, like the audio quality is so shitty.

839
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:09,110
Speaker 0: Like there's this whine in the background.

840
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:12,909
Speaker 1: You know, when I used to fly JetBlue back in the college days, it was like TV.

841
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,048
Speaker 1: Fuck yeah.

842
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,410
Speaker 1: And I'd be watching like ESPN on the plane and whatever.

843
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:28,889
Speaker 1: Then, like ever since the iPod era, like when I actually had an iPod and had stuff, podcasts to listen to, and especially when I had laptops and things to watch video on.

844
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:30,005
Speaker 0: Or just play Civ V.

845
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,870
Speaker 1: Or DS's and such like that.

846
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,370
Speaker 1: It's just like I go on JetBlue and I just turn the TV off.

847
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:38,255
Speaker 1: I don't really use.

848
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:42,665
Speaker 1: the only thing I use on the in-flight entertainment system is watching where the plane is.

849
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,469
Speaker 0: Occasionally, if I'm on a long flight, I'll watch a movie or two.

850
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,530
Speaker 1: Even going to Australia, the longest flight ever.

851
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:54,630
Speaker 1: I did not watch even one movie or television show on the entertainment.

852
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,809
Speaker 0: I watched the movies during mealtimes usually because I can't have my laptop out at that time easily.

853
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:02,250
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't know what I did during the meal time.

854
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,528
Speaker 1: I think I just concentrated on the meal.

855
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,098
Speaker 0: Nah.

856
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:04,767
Speaker 1: I don't know.

857
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:06,469
Speaker 0: Con, you really wanted to enjoy that meal.

858
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,446
Speaker 1: I guess.

859
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:09,070
Speaker 1: It actually was much better.

860
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:09,670
Speaker 1: You know what?

861
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,050
Speaker 1: It wasn't like people, you know, airline food is sort of a joke.

862
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,410
Speaker 1: Like cafeteria food is a joke.

863
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,430
Speaker 0: But really, it's just United States airline food.

864
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,006
Speaker 1: Yeah.

865
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,370
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like, well, first of all, JetBlue is great.

866
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,110
Speaker 1: They don't give you food.

867
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,590
Speaker 1: They just give you fucking snacks, right?

868
00:44:22,872 --> 00:44:24,450
Speaker 1: It's like, we're not going to insult you with shitty food.

869
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,330
Speaker 1: We'll just give you no food.

870
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:29,770
Speaker 0: I can eat at like the cheeseburger cheeseburger at the terminal before I fly.

871
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:35,210
Speaker 1: But you know, on the flight to Australia, which, you know, the food was not bad.

872
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,430
Speaker 1: It was perfectly edible.

873
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:47,930
Speaker 0: I fly all around the world and all in all my experience, the worst food on our airlines outside of the United States is better than the best food on most US domestic flights.

874
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,790
Speaker 1: I'm sure if you're on the first Amazo class.

875
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,409
Speaker 0: No, I'm the fucking coach.

876
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:54,690
Speaker 1: I'm saying if you're in the first class in the US, the food might be edible.

877
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:03,490
Speaker 0: So about that business class food in the US is categorically worse than economy class food, unlike Turkish Air or Eddie Hod.

878
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:05,489
Speaker 1: Well, Eddie Hod is a fancy airline.

879
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,610
Speaker 0: Turkish Air is the best airline I've ever flown.

880
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,910
Speaker 1: Have you flown Emirates?

881
00:45:09,897 --> 00:45:10,649
Speaker 0: I haven't flown Emirates yet.

882
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,508
Speaker 1: How about Lufthansa?

883
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:12,529
Speaker 0: I've flown them.

884
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:12,858
Speaker 1: OK.

885
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:14,630
Speaker 0: I've flown a lot of airlines.

886
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,750
Speaker 1: And how about you haven't flown in the Concorde because they don't fly it anymore.

887
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:19,226
Speaker 0: That's not an airline.

888
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:20,630
Speaker 0: That's an airplane.

889
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,310
Speaker 1: It was an airline.

890
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:24,390
Speaker 0: It's an airplane.

891
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:26,310
Speaker 1: Well, who owned the Concorde?

892
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,030
Speaker 0: Air France.

893
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:27,629
Speaker 0: It was a joke.

894
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,710
Speaker 1: I thought I thought it was just like its own airline.

895
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,070
Speaker 0: Really?

896
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:32,828
Speaker 1: That owned them all.

897
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:34,189
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.

898
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,069
Speaker 1: They were just white.

899
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,009
Speaker 1: They didn't have a logo printed on the side of them.

900
00:45:38,592 --> 00:45:39,949
Speaker 0: That's also not true.

901
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,349
Speaker 1: I've never seen one that wasn't 100 percent white.

902
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:49,030
Speaker 0: Here's a picture of one on Wikipedia that British Airways logo.

903
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,108
Speaker 1: Well, there you go.

904
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:51,210
Speaker 0: It's a plane.

905
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,289
Speaker 1: I've still never seen it because your head's in the way.

906
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:58,090
Speaker 1: But it was made by Air France.

907
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,290
Speaker 0: It was like a joint thing with them and British Airway.

908
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:01,709
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into it.

909
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,970
Speaker 1: I'm sure the food on it was amazing is the point.

910
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:05,570
Speaker 0: Why would it be?

911
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,450
Speaker 0: It's such a short flight.

912
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,790
Speaker 1: You're paying a thousand fucking dollars.

913
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,490
Speaker 0: You're paying for the short flight.

914
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,510
Speaker 1: I want to be able to eat during that one hour.

915
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,950
Speaker 0: I would not mind if the Concorde came back.

916
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:16,752
Speaker 1: It's not.

917
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:20,650
Speaker 1: I mean, it's significantly shorter, but not it's still not like two seconds.

918
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,390
Speaker 0: It's shorter enough to matter.

919
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:25,508
Speaker 1: If I wish it still existed, I would pay for it.

920
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,310
Speaker 1: I would say I would have gladly paid to take it to Australia for like six thousand dollars.

921
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,309
Speaker 0: Dude, I was just in London.

922
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,669
Speaker 0: I don't think you can make it to Australia.

923
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,327
Speaker 1: You don't think so?

924
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,330
Speaker 0: No, I would.

925
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,470
Speaker 0: I would have taken it to London because that would have been great.

926
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:38,309
Speaker 0: Oh, that would have been the best.

927
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:39,867
Speaker 0: Here we go, Scott.

928
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:46,450
Speaker 0: Fab JFK to London Heathrow under three hours from takeoff to touchdown.

929
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:47,282
Speaker 1: How much money?

930
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:50,110
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but whatever.

931
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:52,029
Speaker 1: I'd pay a thousand dollars.

932
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:53,469
Speaker 0: I would pay a thousand dollars for that.

933
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:54,530
Speaker 1: Easily three hours.

934
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,070
Speaker 0: Scott, that's shorter than our ride to Boston.

935
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:57,910
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

936
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,278
Speaker 1: Yeah.

937
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:00,249
Speaker 1: How awesome is that?

938
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,589
Speaker 1: Plus three hours.

939
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:02,689
Speaker 1: I'd like some food.

940
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:03,423
Speaker 1: Give me a snack.

941
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like JetBlue.

942
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,288
Speaker 0: Get some peanuts.

943
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:07,710
Speaker 1: Peanuts.

944
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,510
Speaker 1: They don't go to a lot of airlines.

945
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,590
Speaker 1: Don't do peanuts because people with allergies might get killed.

946
00:47:12,192 --> 00:47:13,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really sad about that.

947
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,007
Speaker 0: I really like peanuts.

948
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,929
Speaker 1: I like peanuts too.

949
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,288
Speaker 0: I get air.

950
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,030
Speaker 0: I get peanuts.

951
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,210
Speaker 0: A lot of non-United States.

952
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:19,449
Speaker 1: Bring them on the plane?

953
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:23,110
Speaker 1: So the TSA is not going to take my peanuts.

954
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:23,930
Speaker 0: They might.

955
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,829
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised.

956
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,130
Speaker 1: And I happen to sit next to a stranger who's allergic to peanuts and then they start dying.

957
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,190
Speaker 1: I got to jab him with an EpiPen and apologize.

958
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, most peanut allergies are not like that.

959
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,569
Speaker 0: Maybe while they're asleep, you just like grind them up and jam them in their mouth.

960
00:47:35,972 --> 00:47:36,768
Speaker 0: But that's murder.

961
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,229
Speaker 1: Only if I know.

962
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:41,910
Speaker 1: What if I didn't know?

963
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,990
Speaker 1: And I was like, hey, you want a peanut?

964
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,228
Speaker 0: Oh my God, I didn't know.

965
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,290
Speaker 0: I think that's the paper skull, whatever, doctor.

966
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:52,490
Speaker 0: If I punch you and you're just super weak and it crushes your skull, I'm still guilty of manslaughter.

967
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:52,807
Speaker 1: Right.

968
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,710
Speaker 1: But if I offer you a peanut, like, hey, you want a peanut?

969
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,750
Speaker 0: There's an issue in offering it to you and grinding it up and shoving it into your mouth while you're asleep.

970
00:47:58,912 --> 00:47:59,110
Speaker 1: Sure.

971
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

972
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,850
Speaker 1: I don't think it's good to grind up anything and put it in someone's mouth while they're asleep.

973
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:10,289
Speaker 0: But I just, I can't express to you how awful most airlines inside of the United States are the more I fly overseas.

974
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:11,188
Speaker 1: Yeah.

975
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:14,430
Speaker 0: Also how awful the TSA is the more I fly overseas.

976
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,228
Speaker 0: Everything about the experience of flying within the United States is awful.

977
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:20,336
Speaker 1: compared to the US is bad.

978
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,550
Speaker 1: Flying is amazing.

979
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,509
Speaker 1: The miracle of flight.

980
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,690
Speaker 1: It's like other people, they get on planes and it's like, I see people who prefer the aisle seat.

981
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:32,070
Speaker 1: I guess they want to get up and go to the bathroom without having to make one else get your flights under 10 hours.

982
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,268
Speaker 0: Why the fuck are you getting up?

983
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,788
Speaker 0: Sit there too.

984
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:37,390
Speaker 1: It's like people don't want the middle seat.

985
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:38,610
Speaker 1: Obviously never want a middle seat.

986
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:39,027
Speaker 1: The worst.

987
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,370
Speaker 1: But people have the window seat.

988
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,569
Speaker 1: It's like they don't look out the window.

989
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,689
Speaker 1: It's like I've flown a bunch of times.

990
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,490
Speaker 1: Every single time I still look out the window and go, Holy fuck.

991
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,370
Speaker 1: Miracle of flight.

992
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:50,009
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

993
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:50,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

994
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,770
Speaker 0: I'll look out three times the entire takeoff because that's awesome.

995
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,950
Speaker 0: The entire landing because hey, I look out the window.

996
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,028
Speaker 1: If I'm in the window seat, which I usually am, I'm looking out the window like 80% of the time.

997
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:10,129
Speaker 0: Well sometimes when it's sunny and you're above the clouds, you can't look out the right or it's pitch black and you can't even see anything because you're above farms and mountains.

998
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:21,330
Speaker 0: When I was flying to Tokyo, I remember at one point we were flying over northern areas and you could see like the hints of Aurora off on the horizon.

999
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,170
Speaker 1: Could you see like Mount Fuji?

1000
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:23,987
Speaker 0: No.

1001
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:26,910
Speaker 0: Not that that was over the Arctic at that point.

1002
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,070
Speaker 1: Oh, you were flying over the top?

1003
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:29,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1004
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:34,430
Speaker 0: That's how you get direct from JFK to Tokyo.

1005
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,450
Speaker 1: Over the top, not around.

1006
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, over the top.

1007
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:43,649
Speaker 1: But yeah, no, it's like, uh, you know, people, they just, you know, they fly without, you know, it's like without appreciating.

1008
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:45,330
Speaker 1: You are fucking flying.

1009
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,109
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

1010
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:51,990
Speaker 1: And it's like, dude, seriously, if you don't look out the window and say, holy shit, you shouldn't be allowed to fly.

1011
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:55,650
Speaker 1: You're like, oh, if you're not going to appreciate flying, you don't get to fly.

1012
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:56,044
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1013
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:57,210
Speaker 0: The actual act of flying.

1014
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,470
Speaker 0: If the TSA went away, I would fly almost everywhere I go.

1015
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:02,109
Speaker 1: I would fly to work if I could.

1016
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:02,566
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1017
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:06,890
Speaker 1: People like a hundred years ago basically couldn't fly.

1018
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:11,830
Speaker 1: Even today, only very few people, relatively speaking, are privileged to fly.

1019
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,248
Speaker 1: Caesar could not fly.

1020
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:17,210
Speaker 1: Queens and Kings of ancient times could not fly.

1021
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,650
Speaker 1: Even Abraham Lincoln could not fly.

1022
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,530
Speaker 0: I like how that's your even Abraham Lincoln.

1023
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,070
Speaker 1: That's right.

1024
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,770
Speaker 1: Someone that recent could not fly.

1025
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:25,969
Speaker 1: I don't think Teddy Roosevelt flew.

1026
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,379
Speaker 1: Did he?

1027
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:27,549
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1028
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:36,810
Speaker 1: I don't, you know, people who are really important and really recent did not have the privilege to experience the miracle flying that I am privileged to have.

1029
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,410
Speaker 1: Better fucking appreciate that.

1030
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:38,668
Speaker 1: Okay.

1031
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,238
Speaker 0: So I just type did Teddy Roosevelt?

1032
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:49,290
Speaker 0: and the suggestions are invent the teddy bear, marry his cousin, see Bigfoot, have polio, get shot.

1033
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:50,586
Speaker 1: Wrong Roosevelt on the polio.

1034
00:50:53,673 --> 00:50:55,328
Speaker 0: But at least someone thought to look it up.

1035
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:55,929
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1036
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,590
Speaker 1: And I guess that person was educated.

1037
00:50:57,751 --> 00:50:58,187
Speaker 1: So good for them.

1038
00:50:58,712 --> 00:51:00,650
Speaker 1: Much better than the person who keeps getting it wrong.

1039
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:03,790
Speaker 0: Oh, when did Theodore Roosevelt fly in an airplane?

1040
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:09,923
Speaker 0: On October 11th, 1910, everyone Roosevelt Scott was the first president to fly in a plane.

1041
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:11,249
Speaker 1: Hallelujah.

1042
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,929
Speaker 1: Deservedly.

1043
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,228
Speaker 0: So he was the first, I bet he fucking appreciated it.

1044
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,810
Speaker 1: He was probably like, holy shit, this is fucking amazing.

1045
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,030
Speaker 0: Bully, bully, bully the entire way.

1046
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:21,526
Speaker 0: Just bully.

1047
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:27,641
Speaker 1: I mean, in his day, you wanted to get to California to use a fucking boat through a canal that he dug with his own hands.

1048
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,490
Speaker 0: or road trip.

1049
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:31,309
Speaker 1: They didn't really have cars.

1050
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,368
Speaker 0: They had road trips.

1051
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:32,965
Speaker 1: Sure.

1052
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,549
Speaker 0: He's got an all-around trail.

1053
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:35,829
Speaker 0: Or there were road trips.

1054
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:36,769
Speaker 1: You could use a train.

1055
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,610
Speaker 0: There were road trips back in the day.

1056
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,190
Speaker 1: There were trains.

1057
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,207
Speaker 1: Trains were the way to go.

1058
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:40,904
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1059
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:41,544
Speaker 0: Yep.

1060
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,650
Speaker 0: So I've never flown first class.

1061
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:47,570
Speaker 1: I have also not flown in the first class.

1062
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,410
Speaker 0: But I've seen inside a first class.

1063
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,710
Speaker 1: I've seen inside all the first class.

1064
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've basically got a tiny walled apartment with a lay down bed.

1065
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:00,009
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the thing is, even the first classes that are that fancy, the ones on Emirates are even fancier.

1066
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,150
Speaker 1: So it's like the first class on one airplane is like coach on some other.

1067
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,829
Speaker 0: I've flown business class several times.

1068
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:05,949
Speaker 0: It's plenty.

1069
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:06,847
Speaker 1: It is.

1070
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:08,210
Speaker 0: It is so great.

1071
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:12,529
Speaker 0: I thought like, oh, I should maybe I should upgrade to business class on this flight to Australia.

1072
00:52:13,352 --> 00:52:15,550
Speaker 0: And I expected it to be more expensive.

1073
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:19,150
Speaker 0: It was so much more expensive.

1074
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,270
Speaker 0: It even was like a ludicrous price.

1075
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:22,088
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1076
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,388
Speaker 1: If it was if it was a little bit more money, I would have done it, too.

1077
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:25,310
Speaker 1: But it's not.

1078
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:27,350
Speaker 0: I would have paid an extra thousand dollars.

1079
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,930
Speaker 1: Prohibitively expensive.

1080
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:30,970
Speaker 0: But there is a secret.

1081
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:37,570
Speaker 0: If you fly overseas that I've found is that a lot of overseas airlines have something that they call premium economy or something like that.

1082
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:39,449
Speaker 1: It's a plane is big enough.

1083
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:43,989
Speaker 0: It's better than what business class is inside of the U.S.

1084
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:46,799
Speaker 0: And most airlines like in Turkish air premium.

1085
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:57,029
Speaker 0: a little more legroom, a lot more like better seat, a huge seat that reclines all the fuck way back and multi-course dining like they bring you.

1086
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,010
Speaker 0: Here's the menu.

1087
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,129
Speaker 0: Here's appetizer number one.

1088
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,149
Speaker 0: Which of our four dessert selections would you like?

1089
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:04,949
Speaker 0: Here's a bottle of wine.

1090
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:06,929
Speaker 1: Here's your crack pipe prewarmed.

1091
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,937
Speaker 0: I do also enjoy how outside of the

1092
00:53:10,017 --> 00:53:10,359
Speaker 0: U.S.,

1093
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:13,829
Speaker 0: pretty much every airline just gives you as much alcohol as you want.

1094
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:16,090
Speaker 0: Like they don't charge you.

1095
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:16,647
Speaker 0: It's just free.

1096
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:18,413
Speaker 0: Inside of the

1097
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:18,574
Speaker 0: U.S.,

1098
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:21,570
Speaker 0: they're like, would you like an awful rum and Coke for nine dollars?

1099
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:23,549
Speaker 1: For me, this is not an issue.

1100
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:27,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but also juices, free juice, as much juice as I want.

1101
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,190
Speaker 0: Just give me all the orange juice.

1102
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,430
Speaker 1: Give me all the orange juice until I can't drink it anymore.

1103
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,646
Speaker 1: Until I'm so sugared up, I can't.

1104
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,070
Speaker 0: Orange juice is so important on flights.

1105
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,908
Speaker 1: Until I turn orange.

1106
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:38,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1107
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,710
Speaker 0: So yeah, I've noticed also that we're really, really fucking spoiled by living in New York.

1108
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can just go to the airport immediately and we don't have to drive to it, park at it.

1109
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, or even I know a lot of people who...

1110
00:53:52,132 --> 00:54:03,270
Speaker 1: Like in terms of flying, right, it's like if you're taking a trip somewhere and you have to factor in like getting to the airport as part of the time, I see why a lot of suburb people like flying won't actually save them anything.

1111
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,410
Speaker 1: Like let's say you live outside of the city of Boston, you know, fly to New York.

1112
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:08,710
Speaker 1: It's a three hour drive.

1113
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:13,090
Speaker 1: You drive 45 minutes to get to the airport and park and you got to pay for that.

1114
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,690
Speaker 1: Then you spend like half hour to 45 minutes getting through the airport and then you fly.

1115
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,946
Speaker 1: It's like if you would have just drove to New York, you would have made it in the same time.

1116
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,489
Speaker 1: I live in New York.

1117
00:54:23,151 --> 00:54:24,570
Speaker 1: I get on the air, the subway.

1118
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,030
Speaker 1: It takes me to the airport.

1119
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,049
Speaker 1: I get on the plane.

1120
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:27,903
Speaker 1: Boom.

1121
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:28,769
Speaker 1: I'm there.

1122
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,010
Speaker 0: Even look like when we lived in Beacon.

1123
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:30,650
Speaker 0: All right.

1124
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:36,588
Speaker 0: Hour train into the city, hour and change like hour and a half hour from there to the airport.

1125
00:54:36,918 --> 00:54:37,129
Speaker 1: Yep.

1126
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:38,008
Speaker 0: Then fly.

1127
00:54:38,618 --> 00:54:38,808
Speaker 1: Yep.

1128
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:45,550
Speaker 0: Or maybe go to the local airport, fly to the real airport and then fly.

1129
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:47,614
Speaker 1: If you... There are a lot of like.

1130
00:54:47,936 --> 00:54:51,428
Speaker 1: you got to look at these airports that aren't the major airports, which a lot of people don't look at.

1131
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,825
Speaker 1: There's a lot of secret flights there that people don't know.

1132
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:56,290
Speaker 1: that can save you a fuck ton of time.

1133
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,450
Speaker 1: For example, one I know of that my mom uses is White Plains has an airport.

1134
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:00,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1135
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:03,249
Speaker 1: You wouldn't know that White Plains has an airport, but it does.

1136
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,190
Speaker 0: Dude, I used that.

1137
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,530
Speaker 0: I used Stuart Airport by Beacon multiple times.

1138
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,730
Speaker 1: That's bigger than White Plains Airport.

1139
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Stuart Airport.

1140
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,334
Speaker 0: Well, that was.

1141
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:11,830
Speaker 0: I think it was a landing place for the shuttle.

1142
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,470
Speaker 1: Well, White Plains Airport is really tiny, but you know what?

1143
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:20,690
Speaker 1: You can fly direct from White Plains to West Palm Beach on JetBlue.

1144
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:28,309
Speaker 1: Just like, oh, so if you live in like Connecticut, don't drive into fricking, you know, or up, you know, slightly upstate New York.

1145
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:30,250
Speaker 1: You can get there really quick.

1146
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:34,870
Speaker 1: Like 30 minute drive is a huge radius of, you know, people living.

1147
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:39,328
Speaker 0: But even among the big airports, like you think Boston you mentioned or D.C.

1148
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,530
Speaker 0: or New York, New York is such a cut above.

1149
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:45,130
Speaker 0: If I want to fly almost like when I... Not LaGuardia.

1150
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,350
Speaker 0: Not Newark.

1151
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:56,810
Speaker 0: When I fly to Turkey, when I fly to Brazil, when I fly to India, when I fly to London, all these places, there's multiple direct flights from JFK every day.

1152
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,108
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of people, if you live somewhere else besides like New York, Chicago,

1153
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:01,229
Speaker 1: L.A.,

1154
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:07,710
Speaker 1: like a major, major city, you know, you can't really get direct flights to all these places.

1155
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,910
Speaker 1: So flying is just not flying again.

1156
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,148
Speaker 1: The convenience goes down.

1157
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,629
Speaker 0: Like, so I was late to the studio tonight.

1158
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:24,070
Speaker 1: If you're in Seattle and you want to go to, you know, I guess, I don't know, Germany, you're taking like three flights minimum to get there.

1159
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,089
Speaker 0: But no, when I was here.

1160
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,268
Speaker 1: Seattle is somewhere else.

1161
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:27,850
Speaker 0: Direct flight to Frankfurt.

1162
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:28,570
Speaker 0: Whatevs.

1163
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:28,966
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1164
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,461
Speaker 0: No biggie.

1165
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:37,990
Speaker 0: So the reason I was late to the studio is that I was trying to book a flight because I actually have to be in Paris like the days before PAX East this year.

1166
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,610
Speaker 1: Well, if there was a Concord, you wouldn't have any problems.

1167
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:40,910
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1168
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,749
Speaker 1: You get there, you could go day of.

1169
00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:44,649
Speaker 0: So I was looking for flights.

1170
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:47,010
Speaker 0: So I'm going to fly out, do my thing, and I'm going to fly.

1171
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,510
Speaker 0: Basically, I wanted to fly from JFK to Paris.

1172
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,569
Speaker 0: Trivial, tons of flights.

1173
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:55,730
Speaker 0: Want to fly from Paris to Boston so I can just go straight to PAX like Thursday.

1174
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,189
Speaker 0: Like, there's no reason to go.

1175
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:02,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is cheaper and faster to fly to JFK and then take the fucking Acela to Boston.

1176
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,690
Speaker 0: Boston does not have a lot of direct flights.

1177
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,750
Speaker 1: There's like one flight from Paris to Boston.

1178
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,770
Speaker 0: And the few that exist.

1179
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,190
Speaker 1: Because how many Parisians are like, let's go to Boston.

1180
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I remember when I was thinking back.

1181
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:16,910
Speaker 1: They wouldn't say it that way.

1182
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,483
Speaker 0: They would say, "huh-huh, let's go to

1183
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:18,967
Speaker 0: Boston.".

1184
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,950
Speaker 0: And I'm in New York, so we were trying to both meet in Turkey.

1185
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:27,870
Speaker 0: He had to take like this bullshit flight because there just weren't a lot of flights to Turkey and most of them had transfers.

1186
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,670
Speaker 0: And I can just fly everywhere direct because I'm in New York.

1187
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:37,748
Speaker 1: So flying is really convenient and awesome for important people who live in important places and go to important places and really not convenient for you plebs in the sticks.

1188
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:40,229
Speaker 1: So shove it.

1189
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,729
Speaker 1: We will experience the miracle of flight and appreciate it for you.

1190
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:52,230
Speaker 0: But then again in the sticks, I have to say when we lived in Beacon and we wanted to drive somewhere, we lived at the intersection of two of the biggest freeways in America.

1191
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:53,189
Speaker 1: They're pretty big.

1192
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:58,740
Speaker 0: If we wanted to drive, there was no drive to the freeway and then go that most people have.

1193
00:57:58,890 --> 00:57:59,768
Speaker 0: It was just like, let's go.

1194
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:06,527
Speaker 0: Driving was so fast and so convenient so that now when we live in New York City, I can fly anywhere in the world.

1195
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:22,090
Speaker 0: But if I go to like Hunter Mountain, which is not that far away and I want to drive closer than any place you're flying to and I want to drive home, I'll spend the last hour of that drive within like 20 miles of my apartment.

1196
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:26,350
Speaker 1: I mean, New York City is also much closer to all these major highways and whatnot, right?

1197
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,206
Speaker 1: It's just we don't know.

1198
00:58:27,811 --> 00:58:30,550
Speaker 0: It's closer in terms of distance, not in terms of time.

1199
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:30,817
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1200
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:37,029
Speaker 0: If we had a car, though, if this was not New York City, it would take 10 minutes to drive to JFK.

1201
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1202
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,270
Speaker 0: It's only because it's New York that it takes a goddamn hour.

1203
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,329
Speaker 1: I can bike to JFK.

1204
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:42,927
Speaker 1: I have.

1205
00:58:43,178 --> 00:58:43,390
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1206
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,229
Speaker 0: It's faster to bike than to drive on certain days anyway.

1207
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,470
Speaker 0: Flying is pretty awesome.

1208
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,070
Speaker 1: Let's just talk a little bit about the actual terminals themselves.

1209
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:58,310
Speaker 1: So a lot of airplane terminals, they're all really kind of different, but all sort of the same as well.

1210
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,010
Speaker 1: It's it's kind of a strange two tiers.

1211
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,869
Speaker 0: There's the modern one with good food and the old school one.

1212
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:03,410
Speaker 1: Right.

1213
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,910
Speaker 1: But even the food is you ever know.

1214
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:09,190
Speaker 1: I always get confused by the ones that have like the sit down restaurants.

1215
00:59:09,572 --> 00:59:14,550
Speaker 1: And it's like, OK, you got like even the new fancy JetBlue terminal, awesome terminal, Super modern.

1216
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,270
Speaker 0: I can tell you exactly why those they have the fancy restaurant.

1217
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:27,990
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, maybe if I'm landing in JFK and I'm going to take a different flight to leave and there's a huge gap between the two flights, I might use the sit down restaurant.

1218
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:32,270
Speaker 1: Why else would I ever use that sit down restaurant?

1219
00:59:32,472 --> 00:59:33,690
Speaker 1: What other circumstance?

1220
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,769
Speaker 0: I get to the airport early because it's always an international flight for me.

1221
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:39,530
Speaker 0: So I get there, you know, two and a half hours early.

1222
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:40,529
Speaker 1: That's way too early.

1223
00:59:42,152 --> 00:59:48,149
Speaker 0: Uh, the reason for that is because I almost missed my flight home from Brazil once because sudden traffic jam.

1224
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:49,406
Speaker 0: What do you do?

1225
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,650
Speaker 1: I'm not driving to the airport.

1226
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:51,309
Speaker 1: I'm taking the subway.

1227
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:55,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are subways to most airports in the world, but I'm talking about right.

1228
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,210
Speaker 1: But OK, but there's this one here in New York, New York.

1229
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:03,910
Speaker 0: So in these other countries, I need to leave a lot of time because a lot of things can fuck me on my way to the airport.

1230
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,210
Speaker 1: And if something doesn't fuck you, you sit down at that restaurant and eat dinner.

1231
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm a business traveler.

1232
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,189
Speaker 0: Company dime.

1233
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:11,450
Speaker 1: Company dime.

1234
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:16,710
Speaker 0: Also, it's pleasant to not be sitting in the normal lounge to be sitting somewhere.

1235
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,870
Speaker 1: So what if you're sitting there and you're eating dinner and it's like, oh, shit, the food still hasn't come out.

1236
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:25,830
Speaker 0: Oh, those restaurants are designed around people who are in a hurry.

1237
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:28,150
Speaker 0: They bring you the check fucking immediately.

1238
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,089
Speaker 0: Soon as they see that you're done, they bring you the check.

1239
01:00:30,332 --> 01:00:32,469
Speaker 0: You telling your flight, they'll remind you how you should go.

1240
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:36,644
Speaker 0: If you order something that won't be ready quickly and your flight's coming soon, they warn you.

1241
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:39,730
Speaker 1: Well, what about in the airline terminals?

1242
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:40,370
Speaker 1: Right.

1243
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:42,870
Speaker 1: All the fancy stores that I mean, I understand.

1244
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,890
Speaker 0: I don't get that at all.

1245
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:51,243
Speaker 1: I understand that if you shop at those places, I understand the store that's selling the snacks and the magazines, you know, the stuff that's like.

1246
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:54,710
Speaker 0: the only reason those jewelry stores are there is so guilty.

1247
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,490
Speaker 0: Cheating businessmen can buy gifts for their wife on the way home.

1248
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:09,930
Speaker 1: I understand even the store that sells clothes because, hey, maybe you, you know, didn't pack like, oh, shit, I need I ruined my shirt or something happened to a clothing and I really need one or, you know, something like that.

1249
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,310
Speaker 1: There might there's a case where I need to buy a clothing in an airport.

1250
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:13,849
Speaker 1: Right.

1251
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:18,510
Speaker 1: The jewelry, I guess you came up with the only possible reason for that.

1252
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:24,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the the stores that sell overpriced everything else, especially like the duty free.

1253
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,089
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, theoretically, you don't pay tax on this.

1254
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:28,110
Speaker 0: Now, what's the scam?

1255
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,828
Speaker 1: It's overpriced to begin with.

1256
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:32,550
Speaker 0: I've I've all I've checked the prices many times.

1257
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:37,170
Speaker 0: Everything you ever see in duty free, I can get cheaper on Amazon or at a local liquor.

1258
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,809
Speaker 1: Now, some of those things, items they sell in duty free, regardless of the price, we're assuming you're going to pay overpay for this.

1259
01:01:42,915 --> 01:01:43,108
Speaker 1: Right.

1260
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:43,988
Speaker 1: Makes sense.

1261
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:46,090
Speaker 1: Like, oh, I saw on a duty free.

1262
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,270
Speaker 1: They were selling fancy cameras.

1263
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:48,230
Speaker 1: It's like you're a tourist.

1264
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:50,789
Speaker 1: You might not have a fancy camera and you might decide up.

1265
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,086
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1266
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,330
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of people seem to get tricked and buy a lot of alcohol.

1267
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,869
Speaker 1: You know, luggage makes sense.

1268
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,607
Speaker 0: All right.

1269
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:03,346
Speaker 1: Alcohol, I guess, might make sense if you're an alcoholic, but it's like this on TVs in there and it's like, OK.

1270
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:08,069
Speaker 0: So part of that, Scott, is that we live in the US where it's not a big deal.

1271
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:18,489
Speaker 0: Most other countries, especially in Europe, have huge taxes on importing things and duties and things, and their prices are also messed up.

1272
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:21,850
Speaker 0: So I think it actually works out for a lot of those people.

1273
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:22,470
Speaker 1: Really?

1274
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:24,289
Speaker 1: Like they see a TV and they're like, I need that.

1275
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:24,870
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1276
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:26,530
Speaker 1: That's a really good price.

1277
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:30,369
Speaker 0: You can structure buying that TV to where you end up not paying taxes on it.

1278
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:32,530
Speaker 0: That might actually make up the difference.

1279
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:38,510
Speaker 1: You mean you'd save more money, though, just buying one at like Best Buy in the US and then find a way to get it.

1280
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:39,630
Speaker 1: Well, you just flew somewhere.

1281
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:40,328
Speaker 1: Where did you fly?

1282
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:46,730
Speaker 0: So, Scott, if you buy it in the duty, if you buy it in the US and try to export it through customs, it's harder than if you get it through the duty free.

1283
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:50,710
Speaker 1: But like the duty free also has that tax person at the end who doesn't actually do anything.

1284
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:55,169
Speaker 0: What's funny is I end up going to these places in the airports and international terminals to buy like a bottle of water.

1285
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,369
Speaker 0: And then they're like, can we scan your boarding pass?

1286
01:02:57,531 --> 01:02:59,008
Speaker 0: And then I don't pay taxes on that water.

1287
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:01,598
Speaker 0: So I have.

1288
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:02,969
Speaker 0: I have shopped at those places.

1289
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:06,830
Speaker 0: I've bought bottles of water and occasionally I've bought bags of Kit Kats.

1290
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, I buy candy, too.

1291
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:08,968
Speaker 0: Mostly Kit Kats.

1292
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:11,619
Speaker 1: In Israel, I bought the bazooka gum.

1293
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,110
Speaker 1: that says bazooka in Hebrew.

1294
01:03:15,923 --> 01:03:16,649
Speaker 1: The whole sack of it.

1295
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1296
01:03:18,672 --> 01:03:20,262
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like they got stuff in there.

1297
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:21,068
Speaker 1: that makes no sense.

1298
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:24,050
Speaker 1: I mean, hotels have jewelry stores in them, too.

1299
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:27,050
Speaker 1: I never understood that shops at the hotel jewelry store.

1300
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:31,430
Speaker 1: And how sad is the person who is the person who has to work in the hotel jewelry store?

1301
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,108
Speaker 1: That's their job.

1302
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:39,209
Speaker 0: If you're if you're working boring retail, I think the best possible case is boring retail where there's never a customer.

1303
01:03:39,513 --> 01:03:40,890
Speaker 1: So you spend all your time reading.

1304
01:03:41,201 --> 01:03:41,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1305
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,909
Speaker 0: You just sit there with your fucking smartphone the whole time and don't do anything.

1306
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:50,949
Speaker 0: That would be that would be a fine job compared to actually serving real customers in the same situation.

1307
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:51,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

1308
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:56,350
Speaker 0: Of course, your commute now involves going to the airport every day.

1309
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,250
Speaker 0: That alone might be worth killing yourself.

1310
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,088
Speaker 1: Hotel jewelry store.

1311
01:03:59,490 --> 01:03:59,805
Speaker 0: That would be.

1312
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:01,650
Speaker 0: But imagine working at the airport.

1313
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,130
Speaker 0: It's like the people who work at the rest stops on the freeway.

1314
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,637
Speaker 0: Like it's just.

1315
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,330
Speaker 0: it's so weird and fake.

1316
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,230
Speaker 1: There could be jobs you can get at the airport that are cool.

1317
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,207
Speaker 1: Orange stick guy.

1318
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:11,210
Speaker 1: Pilot.

1319
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:12,350
Speaker 1: Best job.

1320
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,749
Speaker 0: No, pilots, the worst job.

1321
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:14,609
Speaker 0: They get paid shit.

1322
01:04:15,072 --> 01:04:16,110
Speaker 1: I thought they had an awesome union.

1323
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,786
Speaker 1: They get paid a ton.

1324
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:18,590
Speaker 1: They get paid fighting all the time.

1325
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,039
Speaker 0: Wages for pilots who aren't doing like.

1326
01:04:22,721 --> 01:04:28,150
Speaker 0: basically the pilots who are making like six figures plus pilots are fucked.

1327
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:31,304
Speaker 0: In fact, the wages for most pilots in the U.S.

1328
01:04:31,344 --> 01:04:32,429
Speaker 0: is approaching minimum wage.

1329
01:04:32,756 --> 01:04:32,861
Speaker 0: What?

1330
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,210
Speaker 1: I thought their union made them have tons of money.

1332
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,090
Speaker 1: No, that's a shame.

1333
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,410
Speaker 0: Being a pilot really sucks.

1334
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,828
Speaker 1: Well, they get to experience the miracle of flight all the time.

1335
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,510
Speaker 0: Well, flying is pretty awesome.

1336
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,029
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why they make their planes disappear.

1337
01:04:48,423 --> 01:04:49,070
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

1338
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:49,710
Speaker 1: Didn't get paid enough.

1339
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,430
Speaker 0: I mean, what else?

1340
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:53,010
Speaker 0: I get really thirsty on planes.

1341
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:53,949
Speaker 0: I drink a lot of water.

1342
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:54,730
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1343
01:04:56,532 --> 01:04:58,210
Speaker 0: Everyone else gets up to pee a million times.

1344
01:04:58,396 --> 01:04:58,728
Speaker 0: I don't.

1345
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:00,770
Speaker 1: I'm not afraid of the plane.

1346
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,050
Speaker 1: Anything bad happening to the plane.

1347
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,688
Speaker 1: Everyone else is.

1348
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,070
Speaker 1: Nope.

1349
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:04,870
Speaker 0: Granted, it's interesting.

1350
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,001
Speaker 0: We live in a world where a 777 disappeared.

1351
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,250
Speaker 1: It's fascinating, but I'm not afraid of it.

1352
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,350
Speaker 0: Not afraid of it either, but it's interesting that that happened.

1353
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:13,978
Speaker 0: Flying.

1354
01:05:14,404 --> 01:05:14,740
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

1355
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,640
Speaker 0: Let's go down to Boston.

1356
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:24,880
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1357
