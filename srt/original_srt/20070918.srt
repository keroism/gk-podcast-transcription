1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,206
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday September 18th.

2
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:12,128
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,176
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:16,820
Speaker 0: team fortress.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:35,443
Speaker 1: Let's do this Alright, we gotta get this done quick so I can get back to playing team fortress - which I've been playing pretty much non-stop until Just now.

6
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,132
Speaker 0: I played two rounds this morning.

7
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:37,856
Speaker 0: I got home.

8
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:41,440
Speaker 0: I Tweaked it a bit, and I've been playing up until now.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,895
Speaker 0: And this is why we're recording the show at 9 something I haven't done in a long time.

10
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:45,237
Speaker 0: actually.

11
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:49,812
Speaker 0: we used to record the show At 930 so this isn't too bad or even later than that on many occasions.

12
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:54,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, so actually pretty good all right Yeah, but our team fortress - I got it.

13
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,612
Speaker 1: I got to play more.

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll be do.

15
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:57,800
Speaker 0: we'll be playing.

16
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:03,420
Speaker 0: Think this game from now until probably we die will be available for play.

17
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:08,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not gonna pull the tribes - the thing is I will get into this when we talk about it.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,855
Speaker 1: But I do want to say while this game is pretty fun already The experience is not even close to the first days.

19
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:18,068
Speaker 1: experience of tribes - No, like not even it's not a perfect.

20
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:20,316
Speaker 0: plus is the beta first of all as I could.

21
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,363
Speaker 0: of all you know the game is Great, but it's not perfect.

22
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:31,894
Speaker 1: so in the news a bunch of FPS nut balls freaked out because the team forgers 2 beta Didn't come out when they wanted it to come out.

23
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,120
Speaker 1: it came out some hours later.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,400
Speaker 0: All right, so let me let me give you the whole story.

25
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:40,260
Speaker 0: I went around collecting information from various sources, and this is the story that I collected.

26
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,432
Speaker 0: I am not going to like you know stand by.

27
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:45,256
Speaker 0: this story is a hundred percent true But this is what the evidence tells me.

28
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:50,075
Speaker 0: all right They said they would come out with the beta on Monday yesterday, and of course.

29
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,520
Speaker 0: They're in the Pacific time zone.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,589
Speaker 0: So we assume it means Monday Pacific time.

31
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,080
Speaker 0: so of course a lot of people are like they're gonna put it out it.

32
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,974
Speaker 0: you know midnight Pacific like immediately is the day as soon as the day starts.

33
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:01,339
Speaker 0: and that didn't happen.

34
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,590
Speaker 0: and As the day went on it the game didn't come out.

35
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,213
Speaker 0: it didn't come out.

36
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:06,855
Speaker 0: it didn't come out.

37
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,245
Speaker 0: right people are like Where is the game?

38
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,389
Speaker 0: They're not coming out with it.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,711
Speaker 0: Well.

40
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:11,997
Speaker 0: They said they come out with it today.

41
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:12,620
Speaker 0: They're not coming.

42
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:17,275
Speaker 1: They're a bunch of crapo dig stores like vel fucks all their customers.

43
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:18,680
Speaker 1: takes money doesn't give game.

44
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like dude.

45
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,770
Speaker 1: It's a beta.

46
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,016
Speaker 1: What do you want?

47
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:22,357
Speaker 0: Yeah?

48
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:22,880
Speaker 0: It's a beta.

49
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,444
Speaker 0: You're lucky.

50
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:26,040
Speaker 0: They're giving it to you, and they didn't promise a specific time.

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,240
Speaker 0: They just said today, so you're lucky you're getting it at all.

52
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:40,940
Speaker 0: So after some digging not digging with two G's with one G I have discovered that it is most likely situation that they're having a problem with the Linux dedicated server.

53
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,306
Speaker 0: The game itself.

54
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:43,069
Speaker 0: they've got going.

55
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:47,837
Speaker 0: the certain the Windows Server They got going but the Linux server They didn't get going.

56
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:57,931
Speaker 1: now This is something a lot of you who play PC games and use Windows might not realize because you think oh the games are all Only in Windows, and that's true, but the majority of FPS is out there.

57
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:01,179
Speaker 1: the majority of the servers are running Linux.

58
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,507
Speaker 1: well It's generally easier and better.

59
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:08,402
Speaker 0: well when you play game like World of Warcraft right all the servers are run by Blizzard.

60
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,466
Speaker 0: they run all the servers.

61
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:16,232
Speaker 0: You know I don't run a server in my house, but for a game like Counter-strike valve doesn't run any servers at all.

62
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,456
Speaker 0: they run zero servers.

63
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:18,600
Speaker 0: this saves them a lot of money.

64
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,016
Speaker 0: They got how much World of Warcraft pays granted all those servers?

65
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:25,816
Speaker 1: the first server I connected to playing team for just when I got home claimed to be the official valve.

66
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:26,740
Speaker 1: play test server.

67
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,304
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe they have a couple for the testing But I don't think they're not.

68
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:32,539
Speaker 1: they're gonna turn those off as soon as I probably but that I mean it clip for all.

69
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,110
Speaker 1: I know It was some punk kid who just said that.

70
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:41,772
Speaker 0: maybe you know you have no idea But all the servers of for counter-strike are Run by just people who like counter-strike.

71
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,720
Speaker 1: I mean we ran one a really crappy one.

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,579
Speaker 0: All right valve gives you the software to run a server for free.

73
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:55,659
Speaker 0: You can't play the game with that software even though it's pretty similar software But you can run all the servers you want as long as you have computers that have internet connections.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,492
Speaker 1: now You might think why do people just run these servers for free?

75
00:03:58,733 --> 00:03:59,556
Speaker 1: when do all this work?

76
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:04,100
Speaker 1: and the answer is Because they're in college, and it's a power trip to be the admin of a server.

77
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:09,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get to be the admin and also you can reserve slots so that way you can always play the game.

78
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:19,536
Speaker 0: Yeah You can have a private server where you and your friends can play without like random people on the internet coming in and fucking Around with you and also while you can run a server on the same machine as you're playing the game on.

79
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,243
Speaker 0: that's really bad For performance.

80
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:26,259
Speaker 0: you definitely want to have a separate computer that runs the server on its own and someone's got to run that.

81
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,408
Speaker 1: yeah Well, just the physics and the engines and everything.

82
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:31,460
Speaker 1: servers for games actually take quite a bit of processing power.

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's mostly CPU and network that you're worried about when really yeah, you're not gonna need the video card with that a term.

84
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:37,752
Speaker 0: No, no, you're not.

85
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:51,480
Speaker 0: so The Linux server the most popular OS for running game servers especially valve game servers because while they don't release their games for Linux They put the servers for Linux because people run in servers like to run Linux.

86
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:56,320
Speaker 0: And I remember back in the half-life days if a server was a Linux server They actually had like a little tux icons.

87
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,146
Speaker 0: You would know that that was a better server And they usually were better.

88
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:02,844
Speaker 1: servers say tribes to it had the little icons and Every.

89
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,235
Speaker 1: all the Linux servers were usually better and faster.

90
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:09,312
Speaker 0: Yep, so They're having trouble coming out with the Linux server.

91
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:15,035
Speaker 0: you can and download it right now But it only downloads the content which is sort of like the stuff that you can download.

92
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:21,340
Speaker 0: while you're waiting for the real server To come out it doesn't actually download like the executable things you need for the server.

93
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,659
Speaker 0: So you can't run a Team Fortress 2 server on Linux right now.

94
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,757
Speaker 0: Because basically what valve did is they tried all day Monday to get this to work.

95
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:29,540
Speaker 0: they couldn't.

96
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:40,996
Speaker 0: So at the last minute at like 11 30 p.m.. Pacific time They put the game out like they promised so that they wouldn't go back on their word And they're just holding out on the Linux server until they get it to work.

97
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:45,129
Speaker 1: the net result They're like 12 Team Fortress servers in the world.

98
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,039
Speaker 0: there are barely any Team Fortress servers because they're only Windows servers and all.

99
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:57,160
Speaker 0: as far As I can see all the low ping servers that I can get to are full Constantly and the only servers I can get on are very high ping servers which kind of sucks.

100
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:05,420
Speaker 0: So I either need to like brute force my way into one of the low ping servers or wait for the stupid Linux client to Come out, and then we can turn our servers on and we'll be in business.

101
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:13,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean the only real news here Is that a lot of people are really you know down on valve and blaming valve saying oh, how dare you betray?

102
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:21,749
Speaker 0: Well, it's like what they do is they create this own expectation in their minds of what they want and then they they act as if valve Promised them what they expect.

103
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:28,995
Speaker 1: I mean if valve had said the game will come out in September and the game wasn't out by mid 1201 on September 1st.

104
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,320
Speaker 1: They'd freak out just as much.

105
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:31,204
Speaker 0: That's true.

106
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,053
Speaker 0: That is true all right.

107
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:40,700
Speaker 1: so in much more Happy news that you might know that Nintendo has had various forums and social things over the years.

108
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,439
Speaker 1: But there were the insider forums.

109
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,031
Speaker 1: I'll get to my opinion on those, but they're gone.

110
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:47,854
Speaker 1: They're dead.

111
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,858
Speaker 1: They're done.

112
00:06:48,878 --> 00:07:04,758
Speaker 0: Yep Well the official Nintendo forums at nintendo.com for insiders insiders to Nintendo Basically, they've decided that they're gonna redo their whole website to go with their Wii and DS explosion Which I think is a great thing because the Nintendo website is kind of shitty.

113
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,176
Speaker 0: yeah It's full of flash and the interface is kind of cluttered and really small and hard to deal with.

114
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:15,559
Speaker 0: and the only thing I use That site for is to register vidya games when I get them because occasionally that means I get prizes.

115
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,011
Speaker 1: now They might think why is it news that Nintendo shut down some forum somewhere?

116
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,480
Speaker 1: the answer is kind of frightening.

117
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:28,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you have ever delved into the insider forums But they were a cesspool a fest off.

118
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:30,485
Speaker 1: They were the worst thing in the world.

119
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:31,549
Speaker 0: if you ever wanted to see.

120
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:41,280
Speaker 0: you know you think up in your mind the stereotype of An AOL using ten-year-old pokey kid with his mudkips that has got six pikachus in his team.

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,025
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

122
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:49,935
Speaker 0: take that stereotype to the extreme Multiply it by a few thousand and make a forum that consists of those people and only those people.

123
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 0: that is what these forums were.

124
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,444
Speaker 1: They were Absolutely unusable.

125
00:07:54,525 --> 00:08:04,440
Speaker 0: It was nothing, but ten-year-olds yelling at each other and They were saying like some of the dumbest shit you could possibly imagine like like imagine when you were in fifth grade.

126
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:09,400
Speaker 0: Well, I guess if you're as old as us imagine when you're in fifth grade and like kids would be saying stuff about Nintendo.

127
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,390
Speaker 1: I heard Mario fives coming out.

128
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,339
Speaker 1: I got a copy and the copy looked at me.

129
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,034
Speaker 0: Yeah I got a super duper Nintendo from Japan.

130
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:21,360
Speaker 0: It's coming out next week.

131
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,726
Speaker 0: I imported it, and I'm playing Super Mario World 4 and there's a secret level and you can play as Green Luigi toad.

132
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,071
Speaker 1: yeah, but like three warp whistles.

133
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:30,994
Speaker 0: I got nine.

134
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of stuff.

135
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,179
Speaker 0: That's the kind of stuff that goes on in the insider forums.

136
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,821
Speaker 0: No Exaggeration.

137
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,249
Speaker 1: and on this the worst part is.

138
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,178
Speaker 1: I mean these forms are bad on a number of levels and they might.

139
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:48,280
Speaker 0: I Wouldn't hesitate to put them on like a top 10 list of worst forums on the net.

140
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,559
Speaker 1: I mean the penny arcade forums are assess pool.

141
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,288
Speaker 1: They're pretty bad, but they're not.

142
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,640
Speaker 0: they're not at least in the penny arcade forums.

143
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,873
Speaker 0: There are a few shining lights here and there of.

144
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:00,539
Speaker 1: you know the penny arcade awesome But there was none of that in the inside here.

145
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,919
Speaker 1: They had no redeeming value.

146
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:10,435
Speaker 0: You take the worst of the end of the penny arcade forums the absolute worst And you spread it thickly over an entire surface.

147
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:11,460
Speaker 0: that is the insider forum.

148
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,689
Speaker 1: You know I would rather go to a forum hosted by the style Project than ever delve into the inside.

149
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:19,140
Speaker 0: I would go to the something off of forums and fortune.

150
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,846
Speaker 0: Before I went to the insider forum.

151
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,980
Speaker 1: I might watch the meat spin for I don't know two or three rounds before I killed myself.

152
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, rather than go into the insider forums.

153
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,175
Speaker 0: That is also true now.

154
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,807
Speaker 0: I'd rather have a Buffalo.

155
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,718
Speaker 0: I take a tire.

156
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,812
Speaker 1: You know we just can't be filthy like the anger video game.

157
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:40,796
Speaker 1: nerd is filthy now.

158
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:41,960
Speaker 0: We can just copy his filth.

159
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can't actually come up with new similar filth.

160
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,203
Speaker 1: Nope right, but they're even worse than that for a number I mean one.

161
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:54,299
Speaker 1: they were one of those forums from what I can gather where you got more privileges based on how much you posted and

162
00:09:55,522 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker 0: The more of an insider you were the the more like they give you stuff like custom I can't and title

163
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:04,859
Speaker 1: or stuff like the ability to edit one of your posts after you post

164
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,000
Speaker 0: it.

165
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:13,208
Speaker 0: It's kind of a shame that the the the forum was sort of run by Nintendo You know, but it was the official run by Nintendo the company but it was.

166
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:18,258
Speaker 0: it seems like all the moderators ran the forum as if it was like some punk kid crap forum.

167
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:28,311
Speaker 0: and For how the forum was run I think reflected on the user base, you know If you run a forum in a certain way It's sort of like look at our forum.

168
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,500
Speaker 0: our forum could easily devolve into mudkips.

169
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,739
Speaker 1: It would already if we hadn't gotten mr.

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,426
Speaker 0: It's all about the way you run.

171
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,180
Speaker 0: the forum determines the kind of people that use it.

172
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,197
Speaker 1: well the world and how the community is like this form works like a lot of forums do where post counts matter.

173
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:47,217
Speaker 1: it always says like so and so has made a hundred and ninety eight thousand posts and that makes them cool.

174
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:55,549
Speaker 1: and the I think what summed it up for me the most was that a lot of these kids Join dig to comment on the story.

175
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:04,580
Speaker 1: No, man, and the story in dig was probably the worst Commented story in the history of dig and it was just all lowercase.

176
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:10,982
Speaker 1: 10-year-old screaming about other forum was gone and one kid one solitary kid It.

177
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:14,138
Speaker 1: it was the example that made me want to just put a bullet right through my eye.

178
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,367
Speaker 1: This is all lowercase and I'm quoting verbatim.

179
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,993
Speaker 0: Oh, no from memory.

180
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,516
Speaker 0: I might want to close my ears.

181
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,667
Speaker 1: Oh Man, this is really sad.

182
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,033
Speaker 1: This sucks Nintendo.

183
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,420
Speaker 1: Those fuckers can't do this.

184
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:30,575
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyone know how I get mana and red?

185
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:34,207
Speaker 1: or god It was mana and whatever which is whatever you get like.

186
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:39,020
Speaker 1: the post counts like mana and post counts from Nintendo forum imported into other forums.

187
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:51,540
Speaker 1: a Little hint out there to anyone who ever runs a forum If there is any sort of stat that your forum keeps as to how many posts a user is made do not make that public.

188
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,799
Speaker 1: That only encourages idiots to post more.

189
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, uh, don't turn your forums into a game.

190
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,921
Speaker 0: if your forums are a game people You will.

191
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:08,600
Speaker 0: you know you that game that you put on top of your forums will sculpt the behavior of the people in those forums And usually encourages bad behavior.

192
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, even slash smart people won't play that game and stupid people will and thus stupid people will post more.

193
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:26,080
Speaker 1: remember back in the day I used to I played the slash shot game where I decided to fill my entire history with nothing but plus fives and I discovered That slash shot is indeed a game is trivial to do that and it encourages a certain type of behavior.

194
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:33,936
Speaker 1: Anyway enough of that.

195
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,807
Speaker 1: It's time for things of the day.

196
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:42,683
Speaker 1: Oh, man I'm not gonna talk about this much But you know, there are two kinds of videos of people getting tasered on the internet.

197
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 1: now.

198
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:56,730
Speaker 1: the first kind the kind I Enjoy only because it proves that citizen Surveillance of police officers and public officials can do some good It's when someone who totally doesn't deserve to be tasered gets tasered by some jerk cop.

199
00:12:56,971 --> 00:13:00,669
Speaker 0: I hate it when there's a video of someone getting tasered who didn't who shouldn't have been.

200
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:06,030
Speaker 1: no I love it because whenever that happens that means that now there's a record and there's accountability.

201
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:11,133
Speaker 0: I know but I don't like it because I see the video and I just go ah It's.

202
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:20,010
Speaker 0: it's so painful for me to see like an innocent person Getting like police brutality or like jailed when they didn't do anything.

203
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,646
Speaker 1: But then there's the second kind of video of someone getting tasered on the internet, which this one is.

204
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,729
Speaker 1: it is when someone?

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,315
Speaker 1: Totally deserves it.

206
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:36,330
Speaker 1: and these videos are characterized by the following thing The person will be resisting arrest and has already committed some sort of crime and they get lots of warning.

207
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:36,892
Speaker 0: So

208
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:53,270
Speaker 1: the the funny part and I crack up every time is The person's always laying on the ground like resisting arrest and yelling something crazy and the police officer tends to just keep saying Stop that or I'm going to tase you stop resisting or I'm going to tase you.

209
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:59,650
Speaker 1: I am going to tase you if you don't stop resisting and they'll say this for like a minute or two straight.

210
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:08,210
Speaker 1: Just I am going to loudly Clearly multiple times and there's always that when they say it the last time like this is your final warning.

211
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:12,403
Speaker 1: I'm going to tase you right now unless you stop resisting arrest.

212
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,970
Speaker 1: They always have this look like Kind of like that judge with the eyebrow.

213
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:24,329
Speaker 0: You can tell when it's police brutality because I mean you can just tell looking at someone especially when there's a video, right?

214
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:30,270
Speaker 0: Guys only when there's a video you look at the video and you can tell immediately That cop was looking for a reason to tase him.

215
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,900
Speaker 0: He wanted to do it or this person didn't want to do it.

216
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,326
Speaker 0: They had to because the person was going.

217
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:38,226
Speaker 1: there's always just the Always sigh right before.

218
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:41,710
Speaker 1: yeah The reason I bring this one up is there's a video of it.

219
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,743
Speaker 1: The video is kind of bad, but you'll see there was internet outrage about this.

220
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,650
Speaker 1: because look at the police state.

221
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:51,850
Speaker 1: Look at how these cops got this protester and tasered him for no good reason.

222
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:57,987
Speaker 1: But if you watch the video one the guy was obviously a crazy conspiracy nut.

223
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,443
Speaker 1: he was Disrupting a John Kerry thing like super loudly.

224
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:03,764
Speaker 0: Yes.

225
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,710
Speaker 0: He's being disruptive super disruptive.

226
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,802
Speaker 1: He was asked to leave and the police had already been called.

227
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,027
Speaker 1: He refused to leave.

228
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,760
Speaker 0: so that the Here's the thing, right?

229
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:13,890
Speaker 0: He's like, what did I do?

230
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,472
Speaker 0: What did I do?

231
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:22,932
Speaker 0: and if you if you don't really pay attention you think oh this guy just got up Even if he said crazy batshit even twice as crazy as the batshit He said.

232
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:28,290
Speaker 0: right going up and asking a crazy batshit question is not enough to get you tased or arrested or anything.

233
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,510
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't get tased when I asked Magic Johnson if you remembered working with Captain Lou Albano in the Super Mario.

234
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:39,201
Speaker 0: He could have gone up to that microphone and said Hibidi jibidi jibidi jibidi jibidi and that's not enough.

235
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,850
Speaker 1: I believe you meant hibidi habidi jibidi jibidi.

236
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:49,193
Speaker 0: Anyway, if he goes up and says that you know that there's not it's not any and they just tased him for saying that That's not cool.

237
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,450
Speaker 0: The thing here is that they came up to him and they said they asked him to leave.

238
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,276
Speaker 0: You can be asked to leave.

239
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,861
Speaker 0: This wasn't like public property.

240
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,346
Speaker 0: This was like an event.

241
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:04,790
Speaker 0: they can ask anyone to leave But if you don't leave you're now trespassing which means they can arrest you for trespassing.

242
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,516
Speaker 1: Such the funniest part.

243
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:19,166
Speaker 1: as soon as you resist that arrest game over because while the cop is saying it You can't hear it too clearly just because of the video The moment when the police take the guy down he starts yelling like what aren't you good?

244
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:19,888
Speaker 1: something like somebody.

245
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,514
Speaker 1: help me Aren't you seeing this?

246
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:25,549
Speaker 1: and as soon as the cops actually get him to the ground the crowd cheers because they shut him up.

247
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, this one guy on.

248
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:34,916
Speaker 0: I think there was one applause from one other conspiracy not in the audience and you can tell John Kerry is just like oh god He handled it.

249
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:37,807
Speaker 1: Well because at the end he's like, well, I'll answer the young gentleman's question.

250
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,272
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah I mean like.

251
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:47,138
Speaker 0: if I was John Kerry, I probably would have handled it in similar fashion like being all groany like And then being like, alright, I'll answer your question.

252
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,507
Speaker 0: you conspiracy nut after you too bad.

253
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:50,329
Speaker 0: You're not here to hear it.

254
00:16:52,150 --> 00:17:02,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, so while there are videos where people get tased undeservedly and they're upsetting and there are videos where people get tased deservedly And I guess they're refreshing and that I don't feel so bad.

255
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:07,390
Speaker 1: The police have tasers Well, it's more that you can't say all cops are bad and all cops are good at credit.

256
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:10,223
Speaker 1: There's the common wisdom that 99% of cops give 1% of bad name.

257
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:23,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this particular video is is interesting in that it is one where people think it's a taser Didn't deserve it video, but it's actually a did deserve it video, right?

258
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,208
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

259
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:24,810
Speaker 1: Let's get this quick.

264
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,698

Speaker 0: This guy is like three times as awesome as I thought he was before.

272
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,330
Speaker 0: Like I used to think there were like two or three awesome guys.

273
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:12,930
Speaker 0: They were actually all the same guy doing the same.

274

286
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,885
Speaker 0: It's one of those games.

287
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,532
Speaker 0: That's sort of like Like.

288
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:22,010
Speaker 0: one of those games is sort of like an underground Japanese video game in a way But now it's in English and the translation is really good and the game just works and it's really fun.

289
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,746
Speaker 0: The only thing is I think you kind of have to play it with your keyboard.

290
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,470
Speaker 0: I couldn't find out how to play it with a gamepad so much even though that might be possible.

291
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:30,849
Speaker 0: I just haven't found out how yet.

292
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,382
Speaker 0: So this game is worth playing.

293
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:38,724
Speaker 0: if you are cheap have a PC Can't afford to play any other games and you're looking for a game to play.

294
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,229
Speaker 0: This game is pretty cool.

295
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:41,473
Speaker 0: It's pretty.

296
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:54,845
Speaker 0: the coolest thing about the game is that the graphics are like done in an old-school 8-bit styling Sort of like a commander keen kind of thing, but they use like modern, you know It's 32-bit color with like alpha blending and all sorts of stuff.

297
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:55,910
Speaker 0: So it's this really cool.

298
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,190
Speaker 0: Look to the game and I really like those kind of nouveau retro game.

299
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah And the game otherwise is really cool and has some really cool mechanics that I've never seen in any other games before.

300
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:12,690
Speaker 0: Like any weapon you can collect these things to level the weapon up to level 3 But getting hit while a weapon is out reduces the level of the weapon.

301
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:16,565
Speaker 0: So and you got all these different weapons to switch between the games do things like that.

302
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:17,208
Speaker 0: I don't know.

303
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,208
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool I like it.

304
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,555
Speaker 1: I mean how many shooters were?

305
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:23,170
Speaker 1: you level up the weapon you get hit and the weapon weakens it goes away or changes.

306
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,070
Speaker 0: But yeah, this game is cool has a cool plot play.

307
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:31,105
Speaker 1: So speaking of cool games team fortress 2 is out and the beta is out.

308
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:31,386
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,810
Speaker 1: Well effectively the game is out.

310
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,230
Speaker 1: I'm sure they're gonna be a lot of changes but and there's a lot of bugs already.

311
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:40,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really want to give my impressions of the game and we're gonna you know, kind of early review it.

312
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,577
Speaker 1: We'll review it in depth as it goes on.

313
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,484
Speaker 1: We'll keep doing a beta.

314
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,170
Speaker 0: - so yeah take that is you.

315
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:46,431
Speaker 0: But

316
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:59,184
Speaker 1: we realize that a lot of people particularly after I tried to play some fortress forever Last weekend and learned that most people out there Never actually played most of the games that led up to team fortress 2

317
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:02,916
Speaker 0: and most people don't even really know Like what the deal is with team 4.

318
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,185
Speaker 0: Yes, or why it's significant or popular or why it.

319
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:10,638
Speaker 0: there's a lot of people out there Like team fortress 2. where's team fortress 1?

320
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:13,999
Speaker 1: I mean I'll say it really simply and then we'll go into the history.

321
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,794
Speaker 1: if you think the team fortress classic was the original you are sadly Mistaken.

322
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:21,050
Speaker 1: team fortress classic in my opinion.

323
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,781
Speaker 1: Well, I talk about I agree.

324
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,310
Speaker 0: I agree mostly with rim on this.

325
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:30,229
Speaker 1: I am of the mind that team fortress classic is the absolute worst implementation of team fortress on any platform.

326
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,535
Speaker 1: Name a worse one.

327
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,985
Speaker 0: It's the worst one that I know of.

328
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,250
Speaker 0: there could be a worse one out there.

329
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,570
Speaker 0: I well - it's the worst major one to its credit.

330
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:44,150
Speaker 1: I never bothered with the unreal based ones, but all the people I knew who played them hated them.

331
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,487
Speaker 1: I don't know why they played them, but they hated him while they played him.

332
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:47,833
Speaker 0: Yep I do.

333
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:52,489
Speaker 0: I do want to say though in the defense of team fortress classic that the hunted mode is okay.

334
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:53,715
Speaker 1: It is actually.

335
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,790
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the hunted mode, but the actual answer the flag mode sucks.

336
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:02,907
Speaker 1: So team fortress actually began like right as I was going into high school.

337
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:09,425
Speaker 1: It was like 1996 Yeah, and a couple of guys wrote a mod for quake wine quake one.

338
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,368
Speaker 0: now get this right.

339
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,699
Speaker 0: yet Wolfenstein 3d no multiplayer.

340
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,250
Speaker 0: doom 1 and doom 2 and all the other dooms.

341
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:20,726
Speaker 0: They had some multiplayer going on, but it was all deathmatch or co-op.

342
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,393
Speaker 0: beat the game together It was no.

343
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,222
Speaker 0: there was no team play.

344
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,990
Speaker 0: There was no objective play.

345
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:36,335
Speaker 0: It was just either multiplayer deathmatch every man for themselves who gets the most kills instantly respawn the simplest most bare-bones gameplay mode you can imagine or Beat the game with some friends.

346
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:45,490
Speaker 0: help quake one came around and you know doom you could mod But quake one you could mod like much more significantly than any other game previous.

347
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,804
Speaker 0: I mean there was Duke Nukem 3d, but you couldn't really mod that I mean.

348
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,290
Speaker 1: quake 2 was similarly model.

349
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:55,608
Speaker 1: I think the point is more that quake 1 was the first game that that really was model accessibly to people.

350
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:56,150
Speaker 0: first FPS.

351
00:22:56,391 --> 00:23:01,250
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was also multiplayer and able to be played online because I mean doom was super model.

352
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:08,110
Speaker 0: I made mods for doom and doom - but you couldn't make you couldn't really mod multiplayer games in a significant way.

353
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:12,044
Speaker 0: You know you could like make a map and you could change some weapons and you could change some bad.

354
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:16,541
Speaker 1: actually someone made a really Good rocket soccer team mod for doom.

355
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:17,787
Speaker 0: Wow, that's crazy.

356
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:18,570
Speaker 1: I actually played it.

357
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,294
Speaker 1: It was pretty fun.

358
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:22,110
Speaker 0: Most of the mods like Barney doom, but yeah.

359
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:26,390
Speaker 0: Anyway, the first the thing about team fortress that was so significant.

360
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:27,990
Speaker 0: There were a lot of things significant about it.

361
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,622
Speaker 0: But not only was it like the first major mod for quake one.

362
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:38,450
Speaker 0: It was the first major multiplayer team FPS mod ever that was significant.

363
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:44,756
Speaker 0: I mean there might have been like one here or there but no one played them and I can't find any evidence to even suggest Any existed but they might have.

364
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:48,270
Speaker 1: this was the one that was played by actual humans a lot.

365
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might even been the first one.

366
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,807
Speaker 0: I just the only reason I'm not saying it definitely was is because I don't have any evidence that there You know were or were not any others before it.

367
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:03,128
Speaker 1: now there is the the history of team fortress itself and the evolution of this original game and the iterations.

368
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:10,108
Speaker 1: and Eventually, there was mega team fortress, which in my opinion is the second best implementation of a team fortress game ever.

369
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:17,995
Speaker 1: Yep That would take a whole show in and of itself to cover all the details of that and we'll probably do it someday because it's Actually kind of fascinating.

370
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:24,436
Speaker 1: but suffice to say that was the original and then from there we had you know mega team fortress Which was just improvements on that.

371
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:32,930
Speaker 1: and then there was quake 2 and there was the weapons factory mod Which was like the super super complex version of the same basic concept.

372
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:44,610
Speaker 0: There are also lots of similar mods that weren't called team fortress for like there was just capture the flag for quake 1 and just Capture the flag for quake 2 which were team FPS is where you sort of did a similar thing to team fortress.

373
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:50,290
Speaker 0: It wasn't exactly like team fortress which why they didn't call it team fortress, but they were team multiplayer FPS.

374
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:55,629
Speaker 0: I mean you could play action quake or action half-life and get a game mode similar to team fortress going on.

375
00:24:56,051 --> 00:25:00,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean just back in the day, but when I was like super into PC gaming.

376
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:15,733
Speaker 1: I just remember that the three games I played all the time were mega TF weapons factory and action quake - yep But to skip all that history what we're really talking about is this whole genre of game that effectively could be just called a team Fortress game.

377
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:16,115
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:16,336
Speaker 0: Now.

379
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:17,802
Speaker 0: What is a team fortress game have?

380
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,187
Speaker 0: first of all, it's an FPS.

381
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:23,444
Speaker 0: if it's not an FPS It's not team fortress - you have classes.

382
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,191
Speaker 0: This is the other significant thing I mean.

383
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:26,797
Speaker 0: there are games that it classes before.

384
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:39,784
Speaker 0: we've had classes in games since the original Dungeons & Dragons But classes in an FPS where you start the game and you choose a class and depending on the class you choose You'll have a wildly different set of weapons available to you.

385
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:49,215
Speaker 0: I mean think about in the doom Multiplayer everyone had the same weapons pistol shotgun rocket launcher plasma BFG Whatever chain gun.

386
00:25:49,817 --> 00:26:00,909
Speaker 0: now there was an FPS where everyone had different weapons, you know It was your flamethrower versus my rocket launcher versus shotgun versus machine gun versus laser and that was pretty significant.

387
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:10,756
Speaker 1: and The real fun part of these games was just that it was team-based and because of these classes and because there was an objective It wasn't just kill the other people.

388
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:15,510
Speaker 1: It was get in there get that flag get it back without them getting your flag.

389
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:19,910
Speaker 1: The game took on this kind of life of its own and new modes of gameplay.

390
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:29,450
Speaker 1: I mean the idea that you could play an FPS multiplayer Where you were gonna sit in the base and defend the ramp room that leads up to the flag.

391
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:30,956
Speaker 1: And that was what you were gonna do.

392
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:32,563
Speaker 0: you weren't gonna attack anyone.

393
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,350
Speaker 0: you were gonna go to try to kill anyone.

394
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:39,575
Speaker 0: You were just gonna not let anyone past a certain point you were not in shall pass You think about.

395
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:46,990
Speaker 0: up until then if you're playing an FPS Your only goal was to get from point A to point B without dying and probably killing as many things as possible.

396
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:57,474
Speaker 0: Now you were still playing an FPS be it a completely different goal doing something completely different Developing a completely different skill set within the same, you know I Don't know though.

397
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,744
Speaker 0: I lost a word idiom.

398
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:09,643
Speaker 1: Yes It was just that because of the classes you know people would kind of fall into these roles and people would specialize and a lot Of emergent team play started coming about.

399
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:11,010
Speaker 1: I mean clans are a whole different fact.

400
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,137
Speaker 1: We're not getting into that but in public service.

401
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:16,529
Speaker 1: just people play in this game not affiliated with each other didn't even know each other.

402
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:23,313
Speaker 1: Team play would start to emerge and it start out with simple strategies like let's all rush now Or they're getting

403
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,237
Speaker 0: the flag everybody

404
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:34,230
Speaker 1: defend and things like that, but it started getting complicated, you know, all right We'll have a bunch of snipers to guard the Midway and then suddenly we'll rush through here and do this and that and centuries Hidden in these corners and oh my god.

405
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:45,030
Speaker 0: Yeah Now the last significant thing about team fortress that really sets it apart from other games at least other capture the flag games Especially is that let's say I run in the base and they get the flag and I'm running I'm running I'm running I'm running.

406
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:45,889
Speaker 0: It's a two-fort map.

407
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,075
Speaker 0: Which is a two-fort map?

408
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,632
Speaker 0: means there's a fort on one end a fort on the other end at a big open field in the middle.

409
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:51,884
Speaker 1: that's very specifically.

410
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:59,090
Speaker 1: there's a Open field in the middle of water in a river a bridge across and there's also a sewer entrance that goes between the two.

411
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,156
Speaker 0: Yes That is what a two-fort map looks.

412
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:07,701
Speaker 1: there is a lot of nomenclature and if you talk to some of those old hardcore Grizzled mega TF players they'll speak a language.

413
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:12,941
Speaker 0: I met few men today understand But anyway, so it's a two-fort map.

414
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:22,910
Speaker 0: I go into the top of the enemy base I jump off the freaking rafters, you know with a rocket jump and I'm going I'm going I'm going and then slowly Snipes me and I die in midair and I fall to the ground.

415
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:26,463
Speaker 0: The flag falls to the ground in the middle of the field.

416
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,230
Speaker 0: now some of these stays there.

417
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,153
Speaker 1: Well some of these.

418
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:32,784
Speaker 1: the flag stays there until a teammate touches it and then it returns.

419
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:33,366
Speaker 1: some of these.

420
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:34,590
Speaker 1: it stays there for a time.

421
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,650
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of different ways.

422
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:44,962
Speaker 0: This could work but the point is is that it stays there and a lot of other CTF games would be you die the flag Returns, you know, yeah, and someone has to actually make the whole trip at once.

423
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:47,650
Speaker 0: the fact that the flag stays there, right?

424
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,990
Speaker 0: It does like two or three important things to the strategy of the game.

425
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:59,232
Speaker 0: first of all It encourages the team play because now it's not a matter of is there one guy on our team who can go and get the Flag for us?

426
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,540
Speaker 0: it's can the team get the flag?

427
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,470
Speaker 0: because if you die someone can pick up the flag and keep carrying.

428
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:07,930
Speaker 0: Yep, you can go with you and defend you while you're getting the flag.

429
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:18,829
Speaker 1: so the arsonist and the engineer sitting in the base defending the flag are just as important to your victory as the Recon or the scout and the heavy guy who are running forward trying to capture it.

430
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,026
Speaker 0: Secondly it changes the dynamic of the game.

431
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,379
Speaker 0: mid game I mean, okay the both flags are in the bases.

432
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,105
Speaker 0: Everyone plays a certain play style.

433
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:31,439
Speaker 0: while both flags are in the bases suddenly someone gets one of the flags in the middle of the field.

434
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:44,602
Speaker 0: the game completely changes as all these defenders move out to the Middle of the field and all the offense completely changes this direction and the game goes crazy and people have to adapt to all these Crazy situations depending on where the flag happens to end games

435
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:56,644
Speaker 1: like this or games where momentum matters And that is probably one of the biggest factors in the enjoyment where if you get a foothold in the enemy base Like you've pushed them back to their border and you're now like at their gate and

436
00:29:56,684 --> 00:29:58,510
Speaker 0: you guys we got turrets in their base where?

437
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,761
Speaker 0: They spawn and they can't leave.

438
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:09,049
Speaker 1: Yeah My favorite was in weapons factory the heavy weapons person could make a laser like you stick it on the wall And it's just a death laser that goes out in one direction doesn't move.

439
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:14,190
Speaker 1: Of course on some maps you can put a few of these right across from the enemy spawn.

440
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:17,417
Speaker 0: Yes Now another thing these games did.

441
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,226
Speaker 0: is they pretty much at least at the quake very the quake based ones.

442
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:23,955
Speaker 0: is they required To be good?

443
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,650
Speaker 0: an extremely high level of PC FPS proficiency?

444
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,393
Speaker 1: I'm not just that.

445
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:33,130
Speaker 0: if you couldn't rocket jump like across the field and the to fort you were gonna die trying to walk.

446
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you couldn't bunny hop and I'm not talking quake to bunny hopping which was pretty easy.

447
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:50,450
Speaker 1: Try actually bunny hopping in quake one It was kind of a glitch but it was one of these like in Smash Brothers where like the super tournament players Do things that are barely legal and are almost a glitch and that's how they play the game.

448
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,269
Speaker 1: That's just how good players play.

449
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,990
Speaker 1: These games are a lot the same way at least especially the older ones.

450
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:03,108
Speaker 1: they think the skills got to such the point and the margins were so thin among the good players that it would come down to.

451
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:07,430
Speaker 1: I Have got the precise timing to bunny cock jump and get in and get the flag.

452
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you think about the way the game works is an example to show you just how much FPS skill meant The scout was the fastest.

453
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,350
Speaker 0: if you just picked all the classes you just ran the scout was the fastest.

454
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:26,704
Speaker 0: Someone with FPS skill and the medic could go faster than anyone even with the scout someone if they use the scout It'd be slower than if they were with the medic because of the way it worked.

455
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:29,897
Speaker 1: So What version would that be true?

456
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:30,319
Speaker 1: I could never.

457
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,770
Speaker 1: you're gonna make a scout car go slower than the other people.

458
00:31:33,214 --> 00:31:34,750
Speaker 0: No, you wouldn't make the scout go slower.

459
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:40,270
Speaker 1: You can make the medic go really fast But the scout with the same person with the same skill can make the scout go faster.

460
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:41,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were like sir.

461
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,538
Speaker 0: I don't know.

462
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,530
Speaker 1: I think what team fortresses have you played?

463
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,574
Speaker 0: I played Team Fortress classic mostly but I The other ones a couple times.

464
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,697
Speaker 1: one's name some.

465
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:55,450
Speaker 0: I played the original Team Fortress like two times and played the mega TF two times.

466
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:56,555
Speaker 1: Oh, so you had quake world.

467
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:58,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had quake one.

468
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:03,246
Speaker 0: I doubt you know the open source, whatever You know, there's like five open source engines that let you play it.

469
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:04,813
Speaker 1: Ah Uh-huh.

470
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,645
Speaker 0: Anyway, but that's what it says on the internet also, so I'm not just making it up.

471
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:09,287
Speaker 1: Okay.

472
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:18,218
Speaker 0: Yeah Regardless that's that's the way this kind of game was is that your FPS skill could go above and beyond And take you to a higher level.

473
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:28,006
Speaker 1: the skills that were required not just skills in terms of FPS but in terms of you had to understand the game and Understand the mod and it was actually super complicated to play some of these because you had to buy.

474
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,293
Speaker 0: factory was twice as come Factory.

475
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:38,759
Speaker 1: you had to bind a million keys to a million different things and every class had like a bunch of different kinds of grenades that were all specialized and different weapons and

476
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,429
Speaker 0: you needed like to set up scripts for a lot of these games so that you Could you know shoot your pistol in your left hand?

477
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,990
Speaker 0: But then like throw a grenade and without having to like switch weapons throw a grenade switch weapon.

478
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:55,130
Speaker 1: Well, that was specific to the fact that mega TF and game and the other games grenades were offhand.

479
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,808
Speaker 1: You could just throw a grenade while you had your gun out quick to didn't have that Facility you had to switch to grenade and then throw it.

480
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:11,443
Speaker 1: So me and many other people who played this game wrote scripts where by hitting a button it would swap Weapons throw a grenade and then swap back to the weapon.

481
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:12,950
Speaker 1: I just been using very quickly.

482
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:13,230
Speaker 1: Yes

483
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:35,309
Speaker 0: these games while awesome in their day were very obtuse very inaccessible and pretty much only the hardest core of people who not only had PC skills the willingness and determination to deal with like, you know quake scripting and Also mad FPS kills and crazy reflexes and all that such could have any chance of actually doing.

484
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:42,262
Speaker 1: well It was it was just the bar was set so high But anyway fast forward TFC sucked and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

485
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:43,365
Speaker 0: Well TFC.

486
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:47,682
Speaker 1: I'll just say what it was is Well, I want to get to Team Fortress 2 the interesting part.

487
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:51,410
Speaker 0: when half-life 1 came out, you know They had they needed a Team Fortress game for it.

488
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:57,130
Speaker 0: So they made Team Fortress classic which is supposed to be a throwback to the original Team Fortress and it kind of was.

489
00:33:57,631 --> 00:34:03,570
Speaker 0: But it was really simplified kind of slow kind of crappy and it was just Team Fortress for half-life.

490
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:07,309
Speaker 0: But there was a play mode called the hunted where you protected the VIP and that was fun.

491
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is Team Fortress classic was really shit.

492
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:11,746
Speaker 0: It was really shitty.

493
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:12,128
Speaker 0: It's silly.

494
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:13,313
Speaker 0: She's right You can still play it.

495
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,830
Speaker 1: So before Team Fortress 2 came out, you know, there's a mod called fortress forever.

496
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:24,650
Speaker 1: They just came out like a four days ago Which is oh I've played it and I know a lot of people in the forums have played it and I also played it.

497
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,726
Speaker 1: It's a lot like TFC and it's just really crappy and not worth it at all.

498
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:29,389
Speaker 1: It wasn't fun.

499
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,025
Speaker 0: It does have better class differentiation and variation than TFC and it is more polished than TFC.

500
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:38,716
Speaker 1: But other than that, yeah Yeah, it's just it's not fun at all.

501
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:39,498
Speaker 1: I didn't enjoy it.

502
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,466
Speaker 0: one whit they didn't.

503
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:47,790
Speaker 0: they concentrated I think too much on just like following the Team Fortress formula and they didn't actually think about that.

504
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,485
Speaker 0: The gameplay and then like, you know making it interesting and they didn't think about the maps too.

505
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,107
Speaker 0: Well either.

506
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:54,010
Speaker 0: so it's really.

507
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,810
Speaker 0: It's like they get the basic like they got like the peanut butter and the bread, right?

508
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,810
Speaker 0: But they didn't get the subtle flavor of the jelly.

509
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,283
Speaker 0: Oh, like all the detailed work in making that mod good is just totally lost.

510
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,557
Speaker 1: But anyway, totally enough history Team Fortress 2.

511
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,630
Speaker 0: would you want to say why it took 10 years to Team Fortress 2 to come out?

512
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:16,580
Speaker 1: I think we could do a separate like historical show on that.

513
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,229
Speaker 0: Well go to rim dot weights dot Tia.

514
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:25,042
Speaker 0: for Basically they kept promising the Team Fortress 2 would come out.

515
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:27,250
Speaker 0: the guys who made the original Team Fortress made a company.

516
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:29,542
Speaker 0: They said they were gonna make Team Fortress 2.

517
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:31,110
Speaker 1: I think everyone on the internet knows this.

518
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,716
Speaker 1: We've talked about this several times.

519
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,281
Speaker 0: I'll give it Team Fortress.

520
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,570
Speaker 1: I think we can skip it and I think we can skip it.

521
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,858
Speaker 1: They may think we can skip it.

522
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,750
Speaker 0: I think you just talk about something else.

523
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,404
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of we've talked about this before more than once.

524
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:43,389
Speaker 0: it took ten years.

525
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:46,370
Speaker 0: Yeah game finally came out like us last night.

526
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,620
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the beta came out last night after ten years.

527
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,246
Speaker 1: So initial impressions.

528
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:52,450
Speaker 1: I it's fun.

529
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:57,270
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the visual style first because that's the one arena where I don't think anyone can complain.

530
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,906
Speaker 0: Well the first time I ever saw the visual style, right?

531
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:00,590
Speaker 0: I was like what the fuck?

532
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,252
Speaker 0: What are they doing?

533
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,582
Speaker 0: And then the second time I saw it.

534
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,430
Speaker 0: I was like, that's the awesome.

535
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,139
Speaker 0: That is exact that the the visual style.

536
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,729
Speaker 0: while usually don't care about the graphics and games and I still don't The point in this game is that the aesthetic?

537
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:24,850
Speaker 0: the way the aesthetics are in Team Fortress 2 is it is a visual representation of the Style of gameplay and the attitude of the gameplay that the game.

538
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've actually talked about that too on the show.

539
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:38,750
Speaker 1: if you wanted the example I watch I believe the trailer number two to Team Fortress 2 which Exemplifies everything that should be in a good Team Fortress style game.

540
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:47,470
Speaker 1: And if you watch the video to a certain point the music changes and that was the moment When I had a nerdgasm and decided that I would do anything to have this game.

541
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Team Fortress 1 had the same feel in the play, but it looked like quake 1.

542
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:57,558
Speaker 0: You know weapons factory had the same feel in the gameplay But it looked like quake 2 Team Fortress classic feel.

543
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,750
Speaker 0: gameplay same I guess but crappy but it looked like half-life.

544
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:04,490
Speaker 0: This looks the way it feels and that is a awesome.

545
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:08,650
Speaker 1: Yes, because it meant to me that the people making this game know what's important.

546
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:11,763
Speaker 1: So the visual style of the game is perfect.

547
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:18,690
Speaker 1: every single thing You can see in the game while you play is just I. I can't see anything they can improve.

548
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:27,429
Speaker 0: Yeah Looking at the game makes me feel like I'm playing it and that means that the people making the game They have the same idea about what the game should feel like.

549
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,438
Speaker 0: that I do because it can't get better than the characters.

550
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:40,390
Speaker 1: facial expressions are right the engineer looks down and like kind of Everyone just looks perfect and whatever they're doing the heavy weapons guy is laughing his ass off as he's firing that weapon.

551
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:40,851
Speaker 1: It's just.

552
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:44,884
Speaker 1: it's so organic feeling and just so there's this sense.

553
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:51,306
Speaker 1: That's obviously artificial of Camaraderie where you hear your teammates yelling things to each other.

554
00:37:51,326 --> 00:38:01,509
Speaker 1: not you know voice chat but the characters that they're playing in the game just kind of yell into each other and Medic and on taunting each other and get the same feeling is in the natural selection ready room.

555
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,326
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah while you're playing which is awesome All right.

556
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,963
Speaker 1: And I think my favorite little bit is that the spy if a spy.

557
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:15,730
Speaker 1: I mean this has been a problem with all Team Fortress Games that have spies or anything like that where it's hard to not shoot at spies on your own team.

558
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:28,290
Speaker 1: Yeah in this game if a spy is on your team disguised as an enemy He still looks like a spy from your team But he has a paper mask over his face with the face of the enemy drawn on it.

559
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:32,382
Speaker 1: Yep, but if it's an enemy, it looks just like their engineer.

560
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:41,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, they figured out all sorts of you know Within the game there, you know, like I said the old Team Fortress games were very inaccessible to normal people.

561
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:46,910
Speaker 0: They have polished the interface of this game in the audio and the video.

562
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:57,289
Speaker 0: They added visual cues and the controls pretty much in every aspect so that there is no all the problems of a Team Fortress game that make it inaccessible or difficult to figure out are totally gone.

563
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,130
Speaker 0: like You know the used to be like it for example fortress forever, right?

564
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,773
Speaker 0: You want a cloak.

565
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:07,604
Speaker 0: you push a button it says you are now cloaking and then a few seconds later It says you are now cloaked down in the chat area.

566
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:08,329
Speaker 0: That's it.

567
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:13,450
Speaker 0: You have no indication of whether you're cloaked or not anymore or how cloaked you are in this one.

568
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:24,870
Speaker 0: You push one button the spy picks up a wristwatch pushes a button on it and he keeps his wristwatch up in front of his Face, but his arms totally get cloaked and you can see that you're cloaked with your eyes.

569
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:34,943
Speaker 0: And then when you get uncloaked you can see that you're uncloaked and you can see that you need to recharge your little cokey thing now along those lines and this is something that is absolutely brilliant.

570
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:37,169
Speaker 1: a lot of classes have a special power.

571
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:43,359
Speaker 1: in Team Fortress 2 you bind a key to that and Every class is special.

572
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:52,789
Speaker 1: power is activated by that same key Unlike say weapons factory where you had to have a separate script and a separate set of key binds for every single class.

573
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:55,057
Speaker 1: in this Game you need to worry about any of that.

574
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:58,689
Speaker 1: the middle whatever button you bind is the special power of anyone.

575
00:39:58,709 --> 00:39:59,110
Speaker 1: you play them.

576
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,170
Speaker 0: I know class has more than one special power.

577
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:09,661
Speaker 0: So you push like Q when you're the spy and you will cloak if you're the medic And you have your energy thing charged all the way up.

578
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:11,570
Speaker 0: you push Q and you use the invincibility.

579
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:12,076
Speaker 0: That's it.

580
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:12,905
Speaker 0: you push one button.

581
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,360
Speaker 0: good So what else about tf2?

582
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:15,502
Speaker 0: well?

583
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,762
Speaker 1: There's this interesting effect where when you move the mouse really quickly the world blurs.

584
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:30,002
Speaker 1: now on one hand it looks kind of cool But on the other hand I almost feel like that might have been added Partly because the game is gonna be on consoles.

585
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,450
Speaker 0: Yes, it's tough to tell.

586
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,310
Speaker 0: I mean you look at this game, and you can play on your PC with your Xbox 360 controller.

587
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:37,515
Speaker 0: You know you can.

588
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:38,600
Speaker 0: it's it's.

589
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:40,930
Speaker 0: you know the game for the Xbox 360.

590
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,123
Speaker 0: I'm assuming it's gonna be the exact same game as that we're playing now.

591
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:45,710
Speaker 0: You know only fixed and such.

592
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,145
Speaker 0: But I can't like I move the mouse around and I'm like okay.

593
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:51,410
Speaker 0: This is a PC FPS.

594
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:52,600
Speaker 0: I have full control.

595
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,807
Speaker 0: I'm not being auto aimed I'm not being limited or anything like that.

596
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,373
Speaker 0: But it feels like when I play the game that they've done something Like.

597
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:05,370
Speaker 0: I guess it feels like there's some accommodation for console.

598
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:07,450
Speaker 1: Oh, I can tell you exactly I can't put my finger.

599
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,494
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of factors.

600
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,330
Speaker 1: one the faster you move the mouse around the screen blurs while you're moving it.

601
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the blurriness though.

602
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:14,930
Speaker 0: It could just be an.

603
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,914
Speaker 1: That's not the only thing.

604
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:26,089
Speaker 1: in general and this game is almost barely an FPS because you're FPS skills and precise aiming mean jack and shit in this game.

605
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,250
Speaker 0: well They mean a little bit.

606
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,521
Speaker 0: I mean when I was playing a little bit.

607
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:31,350
Speaker 0: all it means is they don't mean enough.

608
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:39,583
Speaker 1: they have to point in the general direction of the enemy and you're probably gonna hit him because People move kind of slowly and like the Rockets take forever to get where they're going.

609
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:46,380
Speaker 0: yeah, most of the guns have really wide spreads and Sniping headshots don't mean anything it appears at least I can well.

610
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,484
Speaker 1: for snipers it seems to.

611
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:53,750
Speaker 1: the problem is that sniping is just Absolutely trivial and it's also kind of not fun because the zoom is just on and off.

612
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,590
Speaker 1: It's not like a slow zoom in and it's not lift up the button to shoot its click.

613
00:41:57,632 --> 00:42:00,197
Speaker 0: Yes anyone has ever played an FPS on the PC?

614
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:11,410
Speaker 0: the way sniping should work always is where you when you hold the mouse button down for Shooting right it zooms in and then when you let go of the button it should actually shoot only for the sniper rifle.

615
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:14,314
Speaker 0: It should do that because think about it You're sniping right.

616
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:17,646
Speaker 0: if you had to push the button to shoot the mouse might move a little bit.

617
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:22,130
Speaker 0: when you push the button in But you sort of hold the button on someone and let go and they die.

618
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:23,375
Speaker 0: That's how sniping should.

619
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:27,290
Speaker 0: it just feels so much better that way and that's that's I can't imagine any other way.

620
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:33,570
Speaker 1: But just the way the game like the way Characters move and how fast or slow they are in the way all the weapons work it.

621
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,906
Speaker 1: FPS skill means very little in this game, but even worse.

622
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:41,415
Speaker 1: I hate to say it But the way the game is now in its current state Team play doesn't matter either.

623
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:45,970
Speaker 1: the game is basically just two mobs of players push against each other until one wins.

624
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:59,110
Speaker 0: I can't see any strategies beyond the Blindingly obvious ones like have a heavy guy with a medic Following having a heavy guy with a medic following him if the heavy guy isn't stupid and one of my friends now?

625
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:08,470
Speaker 0: Well, I basically when I had as someone who was good at being a heavy and I was the medic and I followed them We just kicked all kinds of ass like destroyed the other team almost entirely was amazing.

626
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:14,048
Speaker 1: Just the only other thing that really bothers me aside from the fact that the FPS in is not so hot.

627
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:16,959
Speaker 1: It's just The the weapon selection.

628
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:18,910
Speaker 1: while it's good they've I mean they got rid of grenades.

629
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,241
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that and every class is just like bare-bones.

630
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:23,685
Speaker 1: It is exactly what it is.

631
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:25,110
Speaker 1: It is iconic of what it is.

632
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,410
Speaker 0: Yes, they have pretty much taken the Team Fortress formula.

633
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:36,230
Speaker 0: They removed all the cruft and they boiled it down to just the essence which I think is good because it exemplifies What makes a Team Fortress game a Team Fortress game?

634
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:43,993
Speaker 0: But in some ways they took off too much cruft the fact that every character effectively only has one Weapon.

635
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,299
Speaker 1: that's good for their class.

636
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,927
Speaker 1: Everything else is just kind of nothing.

637
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:47,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like everyone.

638
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:49,461
Speaker 0: It's I mean the heavy weapons guy.

639
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:51,010
Speaker 0: He has his heavy weapon.

640
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,939
Speaker 0: Then he's got like the shotgun in his fists and that's pretty much it.

641
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:58,373
Speaker 1: and no character has more than one special power or special Anything or special weapon.

642
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:06,336
Speaker 1: and I'm not saying I want the weapons factory world where I've got a character that has like nine different things they can do.

643
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:14,590
Speaker 1: no no no see but I don't want a game where I Feel like my class is so limiting to me that I don't have any tactical decisions.

644
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:17,370
Speaker 1: It's not like oh, I'm in close quarters got to use this.

645
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,068
Speaker 1: It's just this is my weapon and everything else is a backup shit weapon.

646
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:26,046
Speaker 0: Yep I mean the thing about that they've done right is they've made every class.

647
00:44:26,106 --> 00:44:27,210
Speaker 0: It's an asymmetric game.

648
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,283
Speaker 0: You know when asymmetric game is where people have different things to work with.

649
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,910
Speaker 0: right, you know, not everyone is equal.

650
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:36,688
Speaker 0: It like chess is a symmetric game, you know, this is not because you have different classes, you know.

651
00:44:36,728 --> 00:44:41,156
Speaker 0: at the same thing They've made each class super min-maxed Which is what they should do.

652
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:45,257
Speaker 0: like the scout is really good at going Running into the base and grabbing stuff.

653
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:47,427
Speaker 1: Even though the scout is way too slow in this game.

654
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,210
Speaker 0: He is way too slow.

655
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,276
Speaker 0: He needs to be a lot faster.

656
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:49,698
Speaker 0: You know what?

657
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:51,970
Speaker 0: He can't even outrun the lowest level sentry turret.

658
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,270
Speaker 0: He just gets killed if there's one there period which sucks.

659
00:44:54,611 --> 00:45:02,357
Speaker 1: Actually what I'm kind of thinking is that if you just need to double the moving speed of every object in this game Yeah, and the game would be a lot better.

660
00:45:02,478 --> 00:45:03,341
Speaker 0: It would be a lot better.

661
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:05,210
Speaker 0: it see the game doesn't feel.

662
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,410
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't slow it down to the point at which I'm like, this is too slow.

663
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:10,476
Speaker 1: It's not like these.

664
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:18,190
Speaker 1: when like weapons factory was released on quake 3 The way quake 3 engine is the game just felt so slow and boxy that it just it was unplayable.

665
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they slow.

666
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,350
Speaker 0: it feels like it's like a tad slow.

667
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:25,290
Speaker 0: It's like I need to be moving a little faster here a little faster people, you know.

668
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:29,710
Speaker 0: But the scout is super fast and but that's what he is.

669
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,682
Speaker 0: He's super fast and he can double jump and that's.

670
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:32,708
Speaker 0: he's super good at that.

671
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:34,357
Speaker 0: But he's super weak.

672
00:45:34,418 --> 00:45:36,570
Speaker 0: and in actually fighting now, that's fine.

673
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:48,220
Speaker 0: But just if I feel like every class needs one more special job like the heavy guy He's super good at his mowing people down and he has super good at not dying because he has lots of health But he's moves really slow.

674
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,743
Speaker 0: That's right.

675
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:50,030
Speaker 0: He's that's his min and his max.

676
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:55,872
Speaker 0: He's max at killing a lot of guys and defending your base from like an onslaught of enemies and doing a lot of damage take A lot of hits.

677
00:45:56,233 --> 00:46:00,729
Speaker 0: and he's min at doing anything else that it requires moving or dodging or anything.

678
00:46:02,153 --> 00:46:05,074
Speaker 0: His only weapon is The heavy machine gun.

679
00:46:05,114 --> 00:46:08,367
Speaker 1: now that give him another game play be ready for gameplay purposes.

680
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:09,090
Speaker 1: That could be fine.

681
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:17,613
Speaker 1: the problem is that it actually gets Uninteresting really quick because you don't have any options and your only option if you get bored with using that one weapon is to play A different class.

682
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:23,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I was changing classes a lot just because it got really uninteresting to play the class I was playing.

683
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:37,322
Speaker 0: but also depending on the situation in the game I would change classes as opposed to sticking with one class and changing my strategy because They've min max them so which is good because it makes the game interesting But they've boiled them down to where they're.

684
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:38,889
Speaker 0: they only have one.

685
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:40,804
Speaker 0: You know thing they can do.

686
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:46,745
Speaker 0: so you have to change Classes when you want to do something differently rather than having another option in how you can play now.

687
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:51,550
Speaker 1: this ties in with another issue That there's been a lot of quote unquote controversy on the internet.

688
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:57,690
Speaker 1: No one has grenades in this game with the exception of the demo man power is he has grenades.

689
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:02,929
Speaker 0: If you've played Team Fortress games before pretty much everyone had a grenades all over the place.

690
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:05,570
Speaker 1: now The reason for that is actually pretty interesting.

691
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:17,385
Speaker 1: I mean all these old games were mods of existing games and to do interesting things you oftentimes had to get around the Programmatic just difficulties or limitations of the engine in the game.

692
00:47:17,425 --> 00:47:17,767
Speaker 1: you were you.

693
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:18,590
Speaker 0: I mean a quick one.

694
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,575
Speaker 0: Everything was either a gun or a grenade.

695
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:21,518
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

696
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,724
Speaker 1: so to make a class interesting.

697
00:47:23,905 --> 00:47:28,422
Speaker 1: I'll use uh, I don't know It doesn't matter just I won't even give an example.

698
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:30,230
Speaker 1: I'll just say you've got a class right.

699
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:39,850
Speaker 1: He's got like two weapons that are unique to his class And then he's got all the normal weapons, and then he has say two or three different quote grenades.

700
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:46,116
Speaker 1: One of them's a normal grenade, but the other one or two are actually special things like oh I got a good one in weapons factory.

701
00:47:46,317 --> 00:47:49,770
Speaker 1: you have the marine right and his main weapon was the rocket launcher.

702
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:54,710
Speaker 1: But he also had another kind of rocket launcher that was crook slightly so and those are like his two main weapons.

703
00:47:55,673 --> 00:48:05,470
Speaker 1: He also had one kind of grenade I forget what it did and another kind of grenade Which was actually a little floating turret, and you threw it and it made a little turret that floated there for like two minutes

704
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:06,312
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm

705
00:48:06,914 --> 00:48:10,144
Speaker 1: and this was a way to super differentiate all the classes.

706
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:22,910
Speaker 1: so each class would have a bunch of different kinds of grenades that were all unique to that class and gave you a bunch of tactical options in that class and In addition you had one or two unique weapons or special weapons for that class.

707
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:36,630
Speaker 1: so each class was very versatile within the scope of what it could do or what it was supposed to do and I think a good team fortress game should kind of mix the two boil it down But at the same time don't boil it down too much.

708
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:43,170
Speaker 1: You got to have a bunch of tactical options, but not so many tactical options that you start overlapping other classes.

709
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,450
Speaker 0: Yes, you look at something like fortress forever right and they pretty much gave grenades to everybody.

710
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gave.

711
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,110
Speaker 0: everyone has piles of grenades.

712
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,097
Speaker 1: Everyone has a normal grenade in a special grenade.

713
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,710
Speaker 1: now the special grenade is fine because I think that adds a lot to the game.

714
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:56,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like ooh.

715
00:48:56,581 --> 00:49:10,075
Speaker 0: I'm the engineer I have a special like engineer grenade that does something special that Everyone also had just a normal grenade and that what that does is it sort of removes the differentiation between the classes because now Everyone can make things explode.

716
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:15,089
Speaker 0: so normally for in team fortress 2 if you're let's say an engineer you build a turret.

717
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:19,690
Speaker 0: well Normally someone needs a grenade to you know to blow up that turret or to really screw with you.

718
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:26,430
Speaker 0: So they call in the demo man or maybe the soldier with his rockets But like a scout really can't take you out cuz you have turret there.

719
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,388
Speaker 0: What's he gonna do about it?

720
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,020
Speaker 0: But in fortress forever the scout can just throw a grenade over there.

721
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:33,770
Speaker 0: cuz everyone has grenades another engineer can just throw a grenade over.

722
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, granted fortress forever is a really shitty game.

723
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:37,610
Speaker 0: It is really shitty, but that's what I'm trying to.

724
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,089
Speaker 0: I'm comparing the good and the shit.

725
00:49:39,236 --> 00:49:52,293
Speaker 0: Yeah Is is that giving everyone grenades removes the differentiation between the classes so that there's no reason to pick one over the other Whereas team fortress 2 has super differentiation, which is good But they've also.

726
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:58,010
Speaker 0: the classes are so narrow in their purpose that you have to keep changing them to do anything different at all.

727
00:49:58,493 --> 00:50:13,167
Speaker 1: So the end result is that the game is fun But it definitely has a lot left to be desired and I hope they change a lot of things because in the end All right The characters all move really really slowly and as a result FPS skills don't actually matter that much.

728
00:50:13,629 --> 00:50:23,357
Speaker 1: in addition You don't have any options with classes other than the basic weapon and as a result, you don't have any strategies except the absolutely basic obvious ones.

729
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:33,105
Speaker 1: and the end result of all of that is that the game just ends up being Lines of people kind of throwing is themselves at each other and there's no interesting duels.

730
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,930
Speaker 1: There's no interesting rocket fights.

731
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:36,650
Speaker 1: It's all really kind of milk toes.

732
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:44,810
Speaker 0: I think all you know It'll end up being if you know The game will boil down to where people execute the same really simple strategies over and over again.

733
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:47,190
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of who can execute them faster and better.

734
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:53,331
Speaker 1: I mean the argument for old games because a lot of this kind of thing would happen in pubs and even other team fortress kind Of games.

735
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:57,005
Speaker 1: the argument was yeah, but skilled players, you know, they play a real game.

736
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:58,090
Speaker 1: They use actual strategies.

737
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:05,250
Speaker 1: Even if I had full control over everyone on my team, there's no interesting strategy worth a dick so far.

738
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least that I can tell.

739
00:51:06,436 --> 00:51:14,690
Speaker 0: I mean there isn't because the only strategies I mean They kind of even tell you like you use these classes for the offense use these for defense use these first support.

740
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:19,876
Speaker 0: You know, it's kind of like alright and you do that And that's pretty much the best you can do.

741
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:35,110
Speaker 0: have your engineers and your heavies and you know stuff and stay around your base Defending with your medics on your heavies and then you know Maybe an engineer goes and does the teleporter thing so you can get to the enemy base Then rush in with like the scouts and the pyros and the soldiers to go and try and get the flag.

742
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:36,073
Speaker 1: There's just.

743
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:40,630
Speaker 1: the game like I said before is barely an FPS and it's barely a team fortress game.

744
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,320
Speaker 1: It has everything going for it.

745
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,627
Speaker 1: It's just it's not there yet.

746
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:44,834
Speaker 1: Nope It needs to.

747
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:51,403
Speaker 1: I seriously think all they need to do is give every single class One more thing that is unique to that class.

748
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:56,690
Speaker 0: and well, maybe not the engineer The engineer has because he has the teleporters and the turrets and the shotgun.

749
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,132
Speaker 0: I think that's.

750
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,561
Speaker 0: I think the engineer has enough but I don't.

751
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,050
Speaker 0: every other class every other class needs something else.

752
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:09,255
Speaker 0: You know spy I think is okay, too But everything else needs to be and a spy is actually like the most well done spy ever I must got.

753
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:10,850
Speaker 1: the spy is like super awesome.

754
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:15,965
Speaker 1: It's better than any spy in any team fortress game ever like for example, the the the sniper, right?

755
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:17,870
Speaker 0: He's awesome at long range, right?

756
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,054
Speaker 0: That's his that's his strength.

757
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:20,580
Speaker 0: So he has the sniper rifle.

758
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:26,570
Speaker 0: Give him another long-range weapon Maybe like I don't know a fire a crossbow or something, right?

759
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:35,336
Speaker 0: You know some other sort of maybe like a rapid-fire long-range weapon of some sort or like a railgun or a laser Painter or something.

760
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:47,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, give him something that you know doesn't make him, you know Like every other class that doesn't even the tables and say oh I might as well be a snipe because the sniper still has to Be super weak at close range and super strong at long range.

761
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:52,287
Speaker 0: Just give him something else to do even like a shot like a special little shot.

762
00:52:52,307 --> 00:53:01,510
Speaker 1: That's like the sniper You don't have as many bullets with it But you shoot it and it goes out and when it hits a wall or something It has a little bit of shrapnel that goes to the sides get people around corners a little bit.

763
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:05,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, something something like that anything just I can't think of anything specifically.

764
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,533
Speaker 0: That would be real.

765
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:12,930
Speaker 1: or like the murder the long-range attack the marine guy Just give him another kind of rocket like maybe a laser-guided and a normal.

766
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, give him like.

767
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:23,668
Speaker 0: you could also give the marine guy like, you know some sort of like shorter range Because the you know, the Rockets are good at long and short range, you know.

768
00:53:24,573 --> 00:53:27,610
Speaker 1: Also make the Rockets faster because the Rockets are really slow.

769
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:34,755
Speaker 1: I think the whole games too slow and I think that is the game's biggest failing that the characters move way too slow The guns move way too slow.

770
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:39,050
Speaker 1: The gameplay is way too slow and it removes a lot of the skill from the equation.

771
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:45,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz now if you have super slow reaction times, you can beat the people with really fast reaction times.

772
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,088
Speaker 0: That's sort of the main thing in an FPS.

773
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:48,093
Speaker 0: I mean like.

774
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:51,768
Speaker 0: I could probably kill fatality in this game, even though his reaction time is like 10,000 times now.

775
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:58,070
Speaker 1: You might say all rim and Scott you're just being overly critical of a not super complicated game and one this game is great.

776
00:53:58,111 --> 00:53:58,950
Speaker 0: Well, well, well perfect.

777
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:07,361
Speaker 1: well No What I'm saying is that there's evidence that everything we've said is true in that from what I've seen Most games end in a stalemate.

778
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:12,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they go to sudden death and they Death I gotta say is actually really cool.

779
00:54:13,092 --> 00:54:15,761
Speaker 1: It depends because the sudden death still has a time limit it does.

780
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:18,350
Speaker 1: if that expires then oh everybody loses play again.

781
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:24,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that the sudden death that the sudden death is a cool idea because what they do is they say Alright, this game has gone on long enough.

782
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,370
Speaker 0: We don't want to sit here for hours and hours.

783
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:28,570
Speaker 0: Just you know playing and doing no one's getting anywhere.

784
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:30,696
Speaker 0: We're gonna say no one can respawn.

785
00:54:30,756 --> 00:54:32,782
Speaker 0: now everyone respawns at the beginning of the map.

786
00:54:32,863 --> 00:54:36,233
Speaker 0: Everything's reset and if you die You're dead now.

787
00:54:36,293 --> 00:54:38,762
Speaker 0: It's like counter-strike right and then we'll see who wins.

788
00:54:39,304 --> 00:54:41,030
Speaker 0: so that's pretty cool.

789
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:55,065
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't really work because the the real strategy there then is don't die No Super camp your base as a group and defend and hope the other team stupid enough to attack because that way Worst case scenario it ends in a draw best case scenario.

790
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:56,170
Speaker 1: They attack you and die.

791
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,168
Speaker 0: The other thing is I think there shouldn't be a time limit on the sudden death.

792
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:04,108
Speaker 1: No, because then then both teams just camp until one team gets sick of it and dies.

793
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:11,460
Speaker 0: maybe The other thing about the sudden death is that if you die early in the sudden death, you know Let's say you you're gonna be brave.

794
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,990
Speaker 0: You're gonna go be like the sniper and sudden.

795
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:19,180
Speaker 0: That's probably why they have the timer in it - yeah you Die right away and now you have to sit there and wait.

796
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:23,093
Speaker 0: now waiting and counter-strike isn't so bad because around a counter-strike Lasts at most.

797
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:26,529
Speaker 0: what five minutes waiting in the sudden death can really suck.

798
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,445
Speaker 1: It only lasts like a couple minutes.

799
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:30,230
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal.

800
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:34,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still kind of bled to sit there and I mean in counter-strike.

801
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:38,670
Speaker 0: you expect that when you die You're dead and then another round will start soon in team fortress.

802
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:44,250
Speaker 0: So you've been you've been respawning the whole game and now suddenly you're sitting there not doing anything and it's pretty boring and annoying.

803
00:55:44,652 --> 00:56:00,470
Speaker 1: I just feel like without some fundamental changes to gameplay The game has a very very very low skill camp and everyone who has any Talent or skill or practices at all is going to maximize their skill in relatively short order.

804
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,981
Speaker 1: In fact, I think they're already optimal players at this game.

805
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:03,925
Speaker 0: I think there are two.

806
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:05,030
Speaker 0: there was a guy named scruffy.

807
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:09,937
Speaker 0: He was just he was the soldier and he was owning everybody and I think he figured it out And there's not much to figure out.

808
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:10,319
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.

809
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:18,411
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I Mean, the only reason I'm not disappointed is because it's a beta and I'm sure they're gonna make a lot of changes before the game Actually comes out.

810
