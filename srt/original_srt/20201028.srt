1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,332
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday October 28th 2020.

2
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:12,774
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,923
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:16,786
Speaker 0: We are reviewing.

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,190
Speaker 0: the comic is Sola.

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,788
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:26,749
Speaker 0: So, uh, I actually went and voted yesterday, you know, they went out to actually do the early voting in person.

8
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:34,827
Speaker 0: mostly I voted in person because You're outdoors like 99% of the time and considering all the trouble with mail-in ballots.

9
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:45,110
Speaker 0: I didn't want to risk Anything about my vote being counted and I wanted I think I said this during the results They're gonna release almost immediately after the polls close.

10
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:55,409
Speaker 1: I think I said this before but you know My mail-in ballot was already confirmed received because I mailed it so long ago, but I may just go vote in person Which is a thing you can legally do in New York.

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:06,789
Speaker 1: Yeah Even if you've sent in a mail-in ballot and what's supposed to happen is when they receive Your when they go to open the mail-in ballots, they'll see that I voted in person and throw it out And if for some reason they make a mistake

12
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:08,872
Speaker 0: It's

13
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:09,394
Speaker 1: not a very.

14
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:12,966
Speaker 1: if I have there's a non-zero chance that I can legally vote twice.

15
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:13,990
Speaker 1: Why would I not do that?

16
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:23,230
Speaker 0: It is amazing how different this is in every state Which is like just one of those things is wrong with America and people who didn't grow up.

17
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,665
Speaker 1: It's wrong with America, but it does provide a unique defense against election interference.

18
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,634
Speaker 1: That is true when we are facing Yep, like.

19
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:44,784
Speaker 0: it'd be really hard to hack the American election because every state is so radically different that like There's a centralized well-designed voting system, you could just attack it directly.

20
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,429
Speaker 1: the surface area is one thing.

21
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,075
Speaker 1: now The surface area is okay.

22
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:53,024
Speaker 1: You have to attack two hundred and something electoral votes worth of systems Yep.

23
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,524
Speaker 0: But also in terms of like our voting the biggest problem in America right now.

24
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:12,150
Speaker 0: for those of you who might be outside of this nightmare late capitalist hellscape or at least adjacent to the late capitalist hellscape It's a global hellscape, but our election one of the problems we face Is that a lot of states if you vote by mail?

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,650
Speaker 0: They're not even legally allowed to open those envelopes until the morning of the day of the election.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,121
Speaker 0: They can't even get a head start on counting them like.

27
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,630
Speaker 0: nonsense like that is a problem in America.

28
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:32,663
Speaker 0: So anyway, we went to vote and the amazing thing was we tried to vote on Sunday When it opened and there was like a four-hour line.

29
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,225
Speaker 0: So we bailed.

30
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:40,330
Speaker 0: we went yesterday Like near the end of the day, but before people actually got off work to try to early vote like in the evening.

31
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:45,844
Speaker 0: But while people might still be busy and there was a huge line But it was actually only about a two-hour wait.

32
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:46,689
Speaker 0: So we stayed in it.

33
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:53,350
Speaker 0: I have never in my life encountered a line that was longer than like ten minutes to vote until this.

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,379
Speaker 1: You know, we know we know what the factors are, right?

35
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:58,030
Speaker 1: So one is obviously more enthusiasm.

36
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:05,150
Speaker 1: Factor two is the early voting in New York has one-tenth of the locations of this is the regular voting.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,797
Speaker 1: Yeah on Tuesday Election Day.

38
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,729
Speaker 1: There are gonna be ten times as many places to go vote, right?

39
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:20,510
Speaker 1: Problem three which you just described to me is that when you go to vote when they're at on Election Day You're going to a specific place that knows who's coming.

40
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,858
Speaker 1: Yeah And they have the ballots ready.

41
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:30,430
Speaker 1: because for that location when you go to early vote They're dealing with such a wider geographic area and different possible ballots.

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, and since they don't know who's coming they're printing the ballots on demand.

43
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,377
Speaker 1: So you have to go up to them and say mom in district X would number whatever and then they print a ballot appropriate for where you live

44
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:49,250
Speaker 0: and that's a problem especially in New York City because Like do you know how many congressional districts are within like a short walk of my apartment?

45
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can walk, you know, most people I think in the United States, right?

46
00:03:55,915 --> 00:04:04,797
Speaker 1: to walk to a place represented by a different member of the federal House of Representatives would be Extremely arduous.

47
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,547
Speaker 0: some states just have one like.

48
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:12,670
Speaker 1: yeah I can take a subway and go through like a whole pile of them.

49
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:13,498
Speaker 0: In fact, I did.

50
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,938
Speaker 0: I did this one time I was I took one of my Strava rides and I looked to see how many Congressional representatives I passed through.

51
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,570
Speaker 0: it was four different congressional districts on that bike ride.

52
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:31,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I might commute this like at least three or four Some significant number right?

53
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,510
Speaker 1: It might even be more than that.

54
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the Maloney district actually goes across into part of Manhattan and part of Midtown.

55
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:40,732
Speaker 0: I'm actually still in that district longer than you might expect Mm-hmm.

56
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,278
Speaker 0: But yeah, so we go.

57
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:43,342
Speaker 0: we wait two hours.

58
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,130
Speaker 0: There's a long long crowd line.

59
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:52,283
Speaker 0: I'm confident based on who is in that line that 99.9% of the people are correctly voting for Joe Biden.

60
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,910
Speaker 0: like there were not some people in that line.

61
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,550
Speaker 0: There's only one part of the year.

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,230
Speaker 0: well two parts of New York City that vote for Republicans one of those parts of Staten Island which fuck them and the other part is like this one neighborhood in Brooklyn.

63
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,502
Speaker 0: It's the only one.

64
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,330
Speaker 0: it's kind of amazing.

65
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:08,494
Speaker 0: But I go in.

66
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,100
Speaker 0: Emily gets a ballot goes to vote.

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,950
Speaker 0: because they're in New York each ballot is serialized.

68
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:21,060
Speaker 0: So they have the list of like the number of people who voted and they can serialize that to the number of ballots that were Handed out and then scanned.

69
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,010
Speaker 0: that's one of those like checks on the system.

70
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,830
Speaker 0: Like if those numbers mismatch, they need to do a manual count of the ballots themselves and figure out what happened.

71
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:35,379
Speaker 0: So I take my ballot that came out of this machine and I go over vote and I fill out the first part of it And then I flip it over because there's a second side.

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,889
Speaker 1: second side is to blame this side, too.

73
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,298
Speaker 0: So I go over a voting person there.

74
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:46,278
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, my ballots broken and she's like, oh shit She says she literally goes.

75
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:46,720
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

76
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,410
Speaker 0: So because now this cause it is no shit how much paperwork they had to fill out because of this.

77
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,363
Speaker 0: Yes, right the ballot that I had from the record and someone's worried about.

78
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,499
Speaker 1: people are worried about so-called voting fraud Right.

79
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:11,689
Speaker 1: It's like You gotta get past some old lady who's working the polling station in Queens Probably been doing it for like all this paperwork to get one vote past them.

80
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:14,908
Speaker 1: It's it's really not easy.

81
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:20,370
Speaker 0: Okay, so what's your guess on how many people I do officially interact with to get a new ballot?

82
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:32,230
Speaker 1: Mean when I go to polling stations in the city, there's usually only Like there'll be two people at the table of find your district because you don't know it for some reason.

83
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,180
Speaker 1: Then there's two people at the table of here's your ballot.

84
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, then there's always one person at the provisional ballot Like I need to sign an affidavit.

85
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:47,252
Speaker 1: Then there's the person who's help you while you're voting person and that is the help you with the scanner and give you a sticker Person.

86
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:47,995
Speaker 1: yeah, right.

87
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,107
Speaker 1: So I mean maybe two or three five.

88
00:06:52,131 --> 00:07:06,948
Speaker 0: I interacted by five people who each person had to take me to another person so I could explain what happened to me to both of them and then the second person would take it from there and go over to another person who had a different function.

89
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:27,409
Speaker 0: and Eventually, we got to the person who's responsible for the machine that prints the ballots Which is in this big lockbox and that person had to key a whole bunch of information into a tiny keypad On the outside of this box to make the machine print another ballot for me And then he had to take my fucked-up ballot and do a bunch of stuff with it somewhere.

90
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,638
Speaker 0: All right, and it'll work.

91
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:35,684
Speaker 1: sure it doesn't get used because you know It's legal to say fill out the front half and just abstain on the back half.

92
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:37,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was no ban.

93
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:41,570
Speaker 1: Yes, someone could have scanned that ballot and you know double-voted or whatever.

94
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:53,285
Speaker 0: Yep, so I voted for Joe Biden under the working parties family line because working families party line because New York is weird Yep, and otherwise straight Democrats because they're the only party interested in governing.

95
00:07:53,626 --> 00:08:00,682
Speaker 0: So I urge you If you have not voted yet, and you're an American Do what you need to do.

96
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:01,347
Speaker 0: go do it.

97
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:05,630
Speaker 1: If you have to skip, you know work and make some sacrifice somewhere.

98
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,005
Speaker 1: But if you're legally allowed to do it do it.

99
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:17,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know me I won't stand in line at a Starbucks if there's more than one person in front of me But I stood in that two fucking hour line to vote in a state that literally doesn't matter Because

100
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:21,250
Speaker 1: I still think you could have waited until on Tuesday.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:31,101
Speaker 1: I think the lines will be way shorter because even though enthusiasm is high still and that will definitely Increase enthusiastic people are more likely to vote early.

102
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:33,970
Speaker 1: right people had all this opportunity to vote early.

103
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:42,760
Speaker 1: So those people aren't showing up Tuesday and there's gonna be ten times as many locations to go to and those locations Won't have to print ballots on demand.

104
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,490
Speaker 1: They'll just have stacks of them right up for you.

105
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:53,610
Speaker 0: Honestly, my reason was one if anything happens like let's say I get hit by a bus before Election Day I still want voted before I get hit by that bus because that the stakes are that high.

106
00:08:54,751 --> 00:09:02,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of people are posting on Twitter like, you know, pretty much, you know every possible inspirational story of someone voting Despite hardship.

107
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,921
Speaker 1: I've seen hundred-year-old person vote.

108
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:13,597
Speaker 1: I've seen I've seen dude with terminal illness Fusion voting right?

109
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:21,001
Speaker 1: It's like for you know, it's like someone like, you know Like in the worst possible shape right going out of their way to vote.

110
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:28,688
Speaker 1: and the idea is if that person can vote And you're listening to this You Can do you can do it?

111
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:29,872
Speaker 1: You're not?

114
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:46,976
Speaker 0: You can have someone drop an iPad into your coffin at that point If you have a cancer.

115
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:51,050
Speaker 1: that's in a late stage, I'm so sorry for you, but why are you wait?

Speaker 0: It's from Carmen.

141
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,090
Speaker 1: That's right.

142
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,938
Speaker 0: So that's enormous from turn of dot.

143
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:15,390
Speaker 0: I was literally playing the trumpet solo in this and Dorma last night.

144
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,670
Speaker 0: My mind anyway, all right.

145
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,730
Speaker 1: So anyway, so I also because we're in posted that I also learned the name of the song wasn't the name?

146
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,554
Speaker 1: I thought it was right and then I saw I'm like, you know I know that song.

147
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,121
Speaker 1: everyone knows that fucking song right.

148
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,587
Speaker 1: and I said what's it from?

149
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:32,370
Speaker 1: and I googled I'm like.

150
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,976
Speaker 1: Oh, it's from Carmen Carmen is.

151
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,763
Speaker 1: I know the name of an opera.

152
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, have I seen Carmen?

153
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,254
Speaker 1: No, have I?

154
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,379
Speaker 1: do I know the story of it?

155
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:43,030
Speaker 1: Yes, cuz I read it on Wikipedia today, right?

156
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:47,025
Speaker 1: I just knew it was a famous opera and I knew that that song was in it.

157
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:58,388
Speaker 1: and I said, you know I'm willing to bet this famous opera that I have never seen nor listened to probably contains other famous songs that I already know.

158
00:11:59,671 --> 00:11:59,972
Speaker 1: It's like.

159
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:03,563
Speaker 1: it's like a guarantee pretty much right but it's like I know.

160
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,730
Speaker 1: I'm basically sitting there thinking I guarantee.

161
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,780
Speaker 1: There are songs on the Carmen soundtrack right that I already know.

162
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,240
Speaker 1: 100% chance at least one or two, right?

163
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,466
Speaker 1: But which songs are they?

164
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,710
Speaker 1: what it's like?

165
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,033
Speaker 1: there's so many songs.

166
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,379
Speaker 1: It could be which ones is it?

167
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:21,981
Speaker 1: Right.

168
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:28,243
Speaker 1: Let me go to Spotify and double-click on Carmen and find out right I The.

169
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:31,940
Speaker 1: what is the first thing I hear within the literal first note?

170
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:33,687
Speaker 1: Do you do you know Carmen?

171
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:34,170
Speaker 1: Have you seen it?

172
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,058
Speaker 0: Because I haven't I have not actually seen it.

173
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:55,417
Speaker 1: The literal first song of Carmen is And I'm like, oh my god, I didn't even have to get to track fucking - Most of the opera scene are either terrible long-winded Wagner that I never want to see again or like Rossini stuff.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,179
Speaker 1: So the story of Carmen at least based on the cliff note summary doesn't seem very interesting.

175
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:01,782
Speaker 0: You know what?

176
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:02,246
Speaker 0: I can tell you.

177
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:09,580
Speaker 0: my advice on opera is very simple Never choose which opera to see if you haven't seen a lot of opera based on what plot sounds good.

178
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,472
Speaker 0: Choose the opera based on the songs you like.

179
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 0: that might be in that opera.

180
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:21,318
Speaker 1: Have the dumbest plots Yeah, so Carmen I kept listening and it was mostly just.

181
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,044
Speaker 1: you know Opera sounds right.

182
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:26,534
Speaker 1: and then another song comes and I'm like, oh, here's the second one.

183
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:27,898
Speaker 1: Do you know which one it was?

184
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:37,592
Speaker 1: No Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

185
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,699
Speaker 1: and then you know the big one right did it.

186
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,774
Speaker 1: That's also fucking Carmen.

187
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:52,407
Speaker 0: So if The Metropolitan Opera somehow survives which I imagine it will we were literally you and I planning to go on a double date to the Opera right after I was like.

188
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,115
Speaker 1: I was like I will go to an opera.

189
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:55,260
Speaker 1: It's been so many years.

190
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,486
Speaker 1: Which one will I go to?

191
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,756
Speaker 1: Well Carmen moved itself up on the fucking list.

192
00:13:58,876 --> 00:13:59,620
Speaker 0: I was hoping for.

193
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:02,515
Speaker 0: I've never seen Carmen so I'd be happy to go.

194
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:09,520
Speaker 1: so obviously And if the rich people prop up the opera enough, right, I feel like the opera ain't gonna go bankrupt.

195
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,465
Speaker 1: I don't think so either.

196
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,838
Speaker 1: If you have a Spotify or an Apple Music or whatever, go type in

197
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:15,260
Speaker 1: "Carmen.".

198
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:19,832
Speaker 1: I didn't even finish this, I didn't even get past the second path here.

199
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,600
Speaker 1: There may be surprises that await here.

200
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:28,700
Speaker 1: Something else I learned is, you know who wrote "Carmen," the opera, composer, whatever?

201
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,174
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, so what are you learning?

202
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:33,239
Speaker 0: I'm actually pulling up some Wikipedias.

203
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are.

204
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,720
Speaker 1: It's Georges Bizet, right?

205
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bizet.

206
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,821
Speaker 1: Bizet.

207
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:51,412
Speaker 1: Apparently, the interesting thing that I read is that this person who made this ridiculously famous opera, uh, like, died after, like, the whatever performance of it.

208
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,820
Speaker 1: Um, and then it became famous afterwards.

209
00:14:56,761 --> 00:15:00,240
Speaker 0: That seems like it's not uncommon just in media in general.

210
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,388
Speaker 1: But, like, it didn't get performed that many times.

211
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,572
Speaker 1: Like, it wasn't a hit yet.

212
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,700
Speaker 1: And then they died, and then it became tremendous.

213
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,579
Speaker 0: I mean, Rocky Horror Picture Show was not really a hit when it came out.

214
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:11,080
Speaker 1: It's still not a hit, really.

215
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,300
Speaker 0: It's a cult classic.

216
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:24,230
Speaker 1: That's, yeah, I mean, it's basically people who care about movies have seen it, but in terms of, like, actual number of people who've actually seen it and know it, it's like people may know the name Rocky Horror Picture Show.

217
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that name.

218
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:27,420
Speaker 1: That's the way I knew Carmen yesterday.

219
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,583
Speaker 1: I know that's the name of an opera.

220
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,471
Speaker 1: I know that's the name of a thing, right?

221
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,195
Speaker 1: A movie or something.

222
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,340
Speaker 1: But they don't know it, know it, right?

223
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:40,600
Speaker 1: And they probably know the time warp and don't know what it's from or that it's even from a thing.

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,527
Speaker 0: You know, because I was thinking about the William Tell Overture.

225
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,239
Speaker 0: Most people only know that from, like, TV shows it was in.

226
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,763
Speaker 0: Or, like, the Tori Adar song.

227
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:55,999
Speaker 0: That song, most people, if you look it up on YouTube, almost all the comments are Five Nights at Freddy's kids being like, "Hey, it's the Five Nights at Freddy's

228
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,340
Speaker 0: song!".

229
00:15:56,761 --> 00:16:02,079
Speaker 0: And one old man is like, "No, it's the song that Martin Prince sings when he's in a cage in that episode of The

230
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,460
Speaker 0: Simpsons.".

231
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:18,555
Speaker 0: So, there's actually a lot of anime news, like, a ton of it, and most of it is around the fact that Netflix had an infinite number of announcements related to anime and animation recently.

232
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,840
Speaker 0: We're not even going to be able to cover all of these.

233
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,320
Speaker 1: Netflix just did all kinds of anime biz, and they did all the press releases for all their anime biz all at once in a big blomp.

234
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,899
Speaker 1: So, the biggest one.

235
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,072
Speaker 1: "Oh, you want some anime Netflix news?

236
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:29,376
Speaker 1: Here you

237
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:29,558
Speaker 1: go!".

238
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Speaker 0: And this is already during, like, this platinum age of animation where I'm watching, like, there is so much good animation out there, and a ton of it is on Netflix.

239
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,984
Speaker 0: I'm just watching it there.

240
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:48,440
Speaker 0: But the one you all probably care the most about, the one that's getting the most buzz, at least in my circles, is, uh, there's a manga, The Way of the House Husband.

241
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:53,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, I, when I first saw this news, I was slightly confused.

242
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,917
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Have we judged this poorly?

243
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:56,759
Speaker 1: Why are people

244
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:57,220
Speaker 1: excited?".

245
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,268
Speaker 1: Because the one that we judged, obviously, was not this one, right?

246
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:07,020
Speaker 1: We judged an anime, because, obviously, this is not an anime yet, right?

247
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,003
Speaker 1: So, it couldn't have been.

248
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,933
Speaker 1: I was like, that's why I was confused, right?

249
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,579
Speaker 1: I was like, "Because we're only judging anime.

250
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,872
Speaker 1: There's no way I could judge an anime that exists.

251
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:14,756
Speaker 1: Are they remaking it?

252
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,117
Speaker 1: I don't know,

253
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:15,239
Speaker 1: right?".

254
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:26,579
Speaker 1: But the one we judged is the questionable, not good one, where the Yakuza boss forces some Yakuza to get, uh, sex change operations and become idols.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not the- that is not the-.

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,342
Speaker 1: That is not this.

257
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:43,379
Speaker 1: This is the one where you see people posting online on Twitter, right, the JPEG of the single page of the manga, where there are two Yakuza complimenting each other's dogs and then wanting to pet them.

258
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,930
Speaker 0: Like, "Alright, your dog is so cute.

259
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:47,979
Speaker 0: Can I pet

260
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,120
Speaker 0: him?".

261
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's this one.

262
00:17:50,764 --> 00:17:57,580
Speaker 1: This is gonna be way good, uh, and it definitely, like, an anime adaptation of that, how can that be bad?

263
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like it's gonna be really fun.

264
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:14,140
Speaker 0: I like it- anytime that trope of, like, a monster or something dangerous ends up in a very, like, simple domestic normal role, is just- that's almost- that's a trope that I just really like, and this seems like it's going to be a good show.

265
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,980
Speaker 0: Netflix rarely seems to pick up stuff that's not good in this regard.

266
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,269
Speaker 1: And they also do a good job of it, right?

267
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:31,220
Speaker 0: They're not gonna do, like, a, you know- Yeah, it won't be- it won't be the, uh, those 90s OAVs, like the Sanctuary OAV that we will never speak of again and never watch again.

268
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

269
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:37,996
Speaker 1: So, also, they announced the, you know, last- what, was it the last Wednesday episode?

270
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,400
Speaker 1: We talked about Olympic whatever?

271
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,099
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Olympic, uh, Kiklos.

272
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:51,380
Speaker 1: Right, well, the- and we mentioned how the person who made the original manga of that was more famous for making, uh, Thermae Romae, however you pronounce it, I don't know.

273
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,419
Speaker 0: Thermae Romae works.

274
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,921
Speaker 0: And guess what?

275
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,709
Speaker 1: Netflix is making the anime of Thermae Romae.

276
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:58,858
Speaker 1: It's like, "Well, I guess I'll watch that instead of reading the manga.

277
00:18:58,898 --> 00:18:59,179
Speaker 1: Thanks a

278
00:18:59,239 --> 00:18:59,399
Speaker 1: lot.".

279
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,918
Speaker 0: Yep, especially considering how good Kiklos is.

280
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, this will probably be a huge, you know, probably even better, right?

281
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,400
Speaker 1: 'Cause the Kiklos one is obviously a low-budget situation.

282
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:17,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the low-budget, I think, is enhancing how good it is for reasons that- Yes, but I think Thermae Romae is a little- is a little less ridiculous, um, even though it bears some similarities.

283
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,930
Speaker 0: So- So, trucking right along from that, there's a- kind of a bigger underpinning to these announcements.

284
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:35,290
Speaker 0: This is from about a week ago, but, uh, part of what's going on is that Netflix actually announced direct partnerships with Nas, Science Saru, Mappa, and Studio Mir.

285
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,835
Speaker 0: And this is on the heels of announcing their partnerships with Production

286
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:39,596
Speaker 0: I.G.,

287
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,480
Speaker 0: which includes Bone- oh, and Bones.

288
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:53,220
Speaker 0: Uh, Netflix is kind of just taking over the Western anime market, and they're also making huge inroads into the actual anime production industry in Japan.

289
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:59,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically rather than the old model of "Japan makes anime,".

290
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:10,520
Speaker 1: and then the Western funimations, you know, whatever, all those companies that went out of business, the genieons, whatever, pioneers, going and licensing those shows for release.

291
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:40,000
Speaker 1: Instead, we have, basically, the digital distributors, right, just sitting on the companies, being like, "Alright, we got a partnership now, uh, you know, maybe we'll have some input on what you're making, right, it'll go both ways, but, you know, you make it, and it's ours already, right, we're in it from the start, before you even made the show, we're not licensing it after you made it or anything, we're gonna make the show together, and you show it in Japan how you're gonna show it, and we're gonna show it on Netflix over

292
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,140
Speaker 1: here.".

293
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,106
Speaker 1: Right, maybe Japan Netflix, I don't know, with their TV in Japan, whatever, but,

294
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,068
Speaker 0: uh,

295
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:56,300
Speaker 1: there's no opportunity for a Crunchyroll to get in there, there's not gonna be, like, negotiations or bids for licenses, um, who knows if they'll even

296
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,140
Speaker 0: be- I don't think this bodes well for Funimation or for Crunchyroll in the long run, to be honest.

297
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:11,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how it bodes for, like, you know, um, will the licenses ever expire, 'cause is it even a license, right, they just have it forever, it's like, it's a Netflix show forever, the end, right?

298
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:20,620
Speaker 1: Um, will anyone get to put out DVDs and boures if they want, you know, what's, is there a merch situation, right, is Netflix gonna come to the anime cons?

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,402
Speaker 0: And it was interesting, I was thinking about.

300
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:38,180
Speaker 0: where am I watching, like, animation, not even just anime, but animation in general, and honestly, like, 70% of all the animation I'm watching lately, like, in the last six months, is on Netflix, and then, like, 10% Crunchyroll, 10% everything else combined.

301
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,305
Speaker 1: Yep.

302
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:51,156
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the show, the one show, I want a Geek Bite right now, a show that is not on any of those pla- the show is actually, like, on Funimation's platform, I think.

303
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,360
Speaker 0: We ended up watching it.

304
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,120
Speaker 1: You gotta, uh, uh, here's some problems over there.

305
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,076
Speaker 0: That little cough coming in.

306
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,680
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, you weren't standing next to some no mask maskless people in the voting line.

307
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:07,799
Speaker 0: One, thankfully, living in New York, 100% of the people in that line were, like, mega masked up.

308
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:08,979
Speaker 1: Of course.

309
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:19,260
Speaker 0: 'Cause they won't let you in, like, you know, you see those videos in other states where, like, there's people without masks all over, like, inside of- that really does not happen in New York City, except maybe in Staten Island.

310
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,019
Speaker 1: I mean, I see people who might not wear the mask, like, when they're walking down the sidewalk alone or with someone.

311
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,160
Speaker 0: But you see them, like, pull it up as soon as someone else appears on the street.

312
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:39,038
Speaker 1: Right, but, like, if anyone is going into a place or with a person or whatever, right, or going to a building or any, you know, then no one is not wearing, you know.

313
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:45,700
Speaker 0: But, uh, when we judged anime, one of the animes we judged was a show called Deca Dense.

314
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:55,699
Speaker 0: And it looked like a generic fighting show, like, it might be fun, maybe it's, like, I don't know, Attack on Titan, but we basically- Didn't we talk about this a little bit last week, too?

315
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:56,599
Speaker 0: Yes, we did.

316
00:22:56,981 --> 00:23:02,140
Speaker 0: So, I've actually seen some of it now, because basically what happened was, I was gonna ignore that show unless there was some buzz.

317
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,999
Speaker 0: There was some buzz, there was a lot of buzz.

318
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,140
Speaker 1: I heard the buzz as well, buzz buzz.

319
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,059
Speaker 0: Literally, yeah, I'm a busy little bee.

320
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,220
Speaker 0: Literally everyone who said anything about this show said the same thing.

321
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,137
Speaker 0: It's not what it looks like, just watch it.

322
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,279
Speaker 0: Two episodes in, you'll see why.

323
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,980
Speaker 0: And no one would- no one would spoil anything else about it.

324
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Speaker 0: So I went, and we- turns out we accidentally have a Hulu account.

325
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:30,880
Speaker 0: So we watched two episodes on Hulu, and sure enough, it starts out, it's good.

326
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,260
Speaker 0: Without the twist, like, if there was nothing special about this show, it actually started out pretty good.

327
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,580
Speaker 0: Like, it was a pretty solid anime, actually better than I expected.

328
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,920
Speaker 0: But the very end of episode one, they show a weird scene, and then the episode ends.

329
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,740
Speaker 0: And all I can think is, wait, that was a weird scene, explain that.

330
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:54,154
Speaker 0: Then I watched episode two, and by the end of episode two, what that scene is is explained.

331
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Speaker 0: And the show is not even close to what I thought it was about.

332
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,918
Speaker 0: The show is- you gotta watch it.

333
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:05,800
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say.

334
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,018
Speaker 0: Decadence is a show that needs to be watched.

335
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,340
Speaker 1: Maybe I gotta pirate it, I don't know, 'cause I don't have no Hulu, and I'm not gonna switch my Netflix for Hulu anytime soon.

336
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Speaker 0: Yep, you could- I don't know, we'll figure out a way for you to watch it.

337
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,360
Speaker 0: I've only seen two episodes, but I am deeply intrigued.

338
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,569
Speaker 0: Like, the best way I can describe this is, I'm watching that first episode, and I'm thinking, "Oh, wait, is this an Evangelion?

339
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,100
Speaker 0: Or is this gonna be more like an Attack on Titan?

340
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,259
Speaker 0: Like, which direction is this conflict gonna

341
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:31,400
Speaker 0: go?".

342
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,280
Speaker 1: I can just watch Evangelion, I can watch that anytime.

343
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,970
Speaker 0: But then it went Mad Max?

344
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:37,600
Speaker 0: For a brief moment.

345
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,609
Speaker 0: I was like, "Oh, Mad Max?

346
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,900
Speaker 0: That is an interesting play, let's see.

347
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,457
Speaker 0: Like, that's an interesting strategy, let's see how it turns

348
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:44,719
Speaker 0: out.".

349
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:47,319
Speaker 0: And then, it goes off the deep end.

350
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:48,540
Speaker 1: Alright.

351
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:53,320
Speaker 0: I think it is particularly, specifically, up your alley, personally.

352
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe.

353
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,840
Speaker 0: Based on what that scene looks like, the style that scene is in, this show is a Scott show, in particular.

354
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,219
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we'll see.

355
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:10,000
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, I have this laundry list- Maybe I should wait till it's 100% out, though, before I start watching it.

356
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,839
Speaker 0: I think it is already out, I think, uh, people have seen it to the end.

357
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:13,812
Speaker 1: The whole show?

358
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:14,380
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, alright.

359
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:18,680
Speaker 0: So, beyond that, other Netflix stuff, like, we're just gonna breeze over these.

360
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,220
Speaker 0: There's a Gorillaz animated movie coming on Netflix.

361
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:27,519
Speaker 0: There's the Pacific Rim anime that Netflix, I believe, is funding straight up.

362
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:37,440
Speaker 0: There is Blue-Eyed Samurai, which is an animated action series with a bunch of famous people I don't really know, and a bunch of famous people I do know are all involved in it.

363
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,579
Speaker 0: This is, like, the all-star cast animated show.

364
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,416
Speaker 0: George Takei is even in it.

365
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:43,394
Speaker 1: Okay.

366
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,100
Speaker 1: We got, uh, this is old news.

367
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,140
Speaker 1: Is that not Netflix?

368
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,560
Speaker 0: An old news from, like, well, old.

369
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,440
Speaker 0: From earlier in October, I don't think we talked about it much, but Bee and Puppycat, season two, where the show kind of goes for real, is on Netflix.

370
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,340
Speaker 1: Yep, we didn't talk about that, but that did happen, yep.

371
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like we talked about it, but we didn't talk about it on the show.

372
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,280
Speaker 1: That's, I think that's correct, yes.

373
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,427
Speaker 0: Yep.

374
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,360
Speaker 0: And, uh, last, we actually have some non-anime follow-up with the manga.

375
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:17,740
Speaker 0: Remember a while back, we talked about the, uh, Utena manga that takes place after the revolution?

376
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,039
Speaker 0: Spoilers, the revolution happens at the end of Utena.

377
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:32,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, all right, so that, we talked about that, but yeah, Chiyo Saito made another volume of Utena manga called Utena After the Revolution, which I presume takes place after the revolution.

378
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,819
Speaker 0: I imagine it's just, uh, it's Saved by the Bell, the college years.

379
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it actually came out.

380
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,759
Speaker 1: It came out, like, earlier this month, but I didn't notice because I didn't receive my copy of it until, like, a couple days ago.

381
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:48,120
Speaker 1: But it is now in my hands, an English copy, a legitimate English copy of this manga.

382
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,200
Speaker 1: So if you're an Utena fan, I don't know if it's good or bad, I can't say.

383
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,018
Speaker 0: But you know what it is?

384
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,320
Speaker 0: It is more canonical content for your moribund franchise.

385
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:01,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, I'm gonna read it soon just to see what the deal is.

386
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,160
Speaker 1: You'll probably hear from me in two weeks about what it contains, some geek bite or something, or who knows.

387
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:11,480
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's now available, so if you want to read it, you should do that soon.

388
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:22,300
Speaker 0: My caution to you, if you liked the Utena anime but have never read the manga, you absolutely have to read the rest of the manga first, because the manga is very different from the anime.

389
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've only read some of the original Utena manga.

390
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,819
Speaker 0: Like, Black Rose is not really canonically part of the manga, it's like a side story that's tacked on at the end.

391
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:38,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how much this new manga has to do with the old manga, though, versus it has to do with the anime.

392
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:39,320
Speaker 0: We're gonna find out.

393
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:44,100
Speaker 0: I believe it just picks right up from the old manga, assuming Black Rose didn't actually happen.

394
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,980
Speaker 1: I'll have to do some research.

395
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just gonna read it, because I've read the manga, it doesn't matter.

396
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:54,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I'll re-read the complete old manga first, and then... Because it's not that long, it's only a few volumes, right?

397
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,419
Speaker 1: The original manga?

398
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,100
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it's not long at all, I have it.

399
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,000
Speaker 0: I could just drop it off at your house if you want to read it.

400
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,493
Speaker 1: It's not like a big 20+ volume deal.

401
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,840
Speaker 0: The other thing I'll caution you is, if you really liked Utena, but you wanted, like, more lore, or answers to burning questions, the manga does not provide that.

402
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,599
Speaker 1: The manga does not have that.

403
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,980
Speaker 0: The manga is Chiyo Saito telling the Chiyo Saito story, which is not the story that the anime tells.

404
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,940
Speaker 0: The anime goes in a very different direction for all the eco-horror reasons we have discussed in the past.

405
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:29,280
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

406
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,997
Speaker 0: What do you got?

407
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:34,620
Speaker 1: Got a very tiny thing of the day here, but it is very high quality, right?

408
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,059
Speaker 1: So what it is is real simple.

409
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:40,980
Speaker 1: It is a TV commercial, and this TV commercial is, what, 15 seconds long?

410
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:41,560
Speaker 1: It's real short.

411
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,840
Speaker 1: And they are advertising a brand of sausage that you can eat.

412
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,280
Speaker 1: Basically, I think it's like Slim Jim that comes in a tube, right?

413
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,719
Speaker 1: But some other Japanese brand.

414
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,620
Speaker 1: But the commercial is a Fist of the North Star commercial.

415
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,120
Speaker 1: It is therefore amazing.

416
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,893
Speaker 1: Kenshiro says, "Eat some

417
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,417
Speaker 1: sausage-y.".

418
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Speaker 1: I don't know.

419
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:04,660
Speaker 1: It's not actually translated, but I'm going to pretend.

420
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,616
Speaker 1: It says, "You have already eaten

421
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:07,040
Speaker 1: sausage.".

422
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:07,819
Speaker 0: I only watched it once.

423
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,180
Speaker 0: I'm not going to play it again while I'm doing the show, but it sounded like he said something different.

424
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,709
Speaker 0: He said like, "Oh

425
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:12,933
Speaker 0: my.".

426
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,460
Speaker 0: But he said something slightly different there.

427
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:18,036
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell if that was just-- I think it might have been, "You have already eaten

428
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:18,319
Speaker 0: sausage.".

429
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:23,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could not tell, and I don't want to play it again, because we're literally live streaming the show.

430
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,960
Speaker 0: But I will listen to it again after.

431
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,239
Speaker 1: The point is, for 15 seconds, you can watch this.

432
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:33,960
Speaker 0: What I wonder is, if I bite into one of these sausages, will they explode in a pile of gore and blood?

433
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Speaker 1: Your enemy will expire.

434
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,340
Speaker 0: The first-- this is a Twitter post.

435
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,320
Speaker 0: It's Patrick Macias.

436
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:45,620
Speaker 0: The first reply to his tweet is, quote, "How much blood is there in those sausages, and under how many megapascals of pressure?

437
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,516
Speaker 0: Biting into these has to be very

438
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:47,880
Speaker 0: risky.".

439
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:51,739
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure your opponent will explode when you bite one.

440
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,820
Speaker 1: You wouldn't sell very many if the customers exploded.

441
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,180
Speaker 1: Or maybe you offer one to your opponent.

442
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,880
Speaker 1: Like, you know, that's like a peace offering, but then they explode.

443
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,980
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day from late September, an infinite time in the past, is an official special music video.

444
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,000
Speaker 0: This happened every now and then over the years.

445
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,420
Speaker 0: Like, there is an official Escaflowne one at one point.

446
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:18,840
Speaker 0: This is an official Pokemon music video.

447
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:25,520
Speaker 0: So it feels like an AMV, but it is actually official, animated by Bones, to a song.

448
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:28,000
Speaker 0: Gotcha, Bump of Chicken.

449
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
Speaker 0: Don't worry too much about the lyrics.

450
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,373
Speaker 0: What?

451
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:34,360
Speaker 0: Do not worry too much about why this is called Bump of Chicken.

452
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,320
Speaker 0: I imagine it's like a bump of cocaine.

453
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,659
Speaker 1: Camels have bumps, not chickens.

454
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,780
Speaker 0: But a Bump of Chicken.

455
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,940
Speaker 0: But this is a phenomenal music video.

456
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,780
Speaker 0: The animation is fantastic.

457
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,859
Speaker 0: This will give you such just, like, a gut punch of nostalgia for the entire Pokemon franchise.

458
00:30:51,721 --> 00:31:04,699
Speaker 0: To the level of, if you didn't know, the movie Stand By Me, a classic of, like, Americana growing up movies, probably more important and more noteworthy than the Goonies for a lot of reasons in America.

459
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:10,679
Speaker 0: The movie Stand By Me is canonically in Pokemon Red, the original Pokemon.

460
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:12,499
Speaker 1: That's true.

461
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,899
Speaker 0: That is, in fact, true.

462
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,540
Speaker 0: And there is a scene in the very beginning.

463
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,740
Speaker 0: This music video starts with four boys walking on some train tracks about to go find some Pokemon.

464
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,212
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

465
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,120
Speaker 0: This music video is great.

466
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,540
Speaker 0: Judas showed it to us the other night.

467
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,675
Speaker 0: She was like, "Hey, you got to watch

468
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:28,858
Speaker 0: this.".

469
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,556
Speaker 0: And, yeah, you all got to watch it.

470
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,698
Speaker 0: In the moment?

471
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:33,740
Speaker 0: I don't know.

472
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,200
Speaker 0: Stuck inside, still.

473
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,934
Speaker 0: Nothing's changed in the last 48 hours.

474
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,297
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

475
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,540
Speaker 0: Uh, the book club book is still tailored.

476
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Speaker 0: Opera Club.

477
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:46,360
Speaker 1: There have to be operas.

478
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:50,500
Speaker 1: And the problem with the Opera Club is that operas are not necessarily accessible to everyone.

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,060
Speaker 1: There are recordings of operas.

480
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,040
Speaker 0: Like, I watch God or Dameron in person, but I watch the rest of the Ring Cycle on, uh, uh, basically on tape.

481
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can watch them on video.

482
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:00,280
Speaker 1: But, like, that's the other thing.

483
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Speaker 1: It's like, we're not qualified or knowledgeable to, like, comment on them.

484
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:04,640
Speaker 0: No, that would be naive commentary.

485
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 0: We would just review the opera as an entertainment experience.

486
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:13,119
Speaker 1: It had these three songs, I remember, and I don't, and because they're the famous songs, I don't remember the rest.

487
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,720
Speaker 1: I didn't understand what anyone was saying.

488
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,620
Speaker 1: I read the subtitles and the story was stupid.

489
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,160
Speaker 1: That's gonna be the comment for every single opera.

490
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,120
Speaker 0: Faust, why did you make that terrible deal with the devil?

491
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,459
Speaker 0: What did you think was gonna happen?

492
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:22,899
Speaker 1: The book was better.

493
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:30,300
Speaker 1: But, yeah, the, uh, the book club book is still The Tale of Genji.

494
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:34,760
Speaker 1: I almost read it, but then I read these comic books we're about to talk about instead.

495
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:38,900
Speaker 0: Yep, uh, I was, uh, not thinking about reading it because I don't have time to read anything.

496
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Speaker 0: Do you know how much shit I gotta do in my day-to-day life?

497
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,140
Speaker 1: You read these comic books.

498
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:45,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read these comic books, like, I only read the first volume.

499
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,339
Speaker 0: I didn't get a time to read the second volume yet.

500
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,819
Speaker 1: All right, well, there's only two volumes that I'm aware of.

501
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is fine because the first volume is great.

502
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,659
Speaker 0: I got enough to go on with this.

503
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:56,020
Speaker 1: Is there any other meta moment whatsoever?

504
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:57,520
Speaker 0: Uh, nothing really.

505
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,819
Speaker 0: Just follow us in all the places.

506
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,760
Speaker 0: Bug us if you don't have a link to our Discord.

507
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:06,419
Speaker 0: You can also use our Geek Nights community forum, but kids mostly hang out in Discords these days.

508
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,820
Speaker 1: Yep, anyway, uh, that's the end of the meta moment.

509
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,498
Speaker 1: Give me a meta moment to go get the comics off the shelf because I forgot to bring them to my desk.

510
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,379
Speaker 0: All right, so, Isola.

511
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,689
Speaker 0: I haven't been following comics much lately because I've been doing a lot of other things.

512
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:30,200
Speaker 0: Like, most of what's occupying my brain time that is not, like, projects I'm working on are video games and board games and some technology things lately.

513
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,379
Speaker 0: So I've been reading comics.

514
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,760
Speaker 0: Didn't even know this was coming.

515
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,260
Speaker 0: But, uh, Isola, uh, has- Isola?

516
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,279
Speaker 1: I don't know how to pronounce it.

517
00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:37,839
Speaker 1: I-sola?

518
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:38,759
Speaker 1: I-sola?

519
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,140
Speaker 0: I'm going with Isola unless someone tells me otherwise.

520
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:48,078
Speaker 0: An evil spell has been cast on the Queen of Marr and her Captain of the Guard will do anything to reverse it.

521
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:55,320
Speaker 0: The only hope lies in an island half a world away, a place known in myth as Isola, the Land of the Dead.

522
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,640
Speaker 0: Gotham Academy creators Brendan Fletcher and Carl Kerschel reunite with a colorist and a letterer to make this thing come alive.

523
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,217
Speaker 0: The funniest thing is the Amazon listing has a sentence at the end that just says, "recommended for fans of Studio Ghibli and the works of Hayao

524
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:12,679
Speaker 0: Miyazaki.".

525
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:14,498
Speaker 1: Kinda.

526
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda.

527
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,760
Speaker 0: Not a hundred percent.

528
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,500
Speaker 0: Like, that is an oddly specific recommendation to make.

529
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:30,300
Speaker 0: I guess I see- I see where they're going with that, but it's really- If you're a fan of the Naoshika manga, that's a better, like-.

530
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:33,080
Speaker 1: Naoshika is definitely the closest to this.

531
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,980
Speaker 0: Because if someone watched Totoro and then thinks they're going to read this, not the best fit, maybe.

532
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,597
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

533
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,020
Speaker 1: So what's the deal here?

534
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,820
Speaker 1: So the creators of this are pretty interesting.

535
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,100
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of them before.

536
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:53,380
Speaker 1: And I looked them up, and you look at their credits, and their credits don't have any particular item, right?

537
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
Speaker 1: That is like, you know, wow, that's like an all-time great kind of thing, right?

538
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,920
Speaker 0: Well, I recognized Carl Kerschel when I looked up his Wikipedia because I've seen him before at conventions.

539
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:05,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

540
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,720
Speaker 1: I mean, I know the person's- I know their name.

541
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,831
Speaker 0: But I knew him as a DC guy, like.

542
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,499
Speaker 0: I didn't really think beyond that.

543
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,288
Speaker 1: Right, it's like name for me.

544
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:13,920
Speaker 1: one thing he did, right?

545
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,240
Speaker 0: It's like, you know- Some DC stuff, but he won an Eisner in 2011.

546
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,331
Speaker 1: Sure.

547
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:29,219
Speaker 1: But it's all this, you know, these are people who are like seasoned professionals in the industry, but they don't have to their name, right?

548
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,060
Speaker 1: Like that, you know, huge title that like everyone knows, right?

549
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:37,899
Speaker 1: Even people who do work in superhero stuff, right?

550
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,740
Speaker 1: You know, like a Frank Miller has like a Dark Knight Returns.

551
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,779
Speaker 1: Like, oh, he's got a, you know, that's his thing, right?

552
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,220
Speaker 0: A comic person might know like, oh yeah, Gotham Academy or like Teen Titans Year One, but that doesn't break beyond the comic fan people.

553
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:01,940
Speaker 1: Right, but like, you know, like they have these creators still have tremendous talent, you know, tremendous skills, and they're just doing professional work for hire, right?

554
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:06,000
Speaker 1: So here they come with their own story, right?

555
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,500
Speaker 1: A new, a brand new property, a unique thing, right?

556
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 1: You know, published by Image and it's like, whoa, look at that, right?

557
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:15,899
Speaker 1: Holy snap.

558
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:20,320
Speaker 1: So what the heck is Isola about, right?

559
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:30,340
Speaker 1: This thing that, you know, these very talented, you know, comic industry professionals did when they finally would make their own book instead of, you know, just another superhero book, right?

560
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:51,554
Speaker 1: So the story here is like what Rim said, there is some kingdom, you don't know a queendom, you don't know about a country, a nation, and the queen of that nation, and this is not a spoiler because it's revealed on page like fucking one, has been intentionally, unintentionally, somehow transformed into a tiger, roar, roar, right?

561
00:36:54,781 --> 00:37:02,620
Speaker 1: And the queen's guard, the number one guard of the queens, basically like the equivalent of Oscar from Rose of Versailles, same job, right?

562
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,719
Speaker 1: Royal guard, the only one person, the chief Royal guard person, uh, is accompanying the tiger on a journey.

563
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:18,319
Speaker 1: So they're running away, um, and trying to keep the queen alive, which is sometimes easy because the queen is a tiger.

564
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,720
Speaker 0: Sometimes difficult because the world is terrifyingly dangerous.

565
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,820
Speaker 1: And because the queen is a tiger and they're like hunters.

566
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:27,400
Speaker 1: And some people seem to know the queen is a tiger.

567
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,680
Speaker 1: Some people don't, right?

568
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:31,634
Speaker 0: Like one random person who shows up, it's like, oh, I know, I know.

569
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,500
Speaker 1: It's also a fantasy world full of magic.

570
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:49,000
Speaker 1: Um, and also there seems to be this terrible secret of space, um, that is revealed very, very early on and that there are, what do they call them?

571
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,017
Speaker 1: There's like a name for them.

572
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,789
Speaker 0: Well, there's the, there's the idea of like.

573
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,660
Speaker 0: who is going to be the in between.

574
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:55,480
Speaker 1: Sure.

575
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:58,600
Speaker 1: But no, there's these things called the Hallam, which are these birds.

576
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,020
Speaker 1: They look like Ravens or crows, black birds of some kind, gigantic black birds.

577
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:04,860
Speaker 1: They are enormous.

578
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:09,960
Speaker 1: We're talking like, you know, bigger than dinosaur sized, right?

579
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,860
Speaker 1: Like could probably Peck it like an Eva's face.

580
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:23,499
Speaker 1: Um, uh, so they're out there and they early on, they encounter one that is already deceased somehow.

581
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,620
Speaker 0: And it's notable that the characters are like, I didn't know they could die.

582
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:28,580
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,459
Speaker 1: It's like, holy shit.

584
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,580
Speaker 1: And so it's like they're there as like, even after, you know, volume two, right?

585
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:48,680
Speaker 1: It's like, they're sort of like this looming, not present, but like, you just know they exist in this world threat that sort of hovers over everything because they're mentioned often.

586
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:49,000
Speaker 1: Right.

587
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,440
Speaker 1: They're always like Hallam this and Hallam that.

588
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:51,840
Speaker 1: Right.

589
00:38:52,601 --> 00:39:00,059
Speaker 1: Um, you know, even though they're not there, we haven't that direct conflict of giant birds are coming to Peck you right now.

590
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,999
Speaker 1: That hasn't happened.

591
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:01,840
Speaker 1: Right.

592
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,759
Speaker 1: That would sort of make things end quickly.

593
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:04,598
Speaker 0: Yep.

594
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:11,720
Speaker 0: But what is happening, like what I like about this comic is it starts in media res and uses proper nouns appropriately.

595
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:14,040
Speaker 0: And you start to figure out the deal.

596
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:17,000
Speaker 0: There's like an empire that appears to be collapsing.

597
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:25,960
Speaker 0: Like you encounter, like the, the equivalent of the Roman legions of this emperor empire are sort of like in disarray, like things are starting to fall down.

598
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,540
Speaker 0: There's ruins, there's other kingdoms out there.

599
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:30,180
Speaker 0: There's these warrior clans.

600
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:43,219
Speaker 0: And I do appreciate media that has a lot of those kinds of proper nouns, but just trust you to figure it out and like reveal the story organically instead of having like an origin story or a prelude to explain it all.

601
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,120
Speaker 1: Well, it's not necessarily proper noun leading, right?

602
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:46,362
Speaker 1: Like.

603
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:48,560
Speaker 1: sometimes it's just like, yeah, they're hunters, right?

604
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,540
Speaker 1: It's like, it's just an appropriate word to describe the group.

605
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:00,820
Speaker 1: And the only proper nouns are the ones that for things that need proper nouns, names of countries, names of things that don't exist in the real world, right?

606
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,218
Speaker 1: Names of people, right?

607
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,589
Speaker 1: Yep.

608
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
Speaker 0: They're not like- There are a lot of incidental ones.

609
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,878
Speaker 0: Like they bring up circles, like the circle a lot, and you sort of figure out what that really means as it goes on.

610
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:11,918
Speaker 0: Like why, where this character came from.

611
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:20,819
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's, it's pretty much, you know, journey of two people together and the thing, the difficulties they encounter along the way.

612
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,996
Speaker 1: And they're your discovery and their discovery, right?

613
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:31,640
Speaker 1: Of, um, you know, like what the true, what the real deal is, right?

614
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,439
Speaker 1: Cause like, you know, the queen clearly knows more than the guard does.

615
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:44,220
Speaker 0: The queen is, and there's also a, the guard knows a lot, but the guard's origin is sort of mysterious, like how the guard came into this position.

616
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,819
Speaker 0: There's some romance angles, there's a lot going on.

617
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:53,819
Speaker 1: And they encounter lots of, you know, interesting figures, like magical old man type of people that know more or less, right?

618
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,519
Speaker 1: And help or hinder their journey along the way.

619
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
Speaker 1: There's also the big mystery, right?

620
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:05,020
Speaker 1: Is this place they're going to, Isola, Isola, whatever, right?

621
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:12,535
Speaker 1: Is at some times you think Isola is actually just like, you know, heaven is not a real place, right?

622
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,560
Speaker 1: You know, they're going to their, or it's like the land of the dead.

623
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,260
Speaker 1: They're just going out to die somewhere appropriately.

624
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:22,600
Speaker 1: Or, you know, they're, the journey that they're taking is the important part.

625
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,980
Speaker 1: There isn't at the destination is not real, or it's a magical other land.

626
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,639
Speaker 1: It's not a real land land, or maybe it is a real land land, you know?

627
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:36,980
Speaker 1: And anytime people they meet along the way talk about it, they always talk ambiguously.

628
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,900
Speaker 0: - But I think the main reason to read this, like the plot is good.

629
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,718
Speaker 0: The characters are good.

630
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:47,520
Speaker 0: Like the dialogue is all right, but it really focuses on visual storytelling.

631
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:54,720
Speaker 0: And the words the characters are saying are driving like the things that you can't drive visually because it's a fairly complex world.

632
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,080
Speaker 0: The visual storytelling is pretty phenomenal and the creatures are beautiful.

633
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,960
Speaker 0: Like the pages are just beautiful reading this comic.

634
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:11,080
Speaker 1: - Yeah, what'll happen often is, you know, there's the parts of the story that are quite, you know, literal, like this is happening, right?

635
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:19,399
Speaker 1: And then people are often, characters are often in dreams or hallucinations or visions of some kind.

636
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:21,531
Speaker 1: And you can get a little confusing.

637
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:23,120
Speaker 1: actually, you know, is this real?

638
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,039
Speaker 1: Is this not real?

639
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,420
Speaker 0: - It's almost like form is function.

640
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:34,139
Speaker 0: Like you, you, the reader are disoriented by these rapid shifts of context, but the character that you're following is equally disoriented by them.

641
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:45,480
Speaker 1: - And also the things that are happening, it's like, you know, after the first, like, you know, dreams, you know, kind of, you know, dreamish sequence, right?

642
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:56,531
Speaker 1: You sort of realize, you know, it doesn't matter if this part is literally happening or is in someone's mind or is a vision or who knows what it is because all of it's real, right?

643
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,960
Speaker 1: It's not, they're not, they're not illusions of lies, right?

644
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:03,040
Speaker 1: They're visions of true things, right?

645
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, the dream is showing me something.

646
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:06,379
Speaker 1: They're learning things, right?

647
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,720
Speaker 1: They're not, you know, being fooled by anyone except when they are, right?

648
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,980
Speaker 1: And then you find this, in that case, there is somebody, there's, you know, there's a visible adversary who is doing the fooling.

649
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,040
Speaker 1: So it's not, that part is not, you know, confusing.

650
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,480
Speaker 0: - But what's interesting too is that it actually moves pretty quick.

651
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:36,180
Speaker 0: Like, I gave up trying to predict the pace of this almost immediately because things that I thought they were, like, felt like in a comic would be a setup for later got resolved immediately.

652
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:39,260
Speaker 0: Other things lasted way longer than I expected.

653
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:47,219
Speaker 0: And even volume one ends in a, it ends in a very different place from what I expected one trade of a comic like this to end at.

654
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,583
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I think what.

655
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:53,559
Speaker 1: the reason is that, you know, it originally came out as, you know, individual issues, right?

656
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:57,280
Speaker 1: So each of those issues actually has to have, like, stuff happen in it.

657
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:03,800
Speaker 1: And all the, normally on a long journey like this, you'd have a lot of that, you know, time spent traveling.

658
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:05,099
Speaker 1: They don't do any of that.

659
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,139
Speaker 1: They only giving you the destined, you know, they've arrived somewhere and do a thing at the place.

660
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:13,600
Speaker 1: They meet some people and do a thing at the place.

661
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:20,240
Speaker 1: You know, the parts where things happen are the only parts, the way you're supposed to play, like, a tabletop RPG properly, right?

662
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:33,715
Speaker 1: And it's just like, you know, when they're in a place and then as they resolve whatever is happening there and, like, the next page, which would be, I guess, the next issue, I don't know where the issue boundaries are because the trade puts all the covers at the end of the book.

663
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:38,780
Speaker 1: But it's like they're immediately at a new place, basically, right?

664
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:47,420
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of time spent, maybe a page or two of, like, we're walking on some cliff rocks and then we see a new place, right?

665
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,678
Speaker 1: And let's go there.

666
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:50,440
Speaker 0: But there's definitely a house.

667
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,177
Speaker 1: Let's go in it.

668
00:44:51,460 --> 00:45:01,516
Speaker 0: There's definitely the theme of, like, there was an empire that for various reasons is collapsing and there's some sort of ecological catastrophe that may or may not be related to that.

669
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,099
Speaker 0: And there's a very deep transhuman theme the entire way so far.

670
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,420
Speaker 1: You know, it'll be like, oh, we're escaping some hunters.

671
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:10,098
Speaker 1: We escaped.

672
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,100
Speaker 1: There's some ruins.

673
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:12,380
Speaker 1: Let's go in the ruins, right?

674
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:13,198
Speaker 1: Like the next page.

675
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,960
Speaker 0: Oh, there's the head of, like, the legion that was stationed there.

676
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,220
Speaker 0: But, like, the empire doesn't appear to be paying them anymore.

677
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,919
Speaker 0: And, like, it's not really clear what's going on.

678
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:23,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

679
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,879
Speaker 1: Something else that needs to be mentioned, right, is the, you know, the tiger is a queen, right?

680
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:39,000
Speaker 1: And, you know, the guard, right, is also at least, you know, appears to be someone who is female.

681
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:41,320
Speaker 0: And they're clearly lovers.

682
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:42,158
Speaker 0: Clearly.

683
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:48,173
Speaker 1: Uh, it appears to me the queen 100%, right, is, like, you know, all over the guard.

684
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:52,400
Speaker 1: I don't know.

685
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,919
Speaker 1: The guard may be clueless.

686
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:57,860
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, the guard might be a disaster in that sense.

687
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,340
Speaker 0: The guard may be clueless.

688
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:07,720
Speaker 0: I get the impression the queen, like, elevated the guard to be close to her, but propriety prevented her from exploring that relationship.

689
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:11,540
Speaker 0: And now they're on the road and one's a tiger and we'll see where this goes.

690
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:17,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, clearly the queen, you know, chose this person to be their guard for, like, reasons, right?

691
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,099
Speaker 1: And those that we know what the reasons are, right?

692
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,493
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:29,799
Speaker 0: I don't think there are further plot reasons there, necessarily, because the plot stuff seems to revolve around the queen's brother and whatever the hell he was up to.

694
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:34,900
Speaker 1: I don't know what he didn't make any sense, right, because they don't they don't reveal too much, right?

695
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,658
Speaker 0: Well, I like that, too.

696
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:42,320
Speaker 0: Like, there's a scene where they're with the, uh, the animal people in the woods that were the swampy woods at one point being vague here for a reason.

697
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:51,260
Speaker 0: But even then, like, it's not super clear to the characters or even to the reader exactly why that goes south in a hurry and they get kicked out again.

698
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,900
Speaker 0: And things are very confusing and moving very fast in that regard.

699
00:46:55,381 --> 00:47:04,539
Speaker 0: It's very unclear what anyone wants for real, except the main character, the guard, just wants to turn the queen into a human again.

700
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:12,940
Speaker 0: And the queen seems to also want to become a human again, but also seems to maybe be becoming something different that might have been intended.

701
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,480
Speaker 0: Like, the plot might have been to make the queen different for a reason.

702
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just don't know what the reason is.

703
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:20,260
Speaker 1: Exactly.

704
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,620
Speaker 0: I have no idea what anyone wants except the queen and the guard.

705
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,979
Speaker 0: No, everyone else is basically a mystery to me.

706
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:38,060
Speaker 1: So something on the art that I can't ignore is the coloring in this book is very, very interesting in that when you look at most pages, there are some pages that are exceptions.

707
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,240
Speaker 1: Most pages are basically one or maybe two colors, right?

708
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,120
Speaker 1: Like, you look at the whole page, all the panels on the whole.

709
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,320
Speaker 1: Here's a two page spread.

710
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,120
Speaker 1: Anyone who's watching the stream can maybe see this.

711
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:51,780
Speaker 1: It's a blue page, right?

712
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:54,099
Speaker 1: And then it's like, oh, I'll go over here.

713
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,138
Speaker 1: This is a purple page, right?

714
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,540
Speaker 1: See, every single frame in the whole page is purple, right?

715
00:47:59,982 --> 00:48:04,620
Speaker 1: And it's like, OK, here's a purple page with two blue frames.

716
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:13,598
Speaker 0: And it definitely the color scheme of any given layout definitely has ties to the perspective that you're seeing things from.

717
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,019
Speaker 1: Here's some orange pages, right?

718
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:18,360
Speaker 1: It's like everything, no matter where you turn.

719
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:20,299
Speaker 1: And this holds true in volume two as well.

720
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,160
Speaker 1: Yep, holds true in volume two as well.

721
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:34,699
Speaker 1: Pretty much any page you turn to is one, maybe two colors and different, you know, the hue is the same and all the other variables on color saturation, etc.

722
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:35,769
Speaker 1: Right.

723
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,220
Speaker 1: Luminance are altered, but it'll be like almost like a solid hue for like a whole page or spreads.

724
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:54,440
Speaker 0: And it's definitely tied to the mood of the characters or the context of the story in some capacity or whether or not it's in the dream world.

725
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,500
Speaker 0: I'm not actually sure if there is a dream world or if that's more complicated.

726
00:48:59,493 --> 00:48:59,659
Speaker 1: Yep.

727
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:01,740
Speaker 1: You can even see the colors of the trades.

728
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,640
Speaker 1: Trade number one is the green trade and trade number two is the purple trade.

729
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:18,400
Speaker 1: Even like you don't have to be an artist to see, you know, this like it's such a. it's such like a bold, plain, like in your face artistic decision.

730
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:23,020
Speaker 1: And it really shows like the strength of the colorist.

731
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,139
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, color, you decide you're going to make these all these four pages in a row, all purple.

732
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:28,938
Speaker 1: Right.

733
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,317
Speaker 1: But still, everyone has to be able to tell who all the characters are and tell what all the objects are.

734
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,340
Speaker 1: But everything has to be purple, some shade of purple.

735
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:41,838
Speaker 1: But I also love to put green on this page or red or yellow or brown.

736
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:43,676
Speaker 0: I enjoy the history.

737
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,159
Speaker 1: You got to make it purple in that context.

738
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:53,280
Speaker 0: Watching the queen as a tiger try to interact with the other characters and the nonverbal communication.

739
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,840
Speaker 0: The comic is mostly serious, significantly gory and violent.

740
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,980
Speaker 0: Like this is a violent story, but it also at times is extremely funny.

741
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:10,335
Speaker 0: But that funniness is very brief and sort of punctuates everything else that's going on.

742
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,960
Speaker 1: It's mostly very so far, very, very small amounts of humor.

743
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:15,260
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,580
Speaker 1: It's there, but it's very tiny.

745
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,937
Speaker 1: It's like a. it's like a dusting.

746
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,722
Speaker 0: Like there's.

747
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:24,300
Speaker 0: there is a moment when a character who seems to be able to communicate better with the queen is like basically sitting with the queen by himself.

748
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,700
Speaker 0: And he's like, so, yeah, you're definitely completely in love with your guard.

749
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:28,119
Speaker 0: Right.

750
00:50:28,582 --> 00:50:31,180
Speaker 0: And the queen reacts in an appropriately funny way.

751
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:38,139
Speaker 0: But then it gets into the transhumanist, like, shall we say, transhumanist nonsense two pages later.

752
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:39,398
Speaker 1: Yeah.

753
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:46,500
Speaker 1: And that just also brings to mind just the facial expressions of every single character.

754
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,100
Speaker 1: Right.

755
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,140
Speaker 1: Are like because there's actually not too many words in a lot of parts of the book.

756
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,858
Speaker 0: Which I appreciate.

757
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:52,596
Speaker 0: I like that.

758
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,400
Speaker 1: It's like it's, you know, you know, comics in general became less wordy over time.

759
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,878
Speaker 0: You know, you, you little guy.

760
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:02,940
Speaker 1: Right.

761
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:09,580
Speaker 1: You know, of like the Silver Age and even, you know, where people would just say what was happening in the panel.

762
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:09,870
Speaker 1: Right.

763
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:11,420
Speaker 1: Instead of just showing.

764
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,899
Speaker 1: Right.

765
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,699
Speaker 1: And we learn not comic creators learn not to do that.

766
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:22,260
Speaker 1: But this goes even further towards, you know, saying really the bare minimum and showing everything with the artwork.

767
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,980
Speaker 1: And so, you know, not just the human facial expressions telling you pretty much everything.

768
00:51:29,522 --> 00:51:32,959
Speaker 1: But to be able to draw the tiger face expressions.

769
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:33,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

770
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,418
Speaker 0: Without showing everything the animal features, they still like you can tell when the queen is pissed.

771
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,780
Speaker 1: This is not like a furry situation, though.

772
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:44,556
Speaker 1: I guess it might be.

773
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:47,271
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, yeah, the queen isn't it's not.

774
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,220
Speaker 1: it's not like a tiger person.

775
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:50,619
Speaker 1: It's just a tiger.

776
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:52,659
Speaker 1: It's black with blue stripes.

777
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:59,760
Speaker 0: There are just like there are characters you encounter who are sort of like mishmashes of human and animal traits, but not enough.

778
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,900
Speaker 0: They're not in a stereotypical furry art way, but more in a monstrous and unique style.

779
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:06,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

780
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,299
Speaker 1: This is this is Siegfried and Roy.

781
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,139
Speaker 1: Like it's a tiger.

782
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,871
Speaker 1: It's not a it's not.

783
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:11,979
Speaker 1: it's not Tony the tiger.

784
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:15,838
Speaker 1: That's what I'm trying to say.

785
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:16,298
Speaker 0: Yep.

786
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,199
Speaker 0: But I guess what I would say is like, I don't want to really say much more about it because it's great.

787
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:26,860
Speaker 0: And if you want to read a comic, you've been reading comics lately and you're OK for something that's a little bit violent, but otherwise beautiful.

788
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,080
Speaker 1: This saga is really worth reading.

789
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,320
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Saga is still on hiatus.

790
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:38,259
Speaker 1: So this is your American not superhero comic to read right now.

791
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,400
Speaker 0: I presume that volume three is coming out, right?

792
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,419
Speaker 1: I presume volume three is coming out.

793
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:46,339
Speaker 1: At some point.

794
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:50,980
Speaker 1: I don't know when, but I'll preorder it just like I pre-order one and two.

795
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:52,840
Speaker 1: I actually didn't preorder one.

796
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,220
Speaker 1: I found out about one afterwards and then I preordered.

797
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,400
Speaker 0: I just bought it on Comixology and read it on my laptop.

798
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

799
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,500
Speaker 1: That seems like a good idea.

800
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:03,079
Speaker 1: So, yeah, ESOLA.

801
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:07,778
Speaker 1: I S O L A. It is the comic to read right now.

802
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,760
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

811
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,120
Speaker 0: If anything, I could say this cab was rare.

812
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:14,560
Speaker 0: I actually have to hover over your name if it's longer than, like, 15 characters and wait for the tooltip to pop up to be able to read it.

813
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,279
Speaker 0: That is actually super annoying and sometimes causes me trouble here.

814
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:21,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, make sure you go out and vote.

815
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:22,580
Speaker 0: It's kind of important.

816
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,139
Speaker 0: And now I leave you with...
