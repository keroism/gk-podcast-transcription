1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,849
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday March 24th 2020 I'm rim and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:16,637
Speaker 1: tonight We are reviewing two games that are new to us.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,648
Speaker 1: No return also known as as get kind zurich and square on sale.

4
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:25,728
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:37,807
Speaker 1: So if geek night sounds a little bit different that's because we are actually recording it remotely Which is something we've actually never done in the last 15 years like even one had to.

6
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:42,190
Speaker 1: we've never Done the show in any way except both of us sitting in a room.

7
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,870
Speaker 1: Scott lounging with his eyes closed me not looking at him at our microphones.

8
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean why there was no reason to.

9
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,550
Speaker 0: we would just skip the show if we were apart for some reason.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, right apart from the audio equipment.

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,805
Speaker 1: Yep, but it's difficult times.

12
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,569
Speaker 1: and to reiterate While we would probably be safe meeting up Probably is not good enough right now.

13
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:12,930
Speaker 1: If we can stay home and set up this kind of fucky Janky pipeline to do the show remotely because we've never had to do it before you can stay home for a couple weeks.

14
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,896
Speaker 0: We'll see if it's a couple weeks or longer.

15
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:21,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if it's warm enough to bike biking might be an option.

16
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:21,893
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

17
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:22,857
Speaker 1: I just gotta get nice.

18
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,484
Speaker 0: It's currently too cold.

19
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,629
Speaker 0: So what I'd think?

20
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,881
Speaker 1: well It was warm in a very long walk.

21
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,370
Speaker 1: It was warm enough over the weekend.

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,000
Speaker 1: There was that one day where it was like.

23
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:36,979
Speaker 0: I know it wasn't even a day It was like an afternoon and I basically as soon as it was warm I biked and then it got cold.

24
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,669
Speaker 0: they came back I came home and that was it.

25
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,219
Speaker 0: There was the end of the warm period.

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:46,418
Speaker 1: as soon as it got warm me and Emily was like, yeah And we ran outside and we went for a run and we came back and then the next day It was like 40 and raining.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,449
Speaker 0: It was like four hour period of warmth.

28
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,300
Speaker 1: Yesterday was totally told.

29
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,949
Speaker 0: the Sun went down And I don't think I went outside yesterday.

30
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,313
Speaker 1: Uh, did I?

31
00:01:55,473 --> 00:02:00,430
Speaker 1: I did go outside once to drop off a growler at the Baroness and get a new refilled growler.

32
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:02,389
Speaker 0: Oh, they just give you the whole thing.

33
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:11,926
Speaker 1: So what they're doing is they are basically they're doing takeout food only but they will give you beer and food And that is totally okay for a bunch of arcane reasons.

34
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,659
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I mean you can even get beer delivered from a bodega.

35
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know beer delivery is totally legal and always has been in New York.

36
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,370
Speaker 1: So if you're not familiar growler, basically, it's just a milk jug that you completely fill with beer.

37
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about that size.

38
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:26,649
Speaker 1: It's like a gallon of beer.

39
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,744
Speaker 1: So we're gonna get a couple of those a week and Hopefully that will help keep the Baroness in business because I love that.

40
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,069
Speaker 0: I don't think they're gonna be going out of it.

41
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,570
Speaker 1: Yep, it's cool though.

42
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:46,262
Speaker 1: They basically got two employees in there and like we've known the guy for a long time because we've been going there forever and he's Super chill but because it's so empty and quiet I've got to talk to him a lot more and he's even cooler than I thought.

43
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,050
Speaker 1: he's like he lives nearby.

44
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,869
Speaker 1: He's driving to the Baroness for maximum safety.

45
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,506
Speaker 1: He had like they said of all these protocols of like how people sure you just walk there.

46
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,724
Speaker 1: if he lives nearby Well, he lives like 20 minutes away vice.

47
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:02,002
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not nearby It's nearby compared to like living in Brooklyn.

48
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:10,387
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, anyway, so in some meta news, uh Scott always like to point out that I like.

49
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:11,590
Speaker 1: I like noises.

50
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,776
Speaker 1: I mean I used to be a musician.

51
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:13,760
Speaker 1: I'm still kind of a musician.

52
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,414
Speaker 1: I've been playing my trumpet again, but So it's rims thing is.

53
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:21,650
Speaker 0: all he does is he you know, he makes yeah, he makes annoying noises.

54
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:24,273
Speaker 0: There's a device that makes annoying noises He wants.

55
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:27,685
Speaker 0: he finds out that a particular noise and noise you he'll make that noise.

56
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,010
Speaker 0: go out of his way to make that noise.

57
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:29,933
Speaker 0: It's possible.

58
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:40,950
Speaker 1: but one of the things that a musical instrument that I've always loved is the hurdy-gurdy Which is basically a violin where you don't need to bow or finger because those are the two things I cannot do.

59
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:45,230
Speaker 1: I am I am like preternaturally unable to play stringed instruments.

60
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,630
Speaker 1: But the hurdy-gurdy removes all of the challenges that I would have with a stringed instrument.

61
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,493
Speaker 1: It's basically.

62
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:54,947
Speaker 0: it also removes it sort, you know, the you know, the the finesse, right?

63
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,372
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah exactly It's a.

64
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,822
Speaker 1: it is definitely a a thick fingered instrument.

65
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:07,887
Speaker 1: It's the keytar equivalent of a violin exactly, but it's more like bagpipes of all things because it drones.

66
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,277
Speaker 1: so it's Some people may like this, but it's not air-powered Yeah, but it's still drones.

67
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:13,437
Speaker 1: Like.

68
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,165
Speaker 1: it'll basically play like crank.

69
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,250
Speaker 0: I thought you had to crank it up.

70
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:24,990
Speaker 1: You crank it constantly and a wheel spins past the Strings so you can basically just play infinite notes.

71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,852
Speaker 1: They usually have one of the strings just going wah the whole time and then you play notes on the other string Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:36,289
Speaker 1: So I bought a mechanical kit to make my own hurdy-gurdy and I'm a big is it?

73
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,482
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like a foot and a half tall when I finish.

74
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,389
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's not like cello sized.

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,396
Speaker 1: No No, they're like violin sized time.

76
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,480
Speaker 1: Okay, or even smaller.

77
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,146
Speaker 1: Maybe this is more like a banjo.

78
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,035
Speaker 1: the way I was looking at it Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:49,049
Speaker 1: We'll see how it sounds.

80
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:55,368
Speaker 1: I doubt it'll sound great because it doesn't have like a resonating chamber like a like a well-made wooden instrument would have.

81
00:04:55,749 --> 00:05:04,470
Speaker 1: but This will be a good way to find out if I actually want to play a hurdy-gurdy for real because if I do I'll just like helps get someone to make me a real hurdy-gurdy and I can pass my trumpet.

82
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:12,301
Speaker 0: The best homemade instrument you can possibly make is the cigar box guitar slash banjo Cigar box.

83
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:17,622
Speaker 0: you put a stick on it You put a cup a string or a few You know and the effort to make one is low.

84
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,553
Speaker 0: the style is pretty high Relative to the effort.

85
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,820
Speaker 0: the sound is pretty high relative to the effort.

86
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,070
Speaker 0: the ease of playing versus results is pretty high.

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,223
Speaker 0: It's just like, you know, it's not like a terrific amazing instrument.

88
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,869
Speaker 0: It's just the ratio of ease.

89
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,556
Speaker 0: You made it yourself.

90
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:36,950
Speaker 0: It looks cool and it sounds kind of good is really high ratio.

91
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,506
Speaker 1: So in terms of the ratio of effort to learn versus sounds pretty good.

92
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,274
Speaker 0: harmonica still wins Mmm, I don't know.

93
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:50,618
Speaker 0: I think cigar box guitar or even ukulele is probably easier than Harmonica, I don't know.

94
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,110
Speaker 0: I don't need to learn any mouth skills.

95
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,310
Speaker 0: Anyone with hands already has hand skills.

96
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:58,930
Speaker 1: I had the mouth skills to play basic harmonica stuff round down to basically zero if all you're gonna play.

97
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,406
Speaker 0: But a lot of people don't have any mouth skills at all.

98
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:06,790
Speaker 0: true It's like you have to at least learn some kind of embouchure if you everyone knows how to use the fucking hands.

99
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:14,610
Speaker 1: True that is way back when both of us were learning the harmonica I had an unfair advantage because of the trumpet and like my tonguing skills you had to learn extra skills from scratch.

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,713
Speaker 0: I played clarinet.

101
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,656
Speaker 0: I have mouth skills.

102
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,985
Speaker 0: I just you know, I think that barely requires an embouchure.

103
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:33,686
Speaker 1: I do not have any Discipline To continue and repeatedly practice something to mastery, but I will link to this kit because uh The people who make it it's on a player.

104
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:46,623
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah Parality comm they make like Woodcraft things and they have a lot of really cool stuff there and they're putting a lot of their stuff on sale Because a lot of people are stuck at home like bored looking for projects.

105
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:47,626
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:48,790
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

107
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,260
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

108
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:55,082
Speaker 0: It's sort of a Small news because the news is actually tomorrow.

109
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,408
Speaker 0: We're recording this on March 24th.

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,290
Speaker 0: You're probably listening on March 25th, which is when the news will actually happen.

111
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:09,530
Speaker 0: So it's a. it's a news announcing a news, but Sega has teased for the 60th anniversary of Sega.

112
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,810
Speaker 0: Some sort of announcement tomorrow.

113
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:18,856
Speaker 0: But if you look at the single teaser image that they have released Right, all the all it's.

114
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,906
Speaker 0: the only text they've released is ah, so you've come to this page.

115
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,130
Speaker 0: You must really like Sega.

116
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,723
Speaker 0: Please wait a little longer until the site is open.

117
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,109
Speaker 0: So I guess the site will open tomorrow.

118
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:39,469
Speaker 0: But the image in the teaser appears to be Sega satan Shiro what which is huge news for anyone who knows who that is.

119
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,996
Speaker 1: we were vaguely obsessed with him for a while at RIT because One there wasn't YouTube yet.

120
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:52,270
Speaker 1: So finally having one of these videos was already pretty novel and two He's just an amazing character.

121
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:59,560
Speaker 0: So if anyone who doesn't know when the Sega Saturn was a thing It was a bigger thing in Japan than the u.s.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,549
Speaker 0: Where it kind of flopped mostly, right?

123
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,613
Speaker 0: the Advertisements for it.

124
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:14,929
Speaker 0: the Sega Saturn in Japan involved a character named segata San Shiro, which when you say it quickly sort of sounds like Sega Saturn Shiro.

125
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:21,254
Speaker 0: right Say Exactly Right, exactly.

126
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,483
Speaker 0: I think they received a set of commercials.

127
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,110
Speaker 0: You can watch all the commercials on YouTube.

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,376
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're they're all around and very popular.

129
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,083
Speaker 0: and the final commercial he died spoilers.

130
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:32,549
Speaker 1: Yep, but he dives saving Sega.

131
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:39,109
Speaker 0: Yeah season it was but the commercials are just an amazing character advertising the product in an amazing way.

132
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:48,570
Speaker 0: and you just you know, you you know when in the US knew about this character until You know internet came around and we were able to see Japanese commercials.

133
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,765
Speaker 1: I remember an early kinetic on someone was cosplaying as this.

134
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,186
Speaker 1: I got it.

135
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,927
Speaker 0: I got the picture somewhere I gotta find yes, but by that I already knew who it was at that point.

136
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, right I saw.

137
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,750
Speaker 0: I think at the first time it was like some someone at RIT was like have you heard of Sega?

138
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:14,370
Speaker 0: Sanjiro Sega, it's like oh here it is I. Anyway, so yes, they get so Sanjiro may be coming back or maybe his son or something or descendant or who knows?

139
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,982
Speaker 0: We'll find out by the time you're hearing this podcast problem.

140
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, if not a few hours afterwards.

141
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:27,470
Speaker 1: So in some other relatively minor news, uh half-life Alex is imminently arriving for people who have VR.

142
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,795
Speaker 0: I thought it was out already.

143
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:31,464
Speaker 1: I think it just came out just like there's.

144
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,990
Speaker 1: just reviews are being published.

145
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,123
Speaker 0: Okay, pretty sure it's out now might actually been today.

146
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:40,989
Speaker 1: I think it's out out Yeah, but I think it might have actually been out out as of literally today.

147
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,117
Speaker 0: Let's see when the release date is on Steam.

148
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:44,799
Speaker 0: half-life Alex.

149
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:45,943
Speaker 0: March 23rd yesterday.

150
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,163
Speaker 0: Yep.

151
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,270
Speaker 1: So I've seen some early reviews.

152
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,695
Speaker 1: I plan to play it Probably this weekend.

153
00:09:50,715 --> 00:10:01,272
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to play the whole thing through but it Appears based on the early reviews I've seen but I have not played it yet that it is definitely one of those of the VR That's out.

154
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:06,650
Speaker 1: Not only is a peak experience, but it might be one of the best VR experiences possible.

155
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,150
Speaker 0: We're I mean the important the impression that I've got.

156
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:14,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, the impression that I've gotten is that yeah, every other VR thing is pooped.

157
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:29,270
Speaker 0: now This is like, you know much the way because like half-life 1 sort of set the bar, right and then half-life 2 Sort of also set the bar kinda it for you know, just in other ways, right but like VR is still pretty early technology.

158
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:34,050
Speaker 1: So like a lot of games have set the bar so far, but the bar is still relatively low.

159
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:44,560
Speaker 0: But valve, you know and basically announced like hey the reason we haven't released a half-life 3 We've made several of them is because none of them were good enough Like they refused to release a half-life.

160
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:52,948
Speaker 0: unless it sets a new bar And half-life Alex appears as if it might for you know, VR games be setting the new bar.

161
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,973
Speaker 1: So, there you go I will play it this weekend to see.

162
00:10:55,093 --> 00:11:06,110
Speaker 1: but the VR game I've been playing lately is Currently one of the things that has set a bar because super hot was super great but pistol-width is Amazing what it is.

163
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:12,720
Speaker 1: It's a rail shooter Which is a perfect kind of game to make in VR because you can avoid a lot of the motion sickness problems.

164
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,008
Speaker 0: So it's time crisis.

165
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:16,100
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's it's John wick.

166
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,620
Speaker 1: You're basically just walking forward at a constant rate and enemies pop up everywhere and you got to shoot him.

167
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:25,735
Speaker 1: But the thing that makes it great is that it's actually not really a shooter.

168
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,340
Speaker 1: It's a rhythm game.

169
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,646
Speaker 0: There's games like that.

170
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:39,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's pumping music and in this 3d VR world with a lot of abstract like imagery and abstract shapes and all this fun stuff.

171
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:44,340
Speaker 1: You're just doing this rhythm shooter and it feels like the scene in John wick one.

172
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,485
Speaker 1: We're just walking through murdering Russian mobsters one by one in the nightclub.

173
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,130
Speaker 1: It basically feels like that constantly and it's crazy fun.

174
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:53,106
Speaker 0: And also isn't that what?

175
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:53,548
Speaker 0: isn't that?

176
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,654
Speaker 0: what time crisis feels like?

177
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:58,207
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but time crisis It doesn't have the like the heavy rhythm element.

178
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 0: I guess that's true, but I have seen a rhythm shooters before.

179
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,760
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I think this area is a various mechanism.

180
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,564
Speaker 1: This is blended.

181
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,331
Speaker 1: this a lot of what super hot did.

182
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,788
Speaker 1: Well what I mean isn't What Tokyo 911 does.

183
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,054
Speaker 1: well the game that we used to know.

184
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:17,890
Speaker 0: No, I mean there's already The the blade one beat saver, right?

185
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,432
Speaker 0: There's already.

186
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,315
Speaker 1: that's not a shooter.

187
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:19,958
Speaker 1: That's just a rhythm.

188
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:21,544
Speaker 0: It's a sorter It's a rhythm sword.

189
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:22,830
Speaker 0: Yes, and now you have a rhythm gunner.

190
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,784
Speaker 1: Yep, but the rhythm gun saver with gun There aren't.

191
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:29,600
Speaker 1: I have not seen a game that has combined all of these three things together.

192
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:37,907
Speaker 0: so wasn't there the one that used at the Omega thon the the Harmonics one that was like a rhythm gunner.

193
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,233
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

194
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:46,204
Speaker 1: Yeah that that does a lot of these feelings But it doesn't also have the Tokyo 911 feeling Hmm.

195
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess visually that was just a bunch of colors and lights and things.

196
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a rhythm game that purely whereas this one this one is a rhythm game.

197
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,227
Speaker 0: But the visuals are actually a time crisis.

198
00:12:56,267 --> 00:13:03,420
Speaker 1: visual yep, and dodging it feels exactly like it feels in that police 9-1-1 Whatever that we always played in Wildwood you and your police.

199
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,680
Speaker 0: No, no that gives great.

200
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:16,138
Speaker 1: And I got really good at it because it was as the arcades in a Wildwood got worse and worse and worse that one game Was still there way late to the party it was still just hanging out it barely worked And that was the only game I would play eventually.

201
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:24,900
Speaker 1: anyway, I guess it's time for things of the day.

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,170
Speaker 1: You you've talked up your thing in the day and now that I'm looking at it I see why I've seen this comic before.

203
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,497
Speaker 0: oh you have seen it before.

204
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:42,392
Speaker 0: yeah I have not seen it before at least not before yesterday, so Apparently there is this Hungarian comic strip, and I don't know if how you you know the.

205
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:45,340
Speaker 0: the alphabet of the Hungarian language looks you car.

206
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:50,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, looks somewhere between English and Cyrillic, so I don't know how to pronounce the words.

207
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,860
Speaker 0: I'll just so sorry anyone who knows how to read Hungarian.

208
00:13:54,383 --> 00:14:00,887
Speaker 0: I assume that that the name of the character and the name of the comic is Drusika which is similar like the equivalent of Jessica.

209
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:09,708
Speaker 0: right hmm, but anyway, so this deal with this comic is it was created by Somebody named.

210
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,450
Speaker 0: what was their name?

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:29,873
Speaker 0: Hold on the creator's name is Poots I Paul which probably pronouncing that wrong also And it was published in some sort of publications magazines or newspapers in Hungary between the 50s and the 70s.

212
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,998
Speaker 0: so it had like a good like 20-year run.

213
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:40,618
Speaker 0: basically And even though it's Hungarian you can read these comics because there's very little dialogue in them.

214
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,727
Speaker 0: basically none It's almost all.

215
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,777
Speaker 0: the gags are entirely visual.

216
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:52,968
Speaker 0: occasionally They'll be like a sign with something written on it And each comic will have like a title like Jessica dresses the shop's window.

217
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,159
Speaker 0: Jessica is hiking Jessica in rush-hour traffic, right?

218
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,055
Speaker 0: And there's two different Twitter accounts that are posting comics from this.

219
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:07,806
Speaker 0: one of them is Jessica Daily and one of them is Jessica in order In order.

220
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:17,120
Speaker 0: one is publishing them in order duh Instead of just random selections is posting them one a day and is posting translations and contextual info.

221
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:24,385
Speaker 0: So I recommend the in order one over the other one mm-hmm But it's actually somewhat fascinating.

222
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:39,940
Speaker 0: I looked into how this comic became a thing in the u.s.. It's actually a 4chan deal Apparently Someone on 4chan because basically the idea of the comic is is it the main character is this woman Jessica Jessica?

223
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:49,740
Speaker 0: Whatever and each three panel comic like she's up to shenanigans and the shenanigans are usually sexy in nature But not always yep, but they're not over the line.

224
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,263
Speaker 1: They're just like.

225
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,510
Speaker 1: I don't know they.

226
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,099
Speaker 1: I get a tiny almost eraser.

227
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:56,718
Speaker 1: It's her kind of vibe like she's very lum ask in the way she interacts with people.

228
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,120
Speaker 0: right.

229
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,256
Speaker 0: It's weird cuz sometimes you know for something made from the 50s to the 70s in a communist Hungary right.

230
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:17,053
Speaker 0: sometimes It's sort of male gaze II obviously right which isn't so great, but a lot of times It's actually sort of like a feminist satire like Or you know sexually empowering in different ways right like the

231
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:22,229
Speaker 1: one where the guy is like being a little too Handsy at the dance and she she gets him.

232
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,880
Speaker 0: yeah, there's ones where this guys are too handsy and she like you know hurts them

233
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:26,903
Speaker 1: Right,

234
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:42,914
Speaker 0: but there's also ones were like she's into a dude, and she's like hey Right like there's one where she's dancing at like a costume party, and she's wearing like she's dressed like a you know French Aristocracy from 1800s big big dress and the dude she's dancing with.

235
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,339
Speaker 0: you know who looks like King herp.

236
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,989
Speaker 0: the derp Can't get close enough, and they're dancing awkwardly.

237
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:53,636
Speaker 0: so she sort of sneaks out of the dress And then she's dancing in like her underwear yeah, and it's sort of like hey.

238
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:54,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if?

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,685
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know not all the comics are sexy though There's some that are just like.

240
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:09,140
Speaker 0: this is one here where an old lady loses a bird so she climbs up the tree with a cage to go get the bird and She gives the old lady a cat and the joke is the cat ate the bird

241
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:15,577
Speaker 1: She's afraid of the mouse and she jumps into the arms of a much more dangerous animal.

242
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:19,807
Speaker 0: yeah So you know and also glad you know.

243
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:24,651
Speaker 0: the other thing that's great about this comic is just the art style and aesthetic of it Is crazy good?

244
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,582
Speaker 0: right It's?

245
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:37,156
Speaker 0: you know it gives me some Katie Skelly vibes going on, but you know overall I'm just way into it, so I recommend following this Twitter account.

246
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:50,829
Speaker 0: reading this comic And you know it makes me want to learn more about other You know comic strips from other countries that you know because it's not like there's that many new Newspaper comic strips.

247
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,398
Speaker 0: right they're all webcomics now.

248
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:57,620
Speaker 0: And I already do know a lot of webcomics from other countries to some extent right.

249
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:04,907
Speaker 0: But I don't know a lot about the old newspaper comics from other countries that didn't become world's Popular.

250
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:26,974
Speaker 0: yeah You know ones that were in smaller publications or at smaller runs or were never republished or licensed in other languages or anything like that, so Yeah, whoever found this and made it a thing late last year Thanks, and now everyone can enjoy it and you can see the follower counts on the Twitter accounts.

251
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:33,280
Speaker 0: the follower cats on the turn For these comics are increasing dramatically recently.

252
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:35,406
Speaker 0: Get in on the.

253
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,275
Speaker 0: get in on it, so I'm gonna cheat.

254
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:40,531
Speaker 1: I am linking to a channel I have linked to once before a while back.

255
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,576
Speaker 1: technology actions.

256
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:44,458
Speaker 0: well But I'll fail on you.

257
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:45,423
Speaker 1: I like.

258
00:18:45,443 --> 00:19:03,580
Speaker 1: this video is pretty good because one of the things that I really am fascinated by our Electro mechanical devices like old pre like pre modern integrated circuit arcade machines things like that Like a pinball machine yeah, but this one is a fancy complicated jukebox with song selection.

259
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:09,620
Speaker 1: Okay, complicated song selection, and it's not a teardown of like the entire jukebox.

260
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,446
Speaker 1: So you did make some videos for all that too.

261
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:18,654
Speaker 1: It's a deep like half-hour long explanation of one specific part of the jukebox and it is a

262
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,557
Speaker 0: relay

263
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:38,840
Speaker 1: driven accumulator like an old-fashioned accumulator because In the era before I sees like if you wanted to put logic into something You there were design patterns to do that kind of thing and an accumulator is actually one of the like Core electronic components that you could use to build complex machinery

264
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:39,762
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm

265
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:44,869
Speaker 1: like you know if you ever learn how to make circuits like you learn about adders And you learn about making Nand gates and stuff.

266
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a computer science degree.

267
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:46,738
Speaker 0: I learned that.

268
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:50,052
Speaker 1: yep I was supposed to have learned that yep, but I don't think a lot of people have.

269
00:19:50,112 --> 00:20:05,407
Speaker 1: so if you want to see a Reasonably complex electromechanical accumulator that relies not just on circuits and Relays, but also on big heavy metal pins and springs that are holding them under tension This thing's actually pretty amazing.

270
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:12,635
Speaker 0: how a lot of the problem with a lot of those things though is like you know You know pinball machines right there always breaking and you have to keep fixing them right.

271
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,358
Speaker 0: so how often it?

272
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,788
Speaker 0: How reliable is this jukebox before super reliable?

273
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:21,100
Speaker 1: the machine actually is working and fully restored except for the coin?

274
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,426
Speaker 1: collection mechanism.

275
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:25,320
Speaker 1: no one can figure out how to make it work, haha.

276
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:34,874
Speaker 1: So all they did and the crazy thing is the way it works is there's a solenoid inside that when it's powered Pulls a bunch of levers and activates like a million circuits everywhere like.

277
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,720
Speaker 1: that's basically the equivalent of copy protection.

278
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:42,380
Speaker 1: They can't figure out how to make that solenoid be triggered by the coin accumulator.

279
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:51,387
Speaker 1: So instead they just hard-coded it to always be powered if the machine is plugged in What it's basically an always play mode Mmm in the meta moment.

280
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:54,660
Speaker 1: and like I said we're recording the show a weird way.

281
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:58,040
Speaker 1: So it might sound a little bit different and we're gonna have to tweak this process as we go on.

282
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,320
Speaker 1: But otherwise I think we can do the show like this just fine.

283
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,999
Speaker 1: I'll make some tweaks and by next week you probably won't even notice the difference.

284
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,720
Speaker 1: Maybe otherwise the booklet book remains the tale of Genji not the tale of Ozo.

285
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,785
Speaker 0: We'll see if we can do some reading.

286
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:12,467
Speaker 0: have you been reading?

287
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:16,260
Speaker 1: I have not because I've been playing the original xcom.

288
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like because I'm at home.

289
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:18,911
Speaker 0: I don't have.

290
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,620
Speaker 0: I'm doing all this other stuff instead.

291
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,694
Speaker 0: It's like I got all this extra time of the day.

292
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,067
Speaker 0: I don't need to Read on the right way.

293
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:31,859
Speaker 1: I'm playing original xcom tonight I'll be starting to play some Animal Crossing and I'm also gonna be building my hurdy-gurdy pretty soon.

294
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,309
Speaker 0: I'm playing.

295
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,180
Speaker 0: I'm playing the new doom eternal Got a little bit of Zelda randomizer and I might play some Animal Crossing.

296
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,722
Speaker 0: We'll see.

297
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:41,404
Speaker 0: it's.

298
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,371
Speaker 0: you know, the $60 is the main thing.

299
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,836
Speaker 0: I mean it was less than that.

300
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,358
Speaker 0: I would play it.

301
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:49,195
Speaker 1: No question That's why I got it physical because I can always sell it to someone later or give it away.

302
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:51,305
Speaker 0: and I figured yeah I don't really like doing it.

303
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:51,706
Speaker 0: Whatever.

304
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I figured I've never.

305
00:21:53,132 --> 00:22:06,508
Speaker 1: I've never been on an Animal Crossing train and while I have an idea of what the game is like I don't really know because I've never played it and I've never really seen anything about it except memes and Screenshots and other people who are into it talking about it.

306
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,655
Speaker 0: It's literally just walk around and do stuff.

307
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:11,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm gonna play it I'm gonna mooch around and see what the deal is.

308
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:14,055
Speaker 0: All right, maybe I'll play it.

309
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:14,397
Speaker 0: We'll see.

310
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:20,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see But otherwise, obviously we are not attending any conventions for the foreseeable future.

311
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaker 1: The nope most likely the next convention we will even possibly be able to attend if it happens will be packs West.

312
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:28,816
Speaker 0: Well, that was already the next convention.

313
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:35,860
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I was gonna be a Zenka Khan and kinetic on some other stuff, but I'm assuming everything through packs is cancelled.

314
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,869
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna bother trying to go to those con.

315
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,416
Speaker 0: X may even be cancelled.

316
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:39,998
Speaker 1: It may well be.

317
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:43,140
Speaker 1: Hopefully things are good by unplugged and magfest.

318
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,279
Speaker 0: We'll see.

319
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:46,498
Speaker 1: I'm already making magfest plans.

320
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,259
Speaker 0: All right, that's good.

321
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:49,703
Speaker 0: We need those.

322
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:50,144
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:59,991
Speaker 1: So, uh, we are reviewing two board games today because while they're both pretty good And they're pretty deep games in terms of like what we could say about them.

324
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,460
Speaker 1: There's not a lot to say about them.

325
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:04,972
Speaker 0: No, no, no, they're relatively simple.

326
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,559
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons why this will be.

327
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:15,224
Speaker 1: There's not a lot to say so even though we always try to stretch it out and only do one game per show I feel like we really need to have talked about two games Mm-hmm.

328
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:21,236
Speaker 1: So let's start with the game that I think we Internalized more and that I think we played more than once.

329
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:25,554
Speaker 1: that one Yep, and that I think we will want to own if you don't buy it.

330
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:28,245
Speaker 0: I'll buy it because Matt This was actually citizen.

331
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:31,660
Speaker 0: first look at PAX East and it was actually our friend Matt's copy.

332
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:32,748
Speaker 0: That was in the first look.

333
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,775
Speaker 0: not PAX is copy.

334
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,925
Speaker 0: Yep They're going.

335
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:42,780
Speaker 0: the game is called no return as As kinds of look if I don't know how to pronounce that German.

336
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:51,380
Speaker 0: But I do know that the the the it translates to there is no turning back Right and the game designer is Marco toy Bner.

337
00:23:52,404 --> 00:24:08,700
Speaker 0: And basically there is no turning back is exactly what this game is about, you know We've played tons of board games out there that have some sort of dual currency system Right where the way to win the game is to get victory points, but there's also this other currency like money, right?

338
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,182
Speaker 0: So in st.

339
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:12,336
Speaker 0: Petersburg, it's very literal this victory points and there's coins.

340
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:16,740
Speaker 0: Yeah in Puerto Rico there's doubloons and victory points.

341
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:17,442
Speaker 1: Yeah I do.

342
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:24,449
Speaker 1: balloon in round two is worth way more than a doubloon in round eight Right and race to the galaxy, which is similar to Puerto Rico.

343
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,096
Speaker 0: It's a little more abstract than that, right?

344
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,500
Speaker 0: Yeah in Agricola It's a little bit more abstract, right?

345
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,560
Speaker 0: But there are some resources in the game it over Agricola that are worth less points and some that are worth more points.

346
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,940
Speaker 0: But the ones that are worth less points can be used to purchase things that get you points.

347
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:45,995
Speaker 1: So like if you if you've played Dominion There's it's a got a really good example because early in the game you're trying to get money.

348
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:56,754
Speaker 1: you're getting so you're like to have More buying power you're getting powers But none of those things actually win the game for you or wins the game for you are those green cards that don't do anything Usually right exactly.

349
00:24:57,076 --> 00:25:02,434
Speaker 1: So no Panic time happens when people realize the game's ending and they get as many green cards as they can.

350
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:10,260
Speaker 0: All right, so the the implicit Idea in all of those games is that you have to decide at some point in the game.

351
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,269
Speaker 0: Obviously in the early game, you're not getting the victory points.

352
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,594
Speaker 0: You're in the early game.

353
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,520
Speaker 0: You can't get the victory points.

354
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,286
Speaker 0: You're getting all these other things to build a machine to get the victory points and it's sort of a gradual Gray line.

355
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,700
Speaker 0: you can get some victory points early, right?

356
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:38,000
Speaker 0: You can also maybe get some big money late and you can sort of Transition slowly from focusing on one to the other as the game goes and sort of feel your way through Right and then at the duchy panic time hard shift into victory point only mode.

357
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:48,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, no No return is a game that is pretty much taking that game mechanic making it explicit and Focusing on it to the exclusion of all else.

358
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:57,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, so every you're just going around and every turn you're basically like do I Continue to do the a phase or do I say fuck it and go to the B phase, right?

359
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Speaker 0: You literally on your turn your everyone starts in phase a. in phase a what you're doing is adding your Taking tiles and building up a pool of points right that you could score.

360
00:26:08,823 --> 00:26:12,680
Speaker 0: Right, so and then at the beginning of any of your turns you can say, you know what?

361
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,592
Speaker 0: I am switching to phase B. And of course the name of the game.

362
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:17,280
Speaker 0: There's no turning back, right?

363
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,680
Speaker 0: And as soon as you're in phase B, you can no longer increase your point pool.

364
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:30,340
Speaker 0: Your maximum score has been set But you are using the rest of the game in order to take that pool of points and actually convert it into points.

365
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:38,240
Speaker 0: Alright, so if you were to switch in a phase B too early you would end up converting all your potential points into points.

366
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,364
Speaker 0: And you're you would end up.

367
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:45,140
Speaker 0: the game would continue going with extra turns because you've switched too early And now you're not your met.

368
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,440
Speaker 0: Your score is not gonna be as high as it could have been had you switched a turn later and had a bigger pool.

369
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:58,720
Speaker 0: If you switch too late What will end up happening is you have a big pool of points that's full of so many points and you can't convert them.

370
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:06,789
Speaker 0: And then the game ends with some of your points are unconverted and even worse unconverted points are negative points Unconverted points are negative.

371
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:16,310
Speaker 0: So literally the entire game is decide exactly the right moment of switching from Increase your point pool to choose.

372
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,500
Speaker 0: you start eating up your point pool and converting it into actual points.

373
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:23,333
Speaker 0: Right, so the same as many many other board games.

374
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:29,133
Speaker 0: only just that one mechanic You know just super super polished.

375
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:30,800
Speaker 0: one thing one thing early

376
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:45,180
Speaker 1: And if you play it with people who are canny at games and who recognize this game for what it is It feels like a high-stakes poker game Like everyone's playing real carefully everyone's looking at each other and then suddenly someone's like phase B and then oh shit

377
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:53,880
Speaker 0: Right, if you think of a normal board game that has a lot of different things going on Right like a typical euro game is like maybe you know, like a chocolate chip cookie, right?

378
00:27:54,363 --> 00:28:03,840
Speaker 0: This is literally just a chocolate chip It's all marshmallow one ingredient and they made that ingredient digestible and it's pure uncooked form.

379
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:05,886
Speaker 1: It's just eating the insides of Oreos.

380
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:09,517
Speaker 1: It's just eating the marshmallows from Lucky Charms and not eating the rest of that poison.

381
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,963
Speaker 0: Yep So yeah, if you you know, the game is quick It's me.

382
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:19,347
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of tiles in a in a in a in a bag, basically Yeah, they could be.

383
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,716
Speaker 1: cards like this could be a card game.

384
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:23,995
Speaker 0: just fine I think the tiles make it easy.

385
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:24,800
Speaker 0: I guess it could be a card.

386
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:33,108
Speaker 0: I mean technically any game could be a card game because a card is the most Powerful physical game component.

387
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:37,006
Speaker 1: I defy you to make Maria a card game You could make.

388
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:42,510
Speaker 0: you could fear you couldn't make it good, but you can theoretically make Any board game out of cards only.

389
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,995
Speaker 0: no matter right?

390
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,320
Speaker 0: You can replace dice with cards.

391
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,550
Speaker 0: You can replace tiles with cards.

392
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,660
Speaker 0: You can place pawns with cards.

393
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,900
Speaker 0: Any any other game component can be replaced with cards.

394
00:28:51,080 --> 00:29:01,131
Speaker 1: so one that's hardest to replace is maps unless you literally are just a bunch of cards and The map is just one big card.

395
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:02,700
Speaker 0: Yeah sure big card.

396
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:16,995
Speaker 1: But the mechanic the actual physical mechanics of the game are pretty good too because they're literally just you're laying out the numbers in Suits of colors and you have to go in order so you'll play.

397
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,300
Speaker 1: have this give-and-take of?

398
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:25,560
Speaker 1: Do I blow my load now or do I wait for more tiles to come into my hand kind of like lost cities?

399
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,746
Speaker 0: It's basically exactly lost cities.

400
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:28,809
Speaker 0: the tile playing is.

401
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,374
Speaker 0: it is a hundred percent lost cities.

402
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:32,020
Speaker 0: you go from high to low.

403
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:35,488
Speaker 0: right You know you can't?

404
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:37,399
Speaker 0: you got to put the same color or the same stack.

405
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,220
Speaker 0: You can't go inserting something in the middle of the stack.

406
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,129
Speaker 0: Eleven ten seven.

407
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,059
Speaker 0: well all your eights and nines are worthless now.

408
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,635
Speaker 0: Right you gave up on trying to find them and you can see the stacks.

409
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:50,160
Speaker 1: everyone else is making that part.

410
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,405
Speaker 0: You can't see their hand.

411
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,073
Speaker 1: nope, but you can see the stacks.

412
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:54,660
Speaker 0: so do you know the odds?

413
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,791
Speaker 1: So if a bunch of other people are really building big stacks of yellow Then that can inform your decisions in a pretty clear way.

414
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:05,083
Speaker 0: right and you still need you know When you're.

415
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:12,066
Speaker 0: when you switch to phase two let's say I build a big old yellow stack like eleven ten nine Eight seven seven.

416
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,370
Speaker 0: right it's got a lot of points in it.

417
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:21,580
Speaker 0: I need to have in my hand in phase two Tiles with very high number values to be able to eat those away.

418
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:25,540
Speaker 0: You can't eat up a lot of points unless you have big numbered tiles.

419
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:35,560
Speaker 0: So it can actually be dangerous to build a very strong pool Even if it doesn't take you very long to build it because it would take you so long to eat it away.

420
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,293
Speaker 0: You'll be left with like an eleven left on the board.

421
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,218
Speaker 0: It's a negative eleven.

422
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:39,620
Speaker 0: That's bad

423
00:30:39,786 --> 00:30:58,059
Speaker 1: Yep or maybe if you like near the end of phase one when you're getting ready for phase two if your hand is just full of giant numbers then other players might Expect that they'll be able to eat more of their point total than they possibly could and you might start phase B early and just Go for it, and they'll all be left holding the bag

424
00:30:58,647 --> 00:30:58,890
Speaker 0: You know?

425
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,660
Speaker 0: or let's like okay?

426
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:04,058
Speaker 0: I got my yellows right and I skipped over nine and eight and then I get them later and I go.

427
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,324
Speaker 0: oh I missed.

428
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,530
Speaker 0: I could have put them in my pool.

429
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,912
Speaker 0: It's like well.

430
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:07,575
Speaker 0: No that's fine.

431
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,893
Speaker 0: That's 17 points You can now eat away from the pool you did make.

432
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,781
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not too bad Just hold it You know.

433
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:26,486
Speaker 0: just hold on to them if you can't play them or if you see another player really needs something and if it's a big number hold on to it, but all your small numbers you kind of want to like I Feel like when you want to switch to phase two It's like you feel it coming.

434
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:30,643
Speaker 0: you can just sort of sense it like all right the games that we've reached the peak Play.

435
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:34,660
Speaker 0: play out all your small things that you can to get them out of your hand.

436
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:46,519
Speaker 0: So that way when you start phase B You'll have bigger things in your hand and you can have more efficient phase B. Yeah, right if you start phase B with a bunch of small things your phase B's gonna start with a whimper.

437
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:53,549
Speaker 0: Everyone's gonna see that you move to phase B. You're not gonna eat away that many points right away And then who knows what you're gonna draw out of the bag.

438
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:54,473
Speaker 0: you could be in big trouble.

439
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:58,299
Speaker 1: now on a more like abstract level One thing I would say to all of you is that this game?

440
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:09,054
Speaker 1: Well in the end be a lot like Yahtzee in that if Yahtzee mechanics are in a lot of other games if you get good At Yahtzee, then you will be good at that part of every other game that has it.

441
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,680
Speaker 1: if you get good at no return.

442
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:15,723
Speaker 1: You will start to recognize all the no returns and all the other games You play.

443
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:15,883
Speaker 1: like.

444
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,329
Speaker 1: if you play this game and get good at it.

445
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,638
Speaker 1: You will be a god at st.

446
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:20,100
Speaker 1: Petersburg.

447
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:24,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah pretty much like I said There's so many other games that have that mechanic.

448
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,691
Speaker 0: right of.

449
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,360
Speaker 0: when do I switch from doing you know working on?

450
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,447
Speaker 0: This part of the game to that other part of the game?

451
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:32,756
Speaker 0: right you know pretty much every euro game.

452
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:35,360
Speaker 0: what crown of Amara rims favorite?

453
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:39,150
Speaker 0: Even seven wonders right when do I seven wonders.

454
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,460
Speaker 0: you start out by building up your little resource stack and then later?

455
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,599
Speaker 0: You're playing greens and blues.

456
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,124
Speaker 0: Right right.

457
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,827
Speaker 0: It's like all right.

458
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,112
Speaker 0: I don't need more resources anymore.

459
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,020
Speaker 0: green green green science science science.

460
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, the minion.

461
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:52,371
Speaker 1: I'm like dutchy dutchy dutchy dutchy right.

462
00:32:52,712 --> 00:33:00,816
Speaker 0: so get good at this game, and then you will be able to See this same mechanic in every other game and be good at it as well.

463
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:04,629
Speaker 1: quick to play quick to teach Satisfying like half-hour tops.

464
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:06,576
Speaker 1: to play this game including teaching.

465
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:07,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can learn it.

466
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,041
Speaker 0: You could.

467
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:11,108
Speaker 0: anyone can play it accessible to everyone not just nerds.

468
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,454
Speaker 1: super good, so the other game.

469
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:13,915
Speaker 1: We played.

470
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:17,305
Speaker 1: I don't Think you should buy it.

471
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:21,077
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can buy square on sale.

472
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,020
Speaker 1: It's an actually.

473
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,804
Speaker 0: It's actually from 2005 But it's considered.

474
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:28,660
Speaker 0: first look because it was not easy to obtain in the u.s.

475
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,115
Speaker 0: It's like a Japanese published game, and we they somehow got a copy of it designed by a.

476
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,800
Speaker 1: so what I tied you right?

477
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,109
Speaker 0: so basically what this game is is it's Othello.

478
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,876
Speaker 0: you've played Othello also.

479
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,602
Speaker 0: that is Iago or Reversi.

480
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:46,011
Speaker 1: it's weird how many people to only notice Reversi.

481
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,400
Speaker 1: I ran into a co-worker like last month who?

482
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,908
Speaker 1: Literally had no idea what Othello was.

483
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,253
Speaker 0: I knew it as a fellow because that's what the board game in the store was called Right, but then on like on the computer.

484
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,298
Speaker 0: I was like Reversi.

485
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:58,740
Speaker 0: What's that?

486
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:10,239
Speaker 0: And I'm like oh, it's Othello same same and then and then on Linux in KDE Linux KDE on Linux there was a there was like K Iago or something and I was like what is Iago?

487
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,417
Speaker 0: I'm like oh, it's Reversi.

488
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,632
Speaker 0: How many different names are there for this stupid game?

489
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:16,060
Speaker 0: It's like Klondike solitaire.

490
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:19,014
Speaker 0: It's all these same names for this different names of this game now.

491
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:24,271
Speaker 1: I've never seen a game Incorporate Othello so nakedly before except like.

492
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,076
Speaker 1: actually you know what did of all things?

493
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,560
Speaker 1: Wario were on the Gamecube?

494
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,088
Speaker 1: Yes, but it did.

495
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:35,659
Speaker 1: but the point I want to make and just remember what I'm about to say And we'll get to it in later in this review.

496
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:49,300
Speaker 1: There is a fundamental problem with Othello in that the heuristics or the math like the hard math to Actually be good at Othello are not really human implementable like humans Cannot do that.

497
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:58,210
Speaker 1: It is very hard to learn that the right way to be good at Othello at any scale But it is trivial on a small board.

498
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,096
Speaker 0: You could do it it even.

499
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:06,445
Speaker 1: yeah like a four Tile board sure yeah six tile It's not like the tiniest.

500
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,332
Speaker 1: as soon as you get above like three by three.

501
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:10,179
Speaker 1: humans cannot be good at Othello.

502
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,369
Speaker 0: Well Othello is typically played on like what?

503
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,420
Speaker 0: five by five seven by seven something like that.

504
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,850
Speaker 0: But yeah, but a lot of the I don't know what the.

505
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,080
Speaker 0: I guess the actual board game is a huge board, right?

506
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 0: But the most of the apps I played where it would let you choose the board size I remember five by five and seven by seven usually being defaults.

507
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,493
Speaker 1: But there is a easy algorithm for computers that can play Othello perfectly.

508
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,748
Speaker 1: if you play any like random Othello online There's a decent chance it implements that algorithm.

509
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:36,651
Speaker 1: You will never win.

510
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,580
Speaker 0: There's literally no way to just use that algorithm in your human head.

511
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:42,672
Speaker 1: It's too difficult for a human to do in their head.

512
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,480
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone's ever played Othello.

513
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,086
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll spend this this my free time.

514
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:48,530
Speaker 1: I tried.

515
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,340
Speaker 1: I. I actually have some really fucking complex.

516
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,240
Speaker 0: My heuristic for Othello is get in the corner.

517
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:57,027
Speaker 0: No one could take you once you're in the corner.

518
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:06,540
Speaker 1: my heuristic is based on a point value that I've assigned to every type of Square on the board and then that and then those points are mitigated or altered by board states.

519
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:17,080
Speaker 1: But I can't say like I can't say the rule for doing that I've just memorized certain patterns and if I see those patterns in the local area, I know how to interact with that area.

520
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,649
Speaker 0: Anyway, so square on sale is Othello.

521
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:22,339
Speaker 0: However, there is two big changes to this game, right?

522
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,067
Speaker 0: Change number one.

523
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:25,780
Speaker 0: Is it normally in Othello?

524
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,034
Speaker 0: Let's say I place in the top left corner and then the bottom right corner.

525
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:35,359
Speaker 0: all the Pieces on that diagonal would get filled in with my dudes if they're there like if they're filming already.

526
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,974
Speaker 0: Obviously you you're not allowed to play in a regular Othello.

527
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:40,380
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to play non adjacent.

528
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,282
Speaker 1: Yep, you gotta you gotta place it So there were.

529
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:47,480
Speaker 0: converts it so that wouldn't be a legal play in regular Othello unless they were all filled in anyway.

530
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're square on sale.

531
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,703
Speaker 0: It is a legal play for reasons We'll get into.

532
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:59,800
Speaker 0: but anyway, what happens in square on sale is the same thing I play one and I play another play a second piece and all the in-between places are now mine.

533
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:11,900
Speaker 0: but instead of just conquering them I Place my pieces on top of the enemy pieces that I've conquered Such that they're each place on the board.

534
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:26,080
Speaker 0: each square is stacking higher and higher right and how high the stack is is how many points that spot is worth and whoever has the top piece in the stack is The owner of those points.

535
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:38,584
Speaker 1: So if the yeah square that changed hands more times is just worth more points to whoever has it when the game ends And the game doesn't end when the thing is full like Othello it ends based on a whole bunch of rules Right.

536
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,060
Speaker 0: The second major thing in the game is that it is a bidding game.

537
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,714
Speaker 0: You don't just on your turn go on a spot that you want to go on You bid on a spot you want to go on with money, right?

538
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,668
Speaker 1: And you can then be on a random spot I could be like I'll bid on the corner.

539
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,815
Speaker 1: I'll just go on the corner right now.

540
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:59,897
Speaker 0: Yep And when you bid you have to basically just outbid the current bid on that spot.

541
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,751
Speaker 0: if there is one There might not be one in which case you could bid like a dollar right.

542
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:11,700
Speaker 0: you put your money on the spots that and the Next person who has to come around knows how high the bar is for bidding and then you don't get that spot.

543
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:21,451
Speaker 0: For three turns you bid you put the two on there it flips down to a one Right the next turn and then the turn after that.

544
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:31,302
Speaker 0: you actually would conquer the spot and if someone out bids you Right, they would take the countdown timer at its current state of two or one Right.

545
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,067
Speaker 0: and we have so now.

546
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:39,479
Speaker 0: if people keep out bidding on a spot it never ticks down because it just keeps staying Yeah at its current position.

547
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:40,745
Speaker 1: This is a little.

548
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:53,429
Speaker 1: it seems a little complex and it is a little bit difficult to teach this but once you start playing it makes sense, basically, you have a limited number of dollars and you can bid and Overbid and you'll just leave a pile of dollars on the space

549
00:38:53,870 --> 00:39:01,434
Speaker 0: and when you basically what it means is you bid on a space And you win the space if no one out bids you for twice around the board.

550
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:06,759
Speaker 1: Yep, but Once you win a space Yeah You put your law square on top.

551
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:08,767
Speaker 1: But now your money stays there.

552
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:18,479
Speaker 1: and if it's us any space other than the edges every round Instead of doing your bid you can spend an action to take a dollar from all the stacks you've left out there.

553
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,727
Speaker 0: So you might normally on your right.

554
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:27,200
Speaker 0: so on your turn if you have any money in the middle nine spaces You would pick up one dollar from each of the nine spaces.

555
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:33,932
Speaker 0: Right that's left hanging out there to get your money back slowly because you have a limited money supply You just start with all your money, right?

556
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,280
Speaker 0: It's not like you're making money.

557
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:44,997
Speaker 0: It's like you start with all your money you put it out to bid and after if you get outbid you get all the money Back, but if you successfully bid then the money you bid slowly comes back to you, right?

558
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,872
Speaker 0: From I guess your people paying rent who live in the building you own.

559
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,540
Speaker 0: Yes is the metaphor, right?

560
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:59,380
Speaker 0: But if you put money on the outside spaces that not the nine central spaces the outside Five ten sixteen spaces, right?

561
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,462
Speaker 0: That money?

562
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:04,772
Speaker 0: because the outside spaces are stronger because it's a fellow right?

563
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,156
Speaker 0: Those are harder to take away.

564
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,680
Speaker 0: They're not more powerful.

565
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,247
Speaker 1: They're not as powerful as an Othello because someone doesn't have to maneuver Heuristically to take them.

566
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:19,346
Speaker 1: they can take them just by bidding on top of you Any time.

567
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:22,500
Speaker 0: those out the money that you put in those outside spaces.

568
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,759
Speaker 0: You don't just get back slowly from rents.

569
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:32,520
Speaker 0: You have to forgo bidding for a turn and then you can take one dollar from every stack you have on an outside space.

570
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:45,600
Speaker 0: so if you go for a lot of outside spaces try to make lots of strong Othello plays and put out lots of your Building square tiles then you will end up with your money stuck in the outside edges of the board.

571
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,980
Speaker 0: You'll have to spend your turns getting that money back when other people will come in and actually reconquer all the spaces.

572
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, while you're not bidding.

573
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,754
Speaker 0: and now what did you actually get right?

574
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,200
Speaker 1: and then I think the game ends.

575
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,284
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of conditions.

576
00:40:58,324 --> 00:40:59,429
Speaker 1: But what are the conditions?

577
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,979
Speaker 1: is I think what if every square square has something in it?

578
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if every square has something in it the game end.

579
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,700
Speaker 1: if one player puts out others.

580
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:09,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you put out all your squares the game ends.

581
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:13,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Forget there might be another end condition, but there's another.

582
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:16,140
Speaker 0: This is one other mechanic.

583
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:21,720
Speaker 0: There's one other mechanic involving some jammies on the board to incentivize you spaces.

584
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,120
Speaker 0: There's little jammies on the board at the early game.

585
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:28,758
Speaker 0: So that let you like, you know can't get some extra points here and there.

586
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:33,740
Speaker 0: It's a sort of so if you go early and get conquered late, you still got some points for going early.

587
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,613
Speaker 0: But that's not really a big deal.

588
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:38,724
Speaker 0: It's more of a balancer Yep, though.

589
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,493
Speaker 1: They are substantial amounts of points.

590
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,860
Speaker 1: It's hard to get points in this game.

591
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not insignificant, but they're they're just sort of like there.

592
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,760
Speaker 1: but that endgame condition that sort of leads to my point.

593
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,730
Speaker 1: Remember that heuristic thing.

594
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,291
Speaker 1: So Othello has Non-human like implementable heuristics like Othello.

595
00:41:53,733 --> 00:42:03,120
Speaker 1: humans basically can't be good at Othello But this game plays in the same heuristic space, but because of all these differences from Othello.

596
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:05,819
Speaker 1: No, Othello heuristics actually work.

597
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:24,071
Speaker 1: So it's as complex as Othello in terms of humans probably can't build reasonable heuristics But simultaneously people are good at Othello will not actually necessarily be good at this game because for example in Othello If you get a corner space, there is literally no way to lose that.

598
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:28,538
Speaker 1: No, like it's invincible in this game Like corner spaces just get eaten.

599
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:36,773
Speaker 1: in Othello you can assign very clear point values to like how Worthwhile the space is because once the space is in it's locked in.

600
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:38,800
Speaker 1: it can only be taken from you by being attacked.

601
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:49,693
Speaker 1: within the placement rules of the game here, there are multiple avenues for attack and Othello ends Well when the game is sort of full and complete kind of like a go ending.

602
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:52,160
Speaker 1: but this game ends on other conditions.

603
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,610
Speaker 1: So you can't rely on the board filling.

604
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,100
Speaker 1: the game might end well before it fills and you're just hosed.

605
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:01,980
Speaker 1: So you can't even rely on any knowledge of Othello to be good at this game, right?

606
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:07,121
Speaker 0: Like I had a pretty good play on the board but then the game ended before my Night.

607
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:16,153
Speaker 0: the ticker ran out on my bid and the result of that was I didn't make the big play and my score Suffered a lot because of the timing of the game ending.

608
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:17,480
Speaker 0: not even worse made a bad play.

609
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,800
Speaker 1: I was doing really well in the beginning, but then I lost a bunch of places.

610
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:31,960
Speaker 1: But that was fine because based on my Othello heuristics because I played a hell a lot of Othello I knew that I would be able to retake those places pretty easily and I had a plan.

611
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:37,640
Speaker 1: And then again the game ended early which is not something that Othello heuristics take into account and I just got boned.

612
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,236
Speaker 1: I went from being in first place by a lot to being in second to last place.

613
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,951
Speaker 0: Yep So even though it's a pretty simple game, it's just got what.

614
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:52,660
Speaker 0: three or four components right up board squares Little money tokens and some jimmies, right?

615
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:59,580
Speaker 0: It's all it is is bidding on spaces and then Othello wing when you win the space Right and then adding up score.

616
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,724
Speaker 0: There's not a lot going on But there is way too much.

617
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:08,940
Speaker 0: that particular combination of simple ingredients ends up being way too complex for human brains.

618
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,695
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't think if I played this ten more times I would be recognizably better at it.

619
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:22,020
Speaker 1: Like I don't think I could get better at it without study and like for Othello.

620
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:23,946
Speaker 1: You know how I got better at Othello as a kid.

621
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:30,048
Speaker 1: study like reading books on it and like playing out Scenarios and memorizing patterns.

622
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:39,320
Speaker 1: that is what it would take to be very good at this game And I don't know if normal people are willing able to do that or if it's even worthwhile to do it.

623
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:49,295
Speaker 0: I don't know if the ceiling on the game is as high as go but it's very very high and the floor is Definitely lower than goes floor.

624
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:50,140
Speaker 0: I think this is much more.

625
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,074
Speaker 0: It's a much more accessible game than go like in go.

626
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,900
Speaker 0: You just basically just get destroyed until you get good enough and recognize enough patterns.

627
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:02,570
Speaker 0: You can actually kind of play this if you just have some brains.

628
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:09,900
Speaker 0: Yep, right, but you can't play it really well Right without a lot like super genius level.

629
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:12,291
Speaker 1: It's almost like while I was playing it like.

630
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,261
Speaker 1: I like to talk a lot about brain field and games Like.

631
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,266
Speaker 1: what does this game feel like?

632
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:18,200
Speaker 1: this game didn't feel like anything?

633
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,681
Speaker 1: I was.

634
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:26,140
Speaker 1: I was like reverting back to these like raw Naked heuristics and like I could not model the game in my brain.

635
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,070
Speaker 1: I was following when we first started like three or four rounds in.

636
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:38,211
Speaker 1: I was modeling it based on Othello and then because of the bidding and everything suddenly my mental model Deviated rapidly from what the game was actually doing.

637
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:43,128
Speaker 1: so I had to throw it all away and just play completely raw and the only the only

638
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:52,720
Speaker 0: way I was able to keep the game in my brain is what I was doing was basically Like it became I would try to look and figure out what to do and it became so messy that I just went like blank.

639
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:59,380
Speaker 0: And when I ended up what I ended up doing was just focusing on a small part of the game only and ignoring the rest.

640
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,483
Speaker 0: Yep, being like, okay.

641
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,486
Speaker 0: Here's my guys.

642
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:02,810
Speaker 0: Here's the play.

643
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,156
Speaker 0: Here's a play that I see that I can make.

644
00:46:05,577 --> 00:46:06,199
Speaker 0: that could work.

645
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,354
Speaker 0: I'll recognize this one aspect of the game and focus on that and ignore everything else.

646
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:16,979
Speaker 0: and that didn't work out great But it got me to help me make a decision at least so about what to do.

647
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:28,797
Speaker 1: I want to play it again, but I don't think that will change anything I have to say about the game and I Really can't recommend anyone buy it.

648
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,934
Speaker 0: No, I mean first of all I don't recommend you.

649
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:35,487
Speaker 0: buy it because this is such an easy game to make.

650
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:38,018
Speaker 0: true You can you don't really need to buy it.

651
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:45,147
Speaker 1: if you could find like your grandpa's Othello You know the one with the green board and the little plastic things like the little.

652
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:52,288
Speaker 0: also I don't know if the game even has a publisher in the United States or in English.

653
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:56,030
Speaker 0: We were playing like a you know sort of a messy looking.

654
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,541
Speaker 0: I don't even know who published the copy we were playing well.

655
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,510
Speaker 0: It wasn't the original Japanese published.

656
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:06,130
Speaker 0: Maybe it was the European one, but we had rules printed from the internet clearly and not a real rule book.

657
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:12,785
Speaker 0: So yeah, I don't even know if you can purchase it if you can you know.

658
00:47:12,905 --> 00:47:17,596
Speaker 1: this is there are two Threads in the board game geek forum for this.

659
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:22,670
Speaker 1: the first one was started 15 years ago, and it just says more information.

660
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:27,149
Speaker 1: The second thread is how to get a copy from eight months ago.

661
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,903
Speaker 1: There are a total of nine posts about this game on all of board game geek right.

662
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:44,088
Speaker 0: so if this is if this game is up Your alley I recommend You know making a copy and playing it that way and if you get really into it Find a way to get a legit copy.

663
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:53,506
Speaker 0: somehow I could see a publisher like say big cat games or someone publishing this in English at some point But I don't think that's happening right now.

664
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,289
Speaker 0: So do what you can, but yeah, this is not for everyone.

665
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:07,645
Speaker 0: But if you are someone who cares about games likes really hard games likes abstract games and bidding games you want that blank feeling that Scott described the like.

666
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:11,144
Speaker 1: I am in a world with no Heuristics like a world with no rules.

667
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:11,749
Speaker 1: What do I do?

668
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:19,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you want a game where you can't apply Most of the things you know about games to it to get better at it quickly.

669
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:20,990
Speaker 1: This is the game for you, right?

670
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,211
Speaker 0: It's like.

671
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,055
Speaker 0: you know about bidding.

672
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:22,939
Speaker 0: that doesn't help you.

673
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,185
Speaker 0: you know about a fellow.

674
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,260
Speaker 0: that doesn't help you even though It's a bidding a fellow.

675
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,591
Speaker 1: primarily It's almost.

676
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:29,932
Speaker 1: you know.

677
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:30,653
Speaker 1: you know what it's like.

678
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:31,975
Speaker 1: you know in.

679
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,139
Speaker 1: oh god and music started playing.

680
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:34,620
Speaker 1: okay there we go.

681
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:37,669
Speaker 1: There's no weird pipeline with the remote thing.

682
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:43,166
Speaker 1: I think that got recorded on your channel, but anyway This you know.

683
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,070
Speaker 1: where was I going?

684
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,416
Speaker 1: I lost my entire train of thought.

685
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:46,139
Speaker 1: now I went blank.

686
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:52,128
Speaker 1: You know when you there's a language like German language You don't speak and there's cognates like some languages.

687
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:58,200
Speaker 1: use the same or a similar sounding word to mean something like tea Chai chai like you can kind of figure stuff out.

688
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:07,656
Speaker 1: It sounds very similar, but then there's false cognates a word that sounds a lot like a word You know, but it actually means something completely different like in French.

689
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:13,714
Speaker 1: I was writing a thing I remember I said like my aunt a formidable like my aunt is formidable.

690
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,720
Speaker 1: that does not really mean formidable.

691
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,450
Speaker 1: That's not what that means in English effectively, but formidable.

692
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:22,756
Speaker 1: and what formidable actually means in French.

693
00:49:22,816 --> 00:49:24,420
Speaker 1: like they're not really the same thing.

694
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:29,023
Speaker 1: So you can be led astray by it appearing to be similar to something You know right.

695
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:33,420
Speaker 0: in Spanish someone might say cerveza, and you might think oh does that have to do with service, right?

696
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:33,681
Speaker 0: It's like.

697
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,487
Speaker 0: no that means beer.

698
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:35,434
Speaker 0: yep, okay.

699
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:35,918
Speaker 0: It's like.

700
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:40,720
Speaker 1: so This game has the is false heuristics.

701
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:50,219
Speaker 1: Yes, if you try to be good at that if you if you're good at bidding and good at Othello I think you will do worse at this game than somebody was never played a bidding game and has never played Othello

702
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:53,655
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm all right, so yeah, that's that's enough of that.

703
00:49:53,796 --> 00:49:54,459
Speaker 1: I think that was a show.

704
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:01,860
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
