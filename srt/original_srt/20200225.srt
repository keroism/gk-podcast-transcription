1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,377
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 25th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:17,947
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight Randomizers, like all of them.

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,522
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:30,090
Speaker 0: We are at the end of a surprisingly long Dense convention season for Geek Nights, like way more than usual

5
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,530
Speaker 1: Because some conventions, you know, start at PAX West in Seattle is normal on Labor Day

6
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,890
Speaker 0: But then like all the other conventions just converge into like one a month for a very

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,898
Speaker 1: Mostly because PAX East is early.

8
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,630
Speaker 1: PAX East was early and then we have Unplugged like around like Because Unplugged and South are, you know, basically on top of each other.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also Magfest was early relative to when Magfest has been in the past.

10
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,170
Speaker 1: South and Magfest are even more on top of each other.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, I worry next year South and Magfest might actually overlap.

12
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:03,930
Speaker 1: No, because uh Magfest is later and it's not New Year's but it's also not MLK Day, which is when South pretty much always is.

13
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:04,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta check.

14
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,783
Speaker 1: South is MLK Day as often as West is Labor Day.

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:14,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, not guaranteed No, but it's as long as, you know, Magfest is not MLK Day.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:23,848
Speaker 0: I'm pretty safe with South not overlapping it directly But what this means is what I haven't been playing all the kinds of games that I normally play because my like.

17
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:24,731
Speaker 0: I've been really Busy.

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,814
Speaker 0: just my life has been busy.

19
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:31,150
Speaker 0: So I've been mostly playing like if I play Overwatch I play in the arcade like RNG mode.

20
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:36,630
Speaker 0: I play like Slay the Spire on the Train or Genshin Clever or Dopple Clever.

21
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:40,624
Speaker 0: I can't get above 200 in Genshin Clever 2.

22
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,070
Speaker 1: Where did you even get Genshin Clever 2?

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,934
Speaker 0: It's just on Android.

24
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:43,939
Speaker 0: It's been on Android forever.

25
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,501
Speaker 1: Oh has it?

26
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have both of them.

27
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,776
Speaker 0: Okay They were like a dollar fifty like they were.

28
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:51,383
Speaker 0: I can get I can reliably like.

29
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:56,562
Speaker 0: my average in Genshin Clever is like 270 280 like I can get that really reliable.

30
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:57,064
Speaker 0: Oh, there it is.

31
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:57,907
Speaker 1: Twice as clever.

32
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:58,550
Speaker 0: Twice as clever.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,184
Speaker 0: 187 is the highest score I have ever been able to achieve so far.

34
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:04,590
Speaker 0: That game is really hard.

35
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:09,506
Speaker 1: Yeah Now someone posted a thing online that was like this is how to get the maximum score.

36
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:10,470
Speaker 1: that the first one.

37
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,414
Speaker 1: Here's a little.

38
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:12,459
Speaker 1: here's a little graphic.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,544
Speaker 0: Oh, what did he say?

40
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:14,770
Speaker 1: Luck is the rest.

41
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,303
Speaker 0: But yeah luck is the rest because I did start penciling in.

42
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,690
Speaker 0: what if I could choose my rolls?

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can make a full web game Like if you just roll right you can have a ridiculously high score.

44
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:38,790
Speaker 0: But I do have a very specific strategy that will reliably like 90% of the time get me well over 200 no matter what even with really bad rolls Mmm, so I basically only play that strategy.

45
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,824
Speaker 0: I did try alternate strategies and I did some like math plotting like.

46
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,345
Speaker 0: is there a way?

47
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:51,490
Speaker 0: because the game comes down to both those games I realized come down to the economy of how many dice can you score?

48
00:02:51,891 --> 00:03:00,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, and anything you can do to score one more die somehow without like Sacrificing something fundamental is just how you get your score up.

49
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, and It all other than that.

50
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,403
Speaker 0: It's just luck mitigation like Yahtzee.

51
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:06,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like these games a lot.

52
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:10,041
Speaker 0: So, uh, there is actually a lot of big news.

53
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:20,139
Speaker 0: as you know PAX East is this week Like we're not gonna do a show on Thursday because we will already have had most of our first day of packs By the time we normally record gig nights.

54
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but maybe you know, the Internet's good at PAX East.

55
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:27,190
Speaker 1: I might experiment with some, you know posting some content from PAX East.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,630
Speaker 1: Yeah with their high quality Wi-Fi that is in the convention center.

57
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,330
Speaker 1: But we're gonna do it lower and follow us at every single place that we exist to see if that happens.

58
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,030
Speaker 0: Like I'm not bringing microphones or video equipment or like I'm not bringing the usual kit.

59
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, my bag has mostly board games in it.

60
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:51,004
Speaker 0: Yep, but the big news is pretty recently Sony just outright said they're pulling they're giving up on PAX East.

61
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:52,670
Speaker 0: They're completely pulling out.

62
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:53,950
Speaker 0: They will have zero present.

63
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:05,986
Speaker 1: So if you looked at the play state the map of the expo hall previously There were these two three two giant blocks and one kind of normal block under the stairs because I had some big Announcements and they were really all said PlayStation on them.

64
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,493
Speaker 1: and then it's like well We're pulling out.

65
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,230
Speaker 1: and now the expo hall map has changed and none of those PlayStation things are there.

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:18,670
Speaker 1: I know the aisles in the front of the expo hall where the mega booths are not the indie mega booth The actual industry mega booths, right?

67
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:27,350
Speaker 0: Are much more widely Because there is no way to fill in a gap like that at a con like pack with a last minute with a week's notice.

68
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,190
Speaker 1: Hey Anyone want to buy a giant expensive booth that I would like a week's notice and Be able to bring everything necessary to fill that space.

69
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,887
Speaker 0: It's like no like it was a. and what's interesting is while there is the coronavirus global issue.

70
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:45,870
Speaker 0: There was no Precipitating news in the US of any kind about this, right?

71
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,170
Speaker 1: It's strange how if you look at coronavirus stuff just around the world in general, right?

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,710
Speaker 1: What we see is pretty much very few places or at least very new.

73
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,313
Speaker 1: I guess it's not.

74
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,663
Speaker 1: it's not newsworthy when someone handles it correctly.

75
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:05,438
Speaker 1: every single news story you see is either about someone not doing enough or Showing doing too much, right?

76
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,109
Speaker 0: So there aren't really any places doing too much though?

77
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:19,527
Speaker 1: No, so for example, right you have like Japan not checking the doctors who are on the boats taking care of people Even though the doctor in China, they're like, oh doctors know what to do.

78
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,230
Speaker 1: They won't have it.

79
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,309
Speaker 1: We don't need to test them except the doctor who discovered it died of it already.

80
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what I can say?

81
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,499
Speaker 1: and then you have people.

82
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,470
Speaker 1: you have situations like this where PlayStation Sony is like pull it out.

83
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,717
Speaker 0: It's like Boston is perfectly safe Because of travel to Boston.

84
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:37,720
Speaker 0: that's it bought.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,628
Speaker 0: the fact that it's in Boston literally does not matter at all would not matter What city on earth the event is in?

86
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:53,805
Speaker 0: Because I note Facebook has also pulled out of PAX East meaning oculus has pulled out of PAX East meaning another area They normally run is now empty and PAX is scrambling to fill it in the VR space.

87
00:05:54,106 --> 00:06:10,150
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm you know, I work in capital markets is my day job and Generally global companies around the entire world regardless of where they are have Drastically curtailed any official travel by employees to events of any kind.

88
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:12,800
Speaker 0: No big gatherings of people anywhere.

89
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:34,841
Speaker 0: because and the main reason is While the risk is relatively low because it's a global issue and because it's spread so easily The issue is every major convention or like industry event where a lot of people go Especially events that draw people from a broad area or an international place or that are just very dense are a Significant increased risk relative to normal times.

90
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,689
Speaker 1: So it's still.

91
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:41,164
Speaker 1: You know, it would make sense if the convention was you know somewhere.

92
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:44,490
Speaker 0: no, like I just said it does there is It literally doesn't matter.

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,067
Speaker 0: It's probably no more dangerous to have it in a city where there are more cases than in a city like Boston.

94
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:57,647
Speaker 1: is a equation Moronic level of caution to the point where it's like one of those people who's like, you know Wearing gloves and walk around in a bubble.

95
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:00,722
Speaker 1: It's like Idiots taking, you know taking too much.

96
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:02,130
Speaker 0: think you know anything about this.

97
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,182
Speaker 1: He's too much caution is just as stupid as being not enough cause.

98
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,150
Speaker 0: this is really too much caution.

99
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,740
Speaker 0: It does not cause Sony anything.

100
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,350
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't cost them anything.

101
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:13,425
Speaker 1: It's just still really stupidly too cautious for no reason.

102
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,330
Speaker 1: It makes them look stupid.

103
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,135
Speaker 1: No I don't think it actually the same way.

104
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:22,450
Speaker 1: someone who's taking too much caution in any area of life looks stupid like someone wearing ten Helmets and like wrapping foam around their body.

105
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:34,430
Speaker 0: the other reason why companies pull out of this stuff is that the people that they normally send to events something broadly like a Lot of events globally have been cancelled and a lot of companies have put the overabundance of caution.

106
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,790
Speaker 0: No, I think it's an adequate like amount of caution.

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:47,293
Speaker 0: It's overabundance of caution depending on the case by now because these are all also events where the people that companies send I'm not talking about you and me is like tax attendees But companies.

108
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:53,670
Speaker 0: it tends to be a relatively small set of people who go to all the events and travel a lot.

109
00:07:53,971 --> 00:08:01,358
Speaker 0: The danger is that super spreader situation of people from a company go to one convention Then another one then another one then another one need.

110
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,650
Speaker 1: they just don't travel to a place that there's a lot of virus.

111
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,060
Speaker 0: I just said that's not part of the equation.

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,104
Speaker 0: You don't know shit about this.

113
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,650
Speaker 0: You're just you're just talking out of your ass.

114
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:13,482
Speaker 1: Yeah No If it was a real danger then packs should just not happen.

115
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:19,550
Speaker 0: if the packs if it's not dangerous Did I not just say there's no significant danger to the attendees the day.

116
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,938
Speaker 1: There's no danger to the attendees.

117
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,590
Speaker 1: then there's no danger to attendees who happen to work for a company.

118
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,605
Speaker 0: Understand anything about like threat files or the stupidest thing.

119
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:34,788
Speaker 1: if attendees are not threatened Then people who happen to work for Sony who are also attendees are also not threatened.

120
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,383
Speaker 1: That is just not basic logic.

121
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,817
Speaker 0: That's yeah, that's wrong And you don't know shit that's wrong.

122
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,150
Speaker 1: impact should be canceled because it's not safe to be there.

123
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,620
Speaker 1: It's either safe to be there or it isn't.

124
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:49,530
Speaker 0: uh, that's like Really ridiculous reductive bullshit baby thinking.

125
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,198
Speaker 0: Common sense like the.

126
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:52,860
Speaker 0: no, it's not.

127
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,246
Speaker 1: that says if it's safe to be.

128
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,596
Speaker 1: if it's not safe to be there No, we shouldn't have the event.

129
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,390
Speaker 1: if it is safe to be there then it's safe for any human being to be there.

130
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,734
Speaker 0: That's all right.

131
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,079
Speaker 0: I think you're stupid.

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,550
Speaker 0: Okay, this like I think Sony is stupid.

133
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,450
Speaker 1: They look like little babies who are like, oh, we're so afraid we're gonna hide from the world.

134
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,157
Speaker 0: So you clearly didn't listen to any words.

135
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:10,961
Speaker 0: I said about.

136
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,110
Speaker 1: I'm saying the words you said were wrong and stupid.

137
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,921
Speaker 1: Okay, if you're so afraid, why don't you why you go?

138
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,030
Speaker 1: and maybe you shouldn't be going to pegs you work for a company.

139
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,038
Speaker 1: Why isn't your company preventing you from going?

140
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,508
Speaker 0: most of our business travel has been canceled.

141
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,236
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Well, how come they're not preventing you?

142
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:25,362
Speaker 1: if they should buy that logic.

143
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,770
Speaker 1: They should prevent you from going east.

144
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:34,332
Speaker 0: Uh, well because I am not part of a small team that travels to a lot of places on behalf of the company in a short Span of time.

145
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:34,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:39,167
Speaker 0: Also I am banned from traveling to a bunch of specific places for the foreseeable.

147
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,310
Speaker 1: Well, that is common sense.

148
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,870
Speaker 1: I think Everyone should be banned from going.

149
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:50,910
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand the like basic difference between a generalized threats profile versus like a more specific one.

150
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,730
Speaker 0: Like you just don't know anything about this space and you're talking out of your ass.

151
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,624
Speaker 0: You're like being the epitome of the white dude explaining something.

152
00:09:58,644 --> 00:09:59,508
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about.

153
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,499
Speaker 1: I mean I don't even care if Sony goes or not.

154
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,370
Speaker 1: The point is they just look really stupid.

155
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,102
Speaker 1: And tendos not pulling out Nintendo's showing up just fine.

156
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:07,885
Speaker 1: They don't seem to give a shit.

157
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:08,870
Speaker 1: They're Japanese company.

158
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,295
Speaker 1: How come Nintendo's not pulling out?

159
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:11,279
Speaker 1: Are they stupid Nintendo?

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,423
Speaker 1: You're saying Nintendo shouldn't go.

161
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,130
Speaker 1: so because this Sony's all smart.

162
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,013
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

163
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:16,759
Speaker 0: The difference is probably.

164
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,090
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know the details of the marketing teams in these different companies.

165
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,794
Speaker 1: I guess I was going.

166
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,559
Speaker 0: they're not pulling out.

167
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, but again, like I said, I don't you know I don't know the differences between the marketing teams.

168
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:34,498
Speaker 0: I don't work for any of these companies but some companies have a central team that goes all around the world to do this stuff and some companies have Regional specific teams.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,690
Speaker 0: and if you have purely like regional specific It's a lot safer to like, you know, I have to worry about this stuff nearly as much.

170
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:47,729
Speaker 0: So if you have an entirely US staff that moves entirely to a US location That's much less of a threat vector.

171
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:53,050
Speaker 0: Then a team that travels to the US to do the thing then travels to another like third country to do the thing.

172
00:10:53,271 --> 00:11:00,245
Speaker 1: As long as you don't travel to one of the countries of the diseases all over It's not as the US has like the third most cases and there are.

173
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,690
Speaker 0: there were cases in Boston.

174
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:05,484
Speaker 1: So if you want to do not think there were not see any.

175
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,447
Speaker 0: yeah, there were two.

176
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:07,090
Speaker 0: What do you read?

177
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,670
Speaker 0: I have access to like real like live industry data about this.

178
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,379
Speaker 0: I can pull it up right now if you want to see it.

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,450
Speaker 1: Anyway, let us move on to the next news.

180
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,539
Speaker 0: So what's interesting about this though?

181
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,830
Speaker 0: Is that from the packs perspective?

182
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:25,078
Speaker 0: It's a blow in the sense that a lot of the people who go to cons like packs They're really only there for the expo hall.

183
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,403
Speaker 0: Like I think that's always.

184
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,110
Speaker 0: that's something that I think is stupid like attendees.

185
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,907
Speaker 1: well that we've always said that that stupid.

186
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:39,322
Speaker 0: but The kinds of people who only go to an expo hall are the kinds of people who really want to play like the game that Sony's been hyping up for months saying we're gonna have it at PAX.

187
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,046
Speaker 0: You can play it.

188
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,089
Speaker 0: and They're the kinds of people who don't read websites and will not know that Sony is not there.

189
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:57,749
Speaker 0: I really feel for the poor enforcers We're gonna be standing in the area where Sony was gonna be having to explain to a lot of really angry and dense nerds Why Sony isn't there?

190
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,290
Speaker 0: Like that is gonna be an interesting thing to see play out.

191
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,890
Speaker 0: I'm curious how many people will like just not know Sony pulled out and show up and be mad about it.

192
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,997
Speaker 0: Mmm, the other interesting thing that happened.

193
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:15,313
Speaker 0: Is that the mayor of Boston like Agrees with me.

194
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,522
Speaker 0: Well, not really cuz one what he said.

195
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:24,685
Speaker 0: like he's getting a lot of flack for the kind of bullshitty thing He said about this because he accused an Asian owned company.

196
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,690
Speaker 1: Well, that's all that's true.

197
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:30,107
Speaker 0: Like his whole letter is basically this plays into Asian stereotypes.

198
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Like the response from Sony there is racism going.

199
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,523
Speaker 0: What do you think owns us?

200
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:36,366
Speaker 0: What?

201
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:37,650
Speaker 0: what's your point?

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:48,510
Speaker 0: Like so the mayor of Boston even sent a letter to the CEO of Sony Like mad at him for Pope for having the company pull out of the event.

203
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,202
Speaker 0: I don't think the mayor of Boston understands that much about this.

204
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:57,862
Speaker 0: The only interesting point about that is that The mayor of Boston cares that much about packs.

205
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:58,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing.

206
00:12:58,664 --> 00:12:59,726
Speaker 1: I don't understand right is?

207
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:04,002
Speaker 1: I think packs is a Does not lose right, you know?

208
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:09,150
Speaker 1: forget about whether they should or they shouldn't Understand how convention centers were right?

209
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,090
Speaker 1: But here's the thing is that pecs doesn't make or lose money whether Sony shows up or not.

210
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,514
Speaker 1: There's tons of video giant.

211
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:28,250
Speaker 1: video game companies aren't coming that used to come or right and it's like pecs sold out with or without Right packs used to sell it not selling less tickets because PlayStation pulls out.

212
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:35,528
Speaker 1: They're not gonna sell less tickets next year because Boston makes the same money off packs Pretty much no matter who shows up and less like.

213
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,892
Speaker 0: no No It's even worse.

214
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:45,526
Speaker 0: it was like the whole industry pulls out and is basically like a barren expo hall Which could happen because a lot more companies are planning to pull out of GDC.

215
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,530
Speaker 0: probably well GDC.

216
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why they're either but you know

217
00:13:49,230 --> 00:14:01,090
Speaker 0: GDC actually has an even worse threat profile because GDC doesn't have like normal attendees as much as it has like Reps from the marketing teams of all these international companies all showing up and doing a bunch of meetings together.

218
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:08,145
Speaker 0: Well, it has way less people though Yeah But I would consider GDC to probably be a worst threat vector for this particular kind of illness.

219
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,269
Speaker 1: pandemic expert rim.

220
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,539
Speaker 0: over here I mean, I was the chief risk officer of a company for a while.

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,039
Speaker 0: I am formally trained in risk assessment Like yes, that is true That literally is true.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,329
Speaker 0: That's part of my job.

223
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,004
Speaker 0: But you don't believe me, you know, yes, the government is calling up rim.

224
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,130
Speaker 1: What should we do about the coronavirus?

225
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,054
Speaker 1: It's such an expert.

226
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,079
Speaker 0: Why would the government call me?

227
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,124
Speaker 0: I'm not a government official.

228
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:30,270
Speaker 0: I did that for a company.

229
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:30,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

230
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:32,237
Speaker 1: No one's calling you for help.

231
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:32,639
Speaker 1: You're not.

232
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,787
Speaker 0: my company paid me to do this.

233
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,398
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Oh someone paid you.

234
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,770
Speaker 1: therefore you're an expert, you know.

235
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,813
Speaker 1: Therefore you're right.

236
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,658
Speaker 1: Someone pays you money.

237
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:41,999
Speaker 1: Therefore.

238
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:42,480
Speaker 1: You're right.

239
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:42,902
Speaker 1: Okay.

240
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,790
Speaker 0: No, all I'm saying is that I am a professional risk assessment.

241
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:48,350
Speaker 1: All that means is someone paid you money.

242
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,221
Speaker 1: That's all that's required to be a professional is to have someone pay you money.

243
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,470
Speaker 1: that gives you no credentials whatsoever.

244
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,808
Speaker 1: Someone can pay me to wash their car doesn't mean I'm a car washing expert.

245
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,259
Speaker 0: So you don't Doctors are you don't trust?

246
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,609
Speaker 1: because they're paid.

247
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:01,993
Speaker 0: So what?

248
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:06,550
Speaker 1: why do you trust a doctor that the doctor went to medical school for a zillion fucking years and work their ass off?

249
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,646
Speaker 1: Did you go and study virus spreading or whatever, you know in school for six?

250
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:12,849
Speaker 1: No to ten guys.

251
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,799
Speaker 0: I learned generalized corporate risk assessment.

252
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,521
Speaker 0: That's a very different.

253
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,866
Speaker 1: You know, nothing about viruses.

254
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,070
Speaker 1: No viruses are.

255
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:21,898
Speaker 0: You don't need to know that there's.

256
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,710
Speaker 0: you can just read data about this like there's data feed.

257
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:30,470
Speaker 1: Oh, man If reading data just made me know everything and be an expert instead of studying something for a long time

258
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:43,050
Speaker 0: You learn in risk assessment are like how to interpret data about risk to enable to figure out what the actual Real threat is to your particular domain or your particular company and then make decisions based on that.

259
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,337
Speaker 0: Like that's what that is.

260
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:44,941
Speaker 0: That's a job.

261
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a medical risk.

262
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,109
Speaker 1: I'm gonna contact a medical person not just some rim who read a data.

263
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,409
Speaker 0: Don't think you know what risk officers do in companies or who they are?

264
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know who they are people like rim.

265
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,505
Speaker 1: We think they know what they don't know.

266
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't know.

267
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,767
Speaker 0: That's why I got trained in it.

268
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,952
Speaker 1: Oh, so your training is equivalent to the training of an expert who went to school for a very long time There.

269
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,920
Speaker 0: most people don't go to school for a very long time.

270
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,025
Speaker 1: doctors do you said.

271
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,030
Speaker 1: why do I trust doctors?

272
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of shit.

273
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:12,640
Speaker 0: Are you a doctor?

274
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:16,761
Speaker 0: No, so if you sound the same over I mean if you want to be anti-intellectual and weird you can.

275
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:21,780
Speaker 1: you're the one who's claiming to know something I guess I do know about like risk assessment.

276
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,342
Speaker 1: Okay?

277
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,650
Speaker 1: Okay, coronavirus rim everybody.

278
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:25,795
Speaker 0: I didn't say.

279
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,442
Speaker 0: I didn't say I'm an expert in coronavirus.

280
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:31,870
Speaker 0: I'm an expert in corporate risk assessment Specifically pandemics and epidemics.

281
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,137
Speaker 1: Oh, you're an expert on pandemics, huh?

282
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:39,157
Speaker 0: Now in the in the specific and narrow domain of corporate risk assessment Uh-huh.

283
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:42,082
Speaker 0: Okay I had to draft a plan on what to do.

284
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:55,202
Speaker 0: in fact right now because you know There's a global the entire finance industry everyone's pulled out their BCP plans for these kinds of epidemics and they're said like everything's set up in case where everyone has to Do the pandemic like procedure?

285
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 0: There's a pandemic procedure.

286
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:13,510
Speaker 0: There's a button someone get hit and then me and everyone in the company that I work for now where I don't plan this But I trust the people who are paid to do it They will like they'll hit a button and then I have to follow a procedure where I'm not allowed to go to work And I have to work from home and there's all these things I have to do and everyone in the company has a different playbook.

287
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,273
Speaker 1: There's a button.

288
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:15,762
Speaker 1: you should find that button in the office.

289
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:16,890
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you don't to go to work.

290
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's up some keys on a keyboard.

291
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,642
Speaker 0: I'd still have to work from home.

292
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,250
Speaker 0: I don't get to just not work.

00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,324
Speaker 0: I don't actually need to go to the office to do a lot.

294
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:26,773
Speaker 1: I don't push the button I'm telling you, but if it was such a button I'd be pushing.

295
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:34,890
Speaker 0: the other thing the mayor might have been mad about is Reputational risk to Boston and the fact that the news said Oh big company won't travel to Boston.

296
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:43,810
Speaker 0: But if that's actually what the mayor of Boston is mad about the mayor of Boston Doesn't seem to actually understand how companies work or how events work.

297
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,790
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the thing is I don't think that hurts the reputation of Boston, right?

298
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,292
Speaker 1: It's like.

299
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,888
Speaker 1: it's like people think there's a big they make up.

300
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:56,164
Speaker 1: well So like there is a mind they think they've been sliding.

301
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:56,987
Speaker 1: everyone's like what the fuck.

302
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:08,290
Speaker 0: so Scott you realize though there has been like in the last month a drastic downturn in Tourism and visiting revenue in like every major city on earth basically entirely because of coronavirus.

303
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:13,706
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah People aren't traveling because people are paranoid and traveling less sometimes with good reasons.

304
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,770
Speaker 1: Sometimes not with good reason.

305
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, people are traveling less.

306
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,489
Speaker 0: They're spending less eating at restaurants and that's it.

307
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,950
Speaker 0: But that of course but the real danger times the racist reasons?

308
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:30,266
Speaker 0: Yeah pretty rarely it seems like it's mostly Just generalized caution coupled with the real economic damage is coming from supply chain misses.

309
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:31,590
Speaker 1: That's also true.

310
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:41,568
Speaker 0: so Pax East issued a statement about you know The safety of packs and everything and what it basically boils down to is what it boils down to at all conventions.

311
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:50,470
Speaker 0: if you're going To Pax do the same thing you do at every gaming convention Don't touch other nerds and don't shake hands with people cars and wash your hands

312
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,887
Speaker 1: Even if you're not gonna get the corona virus if you're gonna get

313
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:53,149
Speaker 0: the flu

314
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:54,574
Speaker 1: You could you could get anything.

Speaker 1: if I write there was swine flu effects.

316
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a bunch of our friends got it got diagnosed.

317
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:04,110
Speaker 0: I remember I was on the phone with Robert Gu listing the flight numbers of our two friends that were on it, right?

318
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,390
Speaker 1: It's like, you know that was but that was a time when swine flu was like in the area already.

319
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:08,752
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

320
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,390
Speaker 1: well, I wasn't like oh swine flu's in the other side of the world and we got it.

321
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,870
Speaker 1: So so do you remember that actually?

322
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,802
Speaker 0: One student I think it was from U of W who went to Pax Spread it at Pax and then Pax was actually a right.

323
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,730
Speaker 1: but the point is it was already there to begin with.

324
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,674
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it wasn't like.

325
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,181
Speaker 0: it was not widespread there.

326
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,909
Speaker 0: It was not known to be there.

327
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,638
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there was someone who had it there.

328
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,145
Speaker 0: Yes, and they didn't know yet.

329
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,050
Speaker 0: They went if they were sick.

330
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,773
Speaker 0: They went to Pax.

331
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:42,546
Speaker 0: they spread it to a few people and because it's Pax it spread to a lot of people at Pax and Then because it was a convention it spread to much of the coasts right like rapidly.

332
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:43,750
Speaker 0: Pax was a big part of that spread.

333
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:48,261
Speaker 0: So wash your hands don't cough in people's faces faces.

334
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:53,829

335
00:19:54,371 --> 00:20:02,529
Speaker 0: But the real way you get things like this is not so much someone coughing on you It's don't touch your fucking face after you touch things.

336
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you can just train yourself and it's really hard.

Speaker 1: hand-washing Friction is the most important factor in hand-washing.

373
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:44,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember when I worked in the hospital I had to take classes on like how to wash my hands and you ever see a doctor wash their hands before surgery.

374
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:45,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

375
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,983
Speaker 1: They're mostly scrubbing.

376
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:55,620
Speaker 0: Oh, and then when I worked in Scrubbing I worked in a NICU for a while like an infant like premature, baby Like and they make you wash your hands like crazy.

377
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,570
Speaker 1: Oh you wear ten gloves.

378
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,617
Speaker 1: The procedure don't touch the babies.

379
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:07,650
Speaker 0: because I wasn't trained in how to like prepare to enter that area I had to have a nurse escort me and wash with me every time I went into that room.

380
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,288
Speaker 0: Imagine like seven minutes of scrubbing on your hands and arms before we could even walk into a room.

381
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,505
Speaker 1: Yep So it doesn't mean a baby gets sick they done.

382
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:19,020
Speaker 1: Yeah so you it's like you get a cold.

383
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:27,665
Speaker 0: it's like I you got a cold brand new baby and If someone tries to shake hands with you at a convention just don't like.

384
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,210
Speaker 0: elbow bump is way better.

385
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:32,508
Speaker 0: Like don't touch people's grubby hands for all the reasons we just described.

386
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,174
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not news.

387
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,281
Speaker 0: In fact official advice from penny arcade.

388
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,170
Speaker 0: Do not let a stranger's weeping pustules drip into your urethra.

389
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:43,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, so remember that really entering through the urethra would be pretty hard for a virus.

390
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,209
Speaker 1: I feel like it's more likely to.

391
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:49,320
Speaker 0: uh, All I'm gonna say is wash your hands before your jacket.

392
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:58,270
Speaker 0: if you're a pax and you're the kind of person who jacks at a Pax, you know, you just jacket not in the front Yeah, but I feel like I mean the rosy palm is a very important technique.

393
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,223
Speaker 1: It also a jacket in the shower where you're washing your hand and jacket.

394
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:01,846
Speaker 1: It's simultaneous.

395
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:02,610
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that could work.

396
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:10,399
Speaker 0: I really know anywhere else that packs the jacket beside you not jacket in the shower If you are rooming with other people at packs.

397
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,363
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

398
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:12,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have.

399
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,338
Speaker 0: I Have not jacked it in a shower.

400
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,326

401
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:19,169
Speaker 1: No, I haven't either.

402
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,678
Speaker 0: Okay I was worried there was an implication what you just said.

403
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:23,304
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying it's not making sure.

404
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:26,789
Speaker 1: I'm just saying like You know, all right, they're in the shower.

405
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,353
Speaker 1: They're in there for a few extra minutes You don't?

406
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:37,017
Speaker 1: they wash it away what's you know, I just if someone did I wouldn't be like upset unless they did it in a You know improper fashion.

407
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:38,765
Speaker 0: They leave some issue the killer.

408
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:43,677
Speaker 1: if there's any leftovers That's a problem, right if they take in the if they're in the shower too long That's a problem.

409
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,050
Speaker 0: or if you hear it, right?

410
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,529
Speaker 1: That would also be at least it would just be like come on, man.

411
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,036
Speaker 1: I wouldn't like disturb me personally, but I would imagine it would be very Impolite to many other people.

412
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,524
Speaker 1: I would just be like, come on.

413

414
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,210

418
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,515

00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,484
Speaker 0: It's real intense in VR like Almost too intense.

440
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,055
Speaker 0: Okay Also really gross.

441
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:03,840
Speaker 1: I mean it's gross my what?

442
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:19,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see you think it's gross when you're doing it on a screen But when you're like in the viscera anyway, like even I was like, whoa okay, so The fandoms of these two games overlap more than you might expect Or not at all.

443
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,903
Speaker 0: I think they do overlap.

444
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:27,865
Speaker 0: I know some people who like both these games And there is a lot of fan art and discussion between these two communities.

445
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:29,770
Speaker 0: that is just delightful.

446
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:29,891
Speaker 0: Well, I

447
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:34,645
Speaker 1: was like their games are releasing on the same day And I think somebody made I don't know which one was the first

448
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,574
Speaker 0: the first one I saw the

449
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,221
Speaker 1: person you saw wasn't the first one that was now but

450
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:42,902
Speaker 0: the first one I saw was the one that was Isabel sitting on doom guy's shoulder and

451
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,008
Speaker 1: also the first one I saw

452
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,908
Speaker 0: yep And it was just like rip and tear until it's done,

453
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,210
Speaker 1: right?

454
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:56,428
Speaker 1: So someone made you know a meme crossing him over and I guess you know All the creative people in the universe on the internet were like, oh that's great.

455
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:02,070
Speaker 1: and they started You know riffing on that theme and they just keep on riffing cuz it's a really great mix and it doesn't get old.

456
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:03,863
Speaker 1: Do great taste it tastes great together.

457
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:10,470
Speaker 1: I Stop now wait and you know and keep going till it's spent because you're not gonna be able to redo this one.

458
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:22,250
Speaker 1: It's not like Animal Crossing for the next Nintendo console and the next doom are also gonna release on the same day Unless you know, they're so intelligent that they do that on purpose in like three or four years from now whenever.

459
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,801
Speaker 1: But you know, it could be a much longer time than that.

460
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:26,990
Speaker 1: because how long since the last Animal Crossing?

461
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:32,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I like everything about Animal Crossing except I don't actually like playing the games like.

462
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,375
Speaker 0: I like the aesthetic I like the music.

463
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:35,341
Speaker 0: I like the fandom.

464
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,830
Speaker 0: I just don't actually enjoy the game.

465
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:39,450
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of Animal Crossing and know a lot of Animal Crossing.

466
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:45,178
Speaker 0: I've actually never actually played or bought and We could both play the new one and review it.

467
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,506
Speaker 1: it's a lot of money though, I feel that's the main reason.

468
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:47,666
Speaker 0: Yeah.

469
00:26:47,686 --> 00:27:05,334
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway it's time for things of the day, so I Have to hate a man by the name of Alexander Ovechkin.

470
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of reasons to hate that guy.

471
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:15,989
Speaker 1: He is on the enemy team yeah, but I also have to deeply respect several enemy teams as Literally I can think of at least three teams.

472
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:16,451
Speaker 1: He's on.

473
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,397
Speaker 0: you'll see that my thing of the day will cover that.

474
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:23,650
Speaker 0: he is also One of the best hockey players in history.

475
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,332
Speaker 1: That's true.

476
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,500
Speaker 0: Like one man is the man is a legend.

477
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,630
Speaker 0: He's not number one, but he is a legend.

478
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,440
Speaker 0: He will go down in history and his career ain't even done yet.

479
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,010
Speaker 0: No, like the man is just a hockey god.

480
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,500
Speaker 0: So he recently set a record.

481
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:40,912
Speaker 0: He has scored 700 goals in his career.

482
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:41,955
Speaker 1: that's a lot of goals.

483
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,320
Speaker 1: that is a lot memory.

484
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,040
Speaker 0: It's hockey a sport where games will end like zero zero and go into overtime.

485
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,159
Speaker 1: Lately scoring, you know scores being up and down over time.

486
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,326
Speaker 1: But yes, you know You don't score a lot of goals in a game per team.

487
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:59,720
Speaker 1: if you're an individual hockey player most games your score zero goals.

488
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe you get an assist if you score a point a game and a point is an assist or a goal.

489
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:07,429
Speaker 1: If you score a point a game that's already amazing.

490
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,396
Speaker 1: that is considered fantastic.

491
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,540
Speaker 1: You're a star player.

492
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:13,132
Speaker 1: Yep, right and that's not even a goal a game.

493
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:14,277
Speaker 1: if you score a goal a game.

494
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:14,820
Speaker 1: You're a legend.

495
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if you scored a goal a game you would get 80 something goals a year.

496
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,409
Speaker 1: There's a reason to get to 700 goals.

497
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:27,407
Speaker 1: There's a reason half a score a goal a game For like almost 10 years.

498
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:28,069
Speaker 0: There's a reason.

499
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,112
Speaker 0: the hat trick exists.

500
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:39,387
Speaker 0: people will throw their $40 hat away If someone scores three goals in a single game because it's so crazy when it happens, yeah So this video is like two goals.

501
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:40,672
Speaker 1: It's like whoa, that's crazy.

502
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:59,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, but three in one game Was put out a couple days ago by the NHL's an official video and it is just a super cut of Every single Ovechkin goal like just the goal with like very little contacts and it is almost 13 minutes long.

503
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:04,792
Speaker 0: Yep, it's Mesmerizing especially because 90% of them are him in the same spot.

504
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,980
Speaker 0: Oh, I was about to say it's him in his office.

505
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:08,125
Speaker 0: I want to make a super cut.

506
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:10,173
Speaker 0: that just is him from the office.

507
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,800
Speaker 1: You just want to remove all the non office goals?

508
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, he.

509
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,809
Speaker 1: basically it's like People don't know enough about hockey.

510
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,372
Speaker 1: Basically.

511
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,740
Speaker 1: This is one spot.

512
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:22,220
Speaker 1: I'm like the circle where Ovechkin always stands and whenever I've seen him play live you see him.

513
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,120
Speaker 1: He just sort of skates around there and sometimes your team is smart and has a defenseman just hanging near him.

514
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,614
Speaker 0: Sometimes his sole job is to keep him from scoring a goal like just sometimes.

515
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:33,600
Speaker 1: your team is stupid and he stands there all alone.

516
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:42,554
Speaker 1: He just stands there waiting for his teammate to pass him the puck and assume when the pucks coming towards him He just takes a one-timer right at the goal and he's just practiced it so much.

517
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:47,700
Speaker 1: I clicked on a raise in a lot of the time Even though the goalie knows it's coming from there the goal.

518
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,839
Speaker 1: He's got to pay attention to where the puck is, you know, not to where Ovechkin is.

519
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,522
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

520
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,148
Speaker 0: I watched like a Rangers game.

521
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,658
Speaker 0: Let's say and it's just like he's there.

522
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:57,626
Speaker 0: He's there He's standing in the spot.

523
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:58,188
Speaker 1: Don't let him.

524
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:00,800
Speaker 1: don't let anyone pass the puck to him when he's standing in the spot.

525
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,694
Speaker 1: Stand in between him and the goal when he's in the spot.

526
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:04,399
Speaker 1: How hard is this?

527
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,690
Speaker 1: I can see it from here and I'm not even professional.

528
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,539
Speaker 1: you're paid millions of dollars a year to do this.

529
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:10,394
Speaker 0: That's one guy you got to worry about.

530
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,000
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

531
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,748
Speaker 0: Ah, the latest comment on the video he scored on the Atlanta Thrashers.

532
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,110
Speaker 0: so much.

533
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,113
Speaker 0: They became extinct.

534
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:15,575
Speaker 1: Yep.

535
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:16,357
Speaker 1: That's true.

536
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,866
Speaker 0: Yeah So what do you got?

537
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:19,348
Speaker 1: What do I have?

538
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:27,556
Speaker 1: So quite a long time ago many years ago we did When I was a kid, I had a toy called marble works Which is a bunch of plastic pieces you would put together.

539
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,582
Speaker 1: and oh, yeah I had that.

540
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:33,440
Speaker 1: you drop marbles on the top and they would run race to the bottom right through a series of things.

541
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,918
Speaker 1: It's a very similar hobby that is related to like setting up dominoes and watching them fall.

542
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:40,913
Speaker 0: Yep so here's also into dominoes weird.

543
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:54,500
Speaker 1: and then we did a. We did a thing of the day quite a long time ago about this marble Olympics, which someone made these YouTube videos of marbles, you know Competing with each other as if the marbles were people, right?

544
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,840
Speaker 0: What was fascinating about that video was that it was almost as exciting as real sports like on this particular wavelength, right?

545
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:06,354
Speaker 1: So here is a video sponsored by a company that sells bulk dominoes.

546
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:08,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is a marbula one.

547
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:21,692
Speaker 1: It is brand new and they basically did extremely high production values of marbles racing around this Grand Prix track You know playing it totally straight as if it's a real race a real sport.

548
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,276
Speaker 1: the marbles are on real teams.

549
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:24,640
Speaker 1: they have real names.

550
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:29,640
Speaker 1: They're actually competing, you know, it's somewhat thrilling like a real sport.

551
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,035
Speaker 1: But really this is thing of the day because the production value Yeah, so insanely high if you're willing to put like just to play this straight.

552
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:38,320
Speaker 0: That is amazing.

553
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:47,523
Speaker 1: They even put like marbles in the grandstand And they called the whole thing as if it was real Competating.

554
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:50,956
Speaker 1: and it's it's something to see props to whoever put this together.

555
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,964
Speaker 0: I wonder how many All your camera flipped over.

556
00:31:53,984 --> 00:32:00,160
Speaker 0: I wonder how many takes it took for them to not crack up doing the commentary on these marbles.

557
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:01,473
Speaker 1: It's just one person doing it.

558
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,654
Speaker 0: Yeah So in that a moment, we're gonna be at PAX.

585
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,558
Speaker 0: people don't like to walk out of panels even bad ones at conventions hit them.

586
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Love that slide.

587
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,733
Speaker 0: I get the laugh every time of just the fist.

588
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I paid for that stock image.

589
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,207
Speaker 0: Okay, there's a really good fist.

590
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,934
Speaker 1: This is why I don't give him patreon money.

591
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:47,460
Speaker 1: He'll use it on stock images of fists.

592
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:50,188
Speaker 0: I have bought like four stock images of fists.

593
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:54,440
Speaker 0: Oh, I should replace it with the statue of at Joe Louis arena.

594
00:33:57,043 --> 00:34:02,174
Speaker 0: That is literally in my top five favorite statues of all time, it's not bad It's just a giant statue of his fist.

595
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:02,678
Speaker 0: Nothing else.

596
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:08,436
Speaker 0: Also, you might have known, you know, we are review board games like Joe Louis punch you.

597
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:12,975
Speaker 0: you would take your fucking turn If Joe Louis punched me, I wouldn't take my turn because I would be dead.

598
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:16,257
Speaker 1: Yeah He's playing a lot of board games up in the good.

599
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,826
Speaker 1: So we don't take their turn up there.

600
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:24,619
Speaker 0: We have reviewed a lot of board games on geek nights in the last 15 years.

601
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:29,292
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I have been taking and I've been doing this for a while.

602
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,639
Speaker 0: So there's 65 of them on YouTube.

603
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:37,945
Speaker 0: now I've been taking just the reviews without like the opening crap Yeah thing of the day.

604
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:38,407
Speaker 1: that's the thing.

605
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:54,719
Speaker 1: the format of geek nights, which may change at any time but the format as it has been for a zillion years is do a bunch of bullshit first like the bullshit we're doing right now and Then actually talk about the fucking topic Just like when you watch a late show on TV and it's like yeah a bunch of bullshit at the start of the show and then They interview the celebrity at the end.

606
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,960
Speaker 0: But if you're reading a recipe you don't want like my year in Sardinia before they tell you how to make some food.

607
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,043
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

608
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:06,799
Speaker 1: So if you want to hear just the main bit where we talk about the board game, they're on YouTube.

609
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,465
Speaker 0: Yep 65 of them.

610
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:13,060
Speaker 0: there's a playlist of all of them and I'm adding like regularly that I'm going through the back catalogue.

611
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:19,076
Speaker 0: Eventually every board game we've ever reviewed will be here as a standalone review with like images and everything.

612
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,698
Speaker 0: It's a whole thing.

613
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:25,206
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah The book club book is book.

614
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:26,852
Speaker 0: club book is tail of Genji.

615
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:30,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still reading it on the subway slowly It's long.

616
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll read it.

617
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:38,230
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying I'll read some on my way to Pax and I think I continue to be more interested in everyone.

618
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:38,812
Speaker 0: but Genji.

619
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:39,273
Speaker 1: Yep.

620
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,860
Speaker 0: It's definitely a Genji muyo situation.

621
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:52,116
Speaker 1: That's the first novel that has ever been written now not the first fiction for his now first novel Yep, so I figured that makes it important to read.

622
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:52,640
Speaker 1: So we're reading it.

623
00:35:52,700 --> 00:36:03,617
Speaker 0: Yeah Before we get into the main bid because a friend of ours who was also very much into the randomizers pointed out something interesting And important send your friend to the panel so you can play a quick game without them at PAX.

624
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,188
Speaker 1: Oh the slow person Okay.

625
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:22,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Randomizers have been a thing and I feel like there are only two like People either like know the deal or have never heard of this or you know The other the people who like have heard of it, but like they didn't actually like for me.

626
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:31,097
Speaker 1: I knew about it way long ago Right, but not until the past few months that I actually look closer and was like

627
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,889
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I think I feel like the progression

628
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:40,350
Speaker 1: is you know, you sort of understand it like, okay, I get what's going on there All right, whatever.

629
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get the idea but

630
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:51,185
Speaker 0: then eventually like someone says like something like a different format and they're like Oh wonder how they do those formats and then you kind of want to play one and then you're dragged in and you figure it Right,

631
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:53,540
Speaker 1: so basically the deal is right.

632
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:59,654
Speaker 1: There are a lot of video games out there Especially these days that are procedurally generated or randomized in some way even board games.

633
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you start with a random map.

634
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,244
Speaker 1: Why do we do this?

635
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,860
Speaker 1: because we don't want to randomize the game, right?

636
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:18,772
Speaker 1: So that one player has an advantage or disadvantage because of luck but we want to use luck and randomness in our games to get a different experience each time you play so we don't get bored and Play the exact same thing every time even if the spire

637
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,660
Speaker 0: is great because I don't know what's coming.

638
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,644
Speaker 1: Roguelikes are pretty much the first games to to capitalize on this idea, you know hardcore wise but you know Minecraft does it.

639
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:29,949
Speaker 1: even Puerto Rico does it.

640
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,820
Speaker 1: the plantations are different every time just a little bit, right?

641
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:41,560
Speaker 1: So with the idea of a randomizer is like, okay We got all these new games we've made that are random and have tons of replay value.

642
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,382
Speaker 1: But what if you know these games aren't the best games there ever were right?

643
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:55,800
Speaker 1: the best games there ever were are games like Super Metroid or link to the fast or Mario's got about it.

644
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:02,100
Speaker 0: I just say more that there's a lot of reasons why this particular era of games is most suited to this randomizer thing.

645
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,143
Speaker 1: Oh, that's also true.

646
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:08,700
Speaker 1: The best games that ever were also happen to be extremely suited to being randomized.

647
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,544
Speaker 0: But it's partly that now.

648
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:23,560
Speaker 0: recently we've seen something like there was the remake of link to the past not link to the past of links awakenings that people can play this game, but There aren't that many good Zelda games for example, like you can have played them all and memorize them all and then just fuck you.

649
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,940
Speaker 0: There aren't more of these games to play and the indie ones tend to not be that good.

650
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:36,900
Speaker 0: So now you're just sort of playing the same game over and over again slowly going crazy Especially the single-player games right where your inner you're exploring an environment, especially something like that.

651
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,078
Speaker 1: It's like they become the first time you play the game, right?

652
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,845
Speaker 1: You know, I always say how.

653
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,820
Speaker 1: there's no spoilers or bullshit for movies, right?

654
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,560
Speaker 1: But spoilers are not bullshit for a game like Zelda or Super Metroid or something, right?

655
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,360
Speaker 1: Because the first time you play assuming you haven't like read a map or spoiled it, right?

656
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,740
Speaker 1: You're exploring and learning and discovering and solving puzzles, right?

657
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:05,140
Speaker 1: If you have a crossword puzzle, right the first time you do it You're looking at the clues and you're trying to figure out their meaning.

658
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:09,540
Speaker 1: The second time you do it you just remember that word was in that spot.

659
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,260
Speaker 1: It is now a completely fundamentally a different activity.

660
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:17,580
Speaker 1: It becomes a knowledge based activity and not a you know, trivia based activity.

661
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:21,440
Speaker 1: You're using a completely different part of your brain in a completely different part way.

662
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:29,608
Speaker 1: The second or third time you do something it becomes all about knowledge and not about skills as much Or about anything else.

663
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,700
Speaker 0: so but what you get out of it is different too.

664
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:39,258
Speaker 0: Like you might be like you want to play a Final Fantasy 1 again But you don't want to just play Final Fantasy 1 again, but you want that feeling of playing Final Fantasy 1, right?

665
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:43,960
Speaker 1: So if you play Final Fantasy 1 again, it's like well, it doesn't change on you.

666
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,427
Speaker 1: But huh, let's randomize it.

667
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:46,613
Speaker 1: different bad guys.

668
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:48,020
Speaker 1: items are in different places.

669
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,988
Speaker 1: People say different things different towns different.

670
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,817
Speaker 1: right you can because these are such simple pieces of software.

671
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:54,940
Speaker 1: We can emulate all of them.

672
00:39:55,401 --> 00:40:04,657
Speaker 1: It's really easy to take a piece right to go and look into that ROM and figure out which pieces Of memory represent what and shuffle them around.

673
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:08,690
Speaker 0: Yep but I think there's a lot more going on here in terms of like.

674
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:10,596
Speaker 0: why it became such a big thing?

675
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:14,920
Speaker 0: because it's not just Play a randomized version of Zelda like most people are into this community.

676
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,292
Speaker 0: It's overlapped with speedrunners and competitive gaming.

677
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:21,340
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah people want it to be a competition.

678
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,058
Speaker 0: I'll erase it.

679
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:28,793
Speaker 0: I think it came out of a lot of this the like Link to the past and Final Fantasy like races that would happen like speedrunners racing.

680
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:33,460
Speaker 1: speed running is definitely the added the Competitive element to the randomizers, right?

681
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,867
Speaker 1: So the randomizers themselves are great for that.

682
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,920
Speaker 1: replay value and eliminating knowledge games sort of thing.

683
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but competitive wise it's like, okay people were speed running.

684
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,220
Speaker 1: We're already speed running a game like Zelda Super Metroid, right?

685
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,446
Speaker 1: But it's the same damn game.

686
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,705
Speaker 1: every time they find ways to make it faster But you're still.

687
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:54,960
Speaker 1: it's all about improving your execution, right?

688
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,100
Speaker 1: They're all working together to share the knowledge of how to do it the fastest.

689
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:03,540
Speaker 1: It's all about who can actually push the buttons the most precisely right all in one go.

690
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,340
Speaker 0: Yep, so these things end up being like serious players.

691
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:10,520
Speaker 0: It's all about like can you do the frame perfect tricks you need to do and independently?

692
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,996
Speaker 0: Do you know the game well enough to know all the locations and the kinds of things you might need?

693
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:17,280
Speaker 0: and then you compete in?

694
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,511
Speaker 0: This kind of random e world with all these other people.

695
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:25,160
Speaker 1: by bringing the randomizer into the speedrun You're still testing the execution, right?

696
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,139
Speaker 1: Because when like you have to fight a boss, well, you have to be good at fighting that boss.

697
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,780
Speaker 0: But now there's a. there's a bigger risk.

698
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,359
Speaker 0: Beat Ganon right and press your luck like in free enterprise the Final Fantasy 4 one.

699
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:35,343
Speaker 0: It's like.

700
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:37,231
Speaker 0: does someone go to the moon early and risk it?

701
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:39,140
Speaker 0: like what if the enemy needs up there and strike to the room?

702
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:39,421
Speaker 1: Isn't?

703
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:40,005
Speaker 1: it's awesome?

704
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:41,739
Speaker 1: because you don't know where anything is.

705
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:53,260
Speaker 1: You actually have to think and make different decisions and now Decision making and not just execution come into play and you can test the broader set of skills.

706
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:56,633
Speaker 1: Right, some of your knowledge is still tested right?

707
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,440
Speaker 1: just it's just not purely knowledge.

708
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,271
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you still need to know.

709
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:04,109
Speaker 1: like aha with this item I can go to these places right versus.

710
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,880
Speaker 1: this is the exact memorize the exact path.

711
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:13,380
Speaker 1: Yeah Remember it's almost like there's a maze that's been shuffled and you just and it's not a straight maze of go from beginning to end.

712
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:17,895
Speaker 1: You know, all right, you got you can enter the maze, but you can't get to the end.

713
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,160
Speaker 1: It's locked, you know.

714
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,477
Speaker 1: It's basically the equivalent game to Wolfenstein 3d.

715
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,240
Speaker 1: We have to get keys to open doors to get keys to open doors to get to the exit.

716
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,425
Speaker 1: It's the same exact game as that.

717
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,715
Speaker 0: So imagine you're doing a Wolfenstein race, right?

718
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:31,008
Speaker 1: It's a Wolfenstein race but it's a brand new map.

719
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:41,683
Speaker 1: you've never seen before every single time and You know that like aha if I get a yellow key Then that means that I can open door I can go east right and if I get a blue key I can go west.

720
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:45,173
Speaker 1: but it's still not a hundred percent the same every time.

721
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:47,259
Speaker 1: so there's some knowledge plays into it.

722
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:50,540
Speaker 1: Some of your execution skills still play into it.

723
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,020
Speaker 1: It's all fighting the same bosses the same enemies, but the enemies might be different places.

724
00:42:55,381 --> 00:43:01,300
Speaker 1: They might you know different wet but some of your skills still matter But everything else is shuffled up.

725
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,208
Speaker 1: so you're getting a brand new experience every time.

726
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:17,060
Speaker 1: you still feel it feels way more fun to do and you test all those things as well as the additional test of Figuring out the optimal, you know figure out on the fly the optimal path instead of having a memorized optimal path.

727
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:29,152
Speaker 0: And it is definitely like a little bit performative in the sense that like like Final Fantasy 4 like the the randomizer I like the most is the Final Fantasy 4 one Partly because Final Fantasy 4 is a game that I know inside and out.

728
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,556
Speaker 0: So it's a it.

729
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:36,360
Speaker 0: lets me apply this Completely useless knowledge from my childhood into a current hobby.

730
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:47,620
Speaker 0: Yep but like what that does mean is that it's really hard to enjoy a Game like to an obsessive childhood degree.

731
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:49,180
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

732
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,712
Speaker 1: It depends right on the the exact game.

733
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:55,687
Speaker 0: and like I would not play the link to the past Randomizers of any kind until you had beaten.

734
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:58,276
Speaker 0: link to the past at least twice like all the way through.

735
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:02,640
Speaker 1: you should definitely beat it Not with the normal mode, but I'll play a randomizer.

736
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,660
Speaker 1: But I think even if you've never played it you can still watch and enjoy the red.

737
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,236
Speaker 0: Oh, you can definitely watch and enjoy but it's playing would be too too difficult.

738
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,140
Speaker 1: You lose a few head.

739
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:14,379
Speaker 1: They do have easy modes.

740
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:21,157
Speaker 1: Like a lot of the randomizers when you randomize there's all sorts of choices of what exactly you're randomizing and how

741
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:23,684
Speaker 0: much there's like website Generators you can use

742
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:27,744
Speaker 1: and the links of the past was the one that gets mentioned the most because it's the one that's been developed The most thoroughly.

743
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:30,057
Speaker 1: they're on version like 32 or something, right?

744
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:30,539
Speaker 1: They've been out.

745
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,724
Speaker 1: They've been honing that.

746
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:34,293
Speaker 1: that's the sharpest knife of all the randomizer knives.

747
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:40,580
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 4 is pretty tight Yeah, and there are just so many options, but they do have like easy modes, right?

748
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:42,820
Speaker 1: So for example the Super Metroid one, right?

749
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,568
Speaker 1: There's a glitch in Super Metroid called the the mock ball.

750
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:55,780
Speaker 1: that lets you get under these gates and go to I think into Brinstar without Like without having to fight the the plant boss out of the spore spawn whatever.

751
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,356
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz you never see anyone fight that in a speed run.

752
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,020
Speaker 1: You watch a speed run.

753
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,454
Speaker 1: No one ever fights the spore spawn because they do the mock ball, right?

754
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,500
Speaker 1: I've tried to do the mock ball.

755
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,105
Speaker 1: I can't do it.

756
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,680
Speaker 1: It's too hard because I'm not I'm an old man.

757
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:17,980
Speaker 1: Right, but you can when you're making a metro a Super Metroid randomized ROM you can choose Say, okay put the items when you're randomizing them make sure that you don't put an item.

758
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 1: You know in such a way that means I can't complete the game without doing mock ball.

759
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:27,920
Speaker 1: Yep, or you can say actually, you know what put the items, you know, I can do mock ball.

760
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,560
Speaker 1: You put the items wherever you feel like I'm gonna get there.

761
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:33,682
Speaker 1: And it's the same thing for all the other randomizers I've seen.

762
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:41,587
Speaker 1: they let you customize how random it's gonna be and that actually plays into How you play the randomizer because you go.

763
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:46,120
Speaker 1: All right, I just got you know, I haven't gotten a super missile yet.

764
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:47,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

765
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:50,020
Speaker 1: This these places are unreachable by super missile.

766
00:45:50,120 --> 00:46:06,660
Speaker 1: Therefore there must be a super missile in one of these five places because those are the only five places I haven't checked right that are Accessible right now with the items I have We're where is with what route do I take to check those places most efficiently?

767
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,900
Speaker 1: Right, and that's where the skill of randomizer comes in.

768
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,517
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think like my progression was I saw them like on speedrunners channels first.

769
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:17,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw speed run.

770
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,920
Speaker 1: That's where I see them the most.

771
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:28,030
Speaker 0: Yeah And I was like interested partly because like as much as I love RPG speedruns I've seen like the world record runs of all these games.

772
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:29,455
Speaker 0: So there's not.

773
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:30,919
Speaker 0: they're all the same now.

774
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:38,418
Speaker 0: Yep unless it's like an AGT queue or like there's good commentary and a couch and all that but like I've seen these games to the Point that I don't need to watch them again.

775
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:51,561
Speaker 0: so I started watching the free enterprise Final Fantasy 4 ones because it just gave me this like kind of Exciting speedrun or race that I can't get like watching a Final Fantasy 4 race straight is not that fun Cuz.

776
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:56,639
Speaker 0: either they're neck-and-neck the whole time or one person falls behind and it's over right even formula one.

777
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,120
Speaker 1: funny That my thing of the day was marbula one, right?

778
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,240
Speaker 1: They have the same mostly the same tracks every year, right?

779
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,357
Speaker 1: And even though they change tracks race to race which keeps it interesting and varied, right?

780
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:08,320
Speaker 1: It's still year to year.

781
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,405
Speaker 1: It's kind of all right.

782
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're back at Monaco again, which is still a great track, but whatever right?

783
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:30,403
Speaker 1: imagine if formula one literally they show up at the track in a car and An unknown track appears before them like they're driving there even know what the next turn is left or right or how close it Is or if it's a hairpin or anything, they're gonna drive around the track mad slow Right and learn

784
00:47:30,423 --> 00:47:30,905
Speaker 0: track

785
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,673
Speaker 1: and then speed up and then you have like a real.

786
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:36,280
Speaker 1: the competition is now not just who?

787
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,771
Speaker 1: Fine-tuned their car for that track knowing everything going in and had the best practice and is the best of that track.

788
00:47:42,891 --> 00:47:50,490
Speaker 1: It's Fastest driver when it comes to tracks everyone already knows.

789
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:58,760
Speaker 1: but if you had to learn a track straight up Maybe there's someone else who learns faster and they would be better or just has more raw racing skills, right?

790
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,460
Speaker 1: Or there's also a luck factor though.

791
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:09,209
Speaker 1: Maybe someone's really good at high speed tracks that right and they're good when they're like a long straightaway and it randomly happens to be a track that suits their style.

792
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:20,276
Speaker 0: or maybe someone's falling behind because one thing that the all these randomizers have that makes the races so much fun and why I'm actually into them is You can press your luck in a way that you can't do in a normal speed run race.

793
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:22,228
Speaker 0: if you're falling behind Take a risk.

794
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,860
Speaker 1: Yep, take a big risk.

795
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,944
Speaker 1: Well, it's like you watching.

796
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:29,480
Speaker 1: it is sort of like gives the the spectator the feeling of scratching a bunch of lottery tickets.

797
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,371
Speaker 1: Oh, right every time they open a chest.

798
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:32,980
Speaker 1: It's like who is it gonna be?

799
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,392
Speaker 1: It could just be some garbage or like be the best.

800
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,840
Speaker 0: I get back to your race analogy.

801
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:40,440
Speaker 0: I'm fine Sam way behind in the f1 like randomizer track.

802
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:47,200
Speaker 0: Maybe I just accelerate hard into a corner and just hope that there isn't a chicane right on the other side.

803
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,885
Speaker 0: Yep, like I'll go for it.

804
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:49,286
Speaker 0: I'm behind.

805
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,659
Speaker 0: Anyway, worst case I explode and die, but if it's a straightaway, I might catch up.

806
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,282
Speaker 1: Yep.

807
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:54,866
Speaker 1: Yep.

808
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:55,087
Speaker 1: Yep.

809
00:48:55,872 --> 00:49:03,640
Speaker 1: So some of these Randomizer things out there have really pushed the limits of what they're randomizing.

810
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:08,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes to good extent but sometimes to questionable extent, right?

811
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,000
Speaker 1: So for example, there's a lot of multi-world things going on, right?

812
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,799
Speaker 1: So the there's two different kinds of multi-world cross games.

813
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,667
Speaker 1: Yeah So one of them is is this thing?

814
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:26,549
Speaker 1: it just so happens apparently by luck that the two biggest randomizer games Super Metroid and link to the past right.

815
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:35,406
Speaker 1: for some reason one of them takes up one half of the super Nintendo cartridge and the other one take us the other half I. They're both the same chips in the cartridge Just memory wise.

816
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:40,224
Speaker 1: one is on one half ones on the other so you could put both games in the same cartridge and they don't Really overlap each other.

817
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:41,388
Speaker 1: so they made it.

818
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:42,291
Speaker 1: they hacked it up.

819
00:49:43,153 --> 00:49:45,981
Speaker 1: It's super Metroid link to the past randomizer They.

820
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:47,407
Speaker 1: this useless feels.

821
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,713
Speaker 0: very chess boxing.

822
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:49,315
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

823
00:49:49,396 --> 00:49:50,460
Speaker 1: It's very chess boxing.

824
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,173
Speaker 1: Not only you're playing link to the past.

825
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,720
Speaker 1: you walk into like a door.

826
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,048
Speaker 1: You would never go in like the.

827
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,080
Speaker 1: I think it's like the the fortune tellers, huh?

828
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:00,825
Speaker 1: Useless place to go.

829
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:05,460
Speaker 1: and you walk in and suddenly Samus walks out a door and you're in Super Metroid.

830
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,300
Speaker 1: and Then Samus goes and fights a boss and grab, you know goes there's a chozo statue.

831
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:15,459
Speaker 1: They shoot the ball in the chozo statue and it's like a hook shot.

832
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,131
Speaker 1: Yeah They grab the hook shot and now Samus goes in a door.

833
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,924
Speaker 1: that goes like a map room a place Samus a useless place for Samus to go right?

834
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:23,766
Speaker 1: You don't need a map room.

835
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:28,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and suddenly link comes out in hyrule with a hook shot.

836
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:33,164
Speaker 1: right, and then link goes and opens the treasure chest and It's a super missile.

837
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:34,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

838
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:35,532
Speaker 1: that's how that's crazy.

839
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:36,295
Speaker 1: Right?

840
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,800
Speaker 1: There's like actually very few.

841
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:39,427
Speaker 1: It's amazing with to watch.

842
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:42,118
Speaker 1: there are very few humans who can actually play it.

843
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:44,145
Speaker 1: Right that's thing.

844
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:49,120
Speaker 1: I'll have a problem in the competitive scene that there's like not enough people who can actually play this damn thing.

845
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and then at least especially not to a competitive level.

846
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,378
Speaker 1: and then the other kind is they've got these multi-world things where.

847
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,179
Speaker 1: okay I'll play some link to the past and you play some link to the past.

848
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:08,799
Speaker 1: right and we're gonna generate ROMs together and I'll give you ROM a and I'll take ROM B and We're gonna connect our emulators to the internet.

849
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:16,707
Speaker 1: and When I pick up I see I see an arrow and I pick up the arrows lying on the ground and it's sometimes I might Just like oh that was your arrow.

850
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,500
Speaker 1: Sometimes it was rims arrow.

851
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's randomized it in such a way that the game is beatable, right?

852
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:25,100
Speaker 1: It actually logically figures out.

853
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,900
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll put all these items in a place such that all these people can beat the game.

854
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:32,476
Speaker 1: There make someone was playing a hundred player randomizer.

855
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:39,164
Speaker 1: Whoa And like if you forfeit and quit it just takes all the items that are in your game and gives them to the people they Belong to because you quit.

856
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:40,812
Speaker 1: that way they can beat the games.

857
00:51:40,892 --> 00:51:44,117
Speaker 0: What if someone who has your item just sucks They'll hopefully quit.

858
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,755
Speaker 0: So if I suck and I just keep on keeping on.

859
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:49,940
Speaker 0: I'm just hoarding the item.

860
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:54,500
Speaker 1: I might just be end up waiting for you for someone to find my stuff and I won't have any locations.

861
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,809
Speaker 0: Check that's.

862
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,380
Speaker 1: somebody finds my item.

863
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,901
Speaker 0: we're in.

864
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:07,419
Speaker 0: we're past like the early like bleeding edge of this and we're getting into like more amor of a plateau where the Randomizers that I think are the most popular and doing the best are the ones where?

865
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:16,319
Speaker 0: Game design decisions are being made by the community and it's starting to coalesce into like the right number of people Who have the right sensibility to make these work?

866
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:17,242
Speaker 0: Like.

867
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:20,536
Speaker 0: I want to give you example of that because the link to the past randomizer and it like.

868
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:23,960
Speaker 0: there's a little fact here that Explains what has changed from the original game?

869
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:25,380
Speaker 0: I want to read some of these front for you.

870
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,580
Speaker 0: Just give you a sense of like how the community has decided to alter the games just to make this work.

871
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:33,225
Speaker 0: So it isn't just random bullshit.

872
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:33,867
Speaker 0: That isn't fun.

873
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:34,229
Speaker 0: Yep.

874
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,259
Speaker 0: You're guaranteed to get the digging game item by the 30th dig.

875
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:41,397
Speaker 0: Yep, you're guaranteed to get the village of outcast chest item on the first attempt.

876
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:44,989
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The pyramid and waterfall wishing fairies no longer upgrade your items.

877
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:49,204
Speaker 0: instead the caves contain two chests each of which account for the usual Upgrades like.

878
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:52,357
Speaker 0: that's the kind of work people are doing to make this work.

879
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,245
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's also way.

880
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:55,150
Speaker 1: it's all once.

881
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,340
Speaker 1: you've played the randomized versions of a lot of these games.

882
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,834
Speaker 1: Also, they cut out because that's mostly speedrunning people who have speedrunning interests making these.

883
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 1: they cut out a lot of the time wasting Bullshit, so it's actually much more.

884
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:13,780
Speaker 1: It's it's almost like a convenient version of the game like ah fast text a very minimal text.

885
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:16,091
Speaker 1: I don't have to wait through cutscenes.

886
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:17,015
Speaker 1: They've been removed.

887
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:18,000
Speaker 1: This is great.

888
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,218
Speaker 1: It's like it's like a you don't really if you go back and play the original game.

889
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:24,369
Speaker 1: You're like Yeah, is this so inconvenient?

890
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,574
Speaker 0: come on just give me the sword.

891
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:26,096
Speaker 0: give me the sword.

892
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:26,920
Speaker 0: just give me the fucking sword.

893
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,242
Speaker 0: Let me go.

894
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:28,432
Speaker 0: Let me go right pop up.

895
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,547
Speaker 1: also, you know The thing is some of these randomized type things.

896
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:31,788
Speaker 1: right.

897
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:35,220
Speaker 1: sometimes, you know, cuz it's been randomized the game can end up way easy.

898
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,245
Speaker 1: You get the dream, right?

899
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:39,180
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, you start playing a game and it's like guess what?

900
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,488
Speaker 1: You got the super powerful weapon right immediately.

901
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:44,540
Speaker 1: The game is now gonna be way easy and fun and that's hella fun.

902
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:58,444
Speaker 1: No denying that but sometimes you play this and it's like alright, it's been 50 minutes I've checked a million places and I don't even have a sword yet and I have to go and fight these bad guys with bombs And I have to beat.

903
00:53:58,504 --> 00:53:59,247
Speaker 1: there's nothing.

904
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:02,380
Speaker 1: there's no item left for me to get except for this boss who has an item.

905
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:06,216
Speaker 1: I have to fight them with my bow and arrow.

906
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:10,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, right There's all kinds of crazy shit like that that goes on in randomizers.

907
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:14,860
Speaker 0: It's got a little random feeling of like old Atari games that have a million modes.

908
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:28,820
Speaker 0: like there's a million modes these randomizers, but honestly unless you get like Too deep like to where your predilections become increasingly esoteric I suggest you stick to the types of randomizations that the community tends to support.

909
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you you know just for the super pro ones, right?

910
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,820
Speaker 1: Either level your skills way up to play the or watch the pros or just watch pros and don't bother.

911
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:38,787
Speaker 0: Yeah The Final Fantasy one.

912
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,780
Speaker 0: what I love the most about it is like the game design changes.

913
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,928
Speaker 0: You can go anywhere like imagine you start with the airship.

914
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:51,169
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of changes, but you can fight Like when you go to where a boss would be Depending on how you randomize it.

915
00:54:51,571 --> 00:55:00,860
Speaker 0: either any bosses there But whatever boss is there has the level equivalent of the boss that should be there.

916
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:04,093
Speaker 1: Yep, so you might go to the first boss in the game.

917
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:05,860
Speaker 1: It might be the last boss in the game.

918
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:08,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, they might Of the first boss.

919
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:17,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might fight a rubicante But he sucks or you might fight the miss dragon in the giant robot and it's a dangerous fucking miss dragon.

920
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:20,170
Speaker 0: Yep, you better actually know how to fight that miss dragon.

921
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:22,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like in the actual regular game.

922
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,719
Speaker 0: You don't really have to know you don't have to worry about like how do I deal with?

923
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:37,712
Speaker 0: Rubicante if like we're all level one and his spells suck But I also suck like you don't have to think about that kind of situation gives you all these new Challenges right and that's the thing is like I was saying before.

924
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,738
Speaker 1: these are the greatest games there are.

925
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:46,160
Speaker 1: it's like it would Be really hard to make a brand new game as good as any of these legendary games.

926
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:49,579
Speaker 1: Right, it'd basically be like and some of that's not game design.

927
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,142
Speaker 0: It's more like it's a genre that doesn't make sense anymore for like modern sensibilities There's.

928
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:57,280
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's like it's tough to beat the best of the best, right?

929
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,900
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a reason there's only one chrono trigger game.

930
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,714
Speaker 0: Like no one's made a game like that ever again.

931
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:02,420
Speaker 0: That was popular.

932
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:07,540
Speaker 1: No But somehow we can get more playability out of those old games.

933
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:08,643
Speaker 1: That can.

934
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:12,553
Speaker 1: that's really hard for any new game even a completely fresh one to compete with.

935
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:19,420
Speaker 0: people are fucking talking about Like people younger than me are talking about Final Fantasy 4 because of this like.

936
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:23,976
Speaker 0: That excites me as someone who is old and likes Final Fantasy 4.

937
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:26,578
Speaker 1: Yeah So every day more and more games are getting randomized.

938
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:28,225
Speaker 1: has been Crystalis randomizer?

939
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:30,673
Speaker 0: crystalis won as much as I wanted to like it.

940
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,880
Speaker 0: crystalis is not a good game for that.

941
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,273
Speaker 1: I'm just saying this mario 64 randomizer.

942
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:36,560
Speaker 0: is there different games?

943
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:39,100
Speaker 1: Lend themselves to randomization.

944
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:41,159
Speaker 1: It's sorry or worse than others.

945
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:45,357
Speaker 0: Like I feel like more drastic changes need to be made to make some of these viable.

946
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:54,820
Speaker 0: like crystalis I think they need to somehow like remove the grind to make it about map navigation Primarily map navigation and combat like stuff like that, right?

947
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:02,550
Speaker 1: But you know also if the games aren't that great to begin with yeah, like a randomizing Pizanadu isn't really gonna make it any better.

948
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:03,432
Speaker 0: Whoo.

949
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,558
Speaker 0: What about uh, dr.

950
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:05,980
Speaker 0: Chaos?

951
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,784
Speaker 1: You could do a randomized dr.

952
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:08,968
Speaker 1: Cas very easily.

953
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,370
Speaker 1: Dr.

954
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,497
Speaker 1: Chaos basically is already a random.

955
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:14,072
Speaker 0: I know dr Chaos actually is very like.

956
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,903
Speaker 1: it's not random at all But it's just.

957
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,053
Speaker 1: it feels like you're if you've never played it before.

958
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:19,440
Speaker 1: it feels like playing a random.

959
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:21,850
Speaker 0: I feel like I just take a speedrun of dr.

960
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:28,440
Speaker 0: Chaos as is and just post it and pretend It's a random is like a randomizer and people wouldn't know it would be an easy game to randomize.

961
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't think there's a demand for the head.

962
00:57:31,731 --> 00:57:32,975
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone why?

963
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,360
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone remembers that game.

964
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:35,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

965
00:57:35,983 --> 00:57:44,089
Speaker 1: so is the thing is like if you're someone who makes games right from that perspective if someone made a randomizer Of your game, right?

966
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:44,772
Speaker 1: It's sort of like.

967
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,560
Speaker 1: I don't know how to feel about that.

968
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,897
Speaker 1: It's like you could have just done that yourself and then made your game more popular.

969
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:55,651
Speaker 0: that way Yep, but also I think most randomizers will never become popular All right, and it's gonna come down to like.

970
00:57:56,396 --> 00:58:10,440
Speaker 0: the real takeaway I think is that randomizers are scratching an itch that the world and the entire game industry Just like did not even recognize was there in any meaningful way and it came into the scene completely sideways, right?

971
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,340
Speaker 1: Well, I kept saying for how many years it's like how come you don't make more of the thing that everyone already loves?

972
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:24,040
Speaker 1: You keep making new different things, you know, we need we want some not too much right but some more of the same.

973
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:28,580
Speaker 1: Repeat yourself, maybe at least one time Nintendo is making another breath of the wild kind of deal.

974
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:30,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like maybe they got the clue.

975
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:36,035
Speaker 1: It's like yeah if you do if you get a hit Let us hit one or two more times and then it'll get stale.

976
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:36,677
Speaker 1: then do something.

977
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:37,039
Speaker 1: move on.

978
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,645
Speaker 0: I need some more.

979
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:42,037
Speaker 0: give me more - three right but shit like, you know shit.

980
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:42,840
Speaker 1: That was so good.

981
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,187
Speaker 1: That has never been repeated.

982
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:56,795
Speaker 0: It's like well now we can do it but I think there's a broader takeaway that I don't know what's gonna happen, but I feel like Something from this randomizer community not now.

983
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:57,860
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be years.

984
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:03,523
Speaker 0: I feel like the eSport that really takes off is gonna be.

985
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:13,593
Speaker 0: it's gonna take some elements from what is popular about these randomizers coupled with things we haven't envisioned yet and I feel like the eSport is not here yet.

986
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:14,940
Speaker 0: And this is what I mean.

987
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:20,809
Speaker 1: I mean the most basic thing right is to take say a common eSport like FPS battle Yeah, and it's like.

988
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:21,514
Speaker 1: how come?

989
00:59:21,535 --> 00:59:26,180
Speaker 1: I don't got you know It's like we have procedurally generated games and we use them for roguelikes.

990
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:33,468
Speaker 1: We now you were now procedurally sort of manipulating older games Right to get these single-player experiences.

991
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,758
Speaker 1: Where is the procedurally generated multiplayer experience?

992
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,401
Speaker 1: Right.

993
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,148
Speaker 1: How come there isn't like quake on a random map?

994
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:42,218
Speaker 1: You've never seen before because it computer just made it.

995
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:43,906
Speaker 1: Yep How come that doesn't exist?

996
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:44,610
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

997
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:45,234
Speaker 1: It might exist.

998
00:59:45,696 --> 00:59:46,219
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

999
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,684
Speaker 0: Well, like it edges the DDR competition where it's a song No one's ever heard before.

1000
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:51,829
Speaker 1: song no one's ever heard before.

1001
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:56,228
Speaker 0: arrows never seen before go up and then the game is just really different Skill than regular DDR.

1002
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:56,590
Speaker 0: Yep.

1003
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:58,380
Speaker 0: I am way better at that than I am at like.

1004
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:10,300
Speaker 0: Better at that than I have a better in real D Way better, but the other takeaway might end up being the like The random part in the sense that people can come back from behind.

1005
01:00:10,923 --> 01:00:17,789
Speaker 0: I know coming back isn't actually a thing but like you can press your luck and like That's something that doesn't really exist in a lot of the current eSports.

1006
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,474
Speaker 0: There's very little press your luck.

1007
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:21,460
Speaker 0: that is effective in eSports.

1008
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:24,254
Speaker 1: Well, you can't press your luck when there's no luck right.

1009
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:27,713
Speaker 1: a lot of these other games Like I said when their knowledge and skill based only.

1010
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:31,099
Speaker 1: it's not about luck It's about how well did you execute on that day?

1011
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,120
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, look over the randomizer, right?

1012
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,987
Speaker 1: The randomizer is still.

1013
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:38,200
Speaker 1: skill and knowledge still matter a lot.

1014
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,500
Speaker 1: If you don't have them, you're not going to win.

1015
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,420
Speaker 0: In fact, you need them to know when and how to press your luck, right?

1016
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,480
Speaker 1: But luck does suddenly come into it when it's a competition at least and not a. you know.

1017
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:54,999
Speaker 1: You just playing you know, Zelda again - yeah and making it more fun by you know Mixing it up and not just playing the same exact game again.

1018
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,704
Speaker 0: But that luck is what makes it a spectator sport and I think that is why Randomizers took off.

1019
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:04,740
Speaker 0: It's that they're fun for the people who play them and fun for the people who watch them.

1020
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,509
Speaker 1: Yep, but also you don't get old right?

1021
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:09,515
Speaker 1: And yeah, this is so this perfect.

1022
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:11,160
Speaker 0: There's no three true outcomes.

1023
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,436
Speaker 0: Baseball there are not but think of it.

1024
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:16,244
Speaker 0: like hockey Hockey has the.

1025
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,452
Speaker 0: you can pull your fucking goalie if you want.

1026
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:20,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that adds so much excitement.

1027
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:24,740
Speaker 0: Most of the good randomizers like people do the equivalent of pull their goalie.

1028
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:28,599
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I like it pretty much every time I watch a speed running competition of any game.

1029
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:36,080
Speaker 0: Yeah I see some sort of goalie pulling Because you know I saw someone get in that fucking whale and go to the moon and no one else was on the moon.

1030
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,523
Speaker 1: You're not?

1031
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:39,000
Speaker 1: you can't necessarily tell how the other players are doing.

1032
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:40,285
Speaker 1: You just had to.

1033
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:42,660
Speaker 1: it's like do I feel behind or do I feel ahead?

1034
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,812
Speaker 1: Yeah, am I doing well or doing worse?

1035
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,140
Speaker 1: Well, how much time is on the clock?

1036
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,548
Speaker 1: How many items do I have?

1037
01:01:47,588 --> 01:01:49,160
Speaker 1: How much have I made progress right now?

1038
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:52,160
Speaker 0: Imagine playing this in like a stadium.

1039
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can't see the other screens.

1040
01:01:54,347 --> 01:01:59,851
Speaker 0: like you're just doing your randomizer and suddenly this the crowd starts going crazy And you didn't do anything.

1041
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:01,460
Speaker 1: Well, that's why you can't hear the crowd either.

1042
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that might actually make it even more exciting.

1043
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,320
Speaker 0: like suddenly you see the other players.

1044
01:02:06,481 --> 01:02:10,036
Speaker 1: That is actually a negative of the competitive speedrunning scene.

1045
01:02:10,157 --> 01:02:10,458
Speaker 1: Is that?

1046
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:14,420
Speaker 1: There's a big taboo about calling anyone out for cheating without evidence?

1047
01:02:14,742 --> 01:02:17,880
Speaker 1: Usually all the ones I've seen stream have like 20-plus minute delays.

1048
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:24,380
Speaker 1: I'm James is because you know We're racing me and Rimmer racing in a randomizer and I go right and rim goes left.

1049
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:26,630
Speaker 1: Right if I can see what rims up to.

1050
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:27,776
Speaker 1: I see he gets the hammer.

1051
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:28,640
Speaker 1: Well, I just stop what I'm doing.

1052
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:29,229
Speaker 1: I go left.

1053
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,181
Speaker 1: Yep, right It's.

1054
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:33,760
Speaker 0: or if he sees that I'm falling behind he knows that he doesn't have to be that risky.

1055
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:48,547
Speaker 1: Like you can play more conservatively Knowing, you know, you both have this because when you're competing you basically make the same exact random seed for both layers Not knowing what the other not having any information about the other player is Absolutely essential.

1056
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:50,980
Speaker 1: You must have that wall up like you're playing bridge.

1057
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:53,780
Speaker 1: No, that's otherwise the whole competitive aspect falls apart.

1058
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:12,357
Speaker 0: But that's where I wonder if in the further evolution like way beyond these randomizers now like eSports stuff Will know will revealing more information about your standing like your positional heuristic and your opponent Be a net positive or net negative for the game as a spectator sport in the long run.

1059
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:16,300
Speaker 0: right now It definitely is a net negative for the way randomizers work.

1060
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:21,120
Speaker 0: But I don't know what the future of game design looks like for that in the future.

1061
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,953
Speaker 0: I said in the future twice there because I'm really hungry.

1062
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:25,499
Speaker 1: I'm also really hungry.

1063
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:30,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you have never played a randomized game of any kind, right?

1064
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,990
Speaker 1: I would recommend looking up your favorite games.

1065
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:38,229
Speaker 1: that obviously not the newest newest games like Any SS NES era, right?

1066
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,615
Speaker 0: It's like the newest bar even in 64 games.

1067
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:45,556
Speaker 1: It's like the newer games are harder to randomize because the date you're basically manipulating.

1068
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:52,380
Speaker 1: you're looking at the ROM Technologically and shuffling the data in the ROM and a logical way to keep the game functioning.

1069
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:56,320
Speaker 1: But and consistent and beatable and there's a lot going on there.

1070
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:01,752
Speaker 1: It's not just like, you know, completely random bits, right and that is only you know.

1071
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:13,280
Speaker 1: So think of some of your old favorite games and go out and find a community of people Who are playing those games and have a randomizer?

1072
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,350
Speaker 1: obviously the more popular games are gonna have a bigger community of people.

1073
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:22,509
Speaker 0: but if you like like an obscure as any s game and Like say there's a pilot wings randomizer community.

1074
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,175
Speaker 1: I don't think there is no definitely not.

1075
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:24,978
Speaker 0: but say there was.

1076
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:32,387
Speaker 0: if You're the person who was so obsessed with pilot wings and you find the ten other people who together made a randomizer You're set.

1077
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:36,556
Speaker 1: it works best with games based on items Obviously right like link to the past.

1078
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:37,100
Speaker 0: There's a read.

1079
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,640
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why the link to the past one is like the iconic one, right?

1080
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,688
Speaker 1: It's so strange that the link to the past one.

1081
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:47,546
Speaker 1: It's like they didn't make the game to be randomized But somehow it is.

1082
01:04:47,666 --> 01:05:00,638
Speaker 1: it's as if it just by chance that the design of that game with the two worlds in the map Yep, it's just like it was as you couldn't make a better one if you try To predict the future of this space.

1083
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:09,320
Speaker 1: right now I'm like, why don't we just handcraft a brand new, you know Two maps cuz I don't in the past and try to make one that's like handcrafted and better?

1084
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,463
Speaker 1: It's like you couldn't.

1085
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:17,722
Speaker 0: it's so good cuz I don't think we still fully understand the extent of like what randomizers are Right.

1086
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:21,737
Speaker 1: It's like less than a roguelike where a roguelike randomizes everything like crazy.

1087
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:22,480
Speaker 1: It's like a net hack.

1088
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,360
Speaker 1: It's all new dungeon every time man, you know, it's like it's only randomizing certain parts.

1089
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,026
Speaker 0: There are games that do that.

1090
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:29,167
Speaker 0: Like.

1091
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:38,936
Speaker 0: there are other kinds of like randomizer procedurally generated games But none of them also have this competitive aspect and the spectator aspect all rolled into one.

1092
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:43,649
Speaker 0: and the overlap with the speedrunning community I think Randomized everything.

1093
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:53,564
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a net hack speedrun But like the advent of randomizers is something that if you asked me or Scott like on game design stuff 15 years ago Or 10 years ago.

1094
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:55,832
Speaker 0: even not no one could have predicted.

1095
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:59,267
Speaker 1: this has already been going on for a few years Yeah, but no one.

1096
01:05:59,287 --> 01:06:00,212
Speaker 1: I want to solve this.

1097
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:01,720
Speaker 1: who made like the first one?

1098
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:02,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, like who came up?

1099
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:04,134
Speaker 1: who decided to do that?

1100
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,000
Speaker 1: It was so clever.

1101
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:14,510
Speaker 0: Yeah I feel like what you would find is someone made a rom hack once and like played it with their friends and then later the Scene started independently right at best, but this was like.

1102
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:19,207
Speaker 0: this is not something that the game design world Expected right.

1103
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:28,200
Speaker 1: It's like there been rom hacks for a long time But like even the best most polished awesome rom hacks warrant, you know, like I guess like the Zelda was a call under whatever.

1104
01:06:28,668 --> 01:06:33,752
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Some of those really weren't but they weren't much until now.

1105
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:36,620
Speaker 1: the random the randomized rom hack is suddenly a huge huge deal.

1106
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,894
Speaker 0: I tried to play that like what bastard Zelda or whatever?

1107
01:06:38,915 --> 01:06:39,720
Speaker 0: the really hard one.

1108
01:06:40,021 --> 01:06:41,726
Speaker 1: Anyway, even I was like how hard could it be?

1109
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:42,348
Speaker 1: Fuck this?

1110
01:06:42,368 --> 01:06:46,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I recommend going to watch and/or try to play them.

1111
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,291
Speaker 1: Don't worry if you can't beat them.

1112
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:51,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, or beat them quickly Just you know.

1113
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:55,019
Speaker 1: pick one that you were familiar with or maybe you know.

1114
01:06:55,481 --> 01:07:00,600
Speaker 1: Actually, if you haven't actually played any of these legendary games, maybe you should do that first regardless of what randomizers.

1115
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:01,950
Speaker 0: But the two will link to.

1116
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:02,413
Speaker 0: is like.

1117
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:06,019
Speaker 0: there's the link to the past ones The one Scott's into and like most people are into that's the big one.

1118
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:12,673
Speaker 0: I'll link to the Final Fantasy one because RPG speedruns and RPG randomizers are a very different ballgame.

1119
01:07:12,753 --> 01:07:18,920
Speaker 1: You also write want to check Super Metroid and oh, yeah So it's called smz3 is like I said the combo one.

1120
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,192
Speaker 1: We're linked to the past and Metro is Super.

1121
01:07:21,212 --> 01:07:24,967
Speaker 1: Metroid are joined at the hip Which is just watch that one.

1122
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:29,200
Speaker 1: You can't play that unless you're mad skilled because both of those games are very hard.

1123
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,992
Speaker 1: Yep, they are very hard games.

1124
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:35,229
Speaker 1: So You got to be mad skilled to be able to beat them both together.

1125
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:39,300
Speaker 0: I want to mash up bionic commando and anything.

1126
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,207
Speaker 0: What are you randomizing?

1127
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:40,912
Speaker 1: bionic commando?

1128
01:07:41,294 --> 01:07:41,959
Speaker 0: Oh, there are items.

1129
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:44,347
Speaker 1: Okay, are they the same kind of items?

1130
01:07:44,387 --> 01:07:45,190
Speaker 1: like they unlock areas.

1131
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,500
Speaker 0: they unlock areas but there's weapons that unlock areas.

1132
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,810
Speaker 0: There's also radio transceivers that unlock areas and the items.

1133
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:55,664
Speaker 0: there's a lot of doors and items can be different places and doors can go To different places.

1134
01:07:56,067 --> 01:07:56,852
Speaker 0: you can make it work.

1135
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:57,999
Speaker 1: All right, go you do it.

1136
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:03,435
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look right now before we're in the show and see if anyone made a bionic commander randomizer.

1137
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:03,796
Speaker 1: Nope.

1138
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,140
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

1139
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,627
Speaker 0: This Has been geek nights with rim and Scott.

1140
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:14,823

01:08:35,814 --> 01:08:45,957
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patreon patrons for this episode of geek nights will be read momentarily.

1146
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:52,710
Speaker 0: as you know We have a pretty new audio pipeline and new Equipment, so I'm just let me know.

1147
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,700
Speaker 0: Does the show sound better worse the same.

1148
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:59,439
Speaker 0: Is there any audio issue that might be bothering any of you with the current way the show sounds?

1149
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:07,206
Speaker 0: I'm Probably gonna finalize the new pipeline based on some feedback and leave it steady-state for a while But I'm pretty happy with this so far.

1150
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:12,648
Speaker 0: But anyway patreon patrons are Ellen Joyce Heidi McNichol Marty Green.
