00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,164
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 18th.

2
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:16,900
Speaker 1: I'm rim Scott's in the other room packing for Otacon and this is geek night.

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,773
Speaker 1: Tonight we present to you our Kinetic on 2007 con report.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,018
Speaker 1: Let's do this Man, this week just flew by.

5
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,666
Speaker 0: Well, you only work three days.

6
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:39,060
Speaker 1: Those are three quick days, especially when it's not just oh, I'm working three days Then I get a long weekend.

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:48,713
Speaker 1: It's I'm working three day or working three days and then I'm taking a long weekend and then I'm taking a week and another Weekend, I've basically taken seven work days off starting tomorrow.

8
00:00:48,794 --> 00:01:05,800
Speaker 0: So that's a total of 7 8 and 10. a lot of days 11 days of no working and oh that's gonna reset the old Machine, I think I'll be feeling mighty good when we get back or mighty tired from vacationing and eating another vacation.

9
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,880
Speaker 1: No, because our vacations in Wildwood typically are actually relaxing.

10
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:10,765
Speaker 0: I know it's it just.

11
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:17,474
Speaker 0: you know, a lot of people especially typical US Stereotypical family they leave on Friday night.

12
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:27,900
Speaker 1: They get back Sunday night They go to work on Monday and they do stuff the whole time They're out they run around doing touristy crap that tires them out and then they don't actually relax or rewind or unwind or anything.

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,528
Speaker 0: so Yeah, Otacon this weekend.

14
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,270
Speaker 0: Nice.

15
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:32,772
Speaker 1: Yep.

16
00:01:32,913 --> 00:01:34,760
Speaker 1: Well, I don't really have any news about it.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,280
Speaker 1: We already talked about what panels were doing.

18
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,300
Speaker 1: The only thing I really want to point out is that apparently?

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,973
Speaker 1: Gerald over at anime world order has a far lower opinion of himself than we do with him.

20
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:48,099
Speaker 1: So I have to retract my Statement that he's gonna do something awesome at the end of the panel.

21
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:53,339
Speaker 1: It turns out he's going to do something really really lame and boring.

22
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:58,160
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I guess that means he's just gonna show up and be his usual self.

23
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:59,324
Speaker 0: Oh, he's gonna.

24
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:04,240
Speaker 0: he's gonna talk like Sam the Eagle for maybe a half hour and then leave.

25
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:13,320
Speaker 1: Now apparently he was just concerned that I was pimping up like his final segment for the gecky got panel And he's worried that I was gonna raise the expectations too high.

26
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:21,587
Speaker 0: so, uh don't expect so much such a high percentage of the people that are gonna be there listen to this show and They're all expecting something big.

27
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:25,140
Speaker 1: In fact, I almost feel like we should kick anyone out who already listens to us.

28
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you already hear this stuff.

29
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:28,772
Speaker 1: You already know half of it.

30
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:33,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is gonna be mostly entertainment for the Hentai plebeians out there.

31
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,555
Speaker 0: All right, so I actually believe it or not?

32
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,799
Speaker 0: have an underwear pervert news.

33
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,600
Speaker 0: Amazing spider-man is pretty much the spider-man comic.

34
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:51,734
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm always complaining about how there are other spider-man comics like Spectacular spider-man and friendly neighborhood spider-man even though that one's not so bad.

35
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,020
Speaker 0: and I guess there's some other ones.

36
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:55,871
Speaker 0: I don't know a web of spider-man.

37
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,220
Speaker 0: I don't think they make web of spider-man.

38
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,467
Speaker 1: I think that man's really the only underwear pervert.

39
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:02,056
Speaker 1: I like yeah, even then I don't like most Batman.

40
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:06,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway Marvel is doing one smart thing.

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,319
Speaker 0: This is why this is such big news.

42
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,843
Speaker 0: ready They're canceling everything except for amazing spider-man Really?

43
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,168
Speaker 0: Yes, and they're only gonna.

44
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:24,160
Speaker 0: they're gonna make amazing spider-man three times a month Which is a big deal because now you don't have to deal with the bullshit of reading a bunch of different comics.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 0: You just read one comic and I'm sure it was three issues coming out a month.

46
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:33,019
Speaker 0: that means they'll probably be trades every two or three months.

47
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,944
Speaker 0: and Spider-man if it's.

48
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:39,280
Speaker 0: if they write a good spider-man story, I don't know.

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,500
Speaker 0: I might read some spider-man cuz I kind of like spider-man.

50
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,760
Speaker 1: I just remember when I was a kid and I thought hey, I should check out this comic thing.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,370
Speaker 1: I know other people read quote-unquote comic books.

52
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,233
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

53
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 0: is you read them in the early 90s when they were shit.

54
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,552
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is most of them are still pretty bad.

55
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:58,217
Speaker 0: 90% of them are still shit Yes, but in the 90s in the early 90s, it was more like 99 point.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,017
Speaker 1: But my problem was specifically that I thought alright, I'll read this one and it's called the x-men.

57
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:04,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, wait a minute.

58
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,389
Speaker 1: How come the story doesn't make sense between it?

59
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,232
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

60
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:09,436
Speaker 1: I have to read this other comic.

61
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:10,640
Speaker 1: Yeah this other comic.

62
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:11,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll fuck this.

63
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,180
Speaker 1: I'm going back to my Nintendo.

64
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,899
Speaker 0: So it's good to see they're finally moving away from that in however small away.

65
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,735
Speaker 1: I wonder how much crazy fanboy outcry there's been.

66
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:26,991
Speaker 0: there has been Fanboy outcry in both directions surprisingly really?

67
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:27,393
Speaker 0: Yes.

68
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,620
Speaker 1: Ooh, maybe we'll get some sort of fanboy war.

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,283
Speaker 0: Yes, we'll see.

70
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:33,158
Speaker 0: some of the concerns of the fanboys are that you know?

71
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,560
Speaker 0: Let's see if you read amazing spider-man now, right?

72
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:48,907
Speaker 0: Every issue of amazing spider-man is written by one guy and artist by another guy, right and every issue of friendly neighborhood Spider-man is written by another guy and artists by another guy but it's consistent within the title.

73
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:54,183
Speaker 0: so all the friendly neighborhoods are written by one guy and all the amazing sir written by a different guy and The.

74
00:04:54,385 --> 00:05:01,519
Speaker 0: the thinking is that now that it's three a month It's gonna be a different writer for each one during the month and a different artist for each.

75
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,179
Speaker 0: Because no, you know American comic artists are all lazy and they can't you know Do the work of a manga artist of like 10 pages a day?

76
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,480
Speaker 0: And they have to add the colors in and they have to do all this fancy printing and shit.

77
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:22,078
Speaker 0: So they can only make you know, 24 pages a month Whereas a manga artist with their crew makes that much in.

78
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,759
Speaker 1: It depends on the manga artist.

79
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,146
Speaker 0: some Artists are super slow.

80
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:35,479
Speaker 0: Yes, like the trygun guy, but you know freaking Tezuka man He put out a zillion pages all by himself and anyone who doesn't live up to that, you know.

81
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:38,119
Speaker 0: Well, you're just not as good as he is.

82
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:47,160
Speaker 1: But anyway in other news I would just like to point out that Lupin the third is one of my favorite franchises of anime and manga ever.

83
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,052
Speaker 1: I just on the third upon the third.

84
00:05:53,621 --> 00:06:01,600
Speaker 1: Well on July 27th in Japan, they're going to air the 40th anniversary upon the third television special.

85
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:11,806
Speaker 1: now apparently this is the 18th or 19 such special and they got someone cool to sing the opening theme for it and it is called Scott.

86
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,415
Speaker 1: that is so annoying.

87
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:16,198
Speaker 0: I Was trying to keep it up the whole time.

88
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,195
Speaker 1: It's called a Lupin the third kitty.

89
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:24,652
Speaker 0: No elusive Mmm, we might have to watch that somehow.

90
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:25,475
Speaker 1: I don't know.

91
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:27,262
Speaker 1: perhaps there will be a Torrent.

92
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:31,013
Speaker 0: perhaps there might be with some subteeth lays granted.

93
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,340
Speaker 1: We're definitely not gonna see until we get back from our vacation.

94
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:42,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing Lupin is a really interesting Series in Japan because it had like two or three TV series, right?

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:50,747
Speaker 0: It has a whole bunch of movies a lot of which were made for TV movies and it seems that more than any other You know anime manga property.

96
00:06:51,048 --> 00:07:02,149
Speaker 0: Lupin has like a billion TV specials all over the place and it's really hard to see them all and I really let alone the Gigantic quantity of episodes of the shows.

97
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:07,687
Speaker 1: Yes, and all the movies and the manga I and don't forget the live-action Strange psychokinetic strategy.

98
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:08,068
Speaker 0: I got it.

99
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,353
Speaker 0: We got to buy the DVD of that.

100
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:10,156
Speaker 1: I saw that.

101
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,259
Speaker 0: I gotta see it.

102
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:19,940
Speaker 1: I mean it was good enough to where we're at katsu-kan and our hotel room was Literally like at the top of a little stairway and at the bot like it was stairway to our room.

103
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:21,727
Speaker 1: Go down the stairs open the door.

104
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,620
Speaker 1: You're in the middle of the con like crazy yelling right there.

105
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:27,890
Speaker 1: So Scott goes it's go Joe not Scott the other Scott.

106
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,195
Speaker 1: Let's see the other Scott.

107
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:29,778
Speaker 1: We know your.

108
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:30,300
Speaker 0: I wasn't there.

109
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the year before Scott came to katsu-kan.

110
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know there'll be no such year again.

111
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:43,093
Speaker 1: I was there with the the surrogate Scott the the older Scott the some would argue superior Scott Some like he would.

112
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,079
Speaker 0: yeah, that's about it.

113
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:58,020
Speaker 1: Well, uh, he says I'm getting up early to go see this Lupin and I'm laying in bed with a slight hangover thinking You know I'm gonna stay here for a while and he calls my phone like four times and then he comes back upstairs.

114
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:58,563
Speaker 1: It says rib.

115
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,266
Speaker 1: You gotta come down.

116
00:07:59,287 --> 00:07:59,950
Speaker 1: It's freaking awesome.

117
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:06,630
Speaker 1: So in my pajamas, I stagger downstairs and stagger into the showing room and uh, it was awesome.

118
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:08,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll pick that up.

119
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,519
Speaker 1: I'll warn you though It was really dumb, but it was dumb in that awesome way.

120
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,605
Speaker 0: Was it better than size and Jotaro?

121
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,250
Speaker 1: Uh, it was dumber.

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,976
Speaker 1: No, no, it wasn't dumber.

123
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:18,437
Speaker 1: It's hard.

124
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:24,659
Speaker 1: You know, you can't compare him because eyes and Jotaro is the Absolute line between bad and funny.

125
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:27,409
Speaker 1: It is the thin edge if you go.

126
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz part of it's funny and part of it's just bad.

127
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:34,024
Speaker 1: if you go any more bad It ceases to be funny because it's just really bad.

128
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,090
Speaker 1: You don't want to watch that's true.

129
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,780
Speaker 1: If you got any less bad or less dumb, it's just lame and you don't care.

130
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also.

131
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,809
Speaker 1: oh, it's right there.

132
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,875
Speaker 1: There is nothing closer to the line.

133
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:45,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the Lupin is funny bad.

134
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,845
Speaker 1: Lupin was awesome and stupid.

135
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:48,547
Speaker 0: All right.

136
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:57,889
Speaker 1: All right Thing of the day.

137
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,940
Speaker 0: rim didn't want to bother with the thing of the day.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,895
Speaker 1: Well, I could done like there's a ghost riding old grandma.

139
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:03,760
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good one.

140
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,653
Speaker 1: I'm saving that for a Monday.

141
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:11,649
Speaker 1: All right wider Technological and techno society ramifications.

142
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,138
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the socio-political impacts of such.

143
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:14,760
Speaker 0: All right.

144
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,526
Speaker 0: Well, my thing of the day is pretty simple.

145
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,312
Speaker 0: It's Japanese TV.

146
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,459
Speaker 0: Of course the source of all things of the day.

147
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:25,259
Speaker 1: Do you think we should just be done with it and just have a thing of the day be Japanese TV?

148
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Speaker 0: It's basically what this area is, but this is a monkey and a dog Riding the train without any visible help from human beings.

149
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:39,709
Speaker 1: It's quite interesting and somewhat hilarious.

150
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,515
Speaker 1: And I think my favorite part is the end.

151
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:45,024
Speaker 1: when he books through that turnstile Yeah the monkey is actually.

152
00:09:45,044 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 0: you can see that he not only did he learn beforehand how to use the train ticket machine and how to Use the train turnstile and all that stuff, but he learns in the process of executing his you know practiced Maneuver that the turnstile is sort of scary and it'll hit him if he messes up.

153
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,219
Speaker 0: So he is afraid of the turnstile.

154
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:13,100
Speaker 1: I just I mean they always zoom in on his face and he's obviously sitting there Thinking about what to do next and how to go about it and he succeeds.

155
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:16,414
Speaker 0: He actually does a better job than a lot of humans.

156
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:30,640
Speaker 1: I've seen in the city I do recall not one but two of our friends when we took them to New York City for the first time Proceeded to swipe their metro card and then push the turnstile around thus depriving them of getting access.

157
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,889
Speaker 0: Yes, but they still did better than the monkey.

158
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did but I have seen people who haven't.

159
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,989
Speaker 0: yes I have seen people who have not done as well as this monkey.

160
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:44,179
Speaker 1: So yeah, so instead of a thing of the day very briefly We're just gonna tell you about all the things we're doing at Otakon.

161
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:50,917
Speaker 1: Also, I want to point out again that Gerald has something really lame planned for the end of our gecky god panel.

162
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:56,500
Speaker 0: All right anyway Friday most of our first of all, we're gonna be in the artists alley.

163
00:10:56,882 --> 00:11:01,320
Speaker 0: We're gonna be in the back of the artists alley near the bathrooms and left unless the map changes somehow.

164
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:10,832
Speaker 0: So if you want to see us We're gonna probably be spending a lot of time there when we're not doing anything else and at least one of us or one Of the crew will be there most of the time.

165
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:11,958
Speaker 0: I want to say I don't know.

166
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:15,679
Speaker 0: So yeah, come see us in artists alley if you can't find us anywhere else.

167
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:20,639
Speaker 0: So yes, we will be in the artists alley much of the con if you cannot find us anywhere else.

168
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,293
Speaker 0: However, we are also doing some panels for you to enjoy.

169
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:33,796
Speaker 0: first of all, I want to say There's gonna be an OC remix panel pretty much like at the start of the convention.

170
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:35,100
Speaker 1: It was pretty hot last year.

171
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,049
Speaker 1: I highly recommend it.

172
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:40,175
Speaker 0: Yes The OC remix panel is one of the high quality panels.

173
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:41,100
Speaker 0: That is not to be missed.

174
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:44,787
Speaker 0: I was on the wrong page.

175
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:45,470
Speaker 0: That's why I'm messing.

176
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,797
Speaker 1: Oh, I need to open the schedule.

177
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:47,520
Speaker 1: Do I need to handle?

178
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,411
Speaker 0: No, I had the schedule on the wrong page.

179
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,699
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm good to go.

180
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:54,758
Speaker 0: Oc remix panel is in panel 4 at 10 a.m.

181
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,080
Speaker 0: Friday.

182
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:56,024
Speaker 0: Awesome.

183
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:02,747
Speaker 0: The next panel I care about is the bandai visual USA Q&A at 2 p.m.

184
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,133
Speaker 0: On Friday and panel 2 now.

185
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:13,540
Speaker 1: if no one else asks the question We're going to ask it and furthermore I'm going to record the entire panel and I'm not gonna record it craptacularly like whoever recorded the last one did.

186
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:20,893
Speaker 0: Yes, so we're gonna go to the bandai visual panel and we're gonna say hey Why the fuck is your frickin anime so expensive?

187
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:21,335
Speaker 0: goddamn?

188
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,660
Speaker 0: we want to watch all your shows But we don't want to pay 40 bucks for a goddamn 20 minutes of anime.

189
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,799
Speaker 0: Get your freaking head out of your ass bandai visual and we're gonna see what they say.

190
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:35,680
Speaker 0: Cuz as long as we keep asking them the same question at every convention eventually they'll cave in.

191
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,108
Speaker 0: That's the only way we can do it.

192
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,200
Speaker 0: So everyone team up for great justice.

193
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:47,759
Speaker 0: In fact, the greatest justice would be if we ask the question we sit down Someone else stands up and ask the question again and they sit down and so on.

194
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:52,820
Speaker 1: Well only if they don't give a straight answer like we're just trying to rip you off or we don't understand the American.

195
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,920
Speaker 0: But if they do that, we'll have it recorded and we'll put it on the internet and that'll be awesome.

196
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:04,615
Speaker 0: All right now for the panels that we're in Friday night 9 p.m Anime Club back end summit in panel 2.

197
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,160
Speaker 0: You should go if you care about anime clubs.

198
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:11,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott Johnson technically runs that one, but I've been on it for like the last five years.

199
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:16,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will talk about the one we ran at Connecticut because we actually ran it a little bit differently this year.

200
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,410
Speaker 0: There's a good chance you'll see us there.

Speaker 0: you should show up Immediately.

202
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,351
Speaker 0: after that there's a one-hour break.

203
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:25,440
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like a one-hour break in the convention.

204
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaker 0: I mean the stuff's still going on But we have a one-hour break as in we're not doing anything that hour.

Speaker 0: I Don't know what's with them and showing up to conventions late or getting kicked out of hotel room Yeah, but that's sure to be a pretty cool panel.

222
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:39,720
Speaker 0: well We'll arrange something cool to talk about and entertaining and at the very least you'll get to see a bunch of Podcasters all at once and hear all of us talk about things and ask us all questions.

223
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:48,840
Speaker 1: And of course, uh, Dave and Joel just cuz I'm mentioning them You might want to listen to our Wednesday night show next week because they are the guest hosts of geek nights.

224
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,507
Speaker 0: Yes, it's quite awesome.

225
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:50,748
Speaker 1: Yes.

226
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,155
Speaker 1: We I've already listened to it twice.

227
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:59,177
Speaker 0: It's double a-plus And immediately after the podcasters roundtable is the Friday night.

228
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:02,386
Speaker 1: the meat of Friday night concern tomorrow night.

229
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:07,880
Speaker 0: In fact, not tomorrow night two days from right is for two days from this recording at night at midnight.

230
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:22,193
Speaker 0: So that's actually Saturday at zero in panel two right after the podcasters roundtable 18 plus only sorry under 18 year olds Gekiga putting the man back in manga with me rim and Gerald.

231
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:22,554
Speaker 0: Gerald.

232
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:28,620
Speaker 1: rim and I we ran this Just myself and Scott at Connecticut and it went really really well.

233
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 1: the people were there really dug it and I'll admit that at Connecticut we did it kind of half-assed Lee because uh, I Was exhausted my throat hurt and Scott was exhausted.

234
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,020
Speaker 0: Yes, and even then it was awesome.

235
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:52,368
Speaker 0: so if you take that awesomeness and you add a lot more people in the audience and you add rim doing more and Gerald being There and actual visuals and perhaps we might even bring some of the manga Gaki got pass them around

236
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:52,790
Speaker 1: as I don't

237
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,855
Speaker 0: think we're passing them around.

238
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,880
Speaker 1: We got extra Eagles.

239
00:15:55,402 --> 00:16:01,444
Speaker 0: I guess we could pass around extra Eagles, but it's gonna be quite an awesome hour of Anime entertainment.

240
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:09,960
Speaker 0: get manga Gekiga entertainment and you should be there if you like this show And you're a man or a woman All right.

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,940
Speaker 0: The only other panel that I see on the schedule that's worth caring about is the kendo demonstration by our friend katsu.

242
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:18,660
Speaker 0: He is a kendo master.

243
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:24,160
Speaker 0: He will show you the ways of kendo that are not fooling around or stupid and it is listed as a kendo demonstration.

244
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:44,960
Speaker 1: There is a long story that might be told at the panel but if Otakon will let us do it there might be finally closure to the fact that technically I am the undefeated vice president of the RIT kendo club and Technically I was there for the best kendo or other than katsu ever

245
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,665
Speaker 0: And that's technically correct.

246
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,250
Speaker 1: and while that is technically true.

247
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,694
Speaker 1: That is not really true.

248
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,500
Speaker 0: That's not even close to being really.

249
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:54,516
Speaker 1: I'm uh, I'm bad at Tecna a techno.

250
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:01,780
Speaker 1: I'm bad And the only reason I remained undefeated was that I never actually went to a single kendo club meeting.

251
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,096
Speaker 1: Thus no one could challenge me for the position.

252
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,432
Speaker 1: Yes So katsu has had a grudge since then.

253
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:11,469
Speaker 0: if you want to see this kendo demonstration It will be at 2 30 p.m.

254
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,140
Speaker 0: On Saturday in panel 1 at Otakon.

255
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:20,839
Speaker 0: other than that Yeah, not much else we're doing.

256
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:27,998
Speaker 0: There's some things I'm probably gonna be interested in going to see like there's something at 1 a.m.

257
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:28,820
Speaker 0: On Saturday night.

258
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,055
Speaker 0: That's being a live-action movie called killing machine.

259
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:33,160
Speaker 0: That's got to be good.

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,070
Speaker 1: That might be this year's each of the killer.

261
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,780
Speaker 1: SARS wars Ebola syndrome.

262
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:40,112
Speaker 0: It might be but it doesn't say like 18 plus on it.

263
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:40,754
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure.

264
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,023
Speaker 1: Oh, it's got to be ultra-violent I don't know.

265
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:43,585
Speaker 1: What's the point?

266
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,870
Speaker 0: It's called killing machine.

267
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,556
Speaker 0: I assume it's something ultraviolet.

268
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:47,359
Speaker 0: I don't know what the deal is.

269
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:50,229
Speaker 1: Anyway, briefly what we're gonna do tonight.

270
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:50,952
Speaker 1: Maybe not briefly.

271
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,216
Speaker 1: We'll see is we're?

272
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:53,440
Speaker 1: you know, we're going Otakon this weekend.

273
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,494
Speaker 1: But last weekend we went to Connecticut and it was nothing to sneeze at.

274
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:57,679
Speaker 0: no, it was not.

275
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:06,889
Speaker 0: Actually if I let's talk about Connecticut not from the panel perspective, you know panelers perspective But from the goer the con goer perspective.

276
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:15,636
Speaker 0: and if I went to Connecticut as a con goer I imagine I would have spent the vast majority of my time in the tabletop gaming room.

277
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:19,707
Speaker 1: now granted a big part of that Is that Connecticut has better gaming than a lot of gaming cons.

278
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,151
Speaker 1: for one that is true.

279
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:26,660
Speaker 1: The aiming at Connecticut is awesome and two That's just the kind of that we're really into that.

280
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,035
Speaker 1: So that's the kind of thing we do if we go to gaming cons a lot We want to go to a lot more gaming cons.

281
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:36,195
Speaker 0: Yep The artists alley a typical artists alley, but it was twice as big as last year's.

282
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:37,540
Speaker 0: the definite plus.

283
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:42,680
Speaker 0: The dealers room actually pretty high quality a lot of the same dealers as last year.

284
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,966
Speaker 1: We bought $80 worth of mom.

285
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:50,040
Speaker 1: Well $80 of manga from the buy one get three free comic opiate a table.

286
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,814
Speaker 0: Yes comic opiate quite awesome with the cheap old mom.

287
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:53,860
Speaker 1: We pulled a Scott Johnson.

288
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,945
Speaker 1: You should see the job.

289
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:58,080
Speaker 1: We walked away from that table with more manga than we could easily carry.

290
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,208
Speaker 0: I bought these Astro Boy figures and the only I'm.

291
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,877
Speaker 0: usually I'm pretty much done buying figures, but they were a dollar.

292
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:11,220
Speaker 0: a dollar That means like other figures are like eight dollars each and these were a dollar.

293
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:14,632
Speaker 0: Of course the dealer selling them was actually the anime store.

294
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,720
Speaker 0: that's down the road from us, but that's fine.

295
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,552
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also our friend Luca runs hammer girl.

296
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:29,183
Speaker 0: The anime store was there so we got to hang out with them Had offered all of offered by Kazuo Koike, so I bought that from them, of course, of course No one else had that.

297
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:30,788
Speaker 0: Yeah dealers room.

298
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,052
Speaker 0: Not a bad dealers room.

299
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,136
Speaker 1: Yeah now one interest.

300
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:47,018
Speaker 1: apparently on Sunday there was a small but somewhat a bit of a problem with people trying to steal things from dealers and we debated a lot about whether it's the demographic of the con or the area or whatever.

301
00:19:47,038 --> 00:20:01,244
Speaker 1: and Then we discovered that the dude who was arrested was might have been a professional shoplifter or just an idiot But the rest of them might have all been punk kids from the same summer camp that seems to dump all of its kids at Connecticut every year on Sunday.

302
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think some of the biggest shoplifters.

303
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:09,584
Speaker 0: It's something like this, you know little kids at summer camp They don't have money the the money they get.

304
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:19,297
Speaker 0: basically the way summer camps work is their parents put money in an envelope that the camp director holds on to And then when the kid goes on a trip the camp gives them some money from the envelope.

305
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,665
Speaker 0: not all of it Just some of it.

306
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:22,660
Speaker 0: and that's all the kids got.

307
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:29,880
Speaker 0: So these kids want stuff and little summer camp kids are pretty much very good at thieving.

308
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,346
Speaker 0: They've got lots of peer pressure.

309
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:38,820
Speaker 0: They don't have any consequences of actual school You know, they're being herded by college kids and teenagers.

310
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:40,109
Speaker 0: They're.

311
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,540
Speaker 0: they're very Likely to steal things especially from an anime con dealers room where there's lots of little things that they really want.

312
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:54,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course kinetic on definitely alter their policy somewhat and they went from normal con to Super.

313
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:58,175
Speaker 1: crack down on people who steal police there to arrest the scary dude.

314
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,037
Speaker 0: That's how it should be.

315
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:02,260
Speaker 0: Yep Video game room not typical.

316
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:17,760
Speaker 0: Yeah It wasn't the greatest video game room mostly because the way the video game their room there works is that it's Sponsored by like Best Buy and GameStop and those people supply the equipment that is used by the game room and they got shortchanged by the sponsors.

317
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,996
Speaker 1: so to me that would have been nice because actually as a result it was more spread out and it was a lot nicer to Physically be in that room than most anime con game room.

318
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:26,640
Speaker 0: That is true.

319
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,066
Speaker 0: But at the same time there were very.

320
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:31,441
Speaker 0: I walked through it a couple times and there was really nothing I wanted to do in There.

321
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,175
Speaker 0: but there's one guitar hero machine.

322
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:33,760
Speaker 1: even at Otakon.

323
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,766
Speaker 1: I'd never care about the video game room.

324
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:42,811
Speaker 1: to me video game rooms at cons other than tournaments and guitar hero type things Exists for the same reason that anime showings do.

325
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,638
Speaker 0: they're just there except the katakan.

326
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:54,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, katakan is different But it's just to keep people Who aren't doing something currently out of the way and not feeling like there's nothing to do Especially people who don't want to socialize.

327
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:59,160
Speaker 0: the one problem which everyone seemed to recognize is that to get into the game room?

328
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,501
Speaker 0: You need.

329
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,526
Speaker 0: they had a bag check.

330
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know many people complained about this at the con feedback session.

331
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:14,840
Speaker 0: We actually answered more than the staff did about the head basically because the sponsors that the GameStop and Best Buy basically said Hey, if you don't have a bag check, we won't let we won't give you this stuff.

332
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:19,436
Speaker 0: So they had to do a bag check it in order to get the free stuff from the sponsors.

333
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:26,624
Speaker 1: now the real answer I would put forth is that they're gonna need to have a bag check anyway, because those controllers are gonna get stolen Otherwise, yep.

334
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,880
Speaker 0: I mean the controller costs as almost as much as your con badge.

335
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:36,489
Speaker 0: So if you can steal two of them you win You just leave and you buy another con badge.

336
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:49,508
Speaker 1: and I think what bothered me was mostly that the people who complained About the thing about the bag check were the kind of people who probably wouldn't have gone into the video game room Anyway, or more importantly they complained about it Like it was terribly run.

337
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:53,186
Speaker 1: what I got to say it was run better than any Yes in con bag check I've ever seen.

338
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:56,016
Speaker 0: the problem with the bag check was not that it was run poorly.

339
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:56,819
Speaker 0: the bag chin was.

340
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,440
Speaker 0: the Bagcheck was run excellently much better than the katsu con bag check.

341
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:14,037
Speaker 0: The problem with the bag check is that I would walk up to the video game room with an urge to go in But only a slight urge and when they said you'll have to check your bag I said well I would rather not go in there than check my bag and many people felt the same way

342
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:14,960
Speaker 1: at the same time.

343
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,482
Speaker 1: That's fine.

344
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:20,040
Speaker 1: That way if someone goes in there, they're up for a bunch of video gaming and that's gonna walk in and out.

345
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,250
Speaker 1: Yep, it's a tough line.

346
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,240
Speaker 1: I think katsu khan is gonna have the right idea next year.

347
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,416
Speaker 1: We've got two ideas for how to change the way the bag check works to make it more awesome, but we'll see.

348
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:34,140
Speaker 0: we will see What else is going down at the kinetic a lot of panels?

349
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,930
Speaker 1: We didn't get to go to any because we were doing our seven.

350
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna go into every single panel.

351
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:39,543
Speaker 1: We did.

352
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,592
Speaker 1: we talked about him how they went.

353
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,319
Speaker 1: they all went really well.

354
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:54,360
Speaker 1: What I do want to say is that one we ran the how to run an anime club panel and we ran it completely differently from the way we've ever run that panel before and I think it's a much better panel now, and I want to run it this way in the future.

355
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:55,202
Speaker 0: I agree.

356
00:23:55,523 --> 00:24:00,737
Speaker 1: basically the deal is usually Scott Johnson or whoever runs it will you know talk to the audience.

357
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:01,843
Speaker 1: let the clubs all shout Out.

358
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:02,960
Speaker 1: it'd be kind of like a club summit.

359
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:14,940
Speaker 1: What we've learned is that you don't let the audience talk Because most of them can't speak well in public and most of them as the same stupid boring questions that no one else cares about Except for the one cool question last year.

360
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:27,822
Speaker 1: There's always one cool question always but other than that most of the people who go to the anime club summit No offense to you guys But it's pretty obvious what they're doing because I can see how I might have done that back when I was still running an anime Club.

361
00:24:28,244 --> 00:24:32,928
Speaker 1: you ask a question that basically is formatted like this Hi plug my club plug.

362
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:33,590
Speaker 1: plug my club.

363
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,212
Speaker 1: plug my club.

364
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,180
Speaker 1: plug my club my question.

365
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,046
Speaker 1: Show how smart I am Shaw smart.

366
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:38,768
Speaker 1: I am Shaw smart.

367
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:39,430
Speaker 1: I am show smart.

368
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,319
Speaker 1: I am really dumb question that we might have already answered.

369
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:45,664
Speaker 0: That Was so accurate.

370
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:49,680
Speaker 1: I no offense to you guys, but seriously we can see right through you.

371
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:50,783
Speaker 1: So what we did is.

372
00:24:51,345 --> 00:25:01,620
Speaker 1: all we did was ask the crowd if they were people who like raise your hand if you're Running a club want to run a club as opposed to plugging a club want to join a club and most people want it.

373
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,198
Speaker 1: We're running club or wanted to run a club.

374
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:10,340
Speaker 1: So we pretty much just sat there and talk shop and just told them straight up exactly what you do.

375
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,546
Speaker 1: We didn't let the industry do their.

376
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:16,235
Speaker 1: you know the industry stuff and we didn't do the lame like.

377
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:25,168
Speaker 1: well anime showings are important because blah and blah and blah and you have to show wide variety and we were like You trick people into coming with these techniques.

378
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:30,980
Speaker 1: the executive board has to be structured like this and act like this But you have to act like this behind closed doors.

379
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:34,219
Speaker 1: You got to get rid of these people and don't let them be in your club and you got to open it.

380
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,218
Speaker 0: You got to make it feel like it's democracy when it's actually an oligarchy, etc, etc.

381
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,848
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what the crowd fucking loved it.

382
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,836
Speaker 0: I gotta say yeah, it was.

383
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:43,980
Speaker 0: it was our first panel.

384
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,430
Speaker 0: It was well attended and the people seemed to enjoy it.

385
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,680
Speaker 1: people actually lined up outside to get into it.

386
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,406
Speaker 1: I was somewhat surprised by that.

387
00:25:50,587 --> 00:26:00,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, some of the most of the people stayed for our Immediately following panel a podcasting panel, which not the greatest podcasting panel we ever done.

388
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,762
Speaker 0: Well partly

389
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:22,747
Speaker 1: because it was weird there was an audience and almost everyone in the audience Already knew about podcasts so they didn't really want to hear about how you know to listen to one like we usually do with these things and They weren't podcasters except one girl was and I think Scott has the relevant quote from her I think was great, but I I just want to say she was the only podcaster in the audience So everyone else.

390
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:23,289
Speaker 1: we asked them.

391
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,320
Speaker 1: So what did you come here for?

392
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,443
Speaker 1: What do you want us to say?

393
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:27,748
Speaker 1: and none of them knew.

394
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:34,240
Speaker 1: so we just kind of explained all the I don't know the things We thought that are interesting about podcasting and it went pretty well.

395
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,878
Speaker 0: It was okay, but I think our Otacon podcasting panel from last year was far superior.

396
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:44,700
Speaker 1: Yes Well, the larger crowd helped a lot in the bigger room and the fact that the people didn't know about podcasting.

397
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,718
Speaker 0: Yeah things to say.

398
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:52,710
Speaker 0: Yeah I think what we should start doing is maybe we need to start making a panel like Secrets of the podcasters or something like that.

399
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:55,240
Speaker 1: That'd be more like a workshop at a big like a trade.

400
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,188
Speaker 0: No, not secrets like that secrets.

401
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,795
Speaker 0: Like yeah, we say this.

402
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:05,099
Speaker 0: we mean that the same thing Same thing we do at the Anime Club Summit like we you know, we could do a whole demo on.

403
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:07,488
Speaker 1: like Alright, wait, tell try to tell.

404
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,174
Speaker 1: what is rim really laughing?

405
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:10,640
Speaker 1: and what is rim radio laughing?

406
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:18,299
Speaker 0: Started out fake became real.

407
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:22,600
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, that that could be pretty good.

408
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,240
Speaker 1: But there's a girl in the audience who is trying to get into podcasting.

409
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,260
Speaker 1: She just started and apparently she blogged about us after the fact.

410
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:35,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I found her blog by a referral link and I think she said that we were lovably harsh about the realities of podcasting.

411
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:36,425
Speaker 1: And we really were.

412
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:36,968
Speaker 1: we were pretty.

413
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:43,020
Speaker 1: we sat there and we basically said what we always say to you guys Which was most podcasts like most things suck.

414
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:45,440
Speaker 1: It is not easy to make a podcast.

415
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:55,278
Speaker 1: Contrary to what Apple and the internet want to say if you just plug a microphone in and talk It's gonna sound like Animal Crossing and other games or possibly anime pulse.

416
00:27:55,298 --> 00:28:01,955
Speaker 1: I I Had to get a dig in because people in our forums just won't let the anime pulse thing go.

417
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,986
Speaker 0: really they keep Bashing somebody else.

418
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:06,532
Speaker 1: I think we should cuz I don't know.

419
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,780
Speaker 0: it's because I've got a real hanker in to bash someone.

420
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:16,409
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know cuz I don't know who deserves bashing because anime pulse deserved it mostly in a jocular way And it was kind of friendly bashing.

421
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,800
Speaker 1: I don't know what would happen if we seriously bash someone.

422
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:20,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'll wait it out.

423
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:21,680
Speaker 0: after Otacon.

424
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:25,432
Speaker 0: You might hear me seriously bash another podcast like.

425
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:28,343
Speaker 0: I'll actually just come out and say they suck And I hate them.

426
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,392
Speaker 1: Do you have a podcast in mind?

427
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:30,994
Speaker 1: Of course?

428
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:32,260
Speaker 0: I have a podcast in mind.

429
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:35,340
Speaker 1: I think I know which one you think you definitely know which podcast talking about.

430
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,389
Speaker 1: yeah, I know I do know exactly which one you're talking about and I Have opinions about that.

431
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,615
Speaker 0: show you agree though.

432
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,360
Speaker 1: I do agree.

433
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:44,423
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

434
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,189
Speaker 1: nor with anime pulse like.

435
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:52,809
Speaker 1: it's all in good fun because our more our stance on podcasting is still You're creating content that already makes you better than most people.

436
00:28:52,849 --> 00:29:01,763
Speaker 1: you're kings among men, but at the same time at least anime pulse tries and the It should go.

437
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:02,907
Speaker 1: actually emailed me afterward.

438
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,014
Speaker 1: I gave him some hints and he's a cool guy.

439
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:06,920
Speaker 1: It's not but this other podcast.

440
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,406
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into it now.

441
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,278
Speaker 1: now all our friend podcasters are probably thinking crap.

442
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:12,680
Speaker 1: Is it us?

443
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:13,723
Speaker 1: I don't know.

444
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:14,886
Speaker 1: Who are they talking about?

445
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:16,371
Speaker 0: Well, you can all stay in suspense.

446
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:21,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously, it's not Dave and Joel's fast-cross Because they're like my favorite podcast.

447
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,986
Speaker 1: Yeah Because it's the best podcast.

448
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:31,743
Speaker 1: and it's not anime world order because while we fight with them pretty much all the time We are friends with them.

449
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though I think Clarissa actually does hate Scott.

450
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:35,496
Speaker 0: Oh, that's their problem.

451
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,652
Speaker 1: Well, that's her problem Yeah, or your problem.

452
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:38,320
Speaker 0: It's not.

453
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,547
Speaker 0: She might be armed a clown pistol.

454
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:46,718
Speaker 1: Oh My god, they're gonna be there.

455
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,786
Speaker 1: There might be clown pistol.

456
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:50,091
Speaker 0: No, Daryl's not gonna be there.

457
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,560
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but tell Gerald to bring us something.

458
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,527
Speaker 0: How's he gonna get him there?

459
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,353
Speaker 1: I could just picture.

460
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gonna be on an airplane.

461
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can just pick what we need to do someday.

462
00:29:58,161 --> 00:30:02,800
Speaker 1: I want to see Daryl Surratt and an anime con just open up like Il Duce.

463
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:06,320
Speaker 1: Was it one guy with six clown pistols?

464
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:08,343
Speaker 1: That's just stupid.

465
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:09,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Duke.

466
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:09,547
Speaker 0: All right.

467
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,915
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'll just skip.

468
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:12,838
Speaker 0: What else did we do?

469
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:13,420
Speaker 0: a kinetic on?

470
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:14,900
Speaker 1: Let's skip to our big thing.

471
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,153
Speaker 1: You see the story is we told kinetic on.

472
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:21,334
Speaker 1: we can run two game shows for you but one of them is gonna be a beta test.

473
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:31,495
Speaker 1: and Brianna who is pretty cool said all right, you can run your two and we said hey We need a celebrity guests and we got an email right before the con saying you've got celebrity guests.

474
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:32,217
Speaker 1: We're good to go.

475
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:36,032
Speaker 0: now We're sitting there right and we're.

476
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,200
Speaker 0: we get to kinetic con.

477
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:44,998
Speaker 0: We have our itinerary which tells us where to go at what times where our events are and all the guests have similar itineraries that tell them where to go at what times.

478
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:55,130
Speaker 0: and We're sitting there and it's time for our anime match game where we need our celebrity guests and we haven't been told who the celebrity Guests are or even if they're actually coming.

479
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,706
Speaker 1: so we go find a person in the staff where we can ask Who's a guest first.

480
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:01,924
Speaker 0: the guy who handles guests a guy we know now What actually happened.

481
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 1: was he misunderstood our question and thought we were asking about something else?

482
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what he basically said was no just go round up some webcomic guests to which we said ah shit.

483
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:15,056
Speaker 1: So we ran around the con and we got a knob from Apple geeks and we got IDO from fallen.

484
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,040
Speaker 0: we were gonna get anyway.

485
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:22,644
Speaker 1: Yeah and we try ask Luke from hammer girl and we asked Mookie and we pretty much went around trying to grab people and Rethink we're all set.

486
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,294
Speaker 1: We got our friends Corbin and Wyatt to be the peanut gallery.

487
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:26,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was gonna be all good.

488
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:29,417
Speaker 1: So we're sitting there and we're like, alright we can do this.

489
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:29,900
Speaker 1: Are we ready?

490
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,522
Speaker 1: Are we ready?

491
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:33,317
Speaker 1: And meanwhile while we're sitting in the room going are we ready?

492
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:33,820
Speaker 1: Are we ready?

493
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 1: I go outside and discover that there's a line wrapping all the way around the artist alley trying to get into our event.

494
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,762
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

495
00:31:41,144 --> 00:31:44,260
Speaker 1: so, uh, alright pressures on and then the door open.

496
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,869
Speaker 0: There's no pressure because the anime match game cannot fail.

497
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,417
Speaker 0: It is a guaranteed recipe for awesome.

498
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:54,620
Speaker 0: No matter what you do We could have had six random people from the audience up there and it still would have been awesome.

499
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:59,880
Speaker 1: So, uh the door opens and pretty much all the guests of honor from the con walk-in.

500
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:07,160
Speaker 1: So we had I'm just gonna go and order on the website We had Vic aka Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist the dub that dude.

501
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:18,454
Speaker 0: All I gotta say about this guy is that he makes the fangirls scream as do many voice actors But he does it on purpose Like he's just doing everything he possibly can to make them scream as much as he can.

502
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:22,105
Speaker 0: and while it's kind of cool I know Not cool.

503
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:25,600
Speaker 1: I find it great because you could just have a panel and I'd love to see this.

504
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,980
Speaker 0: We're never like three of those panels.

505
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:31,940
Speaker 1: You could have a panel where he just sat there and there was a spotlight and periodically he smiles.

506
00:32:34,723 --> 00:32:35,712
Speaker 1: He waits to lay down.

507
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:36,660
Speaker 1: He smiles.

508
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,749
Speaker 1: I Believe Emily coined the turn by tea kettling.

509
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,215
Speaker 0: Oh it is.

510
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,480
Speaker 0: I don't think she coined that.

511
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:44,846
Speaker 0: I think she got it from someone else.

512
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:45,729
Speaker 1: I thought she coined it.

513
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:46,111
Speaker 1: Did she?

514
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure cuz I've heard it elsewhere.

515
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:49,706
Speaker 1: I heard it from her first.

516
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:51,414
Speaker 0: I did hear it from her first.

517
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:52,840
Speaker 1: So we'll try to deny her credit?

518
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,242
Speaker 0: I'm not.

519
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:54,630
Speaker 0: but let's all right.

520
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,560
Speaker 0: Let's pretend that she coined it into proven.

521
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,140
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we had a Daniel Kevin Harrison who he voice acted in a bunch of stuff But most importantly he was in KO century beast which makes him automatically awesome.

522
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,943
Speaker 0: that is true

523
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:16,612
Speaker 1: and honestly we set it up where Vic was in the middle of the panel of the you know, The celebrity panel and on one end we had the one guy who I'll talk about last Because I got to talk about him

524
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:17,457
Speaker 0: and then on the

525
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:25,342
Speaker 1: other end We had Daniel Kevin Harrison and the two of them together were like the anchors of the panel and it was like crazy guy straight Man, and it was.

526
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,326
Speaker 1: it was just perfect.

527
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:26,667
Speaker 1: Yep.

528
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:28,091
Speaker 1: I got before.

529
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,421
Speaker 1: I couldn't have asked for a better panel of celebrity guests Mm-hmm.

530
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:35,855
Speaker 1: So then we had Caitlin glass who is a voice actress in a million things.

531
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:37,400
Speaker 1: She was Winry from Fullmetal Alchemist.

532
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,920
Speaker 1: The sardonic biting humor that came from her lips was a classic.

533
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:44,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was quite.

534
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:53,190
Speaker 1: it was funny where sometimes she'd make a like a kind of biting answer and for a second I think is she serious or is this just a joke?

535
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:54,013
Speaker 1: You know what?

536
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,176
Speaker 1: I don't care cuz everyone's laughing.

537
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:56,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was great.

538
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:57,224
Speaker 0: Yeah, she'd be.

539
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:00,700
Speaker 0: sometimes she'd be like something actually silly or something actually serious.

540
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:05,420
Speaker 0: Sometimes she just be like now retards and I'd be like, oh she really doesn't like the not her tires.

541
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,552
Speaker 0: I don't know what I don't either me either but she was just like now retards.

542
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,819
Speaker 1: or we had a non from Apple geeks.

543
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,494
Speaker 1: You know who's been on this before.

544
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:21,168
Speaker 1: we like him We had I do from fallen who's a very good friend of ours and she's I think she's actually like from being on our match game She's become a pro.

545
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, she like.

546
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:22,800
Speaker 1: it's funny.

547
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:27,313
Speaker 1: We'll read the question and she knows exactly what answer is the funny answer.

548
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,540
Speaker 1: We were expecting someone to give and she just writes it down.

549
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:42,199
Speaker 1: Yep, and last and certainly not least in fact I want to say most because this man without any coaching was probably the best Celebrity panelist I have ever had running the match game.

550
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,592
Speaker 1: It was none other than Stevie B Steve the man Bennett.

551
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,344
Speaker 0: for those of you don't know about Stevie B I have her.

552
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:52,806
Speaker 0: the first time I ran into him was at my very first con Ohio con to

553
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:53,791
Speaker 1: worse current

554
00:34:53,831 --> 00:35:04,333
Speaker 0: worst con effort, but he was there and The general impression I had of him at that point was that he was a sleazy dude Kind of scary, you know, definitely hip with the fans.

555
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:06,880
Speaker 0: Definitely had the skills of an animator.

556
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,260
Speaker 0: I mean the animated stuff in Japan is no lie.

557
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,591
Speaker 1: The thing is all of this came to us second hand from semi random people Yep, and I think some of it still might be true.

558
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:17,280
Speaker 0: You know, he likes him the cat girls.

559
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:24,319
Speaker 0: He does seem like the kind of guy who's probably has done or does do some sort of sleazy kind of stuff.

560
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,328
Speaker 1: I don't know what you mean by sleazy.

561
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:31,673
Speaker 1: Well, you know by that token we could also accuse Certain other podcasters of the same.

562
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:32,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they're guilty, too.

563
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:38,200
Speaker 0: But you know, I've heard things about him like he has a wife, but he's getting on with cat girls.

564
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:39,660
Speaker 1: I don't know how true that is though.

565
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever the point is regardless of any rumors or facts about him that may or may not be true.

566
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:50,074
Speaker 0: Steve Bennett is a thousand percent awesome at playing the match game.

567
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:50,817
Speaker 1: I mean one.

568
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:55,171
Speaker 1: he's got the credentials I mean the dude animated in Japan on anime like that.

569
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,860
Speaker 1: That's pretty hardcore if you talk about being an anime fan.

570
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,227
Speaker 0: He's also old-school.

571
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:03,404
Speaker 0: He knows about shows, you know, it's it's People on the match game.

572
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:08,680
Speaker 0: often their biggest problem is they just don't have the breadth of anime knowledge to come up with an answer.

573
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:13,680
Speaker 0: You know, that's why I think a lot of our answers were always FMA Naruto something bleach something.

574
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,564
Speaker 0: so, you know, but

575
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:21,308
Speaker 1: he was the one who would come up with the old-school hilarious answer and He basically like usually yeah,

576
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:27,545
Speaker 0: we were like who's the sexiest man in anime and he's like crayon ginger And we're like all men's

577
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:34,811
Speaker 1: and he did all the stuff that normally we have to coach guests to do and also normally we have Plans for if the guests like don't have a lot to say to kind of

578
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:35,614
Speaker 0: speak

579
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,201
Speaker 1: over him and cover it up and make it Funny.

580
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:39,972
Speaker 1: this man required nothing from us.

581
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,820
Speaker 1: This man could have run the match game on his own.

582
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:50,160
Speaker 1: He could have been the only guest panelist filling in all the fans Steve Bennett to be on every anime match game I ever run for the rest of either of our lives.

583
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,146
Speaker 1: I shake that man's hand with pride.

584
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:52,527
Speaker 1: Yep.

585
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:55,296
Speaker 0: Anything else you have to say about him, whatever.

586
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:56,540
Speaker 0: He's awesome at match game.

587
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:57,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, draw your own conclusions.

588
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:05,226
Speaker 1: Just meet the guy because no matter what you may or may not think about if the dude has some motherfucking charisma He sure does and the humors.

589
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:08,234
Speaker 1: So the match game was crazily awesome.

590
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:15,053
Speaker 1: We're gonna be running it with and I just got confirmation I don't know who yet but similar celebrity panelists at the New York Anime Festival in December.

591
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:15,694
Speaker 0: Nice.

592
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:17,680
Speaker 0: Very nice challenge around fire.

593
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,680
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about it.

594
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:27,899
Speaker 1: All I want to say is we learn something from the beta test and what we learn is that the vast majority of anime fans Who go to conventions at least as far as we could tell?

595
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,026
Speaker 1: Don't actually watch anime like.

596
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:36,300
Speaker 1: not only could they not really name a single a character at all outside of like Pikachu and Ichigo.

597
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:41,915
Speaker 1: But they couldn't name anime that were made outside of the span of like 2001 to 2002 and a half.

598
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,161
Speaker 0: Yeah Like.

599
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:49,198
Speaker 0: they could recognize a Sailor Moon and a Dragon Ball and a Naruto and a bleach and possibly a trans.

600
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:59,732
Speaker 0: none of them had ever Seen eska flown a or lane or try gun any show that was slightly outside of the mainstream Cartoon Network to Nami kind of lineup.

601
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:01,539
Speaker 0: They just didn't know about at all.

602
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:05,020
Speaker 0: Most of the people sure there were some people actually had the anime knowledge.

603
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,722
Speaker 0: They they knew.

604
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:10,637
Speaker 0: you know what the shows were but the vast majority had no freaking clue.

605
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:13,165
Speaker 0: They were like You know Evangelion.

606
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,374
Speaker 0: they knew eska flown a what and it's like try gun.

607
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:17,558
Speaker 0: They knew vash.

608
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:18,260
Speaker 0: That's about it.

609
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,324
Speaker 0: They could name anyone else.

610
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,280
Speaker 0: They could even name Masato a secondary character from Evangelion.

611
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,209
Speaker 1: I have them couldn't actually name Shinji.

612
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:27,299
Speaker 1: I just knew he was from Evangelion.

613
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:31,220
Speaker 1: Anyway, we've decided to revamp it and I'll have some details later.

614
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:42,267
Speaker 1: But suffice to say I think challenger on fire in the future is going to be us challenging people like Daryl Surratt to prove how hardcore they are and Get it instead of you know, cuz.

615
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,380
Speaker 0: the problem is is that with this single elimination kind of game?

616
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:47,940
Speaker 0: You might just eliminate everyone in one fell swoop.

617
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:55,400
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna add some Japanese game show style punishments to the people who drop out to make it a little more entertaining.

618
00:38:56,344 --> 00:38:57,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, we did a bunch of other panels.

619
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,736
Speaker 1: We hung out with the Apple geeks crew and they're pretty awesome and we all go with our friends.

620
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,846
Speaker 1: and the only other thing Is that on Sunday morning?

621
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:07,852
Speaker 1: We did a German board gaming panel.

622
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:14,020
Speaker 0: Oh, right and this is our last panel, by the way We did six panels Saturday and one panel Sunday.

623
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:21,345
Speaker 1: There was this fat nerdy scary guy who actually was there for this elf panel like a panel on fairies and elves but he missed it.

624
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:22,451
Speaker 0: that was the panel before us.

625
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:27,974
Speaker 1: so he decided to stick around and He was a heckler is the first heckler I've ever run into it.

626
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:29,540
Speaker 0: there are four people in the panel.

627
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was 9 a.m.

628
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:30,925
Speaker 1: On a Sunday.

629
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:32,290
Speaker 1: We didn't expect anyone to be there.

630
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,220
Speaker 0: So especially a panel about German board gaming.

631
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:43,100
Speaker 1: So, uh immediately this guy takes offense to the term German board gaming But that is disrespectful to all of the other games that come out of Europe.

632
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:49,640
Speaker 1: So we say fine euro gaming but that is disrespectful to all of the wonderful tactical and strategic games that come out of America.

633
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:52,380
Speaker 1: Are you saying that there are no strategic American games?

634
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:53,804
Speaker 1: And I try to say like.

635
00:39:54,124 --> 00:40:05,420
Speaker 1: well from popular perception most American games are things like Monopoly and you know Candyland and life and there's the rare gems like connect for but even that's not that great and chess.

636
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,345
Speaker 1: But most people think of games like Monopoly and then he's like well No it's it's disrespectful to call them German or European.

637
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:22,472
Speaker 1: and then he names like ten games and I play a lot of games like I'm I'm more into German board gaming and like Board games and war games and D&D and all that them and they're like anything.

638
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:24,922
Speaker 1: and I'd never heard of a single one of the games.

639
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:34,379
Speaker 1: he said and I was like God I hate to break it to you But those games don't sell compared to the games that actually come from Germany and it was just downhill from there.

640
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:40,899
Speaker 0: The guy basically made a bunch of some valid some invalid arguments about I don't know what.

641
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:47,179
Speaker 0: I don't know What he was trying to say But he basically all you were trying to do is tell people about our cool hobby of playing German games.

642
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:51,380
Speaker 1: Here's what our panel actually was going to be if this guy had not been there.

643
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:55,914
Speaker 1: If you've never tried these games before you should check out settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.

644
00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:57,780
Speaker 1: Hey, here's a copy of Carcassonne.

645
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,188
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it away to you guys.

646
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,467
Speaker 1: If you want to come hang out and play board games with us We're gonna go right over there.

647
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:04,559
Speaker 1: These games are really cool and you should try them.

648
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:18,597
Speaker 1: but uh No we had Captain McFarty pants and the thing is there's this girl with him and the whole time like he argued over every Statement either of us made and meanwhile the girl is sitting there kind of glaring at him like come on.

649
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,664
Speaker 1: Let's just go Let's just go.

650
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:25,020
Speaker 1: I have better things to do than watch you argue with two guys at an anime con over nothing.

651
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, he eventually wonder how guys like that get a girl and in the first place, maybe she was a sister or something.

652
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:32,967
Speaker 0: Maybe I have no idea.

653
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:35,360
Speaker 1: and other than that kinetic on was pretty awesome.

654
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:40,220
Speaker 1: The con feedback session made me realize something that I guess I've known.

655
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,884
Speaker 1: It's a truth that I've known for a long time But I finally noticed it.

656
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,499
Speaker 1: go to a con feedback session and I want to see if you notice the same thing.

657
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:54,040
Speaker 1: The vast majority of the complaints may like 90% are always from cosplayers about the cosplay in the masquerade.

658
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,467
Speaker 1: That is true and no one complains about any.

659
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:04,799
Speaker 0: I have never been to a con feedback session where less than 50% Of the complaints were about were something other.

660
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,940
Speaker 0: You get my point.

661
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:12,420
Speaker 0: I'm not saying the cost players complaining about the cosplay accounts for more than half the complaints at every con feedback.

662
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,828
Speaker 1: I'm not saying their complaints may or may not be legitimate.

663
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:26,620
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that they are the squeakiest wheel and either cosplays have problems or Cosplayers have problems or both, but something I don't know what to do about it.

664
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:36,220
Speaker 1: I just want to point that out because it's always like someone complains about The bag check at the video game room Which is always coming up and then they complain about the video game tournaments being disorganized.

665
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,128
Speaker 0: but now they're playing.

666
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:50,033
Speaker 0: but these people are complaining like The stage didn't have enough room on it or there were wires on the stage or they didn't have time to like Examine the stage or that we didn't get the dimensions of the stage beforehand.

667
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:52,740
Speaker 0: or and I'm like what the hell you complaining about.

668
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:54,409
Speaker 0: I don't see the problem.

669
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,513
Speaker 1: Well, see I couldn't tell if they were legitimate or not Every single con is the same thing.

670
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:01,303
Speaker 1: So something's up Kinetic on.

671
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:12,529
Speaker 1: I mean we made a bunch of constructive criticisms last year and I just want to say that Kinetic on followed up on pretty much every single concern we brought up in last year's con report to the best of their ability And I gotta hand it to him.

672
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,139
Speaker 1: They ran a pretty damn good con this year.

673
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:23,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, they definitely the things we said they took into account and they improved and I could tell at the con feedback session They were listening closely and they actually cared about what people had to say.

674
00:43:23,993 --> 00:43:25,358
Speaker 1: They did everything we asked.

675
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,512
Speaker 1: so Kinetic on props to you.

676
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:36,971
Speaker 1: I had a really good time Yeah and I think next year they're gonna do more awesome things and improve things that I can better way guarantee we're gonna be a Kinetic on pretty much for as long as Kinetic on goes.

677
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:44,179
Speaker 0: now, even if Kinetic on fails Massively in every respect that board gaming room is still gonna be there and I'll go just for that.

678
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:45,866
Speaker 0: So I know comes to worst.

679
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:47,271
Speaker 0: I'll sit there all weekend playing games.

680
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:49,400
Speaker 1: It's late and we're going to Otacon tomorrow.

681
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:50,428
Speaker 1: So I think that's the end.

682
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,335
Speaker 0: it is the end.
