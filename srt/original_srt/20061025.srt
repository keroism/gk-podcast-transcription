1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,357
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday October 25th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,500
Speaker 0: tonight We tell you everything you'll need to know about the new upcoming anime pumpkin scissors.

3
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:22,560
Speaker 0: We're also still lacking our new compressor so expect slightly degraded audio quality.

4
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:36,247
Speaker 1: Let's do this All right, so since there isn't any anime manga comics news that I could find I'm gonna resort to the super awesome Anime news network.com poll.

5
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:36,889
Speaker 0: great.

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right the current poll is.

7
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:46,899
Speaker 1: of The titles covered in our fall 2006 preview guide which one are you looking forward to the most?

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:57,972
Speaker 1: It is no surprise that the number one most look forward to anime is death note with 568 votes as of right this second that I am recording this.

9
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,819
Speaker 0: that was pretty much guaranteed to be the case.

10
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,186
Speaker 1: that's 46 and a half percent But you know who cares?

11
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:07,737
Speaker 1: that's obvious that it was gonna be even though it is.

12
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:08,920
Speaker 1: look at the graph rim.

13
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:09,703
Speaker 1: Look at this.

14
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:15,827
Speaker 1: the next anime after death note is nine point two percent Compared to forty six and a half.

15
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:23,620
Speaker 1: so if I was an anime company bringing anime over to the US Death note is obviously gonna be a profitable license to acquire.

16
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,333
Speaker 1: Nothing else looks like it's worthwhile.

17
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:33,520
Speaker 0: now everyone might think well Why doesn't some company just license it right away and go with it and start releasing it in the u.s.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,752
Speaker 0: And the answer is that most likely the Japanese company involved.

19
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:54,177
Speaker 0: if they allow anyone to license it anytime soon Well one charge some crazy amount of money with many millions and two They're most likely going to have a clause in the license saying that they can't actually Release the DVDs in America for like a year or two after the show is shown in Japan.

20
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,456
Speaker 1: Yep You know cuz you know re-importation all that jazz.

21
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:07,751
Speaker 1: however I think what's more interesting to note than the extreme popularity of death note compared to all the other anime that are coming out in Japan right now is the rest of this list.

22
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:13,174
Speaker 1: compared to the rest of this list the second most anime which I just mentioned is nine point.

23
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:18,169
Speaker 1: two percent of the votes is Canon 2006.

24
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,139
Speaker 0: wait wait wait wait wait.

25
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,085
Speaker 0: Canon.

26
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:27,638
Speaker 0: as in that series of porn games The same the same the same.

27
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:28,538
Speaker 0: God.

28
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,524
Speaker 0: Canon is not good.

29
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:31,085
Speaker 0: I don't can.

30
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:32,008
Speaker 0: is the party one, right?

31
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,151
Speaker 1: Yep.

32
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,518
Speaker 1: It's the one that mega Tokyo guy likes.

33
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:36,642
Speaker 0: Oh, okay Okay.

34
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the most popular anime coming on Japan right now among Americans?

35
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:48,004
Speaker 1: Well among Americans who go among Americans who were big anime fans who read anime news network Death Note.

36
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,020
Speaker 1: and the second most popular is a perverted game.

37
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:56,676
Speaker 0: So one turned into an anime a small self-selected statistically insignificant sample.

38
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,885
Speaker 1: It's still scary Whatever.

39
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:04,639
Speaker 0: I mean kagehime probably did really well Yeah, probably probably made back its money.

40
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:12,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there I mean there are people still watching bleach and there of course bleach at least and Dragon Ball and all that I understand of course.

41
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,039
Speaker 0: then again, I guess I understand all these horrible porny shows, too.

42
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:25,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, well next on the list is negima Which is one of those one of those shows that you look at it and you say that's gonna be popular with the anime fans Even though it's terrible.

43
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:28,417
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean like pumpkin scissors that we're gonna talk about.

44
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,307
Speaker 1: Yeah bit Well, actually that's it's quite surprising.

45
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:35,840
Speaker 1: pumpkin scissors is one, two, three, four, five six seventh on the list.

46
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:37,627
Speaker 1: It falls under.

47
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:38,089
Speaker 1: let's see.

48
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,836
Speaker 1: after negima is Chevalier.

49
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:53,448
Speaker 0: Hooray Even though I must say Chevalier started out Fantastic as in this show has got everything I want out of any show and he continued as good Yeah, as opposed to continuing is fantastic.

50
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the way you said.

51
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:57,180
Speaker 0: I thought you said you continued just as good.

52
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,383
Speaker 1: No, no, no as good.

53
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,025
Speaker 1: it continued.

54
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:03,738
Speaker 0: good a little bit of Gonzo there a little bit after Chevalier is that?

55
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:12,623
Speaker 1: Clamp robot show whatever something else and then pumpkin scissors and then something else and then Oh D gray man Which I thought would be really popular But I guess not.

56
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:17,322
Speaker 1: and then bartender the show that I want to do well and then crap I don't know.

57
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:20,291
Speaker 1: and then black blood blood brothers are just crap God.

58
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:21,958
Speaker 1: and then crap crap crap crap crap.

59
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:31,556
Speaker 1: So at least the crap is at all at the bottom of the list generally, but Bartender needs more votes that that's and it needs less votes.

60
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:36,074
Speaker 0: a self-selected Crap sample because most people who download fan subs don't go to that website.

61
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 0: They just download everything.

62
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:38,723
Speaker 1: I don't know.

63
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:44,560
Speaker 1: I would tend to think there is a strong match between fans of downloading people and anime news network visitors.

64
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:45,419
Speaker 0: I don't know.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,580
Speaker 0: The only way to really know the popularity would be to watch the seeds and see what's getting downloaded when?

66
00:04:51,180 --> 00:05:03,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a tough call because a lot of people will download every single episode of something, you know Even if they don't even if it's not their favorite show or if it's not the one show they're looking forward to the most.

67
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:08,040
Speaker 0: That's also a really weird, I mean a lot of people probably didn't know what all the shows were.

68
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:11,554
Speaker 0: I was really looking forward to pumpkin scissors until I saw it.

69
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:12,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is according.

70
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:16,631
Speaker 1: This is of the titles in the fall 2006 preview guide.

71
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,560
Speaker 0: So but also when is when I mean this polls going on right now?

72
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,812
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I voted today looking forward whatever.

73
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:27,149
Speaker 0: most people have already seen the show They voted for and they obviously watch Death Note first.

74
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the actually most anticipated one.

75
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:34,315
Speaker 1: The other thing is this is you're talking about which show are you looking forward to the most?

76
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,646
Speaker 1: a lot of anime fans probably watch A bunch of these shows.

77
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just had to pick the best one of them.

78
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:45,294
Speaker 0: There's also the fact pumpkin scissors, which I think is gonna end up doing pretty well Even though I think it's gonna be a really bad show.

79
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:47,545
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll talk about that.

80
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:51,520
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but it really kind of came out of nowhere and no one was looking forward to it.

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,331
Speaker 0: It's just gonna come out and everyone's gonna go.

82
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,458
Speaker 1: Ah I really wonder.

83
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,080
Speaker 1: Here anime just sort of jumps out of nowhere.

84
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,992
Speaker 1: It's like here's the new anime is what it's called in Japan.

85
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,099
Speaker 1: Is there some sort of build-up to these shows?

86
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,705
Speaker 0: Well Funny you should.

87
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,592
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember way back in high school.

88
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:17,440
Speaker 0: I found a video of Some clips from eska flown a a while before it, you know was released in the u.s.

89
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,760
Speaker 0: This is back before you could really get fan subs easily.

90
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:25,057
Speaker 0: So there was at least for in America for this show and it looked like in Japan too.

91
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,542
Speaker 0: because I ran into a lot of Fansites.

92
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:30,880
Speaker 0: I couldn't read long before the show seemed to even come out in there talking about this show.

93
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,402
Speaker 0: That's coming.

94
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:35,273
Speaker 0: the show called eska flown a a collaboration between names.

95
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,179
Speaker 0: I didn't recognize with art by name.

96
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:40,099
Speaker 0: I don't recognize because I didn't know anything about anime back then.

97
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,940
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I at least and my friend group of friends were excited about it for almost a year before it came out in the u.s.

98
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the problem is that they do that in the u.s.

99
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,940
Speaker 1: All the anime companies make trailers for all their shows, but those trailers come out way after the fan subs come out.

100
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,240
Speaker 1: So they're kind of useless.

101
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:05,556
Speaker 0: Well, remember when we went to anime next right and they were showing, you know, we've got the Japanese guest.

102
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:11,174
Speaker 0: Here's what's on TV Right now in Japan and I have the audience was like we've seen all this.

103
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:12,860
Speaker 0: I'm watching that show right now.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,649
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you exactly?

105
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:15,413
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

106
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:24,360
Speaker 0: Oh, well Yeah, we will have to do a whole episode on the state of the industry and fan subs and bootlegging and downloads and all.

107
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:31,419
Speaker 1: Yeah It's sort of one of those mandatory things that every anime podcast has to talk about and every anime website has to have an article on.

108
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:34,595
Speaker 1: and You know, you can't everyone's got to say their piece.

109
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:35,539
Speaker 1: No one can just let it be.

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:45,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though I'll say that in terms of this specific specific issue Most of our opinions pretty much mirror the opinions of anime world orders.

111
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:50,611
Speaker 0: You can check them out Mostly anyway, at least in terms of the causes of the problem.

112
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,115
Speaker 0: Yes, not in terms of the solution.

113
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:53,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's what's your news?

114
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:04,560
Speaker 0: so So Guitar Hero 2 is coming out is out.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,091
Speaker 1: You know, I'm really interested in Guitar Hero, but I don't have the console that plays it So I haven't played it yet ever.

116
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:17,024
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna pick up a ps2 Awesome when it gets less than a hundred bucks Awesome.

117
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,755
Speaker 0: I might pay up to $100 for a PlayStation 2.

118
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:20,639
Speaker 0: That's what it's worth to me.

119
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:32,735
Speaker 0: There are about seven games I want to play on the ps2 and a hundred dollars divided by seven because I can borrow all these games from people Plus the money to buy Guitar Heroes guitar and another guitar.

120
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,179
Speaker 0: Well, I'm buying one guitar.

121
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,589
Speaker 1: I'll buy one of those third-party guitars.

122
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:38,152
Speaker 0: That's fine.

123
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,135
Speaker 1: I don't know what I'll do.

124
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:40,000
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll get the real good.

125
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,840
Speaker 0: I mean you may I buy a controller for your GameCube.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,975
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy a wiimote for your Wii so you can buy a Guitar Hero for my guitar.

127
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:49,199
Speaker 1: You'll see we'll see.

128
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:52,072
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Guitar Heroes 2 is good, you know.

129
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:53,740
Speaker 0: now that's not the news.

130
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,021
Speaker 0: No one needs to know anything about Guitar Hero 2.

131
00:08:57,021 --> 00:09:04,200
Speaker 0: The news is that one of the bonus songs is none other than trogdor the burninator.

132
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:15,640
Speaker 0: I'm really liking this trend of Awesome things from the internet being recognized by smart people in companies and being integrated into popular culture.

133
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,696
Speaker 0: You know really I mean it already sucks to be a peasant.

134
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:24,660
Speaker 0: and then you got trogdor.

135
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,368
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway, it's in the game as a bonus.

136
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:32,993
Speaker 0: I guess that's a spoiler.

137
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:39,289
Speaker 0: unlock it probably I don't know with magic Magicals see I like back in the day like DDR.

138
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,775
Speaker 0: You know how you unlock things.

139
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:41,980
Speaker 0: play DDR more.

140
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all it was songs.

141
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:46,040
Speaker 1: Just I'm pretty sure that's how Guitar Hero also works.

142
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,400
Speaker 1: It's just you have to play it a lot and then songs unlock.

143
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:54,260
Speaker 0: Granted I haven't actually watched homestar runner in over a year - yeah me either.

144
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:59,761
Speaker 1: Like I saw I would watch ever religiously go to the strong bad email every single Yeah,

145
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:03,938
Speaker 0: pretty much from the sixth or seventh strong bad email until about I don't know the 80th

146
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then just interest waned and I just stopped visiting and I I know it's still there.

147
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,268
Speaker 1: I still think it's cool I'm still a fan of his a homestar runner.

148
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:15,994
Speaker 1: I'll still say holy crap.

149
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:18,986
Speaker 1: and and you know Crazy good night coach.

150
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,974
Speaker 0: He's got money but not much.

151
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,360
Speaker 0: see that's where it is.

152
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:26,780
Speaker 0: The moment the homestar runner peaked for me is when the CD came out.

153
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:32,579
Speaker 0: That was like the absolute peak of my fandom of homestar runner and then it fell into sharp decline.

154
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:40,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the homestar runner didn't do anything worse or better It just did more of what it was doing and I got tired of the same thing.

155
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,727
Speaker 1: We sort of like we just watched acid ninja.

156
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:54,539
Speaker 1: someone sent us a link and I realized when I first discovered ask a ninja I was super into it and I was laughing hysterically and every time a new one came out for a few weeks I was laughing hysterically and watching them as soon as they came out.

157
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,654
Speaker 1: But now I didn't really care cuz I've seen that joke before.

158
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,480
Speaker 1: it's just the same joke told differently.

159
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:05,560
Speaker 0: Well, actually the ask a ninja humor is pretty much the same as the strong bad email humor.

160
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:09,160
Speaker 0: It's a guy saying something like this and it's all funny.

161
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,816
Speaker 0: You know cuz blood and something relevant to the thing going on.

162
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,207
Speaker 1: and ah, yeah It's pretty much the same humor.

163
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,000
Speaker 1: and I don't know I. there was a new ask a ninja.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,868
Speaker 1: We just watched it and I didn't laugh so much.

165
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:20,370
Speaker 0: Actually.

166
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,560
Speaker 0: There was one point where I really started laughing.

167
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,847
Speaker 1: I gotta admit but it's not bad.

168
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:28,920
Speaker 1: It's just you know, it becomes harder for them to make me laugh.

169
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,070
Speaker 1: they have to do more.

170
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:35,480
Speaker 1: they have to Change it up a little bit more, you know instead of throwing the same fastball.

171
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:44,103
Speaker 0: So if you happen to be a person who likes guitar hero And if you're not well, you're not a person because everyone likes guitar hero, even though we never played it We know it's good.

172
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:44,827
Speaker 1: That's how good it is.

173
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:45,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

174
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,731
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:47,500
Speaker 0: I've only watched other people play it.

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,848
Speaker 0: I played it once when I was a little drunk at a convention.

177
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,496
Speaker 0: No, and it's really fun.

178
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,299
Speaker 0: What can I say?

179
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,638
Speaker 0: From what I remember?

180
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,746
Speaker 0: Things of the day which someday I'll be able to say loudly again Possibly tomorrow or the next day.

181
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:08,248
Speaker 1: I don't know.

182
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,590
Speaker 1: Yeah.

183
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,855
Speaker 0: I mean we order that new compressor.

184
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,160
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty badass.

185
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,027
Speaker 0: I think it's a double compressor.

186
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:13,388
Speaker 1: Yes.

187
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,496
Speaker 1: We're all out of the single compressors.

188
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,480
Speaker 1: We are to the double power.

189
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:20,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they had a four power, but it wasn't as good as the double power anyway.

190
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:23,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, so thing of the day it you know Halloween is coming up.

191

Speaker 0: Oh, no Yeah, some things people might like but I might not like.

200
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:55,676
Speaker 0: I had a thing of the day I was saving for Halloween but since Halloween we might do something else.

00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,299
Speaker 0: We're not sure.

202
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,853
Speaker 0: I'll use it today because Halloween is coming up and it really fits the season.

Speaker 0: This is a video of Every single death in the entire Friday the 13th series from start to finish in Chronological order showing nothing but the death scene itself quickly.

204
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,765

Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean what I saw these movies and I was real little barely remember them never saw them again cuz whatever Yeah, that was that the final scene in Friday the 13th when I was a little kid scared the ever-living piss out of me Mm-hmm.

00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,396
Speaker 0: Of course, you know movie actually scared me a lot when I was a kid was Halloween.

213
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,164
Speaker 1: this movie I was always scared.

214
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,793
Speaker 1: It was the one with the boogeyman the one where they go boogity boogity.

215
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:53,215
Speaker 0: Oh, mr.

Speaker 0: Boogity.

217
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, mr Boogity scared me too, but it was awesome.

218
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:57,755
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

219
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:58,940
Speaker 1: There's like that Cape right?

220
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they beat him in the end with the dry vac.

221
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,014
Speaker 1: Yeah.

223
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, there was mr.

224
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:04,500
Speaker 0: Boogity, too.

225
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,505
Speaker 0: There was.

226
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,095
Speaker 1: yeah, we got to get that shit.

227
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:13,544
Speaker 1: I've seen it mr Boogity - is really all I remember was this scene where there's a guy floating down the hallway With like he's.

228
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:19,009
Speaker 1: he just floated out of bed and it was horizontally floating down the hallway and he's like boogity boogity Boogity boogity.

229
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,279
Speaker 1: just kidding.

230
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,430
Speaker 0: See the thing about those movies.

231
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:30,160
Speaker 0: and it's pretty much the same thing that Project a co did for me when I was a kid and all sorts of other movies that I saw when I was a kid.

232
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,823
Speaker 0: I didn't get it.

233
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:31,707
Speaker 0: Mr.

234
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,752
Speaker 0: Boogity is a comedy.

235
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:37,299
Speaker 0: It is not a scary movie But to a little kid you take that movie at face value.

236
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:39,227
Speaker 1: You sure do that movie.

237
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,110
Speaker 0: I thought it was horror.

238
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,459
Speaker 0: I was afraid I was worried about what was gonna happen.

239
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:46,537
Speaker 0: Mr Boogity was this demon thing and the second one was creepy and serious.

240
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:53,040
Speaker 0: and you know I just I took it straight up and now I'm older and I just realized that it's not a serious movie at all.

241
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:55,629
Speaker 0: And project a co was not a serious anime.

242
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:56,592
Speaker 0: There was no plot there.

243
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,680
Speaker 1: No project a co was just a comedy.

244
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,941
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, I'm beginning to see a lot of different ways that kids experience things differently from adults like.

245
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:10,221
Speaker 1: I just found out that as you get older you lose taste buds and that's why kids like some foods and adults don't like them.

246
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:17,725
Speaker 1: and it's kind of funny because you always see like my grandpa will eat some like incredibly hot pepper and He'll be like, yeah kid.

247
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,569
Speaker 1: Why don't you eat this?

248
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,215
Speaker 1: It is like and the kids like no way.

249
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:21,340
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you're a wuss.

250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,893
Speaker 1: It's like no he has a bajillion more taste buds than you when I have.

251
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:27,786
Speaker 1: when he's as old as you he can probably eat Pepper just fine.

252
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:28,289
Speaker 0: Yep.

253
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:30,440
Speaker 0: Yeah physical changes cultural changes.

254
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,003
Speaker 0: But the point is these movies were a lot scarier when I was a kid and we got off on a tangent about you know Other movies.

255
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:41,520
Speaker 1: Well, there's not much to say about the thing of the day itself other than it's really fucking gory and awesome.

256
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:44,840
Speaker 0: Well, I'll say one thing one about most of the deaths.

257
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,750
Speaker 0: I'd say three-quarters of them are kind of real like.

258
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:58,812
Speaker 0: not really realistic in what happens in them But realistic in the way that like the people just kind of die in a kind of realistic sad way Cuz you don't have all the horror movie build-up around it.

259
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,900
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of people getting stabbed and screaming.

260
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:05,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess I also realized that a lot of people die in the Friday the third.

261
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,611
Speaker 1: Oh god, there's a lot of freaking kills man.

262
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 1: A lot of kills shots.

263
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:15,134
Speaker 1: You'll see more kills in this video than you will in a game of quake.

264
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,839
Speaker 1: Yeah Mortal Kombat or anything?

265
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:30,399
Speaker 1: All right, my thing of the day is a short short video from Japan And it looks like they're advertising a new product which is only known as the boob Keeney.

266
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,886
Speaker 0: now The funny thing is Scott was sat down in my room with his laptop and we're getting ready to do You know pre-production.

267
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,519
Speaker 0: go over what we're gonna talk about on the show.

268
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,362
Speaker 0: Look at the news.

269
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,817
Speaker 0: do the thing that if you listen to the penny arcade podcast, that's what we do.

270
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:43,579
Speaker 0: We just don't record it.

271
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:52,489
Speaker 0: Yep, and while we're sitting here Scott says oh my god, I got a thing of the day and before you can say anything I say it's that boob Keeney, isn't it?

272
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,817
Speaker 1: And then sure enough it was And is anyway the boob Keeney.

273
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,704
Speaker 1: first of all This video is real hot.

274
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:08,210
Speaker 1: if you have a penis and you are not fond of other penises or maybe you're you know Bye and you swing both ways, but you will enjoy this video.

275
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,819
Speaker 1: It's short, but it is quite enjoyable.

276
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, it shows this girl swimming in a pool and she has a normal bikini bottom on but for a top.

277
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:24,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like she's wearing anything because the video resolution is kind of low.

278
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:29,596
Speaker 1: But when she gets out of the pool, you realize it's no normal bikini top.

279
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:30,860
Speaker 1: It is a boob Keeney.

280
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:41,286
Speaker 1: It looks like these two plastic suction cups that just kind of stick to the boobs and don't really Restrict them or hold them in any way.

281
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:47,818
Speaker 1: They just kind of stick on to them to cover them up and they're flesh colored Outstanding.

282
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, this girl seemed to be swimming around feeling pretty good.

283
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:53,840
Speaker 0: See, I don't know.

284
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,865
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that laws against public nudity aside from laws that Specifically are for health reasons.

285
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,252
Speaker 0: Like you shouldn't be allowed to be naked in a restaurant.

286
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:10,774
Speaker 0: Yeah or walking in the mall But if you're at the beach You should be able to be naked if you want to be naked in the very least.

287
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,220
Speaker 1: why they have nude beaches?

288
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:18,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there aren't any nude beaches in South Jersey, yeah, I see I'll be happy with nude beaches.

289
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:22,314
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you have a private beach you can make it a nude beach, right?

290
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,058
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:23,259
Speaker 1: Yeah.

292
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:23,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

293
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,544
Speaker 1: So this that's okay.

294
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:32,596
Speaker 1: First of all, second of all public nude beach, you know The only problem I see with that is I don't want to have to look at some nasty fat guy.

295
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:33,580
Speaker 0: See whatever?

296
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

297
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,173
Speaker 1: but cuz you should have a nude beach.

298
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:40,910
Speaker 1: They have to have a non nude beach, you know Doesn't have to be.

299
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:41,919
Speaker 0: you can do whatever you want.

300
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,310
Speaker 0: There shouldn't be a law just because someone you don't want to see.

301
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,337
Speaker 0: you know, the thing is you see the fat guy Anyway, he's not wearing much to begin with.

302
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:52,699
Speaker 0: That little bit isn't gonna make a difference.

303
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:58,575
Speaker 0: And second, I mean imagine this this really puts it as I mean.

304
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,740
Speaker 0: as guys we don't think about it.

305
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
Speaker 0: We just go to the beach where in basically nothing but some little shorts and ah.

306
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:10,900
Speaker 0: But because of the puritanical laws in America all the women whether they want to or not have to wear something on top.

307
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure Imagine if you had to wear something on top every time you went.

308
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:21,219
Speaker 1: was the other predicament of the nude beach is You know, if you're used to go into nude beaches the problem probably won't happen to you.

309
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,694
Speaker 0: Um, I know where you're getting at and I actually I read a Wikipedia a while ago.

310
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:27,440
Speaker 1: Okay, what'd it say?

311
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,365
Speaker 0: Apparently nude beaches.

312
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,875
Speaker 0: that happens all the time and even people who go to him a lot.

313
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:40,080
Speaker 0: It just it happens a lot and Everyone who goes to a nude beach is for the most part adult about it and you know why it's happening.

314
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:43,036
Speaker 0: It's obvious why it's happening and no one says anything.

315
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,502
Speaker 0: You just don't Bother with it.

316
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:46,366
Speaker 0: Don't stare at it.

317
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:47,712
Speaker 0: It's not like everyone's gonna point and laugh.

318
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:48,355
Speaker 0: Haha.

319
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,380
Speaker 0: He got an erection.

320
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:53,460
Speaker 1: Lol, what if I start playing with it now that crosses a line?

321
00:19:54,983 --> 00:20:05,816
Speaker 1: See that does indeed cross a line I know but I might want to cross that line if I want to cross some other lines if I find some agreeable females on the nude beach The ones I was looking at.

322
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,114
Speaker 0: Actually nude beaches tend to very much discourage that sort of thing.

323
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,499
Speaker 1: Well, that's why it's next to the hotel.

324
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,968
Speaker 0: Aha, then that doesn't cross a line or what?

325
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:20,303
Speaker 1: if you know, I have my little boat floating in the water near the nude beach or a Little tent.

326
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:25,713
Speaker 0: well Scott, I'll tell you this if you can make it out to international waters You can do whatever you want hot damn.

327
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:26,759
Speaker 1: Let's go to some new beaches.

328
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:31,478
Speaker 1: So anyway, I just want to say it's for talking about nude beaches.

329
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:33,965
Speaker 1: in the winter It's getting cold out.

330
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

331
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:50,580
Speaker 0: while I might feel bad about getting cold We lived in Rochester for a number of years and I've been told by numerous of what one of my friends because I don't get A chance to talk to a lot of people who live there anymore that it is snowed at least multiple times.

332
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:51,844
Speaker 1: We haven't had snow yet.

333
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:52,367
Speaker 1: Whoo.

334
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:53,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it hasn't snowed.

335
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,760
Speaker 0: In fact, it only frosted once and then it got really warm again.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,730
Speaker 1: It's gonna snow I bet within a month and a half.

337
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:01,660
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's a fantastic bet.

338
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,085
Speaker 0: I'll take you right up on that.

339
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:03,747
Speaker 1: So wait.

340
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:04,610
Speaker 0: All right.

341
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:10,052
Speaker 0: So tonight on, you know compressorless geek nights We're gonna talk about pumpkin scissors.

342
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:14,691
Speaker 1: Like we said we talked about last week How much pumpkin scissors did we watch one episode?

343
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,559
Speaker 0: You know what now first off?

344
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:16,941
Speaker 0: We've.

345
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:20,500
Speaker 0: we've mentioned kind of to the side the gonzo syndrome.

346
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:34,980
Speaker 0: anime world order has talked about this too and They're the ones who really made us fully aware of it because I started thinking back after I heard about Gonzo syndrome and looking at all the shows that exhibited it and then realizing that they were indeed all gonzo shows.

347
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:36,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like.

348
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:43,549
Speaker 1: Originally the first gonzo show I ever saw was gatekeepers Which is their first full-on show.

349
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:49,649
Speaker 1: before gatekeepers gonzo did animation work But never a full-on anime TV series.

350
00:21:50,412 --> 00:22:08,309
Speaker 1: and then I looked at the internet at you know The list of shows that they had done And I said, wow Either these are shows that I was really interested in but turned out to not actually be shows for all time Or they were just bad shows at best.

351
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:16,380
Speaker 1: I think a couple of these shows are a little bit average You know, it's like they have all this fantastic amazing animation.

352
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:20,360
Speaker 1: They have you know, pretty interesting character designs.

353
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:29,544
Speaker 1: Everything's all shiny and high-tech and it really impresses you when you see the trailers and the previews for their shows because They seem to be in the right genre.

354
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:30,285
Speaker 1: They're not.

355
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:35,505
Speaker 1: you know, you don't usually make harem shows or Stupid shounen fighting shows.

356
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:49,110
Speaker 1: they make shows that sort of have normal plots in her seem like they're gonna be interesting But in the end you go back, you know 2020 hindsight vision and none of these shows are so great from gonzo.

357
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:57,605
Speaker 0: Well, the reason seems to be that every one of these shows or at least many of them There's always a great concept when you hear what the show is gonna be about or you hear that.

358
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:05,653
Speaker 0: It's like ooh That sounds interesting and then you watch know the opener in the first episode of the first ten episodes and it's wow This is great.

359
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:06,657
Speaker 0: This is going everywhere.

360
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:09,309
Speaker 0: I was the better however, and then it just kind of Peters out.

361
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:21,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean and once you realize that Gonzo has this syndrome of doing things like this then every time there's a new gonzo show You have a whole different view on it.

362
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:24,268
Speaker 1: It totally changes the way you think.

363
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:33,650
Speaker 0: yeah now I worry about gonkotsuo because I haven't seen it all and the first ten episodes were awesome And the count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite stories ever.

364
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,529
Speaker 0: I mean, I have the full on a bridge penguin press of it edition.

365
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:50,270
Speaker 1: Well, I watched not all of it but a vast majority of the episodes I think over 20 of them and towards the end things started to get a little weird and Not the same as earlier and it was still okay.

366
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,650
Speaker 1: But it wasn't as good as it was in the early episodes.

367
00:23:53,771 --> 00:24:00,138
Speaker 1: It was definitely on a downward trend and who knows what the end is like now We're not saying gonzo shows are bad.

368
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:03,750
Speaker 0: Just notice that when you hear about a gonzo show you start watching it.

369
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:08,790
Speaker 0: It always seems a lot more awesome early on and a lot less awesome the longer you watch.

370
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:11,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

371
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,139
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at this list again And I look at the highlights and I don't.

372
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:21,457
Speaker 1: I don't see a single show on here that I would rank is even like B plus.

373
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:26,551
Speaker 1: I think the highest share was like B - stuff like Gatekeepers.

374
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:27,956
Speaker 0: gatekeepers was pretty bad.

375
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:29,942
Speaker 0: I'm sorry and full metal panic.

376
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,668
Speaker 0: full metal panic was pretty bad.

377
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,449
Speaker 0: I'm sorry I didn't like it at all.

378
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:45,236
Speaker 0: Van Dred Yeah Yeah All those shows showed a lot of promise and didn't seem to go anywhere and I lost interest in every single one of them after The first one to nine episodes.

379
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:45,557
Speaker 0: Yep.

380
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,730
Speaker 1: All right, so pumpkin scissors is gonzo's new show or one of their new shows?

381
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,587
Speaker 0: Yep, it's directed by Katsu ito Akiyama.

382
00:24:53,929 --> 00:25:04,661
Speaker 1: now I didn't know who Katsu ito Akiyama was because you know gonzo also has this sort of syndrome where you recognize the label But of the studio, but you don't know anyone in the studio.

383
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:11,985
Speaker 1: It's sort of like Oh clamp You know the word clamp, you know the clamp studio, but I can't name any of people in clamp.

384
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:12,225
Speaker 1: Can you?

385
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:16,238
Speaker 0: no No, no, it's like I really can't.

386
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:16,439
Speaker 0: Yes.

387
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,067
Speaker 1: Someone says studio Ghibli and you know me as Aki.

388
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:23,043
Speaker 1: he works there But and he's the head dude, but can you name anyone else there?

389
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:29,682
Speaker 1: No it but gonzo I don't know anyone at gonzo not even their head, dude All I know is studio gonzo.

390
00:25:29,782 --> 00:25:31,109
Speaker 1: and then the things that come out of them.

391
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,587
Speaker 0: Well, the guy who did this show pumpkin scissors the director.

392
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:44,258
Speaker 0: Yes the director the he also was the director for such wonderful things as El Hazzard the Wanderers Not the OAV if you know the OAV.

393
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:45,643
Speaker 0: No, not the awesome OAV.

394
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:50,119
Speaker 0: the significantly less awesome Significantly more plotting though actually really funny.

395
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:54,093
Speaker 0: after you get past the first four episodes TV show The direct.

396
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:59,148
Speaker 1: he directed bubblegum crisis the original OAV which I like but is hit or miss with a lot of people.

397
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:04,148
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, the bastard OAV which I think is his metallic on it.

398
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,092
Speaker 0: Yep He was.

399
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:09,470
Speaker 0: he was an episode director for Legend of Black Heaven, which is terrible.

400
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:11,974
Speaker 0: Give it a chance.

401
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:19,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, he directed everything that is golf course every OAV And everything that says golf course on it.

402
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:24,444
Speaker 1: So pumpkin says oh and he also this is this caught me by surprise.

403
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,230
Speaker 1: he directed the Thundercats.

404
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:27,878
Speaker 0: No, yeah.

405
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:28,823
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

406
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:30,230
Speaker 1: Whoa Thundercats is awesome.

407
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:38,935
Speaker 1: Let's find the mega condenser.

408
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:43,086
Speaker 1: I'm saying that too fast, let's find the mega condenser still going too fast.

409
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,189
Speaker 1: What's wrong lion?

410
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:50,068
Speaker 0: Oh Fuck it is again Here again that thing that that mega thing.

411
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:54,990
Speaker 1: Yes, and keep your foot off that blasted summer flange.

412
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,019
Speaker 0: So pumpkin scissors.

413
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,773
Speaker 0: I was excited about this from the moment I heard the name.

414
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:08,790
Speaker 0: before I knew it was a gonzo or anything because the name sounded like one of those shows.

415
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:14,186
Speaker 0: That's a little offbeat but actually serious and cool kind of like I don't know.

416
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,430
Speaker 0: I expected something like Batman.

417
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:22,315
Speaker 0: I don't know why Batman you say like mask of the phantasm Batman Alright, just I don't know.

418
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:26,290
Speaker 0: Why does this mix of goonie and serious and a cool style?

419
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,398
Speaker 0: That's what the name pumpkin scissors means to me.

420
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,110
Speaker 0: because I didn't know anything about the show except the title.

421
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:32,175
Speaker 0: I had nothing.

422
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,025
Speaker 0: I absolutely no idea what it was about.

423
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,010
Speaker 0: who did it anything?

424
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:38,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had seen the logo which is a pumpkin with a scissor under it.

425
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:45,410
Speaker 1: That's kind of stylized and cute and definitely the kind of thing you put on a lot of merchandise the pumpkin scissor icon.

426
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:48,605
Speaker 0: So we finally got the show and I watched it.

427
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:49,670
Speaker 0: Well, we watch it together.

428
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:54,101
Speaker 0: The I was hooked in the first 15 seconds.

429
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:56,267
Speaker 0: in the first 15 seconds of the opener.

430
00:27:56,728 --> 00:28:01,362
Speaker 0: this show Was gonna be an amazing show and about a minute after that.

431
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,649
Speaker 0: I totally lost interest in this show.

432
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:09,950
Speaker 1: It's surprising how much it changed moods in the first episode from the beginning to the end.

433
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,295
Speaker 0: Not even that but half.

434
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:11,978
Speaker 0: I mean the opener.

435
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:13,445
Speaker 0: the opener really says it all.

436
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:18,210
Speaker 0: if you don't want to watch the show Just watch the opener and you'll get everything you need to get out of this show.

437
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:34,269
Speaker 0: it starts out with this creepy music coming in and these Stylized kind of tanks coming forward in three to met like it's this weird surreal kind of disturbing imagery these tanks rolling forward and this man is standing in their path and it's creepy.

438
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:38,149
Speaker 0: and Then he opens this lantern and then crazy stuff happens.

439
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:46,190
Speaker 0: But then another 30 seconds into the opener the most stereotypical anime girl character in the history of anime appears.

440
00:28:47,214 --> 00:28:49,904
Speaker 1: It's the girl who's the semi main character.

441
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:50,727
Speaker 1: OMG.

442
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:52,479
Speaker 0: Yeah mrs.

443
00:28:52,641 --> 00:29:02,118
Speaker 1: Edward Alaric Yeah, the characters in the show it really seems like they've Basically ripped off full metal alchemists.

444
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:12,114
Speaker 1: They have a whole cast of characters, you know Which are designed to be popular and the main ones are sort of magical and powerful.

445
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:19,024
Speaker 1: and then there's a whole bunch of military people of varying personalities to fill it in and there's a whole bunch of villains.

446
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,833
Speaker 0: and I Mean it starts out.

447
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:21,777
Speaker 0: even after the opener.

448
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:26,456
Speaker 0: other than the fact that the girl looks really generic and stereotypical The show starts out.

449
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,743
Speaker 0: Okay, the opener is pretty good.

450
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:29,029
Speaker 0: I really want to know what's going on.

451
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,380
Speaker 0: There's a war a truce is announced.

452
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,269
Speaker 0: There's some military function going on.

453
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:34,394
Speaker 0: Everything's fine.

454
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:43,669
Speaker 0: And then as soon as we finally meet this main character girl she starts doing very silly like full metal alchemist humor style things like.

455
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:52,622
Speaker 0: They're taking out something and looking at some bandits and then she rips out the sword and starts yelling We'll see Jim will siege the castle will crush them ha ha ha.

456
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:55,092
Speaker 0: and the other military guys yell at her like no He'll get us killed.

457
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:55,573
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

458
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:57,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's like we can't seize them.

459
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,887
Speaker 1: We're just you know disaster or whatever guys.

460
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:00,429
Speaker 1: What are they?

461
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,319
Speaker 1: Forget what their job they're the war relief effort.

462
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:03,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

463
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,825
Speaker 1: We're the war relief effort.

464
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:08,550
Speaker 1: We don't go see each anyone What's wrong with you, but it turns silly immediately.

465
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:08,811
Speaker 0: It's.

466
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:13,670
Speaker 0: it's the same kind of like side character interaction from full metal alchemist.

467
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,366
Speaker 0: We have all these secondary funny characters who are really good friends.

468
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:23,429
Speaker 0: They're in the military they've got a pet dog who does funny things and It's the same thing.

469
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:30,210
Speaker 0: it's like they're just ripping off the the aesthetic and the idea and the feeling of Those scenes from full metal alchemist to try to make this show popular.

470
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,579
Speaker 1: It could be it very well could be.

471
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,727
Speaker 1: if not, it really seems like it.

472
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:44,290
Speaker 1: Yeah either way the The show basically continues where they fight these tank guys and you see that everyone has powers that are mysterious.

473
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to know the clicheness of this plot?

474
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:51,710
Speaker 0: So this guy is big and Hawking and scary and he finds out there's a truce.

475
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,989
Speaker 0: Why couldn't this have happened sooner, you know, the typical war is bad thing.

476
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:58,468
Speaker 0: Then it shifts scenes.

477
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:59,092
Speaker 0: now they're at this.

478
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,944
Speaker 0: there's this village and these military war relief effort.

479
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:06,644
Speaker 0: people come in with the girl and the guy is there and they meet and they immediately get to know each other.

480
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:12,484
Speaker 0: and then you know the party of the anime is formed and then the bad guys come.

481
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:22,250
Speaker 0: the bad guy is a Growl wolf this member of an elite Secret military unit of which there were what seven or nine?

482
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:32,220
Speaker 0: Some number of guys some number of special unique military units that were illegal and weren't supposed to exist But they did and they were secret.

483
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:40,209
Speaker 0: and now that the military order has kind of collapsed Apparently some of these groups have decided to be mercenaries or live as bandits on their own.

484
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,450
Speaker 0: One of these groups is here.

485
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:52,534
Speaker 0: they're a chemical weapons group and when they say what the group is, we immediately figured out where the show was going because they give a very specific name and That's very specific.

486
00:31:52,574 --> 00:32:07,310
Speaker 0: like this is one of these things one of these X things is out there chemical weapons, whatever and it turns out I'm gonna spoil the first episode that captain main character is Also one of these units and he is the anti of these units.

487
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:11,530
Speaker 0: His job as a secret special unit was to be able to take out all these other units.

488
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:15,930
Speaker 1: He's an everyone else seems to have a special thing like a chemical weapon chemical tank.

489
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:22,070
Speaker 1: This guy is the anti tank trooper with his little magic lantern, which is still unexplained.

490
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,249
Speaker 1: He opens it up and then he can take out tanks on his own.

491
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:26,478
Speaker 0: Somehow

492
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,150
Speaker 1: somehow with now magic lantern

493
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:46,988
Speaker 0: I don't I don't always want to rap on something if it's for some reason unrealistic or if I can't suspend my Disbelief, but they shoot this guy full-on straight up with a shell from a tank an Acid carrion exploding shell and it does nothing to him.

494
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,553
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh.

495
00:32:49,633 --> 00:33:01,620
Speaker 0: and they also pull a old Batman style kind of chemical agent that affects everyone Conveniently several hours later for purposes of the plot, but doesn't actually kill anyone because there's a magic antidote.

496
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:05,050
Speaker 0: Great, this show just goes nowhere.

497
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:10,990
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read spoilers cuz I gotta know what is up with the lantern which probably isn't going to be something cooler interest.

498
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,675
Speaker 1: It's a magic lantern this.

499
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:17,150
Speaker 1: or there might be the souls of dead people in there or something along those lines.

500
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,113
Speaker 0: I'll bet it's radiation.

501
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:20,180
Speaker 1: It could be radiation in there.

502
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,150
Speaker 1: It is something evil in there that gives him powers.

503
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, they keep calling it the will of the wisp.

504
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:25,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

505
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,330
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it could be a will-o-wisp like a demon or something Who knows?

506
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,123
Speaker 1: If it's something good, then what would be the point then?

507
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:34,770
Speaker 1: Why would bother keeping it a secret?

508
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,579
Speaker 1: It's obviously something bad and that's all you need to know.

509
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem with the show is that I figured it out already.

510
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:48,826
Speaker 0: He's got a bunch of stereotypical characters And it seems like everything the show is designed just to try to get people to keep watching.

511
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,310
Speaker 0: They introduced this lantern.

512
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,880
Speaker 0: It's critical to the plot But they don't say anything about it.

513
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:59,404
Speaker 0: and even I who know the show is gonna be crap Want to know what's up with the lantern kind of like how in fancy Lala.

514
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:00,610
Speaker 0: I want to know what's up with the dinosaurs.

515
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:01,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

516
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:04,561
Speaker 0: And then there's the dog character.

517
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:11,400
Speaker 1: Oh the closer of the of the show This is dog and They didn't use the dog yet.

518
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:25,417
Speaker 1: because you gotta understand in the first episode They show scenes from the headquarters the military headquarters where there's a bunch of characters that do very little in the first episode Except you see them doing stuff Talking about the situation in the world.

519
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,190
Speaker 1: and then there's the characters out in the field who are actually the focus of the first episode.

520
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,041
Speaker 1: There's a dog that is at the headquarters.

521
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:35,290
Speaker 0: The dog is pretty much there.

522
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,350
Speaker 1: It looks like the dog from as among Adil only smaller, but it has a barrel under its neck like yep.

523
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:42,764
Speaker 1: You know those dogs that are the ski slopes.

524
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:43,529
Speaker 0: It's really cute.

525
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,554
Speaker 0: But it again it just.

526
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,989
Speaker 0: it feels like I don't know the dogs from FMA.

527
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,552
Speaker 0: This just.

528
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:51,788
Speaker 0: it's there because it's cute and we can have a cute closer and it provides comic relief.

529
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:53,829
Speaker 0: all the time It bites the commander's head.

530
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:54,206
Speaker 1: Yeah.

531
00:34:54,911 --> 00:35:09,050
Speaker 1: So without being told or with anyone saying this I can tell that the dog's job is to bring messages from the headquarters To the pumpkin scissors people out in the field and in the closer they show the dog doing exactly that.

532
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:13,557
Speaker 1: This closer is pretty much The main character.

533
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:17,230
Speaker 1: girl puts a message in the dog's barrel and the dog starts running.

534
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:18,698
Speaker 0: it's actually really funny.

535
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:28,106
Speaker 1: cute clothes and there's a cute music playing and The dogs running and the cute music is playing and the credits are rolling and then the dog stops and looks at this poodle Which is pretty funny.

536
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:32,349
Speaker 1: The dog like pops up in the bottom right of the screen and barks once.

537
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:34,530
Speaker 0: yes Oh, he goes off with the poodle for a while.

538
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,291
Speaker 1: Yeah He does.

539
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,938
Speaker 1: then he comes back and he eventually makes it to the headquarters and gives the note to the headquarters girl And then he goes away.

540
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,290
Speaker 1: and that's the closer.

541
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:52,800
Speaker 0: It's all it's like meant to be cute and to sell dog merchandise kind of like the closer to a horror Matic just designed specifically to be cute and make people go.

542
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:54,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly what is the closer to.

543
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:55,529
Speaker 1: mohoromatic was?

544
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,683
Speaker 0: Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

545
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a cute.

546
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:07,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was these made little tiny Chibi-chibi cartoon maids doing a dance that you could learn and dance that we did in fact learn.

547
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:08,970
Speaker 1: a dance that we did learn.

548
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,045
Speaker 0: We in fact performed it in front of an audience who will never speak of it.

549
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:13,030
Speaker 1: That is right.

550
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,585
Speaker 1: That's a terrible terrible show mohoromatic, but it had.

551
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:17,750
Speaker 1: the cute clothes are going on.

552
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,797
Speaker 1: What other shows had the cute clothes are going on.

553
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,762
Speaker 1: Oh God Did risky safety.

00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:23,549
Speaker 1: have a cute closer?

555
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:26,581
Speaker 0: The cute opener, I don't remember.

556
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:36,361
Speaker 0: all I remember is when we showed it in club We showed the opener and closer every episode because there was a bunch of short episodes that drove me insane I know but I had no say back then.

557
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:42,976
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway pumpkin scissors It's not the worst show ever.

558
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,445
Speaker 1: It's not a bad show like oh my god.

559
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:46,168
Speaker 1: It's MB guys.

560
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,405
Speaker 1: It's bad It's bad, but it's not a show you want to watch.

561
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:51,590
Speaker 1: It's not worth your time.

562
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what.

563
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:53,898
Speaker 0: I'll save you all the trouble.

564
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,748
Speaker 0: pumpkin scissors is the name of the war relief unit.

565
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:57,129
Speaker 0: That's it.

566
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:01,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't seem to be any other significance to that name whatsoever Mm-hmm.

567
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:05,750
Speaker 0: and in fact the icon they show you the logo is just the patch on their shoulders.

568
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:09,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's more to it like the name came from somewhere.

569
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:12,410
Speaker 1: I can't imagine it being cool or interesting.

570
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:15,443
Speaker 1: It's probably just you know made up and corny and force.

571
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:18,829
Speaker 0: if I find out what's up with the lantern I'll just boil it for all of you if you want.

572
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:26,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, it seems like they just chose to call it pumpkin scissors so they can make a cool logo and sell merchandise.

573
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:30,737
Speaker 0: So watch the opener Like the first 30 seconds of the opener.

574
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:35,390
Speaker 0: pretend the show was about that and was like that and just don't actually watch the show.

575
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,269
Speaker 0: Cuz it's not worth it.

576
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you do really have nothing to do for a half-hour you could watch the first episode.

577
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:42,830
Speaker 1: if you really don't believe us.

578
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:44,034
Speaker 0: Um, you know what.

579
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:47,004
Speaker 1: just I wouldn't recommend it, but you could if you.

580
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,710
Speaker 1: there are worse things that you could do.

581
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:59,823
Speaker 0: if you for whatever reason decide you want to see the first episode of pumpkin scissors and you haven't seen the first episode of You know tari watch that one instead.

582
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:00,084
Speaker 1: Yes.

583
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,354
Speaker 1: There are many other shows You should watch instead.

584
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:15,976
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen them like death note or Nana or anything like that yeah, now if you've seen all the other anime in the universe other than MD guys and Or Please save my earth.

585
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:16,880
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

586
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,310
Speaker 0: I wanted to make fun of some anime.

587
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,936
Speaker 0: That was the first one that came to mind.

588
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:21,619
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.

589
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,025
Speaker 1: you thought about that for like a minute.

590
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:24,290
Speaker 1: It was really bad.

591
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:24,933
Speaker 1: What can I say?

592
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:28,467
Speaker 1: I thought that was one of your things you really like place admire.

593
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:36,564
Speaker 1: Yep So that's what we got to say about pumpkin scissors and gonzo And I think from now on when gonzo comes out with new shows next season.

594
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:40,536
Speaker 1: I'll be less highly Expecting of them.

595
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,210
Speaker 0: Yes, but I don't know.

596
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,014
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't want to.

597
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,170
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna discount gonzo because their animation is usually beautiful.

598
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:47,618
Speaker 0: It's just they.

599
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:49,630
Speaker 1: it's like the console would just fire.

600
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:54,024
Speaker 1: There are some of their writers and get new writers over there.

601
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:55,729
Speaker 1: I think they would do pretty well.

602
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:57,773
Speaker 1: You know get like.

603
00:38:57,854 --> 00:39:07,998
Speaker 1: all you really need to do is hire one guy who knows how to write an interesting plot instead of merchandise merchandising crap fest Of course.

604
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,210
Speaker 0: then again, there's the possibility.

605
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:15,030
Speaker 0: I mean all the cool ideas they come up with might not actually have cool ways to resolve.

606
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:25,290
Speaker 0: I mean part of the reason a lot of gonzo shows seem so awesome right away Is that when you hear what it's about or you see the beginning you think wow, that's unique.

607
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,989
Speaker 0: Where the hell are they gonna go with this?

608
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,779
Speaker 0: This is gonna be awesome because I've never seen anything like this.

609
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,609
Speaker 0: and then the truth is it really can't go anywhere.

610
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:38,089
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why all these punk kids in the US like I got an idea for an anime.

611
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:41,765
Speaker 1: The anime is no good because I mean look at gatekeepers.

612
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:42,949
Speaker 0: Where did gatekeepers go?

613
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:45,603
Speaker 1: They fought a bunch.

614
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:49,500
Speaker 0: Yeah Because I remember it back at RIT.

615
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,950
Speaker 0: Everyone was everyone was going nuts about gatekeepers.

616
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:57,370
Speaker 1: Well, cuz you could it was really shallow and straightforward, but it wasn't a fighting show.

617
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,120
Speaker 1: It was a fun campy monster the week show.

618
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what really shiny animation.

619
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:04,669
Speaker 1: Here's the thing And it was watching with a group.

620
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:05,915
Speaker 1: You can have a lot of fun.

621
00:40:05,976 --> 00:40:09,130
Speaker 0: watching the first four episodes with a group was fantastic.

622
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,190
Speaker 0: Cuz you just yell and scream and it's stupid and awesome.

623
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:19,270
Speaker 0: I mean any anime is enjoyable in a group except possibly Legend of the overfeed gatekeepers is sort of awesome in the Phoenix Wright kind of way.

624
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:22,408
Speaker 1: You know, it's like a guy stands up at points and it's like go.

625
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:22,710
Speaker 1: it's like.

626
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:32,569
Speaker 0: My problem with gatekeepers was that it after the first four episodes Everyone kept watching it even though it was the exact same thing.

627
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:37,070
Speaker 0: Nothing changed it and no one was watching it in groups anymore.

628
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,302
Speaker 0: They were all watching it on their own which wasn't fun at all.

629
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,607
Speaker 0: and then talking about it.

630
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:43,072
Speaker 1: Yeah I did.

631
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:46,725
Speaker 1: I didn't watch it after club except for when they had a marathon.

632
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,930
Speaker 1: then I went and I saw the whole show.

633
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:54,761
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I probably could have better spent my time But I got it's one gonzo show that I actually finished.

634
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,150
Speaker 0: I don't think I have ever finished a gonzo show.

635
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:11,650
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a reason for that and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special Thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.
