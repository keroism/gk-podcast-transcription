1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,486
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday October 9th.

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,249
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,737
Speaker 0: I'm hot and this is geek knives.

4
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:15,740
Speaker 0: No, you're not tonight.

5
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:24,361
Speaker 0: We stopped talking about Team Fortress 2.

6
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,378
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:34,247
Speaker 0: So, I don't know when you guys are gonna hear this since our internet is coming and going in a bad way.

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,069
Speaker 1: I Hate that's all I got to say.

9
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:43,875
Speaker 0: You know, we were just talking a second ago about this, but it's almost like if your internet is Working it's great.

10
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,540
Speaker 0: If it's not working at all.

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,062
Speaker 0: It's fine.

12
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:47,327
Speaker 0: Cuz alright, it's not working.

13
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,250
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna try.

14
00:00:48,953 --> 00:01:01,269
Speaker 0: but when it almost works when it kind of works when Every now and then I see a new thing on dig or a page loads It's almost like if you're calling on your car if it's broken and it breaks down.

15
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,295
Speaker 0: crap I call a mechanic or I call a tow truck.

16
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:09,759
Speaker 0: if the car breaks down, but it's still kind of going you almost feel like I'm almost there.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,464
Speaker 0: I'll make it.

18
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:15,387
Speaker 0: I'll keep driving I'll keep driving and you're going five miles an hour down the freeway and your car's not gonna make it.

19
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,297
Speaker 1: but let's sort of like Driving with a doughnut.

20
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:19,250
Speaker 1: It's like you can drive but it sucks.

21
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:29,609
Speaker 1: I drove almost worse than not driving because at least when you it's like well, it's like driving in traffic You're get you're driving everything works, but you're just not getting at where as fast as you could be.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,775
Speaker 1: But it's out of your control.

23
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:36,909
Speaker 0: koma across the Long Island Expressway to Rochester in one go on a doughnut.

24
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:57,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sucks, yep I kept also it's like don't take this thing more than 50 miles an hour and I'm going 50 and I'm going 50 and then I'm like 52 53 shake shake 50 Cruise control 49.

25
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:57,656
Speaker 1: Yep.

26
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least there was no danger getting a speeding ticket.

27
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:01,930
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

28
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,669
Speaker 0: Though actually I almost got a speeding ticket coming home today.

29
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:05,837
Speaker 1: So did you.

30
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,750
Speaker 0: I didn't though but I'm coming in to beacon.

31
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,249
Speaker 0: You know, the speed limit goes from 55 to 30 in the span of like an inch.

32
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:18,132
Speaker 0: Yeah It's also funny because the road goes from crappy to brand new and awesome right at the border of beacon right where the speed limit Drops.

33
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:28,835
Speaker 0: Yep, and I'm going 35 Speed limits 30. there's a guy in front of me going 35 speed limits 30. a cop comes out of nowhere and pulls him over For going 35.

34
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:34,170
Speaker 0: Oh The only reason he didn't pull me over because I kind of ran.

35
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,829
Speaker 0: Well, he was pulling that guy over and I know he was gonna try and get me.

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,478
Speaker 0: I just kind of turned off a side street and went And got off on another street and came home.

37
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,828
Speaker 0: Nice job, which I've done often.

38
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,501
Speaker 0: Yep I guess I should say that everything I just said was a lie.

39
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,350
Speaker 0: I've never actually run away from a police officer.

40
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,861
Speaker 1: He wasn't actively pulling you over you didn't run.

41
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:56,270
Speaker 1: You just decided to go on a detour on your way home.

42
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:09,830
Speaker 0: Hypothetically in the past it's possible that I might have done that when a cop Had his lights on and just couldn't catch me because there was an exit because it was poorly planned He didn't think his clever plan through and he had a speed trap at the top at the front of a hill.

43
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,696
Speaker 0: But behind the hill was an exit.

44
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,830
Speaker 0: But yeah, I may or may not have run away from the cops in that situation.

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:26,530
Speaker 1: The thing is if they may or may not have hit a rest stop If they actually got close enough to you to where there was no, you know No way to say oh, he wasn't actually pulling me over and there was no uncertainty.

46
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:36,597
Speaker 0: Hypothetically, let's say I was the only car on the road in any direction for as far as anyone can see And let's say hypothetically.

47
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,978
Speaker 0: I was going maybe 90 and let's say Hypothetically.

48
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:42,549
Speaker 0: were this actually to have happened that?

49
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,321
Speaker 0: He was just sitting there and I watched his radar gun track me.

50
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,761
Speaker 0: his lights turned on while it was pointed at me and then He floored it.

51
00:03:50,631 --> 00:04:02,432
Speaker 0: but let's just say I part may or may not have parked the car in the back of a rest stop and sat in the rest stop acting like I was shopping for 20 minutes while the cop may or may not have Driven

52
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:03,114
Speaker 1: around

53
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:07,390
Speaker 0: the rest stop and all the areas by that exit looking for a purple Sunfire.

54
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:16,890
Speaker 0: But no that didn't happen at all Right, so no internet made it tough to find news, so I'm gonna do a geek bite.

55
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:31,677
Speaker 0: Oh, man And I think it's a good geek bite particularly because I know a lot of you have probably never played this and while I have Played it in other forms a little bit not in any span or any reasonable amount to actually Really?

56
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,007
Speaker 0: I couldn't have said I played it.

57
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:45,650
Speaker 0: But uh Mario 2 the real Mario 2 the Mario 2 that Japan looked at and said Americans would not be able to play this Game was never released here except until it was released.

58
00:04:45,991 --> 00:05:00,857
Speaker 1: It was released for the Super Nintendo as part of Mario all-stars, which is sort of a re Skinning of Mario 1 2 3 law, you know mark 1 2 3 both twos And Mario world.

59
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:09,350
Speaker 1: so that like if you bought a Super Nintendo early on you got Super Mario world You buy the Super Nintendo later on you got Mario all-stars, which is like every Mario game on one.

60
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:19,646
Speaker 0: I never owned it just because other than you know Mario 2 the real one not doki-doki panic Mario 2 Which I think is actually a lot better game, and I'm really glad Japan did that.

61
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:20,670
Speaker 0: but I?

62
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:26,405
Speaker 0: Owned all those games, so I just it never seemed worth it to buy it for the lost levels And I just kind of forgot about him.

63
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:33,130
Speaker 1: yep And then later on it was released a second time in the US because they came out with a cartridge for the Gameboy color.

64
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,070
Speaker 1: It was a Gameboy color only cartridge.

65
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,849
Speaker 1: you can also play on a GBA or GBA SP, but not on a Gameboy micro or a DS.

66
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:59,724
Speaker 1: and This cartridge I have it is Super Mario Brothers deluxe And it has Mario 1 this real the real original Mario 2 from Japan and a whole bunch of other miscellaneous garbage that you can do also and The only time the only the third time it has been released the United States of America is just now.

67
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:07,288
Speaker 1: you can get the original Unmodified real deal for the Virtual Console for it's like yeah, 600 points six dollars.

68
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:24,469
Speaker 0: now I highly recommend you buy it and my only real reason for that is that While I don't want to buy a lot of Virtual Console games, and they are kind of really expensive There's something to be said for buying the absolute classics because that is the perfect way to play those games.

69
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,310
Speaker 0: nowadays It works a hundred percent like the original.

70
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,119
Speaker 0: There's the graphics are as the best they'll ever be.

71
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:33,450
Speaker 0: that Mario 1 on the Wii is so crisp looking and just perfect.

72
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:37,477
Speaker 1: it's the best Mario 1 and I got to say this.

73
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:47,309
Speaker 0: this is the main gist of what I want to say Mario 2. a Lot of people when they found out that oh Japan didn't think that Americans can handle this game and decided not to release it.

74
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:55,410
Speaker 0: Well, uh, there's probably more to the story than that because Mario 2 was basically a hacked together piece of shit in Japan.

75
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:57,457
Speaker 1: It wasn't a piece of shit.

76
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:58,902
Speaker 0: It was literally there.

77
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:00,808
Speaker 0: You know people always say oh Nintendo.

78
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:01,330
Speaker 0: They innovate.

79
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:02,656
Speaker 0: They're the innovators they.

80
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,570
Speaker 0: every sequel they make is always like leaps and bounds beyond.

81
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:11,360
Speaker 0: Mario 2 is Identical to Mario 1 except the graphics are a little glitch here.

82
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:12,805
Speaker 1: They're not glitch here.

83
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:13,547
Speaker 1: They're the same.

84
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,193
Speaker 0: they look Crappy.

85
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:26,092
Speaker 0: they look because the way they set it up the way the levels don't look as polished that the Sprites they used and where they use them and the way they set the backgrounds up is not nearly as polished as Mario 1.

86
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:26,836
Speaker 1: No, it's not it.

87
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,405
Speaker 1: I don't know just something about it.

88
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,410
Speaker 0: feel really hackish.

89
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,210
Speaker 0: It feels like something a kid would have thrown together like what if I made it so I could jump over the flagpole?

90
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,110
Speaker 0: What if I made us there was a blooper here?

91
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,478
Speaker 0: What if I made it so there was a poison mushroom?

92
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,969
Speaker 1: basically what they did is they added the poison mushroom and they came up with the craziest level design they possibly could.

93
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:50,565
Speaker 1: and The thing is the level design is what isn't polished not the graphic.

94
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:51,850
Speaker 0: yeah the level the level design.

95
00:07:52,103 --> 00:08:00,450
Speaker 0: I mean I guess I said graphics because they'll use a sprite or a Block in a certain place and it just looks like it was hacked there like it doesn't actually belong there.

96
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,768
Speaker 1: But that's where it goes.

97
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:11,130
Speaker 0: But if you've never played this game before cuz I had never played it at length until now I got watching me play on my on the Game Boy Color with Super Mario Brothers deluxe.

98
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,829
Speaker 1: I was able to get to I think eight two or eight three.

99
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,122
Speaker 0: I think yeah, two and that took some doing.

100
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,249
Speaker 1: that's like a lot of doing.

101
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,558
Speaker 0: well I started playing it when it came out.

102
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:22,810
Speaker 1: I've played maybe two back in the high school days like 10th grade.

103
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:25,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, that game is up.

104
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:28,814
Speaker 0: I guess frustrating might be the word Difficult.

105
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,245
Speaker 0: it brought back all those emotions.

106
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,390
Speaker 1: not as hard as Silver Surfer.

107
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:33,032
Speaker 0: No it's not.

108
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:40,568
Speaker 0: but it feels as difficult for me now as Mario 1 felt when I was a little kid and I played it for the first couple of times.

109
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:44,010
Speaker 0: I got to relive that whole experience of playing a game like that.

110
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,430
Speaker 0: That's difficult and I can't get past things easily and I have to find secrets.

111
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:54,850
Speaker 1: Remember that thing of the day where it's the incredibly hard Mario 1 levels and the guy just couldn't beat him.

112
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,461
Speaker 0: This thing does stuff like that.

113
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,670
Speaker 1: It does stuff a lot of times But at the same time it's not even close to that level of difficult.

114
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:07,405
Speaker 0: But it's that same kind of thing where sometimes like you go to jump and there's just an invisible block Where you were jumping and it knocks you into a pit.

115
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:13,047
Speaker 1: Yep Sometimes you'll be in the dark and you'll hit a block and a mushroom comes out.

116
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:13,730
Speaker 0: You're like, is it poison?

117
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,152
Speaker 0: I don't know.

118
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,118
Speaker 0: I can't tell fuck.

119
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,064
Speaker 1: I'm under cuz.

120
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:22,647
Speaker 1: the above-ground Regular mushrooms are sort of yellow and red the usual colors and poison mushrooms like green and you could tell.

121
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:28,265
Speaker 1: but underground Every mushroom is blue and green and you don't know which ones are poison which ones aren't.

122
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:34,170
Speaker 0: the worst thing is I gotta say Because I never thought about it when I played Mario normally because the mushroom was always like this wonderful thing.

123
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:34,714
Speaker 0: I loved it.

124
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,129
Speaker 0: now that there's also a bad mushroom.

125
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:47,049
Speaker 0: Watching that bad mushroom move around was a little bit scary just because it moves so Purposefully and so much faster than any bad guy in that game moves.

126
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:52,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, bad games are all bad guys are all kind of like I do but it's like oh, it's a turtle walking real slow.

127
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,760
Speaker 0: It's a beetle going real slow.

128
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:55,050
Speaker 0: It's a pauberos.

129
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:02,180
Speaker 1: They're fast, but they can only go in certain places, but the bad guys move in a in a pattern, you know Predictable way.

130
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,229
Speaker 0: It's not that menacing?

131
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,950
Speaker 0: No But those poison mushrooms are really menacing like.

132
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,383
Speaker 0: Psychologically those things bother me because they come right at cuz it.

133
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,050
Speaker 1: it's sort of weird in the game.

134
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:23,569
Speaker 1: They positioned the regular mushrooms to sort of always go away from you to make them hard to get like you have to hit it And then hit a brick to make it bounce so that you know You'll actually go in the direction you want it to go so you can get it.

135
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:29,707
Speaker 1: But meanwhile the poison mushrooms they come right at you like here I come and you ever think about avoiding a mushroom.

136
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:35,548
Speaker 1: not easy I mean, it's really hard to avoid a mushroom, especially when you don't have a lot of room to move around in.

137
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:43,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also it's like it's not like it's a goo like if a goomba right it's coming straight at you Right and there's bricks above your head.

138
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:44,941
Speaker 1: Well, that's fine.

139
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:46,708
Speaker 1: You'll just jump and step on the goomba.

140
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:55,670
Speaker 1: Imagine if the bricks are very low above your head and you have to go over The goomba and it's moving faster because if you touch the top of the poison mushroom, it still hurts you.

141
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,327
Speaker 1: That's the menacing part is that there's nothing you can do to fight against it.

142
00:10:59,347 --> 00:10:59,930
Speaker 1: You can't shoot it.

143
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,060
Speaker 1: It's just so purposeful and so scary.

144
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,089
Speaker 1: It's just you know, you can't touch it.

145
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:10,610
Speaker 0: I think the worst thing about this game is that well worse not in a bad way But in a the most frustrating thing, but I like it.

146
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:19,506
Speaker 0: I really like the fact that the game is this way because it gives me all sorts of ways to relive the Frustration of my childhood which I think played a big role in making me the man.

147
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,129
Speaker 0: I am today.

148
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,561
Speaker 0: No, I don't think you could understand out there.

149
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,710
Speaker 0: if you didn't play these old Nintendo games You should probably watch some angry video game nerd.

150
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:29,679
Speaker 0: It really felt like that to play a lot of those games.

151
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,381
Speaker 1: sure did.

152
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,150
Speaker 0: squeezing the controller so hard you almost break it and just.

153
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,685
Speaker 0: But in Mario 1 if you found a secret it was always something awesome.

154
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:46,780
Speaker 1: if you found a warp zone Imagine every Nintendo game in the United States.

155
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,310
Speaker 1: if you found a secret of any kind it was awesome.

156
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,635
Speaker 1: It's like a secret.

157
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:53,384
Speaker 1: Yeah secret was synonymous with awesome.

158
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:54,488
Speaker 1: There was no such thing as a bad.

159
00:11:55,331 --> 00:12:03,019
Speaker 1: so in this Mario telling and it wasn't even like half-life 2 or in half-life 2 you find a secret and it's like Med kits and a gun and some ammo.

160
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:05,027
Speaker 1: Oh, but there's a zombie in here.

161
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:09,885
Speaker 0: I'll just shoot the zombie So I'll tell the store I'm walking and you know, I figure alright.

162
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:16,450
Speaker 0: in Mario 1 There's a warp zone on top of the first dungeon world and I can get on top in this game.

163
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,075
Speaker 0: I know there's something back there.

164
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,700
Speaker 0: Let's go back there and see.

165
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,508
Speaker 0: and hey, there's just more level.

166
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,015
Speaker 0: Hey There's a bunch of pipes to go to a pipe.

167
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,279
Speaker 0: It takes me somewhere else.

168
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,021
Speaker 0: weird what?

169
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,027
Speaker 0: getting another pipe somewhere else?

170
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,257
Speaker 0: even weirder What what?

171
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:32,605
Speaker 0: and then I just died?

172
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

173
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:39,715
Speaker 0: So then later I find I go to another pipe and I find this weird place and then I see a warp zone up ahead like hot diggity.

174
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:45,368
Speaker 0: damn and I see only one pipe in there and I'm like oh man, it's gonna be one of those like straight to the end of the game warps.

175
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:52,418
Speaker 0: and No, it was a warp back to world 1. the only thing that made it better.

176
00:12:52,438 --> 00:13:02,950
Speaker 0: and Emily was laughing because I'm standing there and I just I Mario just stops and I'm looking and I see a warp back to world 1. and you know They're really nice to you in this game.

177
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,730
Speaker 0: They really want to make it a pleasant experience.

178
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:14,439
Speaker 0: Right next to this war back to world 1 is a hole so that if I don't want to take my bad medicine I can just fucking kill myself.

179
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:24,350
Speaker 0: and and that is what I did And I jumped over a flagpole and I was like, oh man, I jumped over a flagpole and I keep running.

180
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:28,258
Speaker 0: Oh, man, there's a pipe back here suicide hole.

181
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:30,951
Speaker 0: warp zone to world 1.

182
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:36,450
Speaker 0: It got to the point where I'm playing and I'm afraid to go into any pipe because there might be something bad down there.

183
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:42,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you don't ever find the real warp zones because you're so afraid that most of the warp zones are fake.

184
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:45,039
Speaker 1: So, you know, you don't go for the secrets.

185
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,230
Speaker 0: I was just waiting for a warp zone to lie to me.

186
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,361
Speaker 1: That's what I ended up doing.

187
00:13:48,381 --> 00:14:02,570
Speaker 1: a lot of half-life 2. it's like if I play half-life 2 if I have ammo and I have health and I see like a house on the side of The road and I know that in that house are probably a lot of weapons But also a lot of bad guys and I have the option of just not going to that house.

188
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,118
Speaker 1: I just don't go to that house.

189
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,390
Speaker 0: I keep driving, you know hard it is for me to do that.

190
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,918
Speaker 0: I have the FPS instant.

191
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,310
Speaker 1: first time I played half-life 2 I stopped it.

192
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,960
Speaker 1: There's a house and I went to every single room.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,470
Speaker 1: and now when I play half-life 2 because I just beat it the other day.

194
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,641
Speaker 1: Cuz I'm preparing for episode 2 which comes out tomorrow.

195
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:19,665
Speaker 0: Don't don't do that.

196
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,778
Speaker 0: I haven't even played Bioshock and I own it.

197
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:24,750
Speaker 0: I haven't even beaten half-life 2.

198
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,962
Speaker 1: Well, I beat half-life 2 again and I be.

199
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,651
Speaker 1: I'm halfway through beating episode 1.

200
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,490
Speaker 0: I spent my whole weekend playing Team Fortress and I became the transcendent spy, right?

201
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:39,090
Speaker 1: But you know now what I do is I just burn through the game as fast as I can only doing the necessary bits.

202
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:45,390
Speaker 1: Because why should I waste my time walking around all these rooms to kill zombies when I know there's nothing actually for Bioshock?

203
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,477
Speaker 0: I was playing that way.

204
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,330
Speaker 0: I didn't go after secrets.

205
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,565
Speaker 0: I just kind of played it, you know kind of just straight in a game like that though.

206
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:52,610
Speaker 1: I would stop for everything.

207
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:57,650
Speaker 0: Well, I'd stop for anything cool or interesting, but I'm not like worried about finding everything.

208
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,806
Speaker 1: I'm worried about just enjoying the house cuz I was playing System Shock 2.

209
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:01,509
Speaker 1: I still didn't beat it.

210
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,350
Speaker 1: I barely played it actually but like the little part I did play I had to investigate everything.

211
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:07,968
Speaker 0: See, I don't know.

212
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,649
Speaker 0: I feel like if I don't have this desire to get like the hundred percent.

213
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:15,097
Speaker 0: Oh I don't have a desire to get the hundred percent.

214
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:20,107
Speaker 1: but like the fun of the game is that there's all these bits to poke All over the place and I got a poke off.

215
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:26,580
Speaker 0: I feel like it's more fun if I just play through the game doing whatever strikes my fancy And strikes my fancy is poking all the pokey bits.

216
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,223
Speaker 0: It depends.

217
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,910
Speaker 0: You didn't poke all those houses.

218
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:30,796
Speaker 1: I did the first time I played.

219
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:33,907
Speaker 0: ah, see I'm playing the game the first time and I'm still not poking all the houses.

220
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:35,853
Speaker 1: Oh Crazy.

221
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:36,718
Speaker 1: All right.

222
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:38,910
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I have to do a news, right?

223
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:46,370
Speaker 1: I guess you do so, you know We used to go on to this podcast and talk about how PC gaming was dead and it kind of was it kind of still.

224
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,170
Speaker 0: Mostly it's getting better a lot.

225
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,214
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people are.

226
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:54,637
Speaker 1: basically there's one game for the PC that's sort of bringing it back the orange box and that's it.

227
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:59,458
Speaker 1: and the orange box is on Xbox 360 and It's gonna be on ps3 later on.

228
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:02,752
Speaker 1: but tomorrow it's gonna be available for PC and 360.

229
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:06,870
Speaker 1: In fact on your PC, you could download it right now and you'll probably let you play it at midnight.

230
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,552
Speaker 0: I'm guessing you might remember that feeling from when tribes 2 got not tribes 2.

231
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:21,560
Speaker 0: I wish tribes 2 came out again Team Fortress 2 and You know, we're sitting there and Scott's like, you know, it's on our computers right now It's just missing a little a couple of bits.

232
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,670
Speaker 0: if we knew those bits we could play right now.

233
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,554
Speaker 1: Basically, they give you.

234
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,710
Speaker 1: they give you all the data files, but they don't give you the exe files.

235
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,722
Speaker 0: Sure I read somewhere else that they just give you an encrypted game and then they decrypt it.

236
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:34,717
Speaker 1: that it's it's some combination of the two Things.

237
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:35,749
Speaker 1: that's that's what I've heard.

238
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,957
Speaker 1: But mostly it's the data files.

239
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,964
Speaker 1: that way there's less stress on their servers.

240
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,690
Speaker 1: the day of is what the idea is.

241
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:46,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course totally helpful for you because as soon as the game comes out you can play immediately.

242
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:57,250
Speaker 0: It's totally mitigated by the fact that even though people have it pre-loaded they sit there refreshing steam Constantly, even though that doesn't do anything for like four hours not helped by the fact that our Internet's not working.

243
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:10,829
Speaker 1: So I know yeah, but just to prove, you know yet another reason why PC gaming is not doing so well Right the I guess the hit PC game that's coming that some people are excited for that I don't really give a shit about.

244
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:21,940
Speaker 1: Honestly, is this crisis game and it looks to be another sort of generic far cry kind of FPS, you know in the jungle Military it's a little bit of sci-fi action.

245
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,904
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for portal.

246
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,250
Speaker 0: I couldn't care less about crisis.

247
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, but well portals coming out tomorrow cry now coming out November 13, you know hard This is.

248
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:34,170
Speaker 0: I have this bonanza of gaming and I'm not even touching my GBA anymore.

249
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,050
Speaker 1: I'm not even yeah, but this and this news I gotta tell you.

250
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:47,244
Speaker 1: Today they released the system requirements and Recommendations for crisis and this is like the hit PC game that people are excited about.

251
00:17:47,285 --> 00:18:01,240
Speaker 1: and I just want to read these system requirements and I cannot say anything else after that other than This is my one more piece of evidence on the pile that despite the orange box PC gaming is still not too well in the United States at least.

252
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,730
Speaker 1: because well if the orange box is all you got that's great.

253
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,041
Speaker 1: But that's one thing and it's not even a PC exclusive.

254
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,630
Speaker 1: All right, this is this is the next best thing on the PC.

255
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:11,713
Speaker 0: So hit us with it.

256
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,241
Speaker 1: Okay, Windows XP or Vista.

257
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:17,009
Speaker 1: All right, this is the minimums minimums.

258
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:27,577
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll do the recommended after I do the minimum processor 2.8 gigahertz or faster for Windows XP 3.2 gigahertz or faster for Vista.

259
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:28,439
Speaker 1: Whoa.

260
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,424
Speaker 0: Wait a minute like core 2 gigahertz.

261
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:31,267
Speaker 0: It's all it says.

262
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:38,867
Speaker 1: Then it says memory one gig or one and a half gigs if you have Vista video card.

263
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:44,583
Speaker 1: a 256 meg video card would be nice, but it has to be at least a g4 6800 GT or better.

264
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:50,612
Speaker 0: Wow That's actually pretty high Relatively.

265
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,956
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh supported.

266
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:52,818
Speaker 1: Okay.

267
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:56,972
Speaker 1: Oh, here's the explanation of the processors an Intel Pentium for 2.8 gigahertz.

268
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the minimum.

269
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:01,779
Speaker 1: see it's weird.

270
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,324
Speaker 1: all the PC Vista.

271
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,171
Speaker 1: you need a Pentium for 3.2.

272
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:12,976
Speaker 0: all the PC games seem to give speeds relative to the Pentium for and I find that strange because you know because in the Recommendants they give it a core - really?

273
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:13,578
Speaker 0: Yes, huh?

274
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,067
Speaker 1: So then I'll see video car hard drive 12 gig 12 gigs of space.

275
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:23,070
Speaker 0: God, I remember when a game that took up 200 megs was like crazy and under requirements.

276
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:27,748
Speaker 1: It says sound card DirectX non compatible, but you can't play without a sound card.

277
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,110
Speaker 1: again.

278
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:34,823
Speaker 1: I Recommended Intel core to duo at 2.2 gigahertz.

279
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,970
Speaker 0: All right, I beat that two gigs of RAM.

280
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:43,521
Speaker 1: I got more than that a geforce 8800 GTS Slash 640 or similar.

281
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,029
Speaker 0: That's not worth it.

282
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:53,189
Speaker 1: And basically that everyone on the internet is saying well you want to play this game You're gonna have to shell out to buy a new computer.

283
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:59,210
Speaker 0: I think the problem is Bioshock didn't even run so well on my computer and my computer is pretty badass.

284
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:07,705
Speaker 1: Yep, and if you really I mean think about these same games if you put them on the 360 It's not because you put the same game on the 360 it runs nicer.

285
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:15,529
Speaker 1: It's because when you program a game for the 360 you're building it to one unchanging hardware target.

286
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:22,010
Speaker 1: Right if you make crisis crisis has to work on pretty much all sorts of PCs with all sorts of different setups.

287
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:22,774
Speaker 1: So you have to.

288
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:25,389
Speaker 1: you can't really optimize it very much when you compile it.

289
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,910
Speaker 0: And there used to be a lot of problems with games work.

290
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:34,330
Speaker 0: Like if you had a certain motherboard processor combination, usually an Athlon something something some games would crash.

291
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:44,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for 360. the 360 is a lot less powerful than this kind of machine but all 360s have the same hardware.

292
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:53,250
Speaker 1: so you can optimize the software for the 360 or for a Wii or for a PA or for any console because all the consoles have the same exact hardware.

293
00:20:53,672 --> 00:21:03,289
Speaker 1: So when you build the software when you compile it you can really optimize it for that Specific machine and a much less powerful machine can do a lot more stuff.

294
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:13,050
Speaker 1: so that's the reason that one thing that's really hurting PC gaming in the US is because You need a much more powerful machine because they can't optimize the software very much.

295
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,400
Speaker 1: Thus it's more expensive wouldn't?

296
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,810
Speaker 1: and they're putting out the same games for the 360.

297
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,105
Speaker 0: You wouldn't need a much more powerful machine.

298
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:23,469
Speaker 0: I mean look Team Fortress 2 looks amazing.

299
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,716
Speaker 0: Bioshock isn't?

300
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:28,613
Speaker 0: I mean it works pretty well, even if you turn the graphics down It still looks really great.

301
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:32,646
Speaker 0: Half-Life 2 looked amazing and those games require almost nothing of your cuz.

302
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:33,830
Speaker 1: these people are graphics nuts.

303
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,474
Speaker 1: That's the other thing.

304
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is the problem.

305
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:43,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, yeah I think the real indicator of how well PC gaming is doing is just that you'd think alright A good idea.

306
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:47,510
Speaker 0: Team Fortress 2 has been this anticipated game forever and you can get into the pre-order.

307
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:54,990
Speaker 0: So you imagine like all the hardcore PC gamers bought the orange box and are gonna play the Team Fortress 2 beta.

308
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,946
Speaker 0: There aren't that many Team Fortress 2 servers and there aren't that many people playing the game.

309
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,170
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary.

310
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only like they're only thousands of players and that's it thousands.

311
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway sells more than that.

312
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:13,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean back in the day Counter-thousands of players at a time, but I mean count and then counter-strike.

313
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:17,478
Speaker 1: God Counter-strike, we're talking tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.

314
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:17,799
Speaker 1: Of course.

315
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,462
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens after tomorrow, you know and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

316
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:25,829
Speaker 0: Yep orange box.

317
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:29,522
Speaker 1: As you're listening to this the orange box is probably available.

318
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:30,707
Speaker 1: Why don't you have it?

319
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:31,430
Speaker 1: buy it online?

320
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,865
Speaker 1: Don't buy the box in the store and those you have dial-up then buy the box in the store.

321
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:37,146
Speaker 0: if you have dial-up I don't know what to tell you.

322
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:46,765
Speaker 0: Yeah Things of the day.

323
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:48,070
Speaker 0: I gotta talk about it.

324
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,732
Speaker 0: You haven't seen it.

325
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:49,335
Speaker 0: Go watch it.

326
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:50,138
Speaker 0: Meet the demo.

327
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:50,760
Speaker 0: man is out.

328
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,606
Speaker 0: It's are really funny.

329
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:56,558
Speaker 1: I'm against rim doing this thing of the day because it's something everyone's probably already seen.

330
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,600
Speaker 0: who cares You know, I don't think everyone has and - there's nothing else on the internet funny.

331
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,359
Speaker 1: Well, I think the problem is you have internet connection to find out.

332
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:18,080
Speaker 0: yeah, that is also the problem because I was gonna look for something else but YouTube not going so well and wall Scott showed me Ignis solace and That's the first machinima for you know, Team Fortress 2 and it started out really cool.

333
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,406
Speaker 0: It went nowhere and was really disappointing.

334
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:22,131
Speaker 0: Nah, I was sad.

335
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,194
Speaker 0: Okay, it was.

336
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,100
Speaker 0: it could have been so great.

337
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,472
Speaker 1: There's no father Frank's best.

338
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:38,649
Speaker 0: Uh you know Dave and Joel talked about Bubblegum crisis and how they realized suddenly that while they thought they liked it in an ironic sense No, they like it in a real sense.

339
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:44,074
Speaker 0: when it comes to father Frank's best I do not like it in a non-ironic sense.

340
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:52,179
Speaker 0: It is not funny And only noteworthy because it was like the first machinima ever.

341
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,811
Speaker 1: The father Frank's best trailer is on YouTube.

342
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:58,700
Speaker 0: Really wonder if it's the original deal.

343
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:02,540
Speaker 1: I'm trying to find the real thing, you know, I've got it.

344
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,854
Speaker 0: I've got a hard drive with my original quake to install.

345
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,380
Speaker 0: that's been passed from peace here.

346
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:09,125
Speaker 1: Find a website that has it.

347
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:11,212
Speaker 1: Oh good Zara Thustra Studios.

348
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:11,894
Speaker 0: Yes, that's it.

349
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,759
Speaker 0: All right, I'll warn you all.

350
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:16,232
Speaker 0: Maybe I should just make father Frank's best my thing.

351
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,117
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying.

352
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:17,599
Speaker 1: You should do.

353
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,328
Speaker 0: I think I've already done that though.

354
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,214
Speaker 1: Well, let me find out the Internet's kind of working all right.

355
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,965
Speaker 0: Regardless if you can find a video of it or just get a hold of quake - and know how to install a mod for quake - which I'll warn you is not so trivial.

356
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:34,279
Speaker 0: then you can watch father Frank's best which is among the first machinima and you know what?

357
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,972
Speaker 1: It's That's the first FPS machinima.

358
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:38,516
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:41,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Still can't think of any before that that I knew of.

360
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:43,165
Speaker 1: No, me either.

361
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:49,334
Speaker 0: granted some people made some scary things in Sierra's the realm But I don't know if that was machinima or just cyber sex.

362
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:50,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what counts.

363
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,205
Speaker 1: Okay, check this out.

364
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:54,214
Speaker 1: We always rag on halo, right?

365
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:54,575
Speaker 1: Yeah.

366
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:55,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

367
00:24:55,861 --> 00:25:00,408
Speaker 0: I think the analogy for halo is very simply that the Renaissance This is pretty cool.

368
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:04,160
Speaker 1: when he came up with this the other day The Renaissance in Italy was a great thing.

369
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:08,238
Speaker 0: it was like the world had gone through this dark age and people had forgotten a lot of things.

370
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:16,603
Speaker 0: and then People started rediscovering this joy this wealth of knowledge and information and art and it was like it was Rome and Greece and all this Amazingness.

371
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:17,949
Speaker 1: and there's a dark age.

372
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:23,440
Speaker 1: and then people remembered what the good stuff They used to have before the Dark Age and they brought it back this revival.

373
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:38,959
Speaker 0: So Renaissance first-person shooters like halo are effectively the Renaissance of first-person shooters Except that it's like if the Renaissance happened like say in Britain But Rome was still there and they just like forgot it about it.

374
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:46,718
Speaker 0: We had this gold like FPS is made these leaps and bounds and were amazing and then they just kind of fell off the radar for a long time.

375
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,889
Speaker 0: and there were these experiences that us old FPS errs had.

376
00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:02,467
Speaker 0: and then you see that new gamers who have never played these old FPS's and don't realize the wealth of the Roman Empire that collapsed around them, even though it didn't really collapse It just kind of disappeared.

377
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:03,392
Speaker 1: It's still there.

378
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:11,140
Speaker 1: We still have all the tablets We're still in Rome and we're watching your Renaissance build itself up and we're still drinking until we vomit then drinking again.

379
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:12,246
Speaker 0: Oh, how quaint.

380
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,700
Speaker 0: they've discovered two-dimensional art yet again.

381
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:19,034
Speaker 0: Perhaps soon they will find music.

382
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:32,028
Speaker 0: Yep but Games like halo while the I mean They're kind of like a rebirth of these old games and they didn't really do anything new and I don't think they're really better Than a lot of much older FPS's.

383
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:44,718
Speaker 0: but at the same time all these kids play these games like halo and While they don't know the culture of the old FPS's they never went through all the things we run through and kind of had the collective society of FPS thing that we had.

384
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:49,317
Speaker 0: I Notice in Scott's video that he's gonna talk about in a second prove

385
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:50,040
Speaker 1: that

386
00:26:50,662 --> 00:27:06,579
Speaker 0: Some of these things much like arts in the Renaissance versus art in the ancient Greco-Roman world are Universal and even if they're destroyed humans tend to recreate the same great things over and over again and the cycle repeats and this video is just.

387
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:08,747
Speaker 0: It is the Renaissance of everything.

388
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:17,906
Speaker 0: that is great about FPS's and the fact that these kids are experiencing these things Without knowing just completely on their own in a vacuum Validates my childhood.

389
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:19,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think is back in the day.

390
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:21,500
Speaker 1: You'd play yourself a counter-strike, right?

391
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:21,963
Speaker 1: It'll be.

392
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:23,500
Speaker 1: some amazing thing would happen.

393
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:26,319
Speaker 0: No one would believe you either but there'd be legends about it.

394
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,089
Speaker 1: Like someone would throw a grenade and it would bounce some guy into a roof But he wouldn't die to have like a health left.

395
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 1: and then he'd like he take out his deagle Like turn around real quick and shoot randomly and get a headshot and the team would win.

396
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:52,317
Speaker 0: Like the one time when you're playing action quake 2 and it's 8 on 8 and your whole team dies and it's you versus the Whole enemy team and then something happens and somehow you suddenly you're breathing heavily.

397
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:56,576
Speaker 0: They're all dead You've won and everyone is typing WTF.

398
00:27:56,938 --> 00:28:01,380
Speaker 1: Yep You know a lot of when you play an FPS crazy shit likes to happen.

399
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,257
Speaker 1: That's just because the way the games work stuff goes on and people go.

400
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:05,840
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

401
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:24,168
Speaker 1: And Team fortress you could tell the people who designed it were trying Purposefully to capture that essence of FPSing where crazy stuff happens by making a game Where the game is the crazy stuff happening, but in halo like every other FPS Crazy stuff still happens.

402
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:31,858
Speaker 1: and this is a video of something particularly crazy happening in halo involving a guy a grenade and some jet of air.

403
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:35,050
Speaker 1: and They are really a really good video of it.

404
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,260
Speaker 0: I must say it it is it's perfect.

405
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:48,135
Speaker 1: It's kind of mean like never having played this game, but having played other FPS is I watch it and I go ah Just like that video where they were shooting vehicles into the sky.

406
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:49,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was that other.

407
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:51,441
Speaker 1: No, I think it was a thing that a long time ago I think

408
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:51,862
Speaker 0: it was

409
00:28:51,943 --> 00:29:01,939
Speaker 1: say they would you they had these shields in halo and I they basically they put a vehicle on the shield disable the shield then enable the shield and it would make the vehicle fly into the sky and was all crazy.

410
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:07,282
Speaker 0: and That is the same thing kind of that we used to do back in Counter-strike.

411
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:09,347
Speaker 0: that is that APC math.

412
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:18,414
Speaker 1: that is the same essence that is being captured in this video and that team fortress 2 tries to Recreate intentionally and that is why FPS is are awesome.

413
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,920
Speaker 1: Especially multiplayer FPS is yes.

414
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:26,268
Speaker 0: So for a lot of you say Oh rim and Scott you're so down on modern FPS is it's more that We're living in Rome.

415
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:33,033
Speaker 0: So we have no desire to go to you know, piss-filled Renaissance to bring back Rome where we've.

416
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:33,655
Speaker 1: we're there.

417
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:38,876
Speaker 0: We've been there for a long time We're not going anywhere and we really want a lot of you to come join us.

418
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:43,580
Speaker 1: because yeah Why are you hanging out trying to recreate what we already have at our offering?

419
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,944
Speaker 0: But at the same time I can't.

420
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:53,800
Speaker 0: I don't feel bad about games like halo because there are so many kids who never played these Old games and a lot of F computer FPS is are kind of hard to play and they're very inaccessible.

421
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,188
Speaker 1: Halo is very accessible.

422
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,160
Speaker 1: these kids get a hundred million dollars excess.

423
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:09,054
Speaker 0: These kids get those same experiences of like a LAN party But instead of having to go to a LAN party which back in the day was quite a feat They just bring their Xbox to a friend's house and plug them in with a special cable.

424
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:19,120
Speaker 1: and it's okay because all the people in Like Europe and other places in Korea where they don't have consoles so much or the you know Consoles are looked down upon or the release.

425
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,968
Speaker 1: I feel like my my crap.

426
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 0: my video game soul when I die is going to leave my body independent of the rest of me and go to South Korea and just possess some kid.

427
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,301
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz it.

428
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:38,388
Speaker 1: the mostly Northern Europe where they still have like the giant many thousand computer LAN parties or all they play is like modern FPS man, we should talk about LAN parties cuz they don't happen like they used to nope.

429
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah.

430
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:47,760
Speaker 0: so today against my Argument I think there's a lot to say and thus we can be done with it.

431
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,908
Speaker 0: We can close this chapter in our lives.

432
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,441
Speaker 1: rim wants to talk yet again about Team Fortress 2.

433
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:58,607
Speaker 0: well, we've been able to play it a bunch now and Things are starting to solidify.

434
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:01,660
Speaker 1: I'm starting to see exact and the final version comes out tomorrow.

435
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,696
Speaker 1: So I can't assume that the version we're playing is much different from the final version.

436
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:06,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing's gonna change.

437
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:15,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, maybe we did an episode about Team Fortress like through the years Talked about Team Fortress 2.

438
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:18,214
Speaker 0: a few times yeah, but always like as an aside or a tangent.

439
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:22,190
Speaker 0: and uh, I'm kind of worried about the longevity of the game.

440
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,651
Speaker 0: still and I think my main reason for that is that Anytime skilled players play against skilled players.

441
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,617
Speaker 0: The game is always a stalemate.

442
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:38,380
Speaker 0: always Anytime two teams are equal are competent in any like any level of competence the game just evolves to a perfect stalemate.

443
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:55,564
Speaker 1: I've noticed that pretty much if the other team does something smart Unless a whole bunch of people on my team are smart more, you know unless I have more smart people on my team than they have on their team, there's no way that I can get through their defense or Stop their offense.

444
00:31:55,764 --> 00:32:02,900
Speaker 1: it is at the same time if I people on my team are doing smart stuff and the other team is doing Stuff that's not so smart.

445
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:07,675
Speaker 1: I can't help but just capture the intelligence or capture the points or just dominate them.

446
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:09,340
Speaker 0: now that used to happen in old FPS.

447
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:23,260
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't say that like if if there were five planners like me and four friends from a clan We're on a team in a pub server somewhere in weapons factory that we wouldn't just dominate the ever-living Crap out of the other team because that that kind of thing happens.

448
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:33,211
Speaker 0: but in This game and Team Fortress 2 because the FPS skill cap is so low and I'm gonna say that again because while we said Oh, I feel like it's low.

449
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:45,726
Speaker 0: I There's no way to argue against it at this point It takes very little FPS skill to play anything but the sniper in Team Fortress 2 but surprisingly So few people have the skill.

450
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,812
Speaker 1: It's like it's pretty much a Boolean.

451
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:48,293
Speaker 1: It's either.

452
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:55,829
Speaker 1: it's not like quake where you could be like bad decent better awesome amazing super amazing.

453
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:57,433
Speaker 1: God fatality.

454
00:32:57,553 --> 00:33:05,533
Speaker 0: if you're an engineer you either are a Optimal or near-optimal engineer or you are a useless engineer pretty much.

455
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:15,665
Speaker 1: It's like there's a way to engineer Perfectly, it's like if you know the map and you know how to use the engineer you and your team doesn't have like an excess of engineers.

456
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,396
Speaker 0: you're usually your team's just smart at all.

457
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:19,324
Speaker 0: like 2-4 is an example.

458
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:40,577
Speaker 0: if say if you're playing like a six on six the absolute perfect defense There are two different places to put the century in the flag room and you kind of alternate so they can't predict every now And then you might move it and you have a pyro running around down there and between the engineer and the pyro Unless the entire enemy team attacks at once and no one comes to defend you which they would.

459
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,965
Speaker 0: if your team's smart You have a perfect defense.

460
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:43,586
Speaker 0: It's optimal.

461
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,328
Speaker 0: There's nothing better.

462
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:48,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the most skilled scout in the universe could not get through.

463
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,123
Speaker 1: What's he gonna do?

464
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:52,235
Speaker 1: the most skilled soldier in the universe could not get through.

465
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,500
Speaker 1: he's gonna get set on fire.

466
00:33:54,022 --> 00:34:03,226
Speaker 1: This is just the way the map is and as long as you're smart It doesn't think they really need to come in with something big and In full force to get through.

467
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:08,083
Speaker 1: and if in order to get through with something that big the rest of your team would have to Be completely incompetent?

468
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:20,188
Speaker 1: at the same time if you make with an awesome offense like let's say you come in with like You know you got two medics you got a heavy you got smart soldiers You got some scouts that know how to move.

469
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,000
Speaker 1: you know you got some snipers backing you up from far away.

470
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:29,768
Speaker 1: You can get across and into the enemy intelligence room You know plus like one or two spies that know what's going on.

471
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,333
Speaker 1: You'll get through every time.

472
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:36,898
Speaker 1: I mean as a scout alone Nine times out of ten I can get to the enemy intelligence room.

473
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:37,300
Speaker 1: granted

474
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:53,440
Speaker 0: The reason we were able to do that is because no one in this fucking game playing it except the planners from other old FPS is like this Understands probably one of the most important tactical I guess innovations in the history of warfare and that is called defense in depth.

475
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:57,190
Speaker 0: You don't put four centuries in the goddamn flag room.

476
00:34:57,491 --> 00:35:00,860
Speaker 0: you have a defensive perimeter and then an internal perimeter.

477
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:03,419
Speaker 0: Someone shouldn't be able to just get right to the flag room.

478
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:05,471
Speaker 0: There is a fight their way to the flag room.

479
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:08,839
Speaker 0: that way by the time they get to the flag room They're already weak, and you finish them off.

480
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,212
Speaker 1: Yeah There is a spot in the map because there's only two ways to get.

481
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:16,040
Speaker 1: there's only two entrances and exits to the basement.

482
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:29,679
Speaker 1: One of them is in the is in the the open-air area with the stairs and the wooden barn and the other place is Through like the main lobby of where you know all the guys usually typically spawn right right up at the front of the.

483
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,447
Speaker 1: you know Right behind the battlements right.

484
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:33,840
Speaker 1: and is that there's the spiral ramp.

485
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:40,340
Speaker 1: You can position a turret so that it can shoot at people going down the spiral ramp and going to the barn.

486
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 1: so if you put that there and you have one in the intelligence room and then you have Some people in the waterworks, maybe downstairs.

487
00:35:49,204 --> 00:35:50,214
Speaker 0: No one can get through.

488
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:50,760
Speaker 1: what is it?

489
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,763
Speaker 1: There's nothing they can do.

490
00:35:51,783 --> 00:36:03,400
Speaker 0: and what it basically breaks down to is that if everyone plays their classes well And Wells not I guess optimally because games like this all games break down when players all play optimally.

491
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,735
Speaker 0: That's why we always complain about a lot of German board games like.

492
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:06,360
Speaker 0: they're really fun.

493
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:15,709
Speaker 0: But once you know how to play optimally and everyone else playing knows how to play optimally the game's not fun because like settlers Of Catan, you don't know how the game works.

494
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:16,574
Speaker 1: You just learned it.

495
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:17,739
Speaker 1: You're new to games like this.

496
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,211
Speaker 1: You know you start playing.

497
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:20,300
Speaker 1: it's crazy fun.

498
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,936
Speaker 1: You're trading you're wheeling and dealing you're building your so it rolls seven and then everyone bribes.

499
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,866
Speaker 0: I'm like, please don't put it on me I'll give you sheep.

500
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:32,211
Speaker 1: Yep, then Once you realize how to play you learn everything.

501
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:34,920
Speaker 1: you're playing with three other people who know as much as you do.

502
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,307
Speaker 1: They're masters of the game.

503
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,296
Speaker 1: There's no decisions.

504
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:38,959
Speaker 1: It's not fun.

505
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:41,490
Speaker 1: It comes down to who rolls the dice now in.

506
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:50,524
Speaker 0: what the dice say in more complex FPS is now again I'm not gonna say that those old complex team fortress solid games were better because that is not a road I want to go down.

507
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:54,664
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna pretend those games were better in any objective sense Yeah, but what they were?

508
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:56,570
Speaker 1: in many ways they were far worse.

509
00:36:56,671 --> 00:37:07,946
Speaker 0: Yes, God, but what they were is There was a much larger skill component of players and tactics mattered a lot but Individual skill mattered.

510
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:13,307
Speaker 0: you could not play the engineer Optimally in those games.

511
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:29,603
Speaker 1: you could not play the optimal recon like there was a theoretical Like you knew the theoretical limits of what could be done with say the engineer you do what he was capable of humans I actually execute that with your mouse and keyboard was so incredibly difficult.

512
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:37,325
Speaker 0: like the number of people who played near optimally in games like that were few and far between and those people were the Fatalities of their day.

513
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:39,813
Speaker 0: Those people were gods among FPS men.

514
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:49,120
Speaker 1: It's like reflexes and aiming and Button pushing and twitching and and you know aim all that sort of stuff mattered a lot.

515
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:58,248
Speaker 1: so even if you pick the right class you picked medic and you knew exactly how to use a medic for the best way possible and You try to do that with all your might.

516
00:37:58,269 --> 00:37:59,655
Speaker 1: you said we need a medic.

517
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:00,840
Speaker 1: our team needs a medic.

518
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,784
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be that medic.

519
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,060
Speaker 1: the medic needs to heal that guy and needs to do this and needs to do that.

520
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:14,165
Speaker 1: You know everything that needs to be done But it's incredibly difficult to actually execute that and if you don't do it just right the other team is.

521
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:24,280
Speaker 1: there's gonna be a weakness and you're gonna get hit in team fortress 2. if You have any level of skill at all, you know, you can aim in the general direction of the bad guys.

522
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,785
Speaker 1: You know how to detect a spy.

523
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:26,890
Speaker 1: you have basic skills.

524
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,576
Speaker 1: you read the little hints.

525
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:32,454
Speaker 1: the game tells you You don't need such a high level of skill.

526
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:33,420
Speaker 1: You just pick the medic.

527
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,766
Speaker 1: you know what to do with the medic.

528
00:38:34,786 --> 00:38:37,679
Speaker 1: you go you do it and that's the best that could be done.

529
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:46,080
Speaker 1: and there isn't really gonna be a weakness and Someone else being slightly better than you isn't gonna make a difference unless they figure out what needs to be done.

530
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,640
Speaker 0: You know, there are pros and cons to this.

531
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,035
Speaker 0: I mean it does make the game more team based and more tactics strategy based and a lot less.

532
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:53,600
Speaker 0: you can't lone wolf it.

533
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:56,060
Speaker 0: Well, you can because most people aren't good at this game yet.

534
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,240
Speaker 1: But yeah, if I'm on a server full of dumb people I can just take the scout and win take the soldier and win.

535
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:01,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really.

536
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:07,814
Speaker 0: Mostly if one of us joins the server Unless like there's other good people playing which this is about a 50/50 shot.

537
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:18,340
Speaker 0: if there aren't other good people on the server I'll literally just pick a team and just look at him like just decide All right I'm gonna win the game right now and I'll just go over and capture three times or I'll just go get the point.

538
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:22,173
Speaker 1: Pretty much when I join a game the game is either in a situation.

539
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:24,039
Speaker 1: I join a random team pretty much every time.

540
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:40,085
Speaker 1: I always be in a situation Where I could just like capture capture capture on my own and just destroy the other team single-handedly or with a little bit of help Or it'll be in a situation where my team is so dumb that no matter what I do is completely hopeless And there's nothing I can.

541
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:40,427
Speaker 1: I once

542
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:58,086
Speaker 0: got into a base that was like almost Optimally defended and they're actually pretty good about spies but I got in and I bit by bit kept getting in and inching the intelligence out and Finally, I got the intelligence to the top of the battlements and they were sitting there and I was yelling into the microphone And typing everyone go scout.

543
00:39:58,287 --> 00:39:59,611
Speaker 0: We only need one cap to win.

544
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:00,855
Speaker 0: It's sitting in the battlement.

545
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:04,927
Speaker 0: if you all just run we win Automatically, there's nothing they can do to stop us.

546
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:09,543
Speaker 0: if we're all scouts just go and no one did it and the intelligence went back To their base.

547
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,277
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's just that.

548
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:20,272
Speaker 0: see that's the thing A lot of people don't see the the final fatal flaw of Team Fortress and I don't want I'm trying not to sound like oh we're so good because we're not.

549
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,105
Speaker 0: the thing is a lot of people are Just not.

550
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:26,639
Speaker 0: they're not experienced with games like this So they're not super good at it yet.

551
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:32,460
Speaker 0: But I think as time goes on a lot of players are going to play their classes optimally because it's not hard to do.

552
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:35,380
Speaker 0: I think the sniper requires the most FPS skill of any.

553
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, the sniper you actually have to aim and you can miss.

554
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:44,390
Speaker 0: and sadly I have met one Optimal sniper in the course of my play.

555
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,193
Speaker 0: I met a couple.

556
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:59,620
Speaker 1: I didn't actually meet them But basically I was trying to scout which is the smallest and fastest guy So supposedly also the hardest to hit and I maneuvered all over the place as much as I could Attempting to cross the field and I knew there was a sniper there.

557
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,960
Speaker 1: I knew he was there and I was trying to avoid him to the best of my ability and he shot me dead every time.

558
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:13,380
Speaker 0: Now I'd always avoided playing sniper in this partly because in all the other games like this It was really hard to be the sniper like really hard and I was never good at it.

559
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,455
Speaker 1: I've been also sort of boring because I like to move around the map.

560
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,560
Speaker 1: I like to make stuff happen.

561
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,719
Speaker 1: I like to see what's going on.

562
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,925
Speaker 1: See I like it a sniper.

563
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:24,243
Speaker 1: you tend to stay in one spot and you tend to do a lot of waiting for people to Come by see.

564
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:25,951
Speaker 0: my role was always in the in.

565
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,136
Speaker 0: the play was in any out.

566
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:46,745
Speaker 0: like previous games I was always kind of the defensive coordinator guy like I'd be defensive and I would constantly just be reporting to the team on what the defensive situation is and what's going on and be like enemy nurse spotted at the spiral staircase enemy spy disguised as demo man spotted at the blah and just you know on top of Defense and all that.

567
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:48,395
Speaker 0: and I like being the defensive dude.

568
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:57,668
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I also like, you know when you're about to cap suddenly all the defense goes offense to make sure you finish the cap And then you all go back to defense and all that stuff.

569
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,260
Speaker 0: But in this game, it's really kind of boring.

570
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:01,505
Speaker 0: I've so many games.

571
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:14,860
Speaker 0: I'll set up my century and No one can cap and even though my team's not defending at all because my team's full of idiots People just keep coming down and dying on that century and spies keep coming down and I guess they get surprised when I shoot them.

572
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:22,459
Speaker 0: and oh actually Probably the best moment in Team Fortress 2 happened to me not too long ago.

573
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:28,380
Speaker 0: I was playing on a server full of super nubs and it was like four on four.

574
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:30,460
Speaker 0: So it's just like it's a fun easygoing game.

575
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,240
Speaker 0: I figure I'll just go defense and kind of practice and figure out where the optimal century spots are and I'll just let the teams Do whatever they want.

576
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:43,100
Speaker 0: I don't care if we win But I'm not gonna let anyone cap and I set up my century and then I get bored with that.

577
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:53,229
Speaker 0: So I go pyro and I'm sitting in the flag room and someone decides to go engineer and he builds a century in a stupid spot and I'm like Build it where I'm standing instead pointed direction.

578
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:58,800
Speaker 0: I'm facing he's like why and I explained he's like, oh, okay He obviously was a nub, but he was respectful of his elder.

579
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:10,700
Speaker 0: So he sets it up and we're sitting there and I run away to do something and I change classes and I come back and I Change classes and I come back again as a pyro and he doesn't shoot at me when I walk in the room.

580
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:15,700
Speaker 0: So I just kind of walk over to the century gun and stand in front of it and he just kind of looks at me.

581
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:19,995
Speaker 0: So I walk over to him and I say you dumbass you should have shot me.

582
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:20,618
Speaker 0: and he's like what?

583
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:20,959
Speaker 0: why?

584
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:22,209
Speaker 0: and I was like I might have been a spy.

585
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,848
Speaker 0: and he's like I Didn't think about that.

586
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:29,319
Speaker 0: and I'm like you should always shoot Anyone who ever walks into this room?

587
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:37,031
Speaker 0: Even if I've been a pyro for an hour and I've walked into this room every five minutes You should shoot every pyro that walks into the room no matter what.

588
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:37,714
Speaker 1: Yep.

589
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:53,060
Speaker 1: You should if you're an engineer Even if some guy what spawns at the same time you spawn and he walks out of the the Spawning room the supply room the same time as you walk out of the supply room and he doesn't leave your sight at all.

590
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,208
Speaker 1: You see your cat your eye on him the whole time.

591
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,919
Speaker 1: if you build a sentry and then he walks near it shoot him.

592
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,446
Speaker 1: Ammo is free.

593
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,019
Speaker 1: spies killing your turrets are not free.

594
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:10,800
Speaker 0: But uh, and while I'm saying this he says to me cuz in the typing team chat, that's crap you're just being paranoid.

595
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,007
Speaker 0: That's a really stupid way to.

596
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:15,325
Speaker 0: and while he's typing that at me He's typed a couple lines.

597
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:16,551
Speaker 1: a medic

598
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:34,149
Speaker 0: walks up behind him A medic on our team and I'm a pyro so I just flamethrower yep, and the guy catches on fire and starts to run away and he turns around and sees the spy fall over on fire and Then he says, okay, I'll shoot anyone who walks in.

599
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,012
Speaker 1: That's right.

600
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:36,096
Speaker 0: And it was just.

601
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:37,340
Speaker 0: it was so perfect.

602
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,100
Speaker 0: I couldn't have paid someone enough money to be a spy and walk in at that moment.

603
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:42,925
Speaker 1: Nope, but they did.

604
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,269
Speaker 0: but I gotta say something.

605
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,893
Speaker 0: I'm a really good spy.

606
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:48,260
Speaker 0: like spying is really fun and I like doing it.

607
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was an okay spy.

608
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,880
Speaker 1: like other spy like I can't be fooled by a spy.

609
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,225
Speaker 1: I've never been fooled by a spy.

610
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:58,300
Speaker 1: everyone's spies have killed me like I'm walking down a hallway.

611
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:00,890
Speaker 1: They come up behind me cloaked and then they stabbed me.

612
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,295
Speaker 1: They didn't fool me.

613
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:03,500
Speaker 1: They just got me.

614
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,809
Speaker 1: There's a difference between fooling and getting.

615
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,175
Speaker 1: you know fooling would be.

616
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:10,667
Speaker 1: I'm standing there A soldier on my team is standing there.

617
00:45:10,968 --> 00:45:12,734
Speaker 1: then he destroys my turret and sabs me.

618
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:14,099
Speaker 1: that's fooling me, right?

619
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:20,380
Speaker 1: Also, you know if I sometimes they don't fool me I see them I start shooting them, but then they kill me first.

620
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:21,579
Speaker 1: That's not fooling me.

621
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:27,700
Speaker 0: That's getting me usually because you have low health already from a previous encounter something like that, but they've never fooled me.

622
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,423
Speaker 1: I've never said.

623
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,370
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not a spy.

624
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,072
Speaker 1: and then it is.

625
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:44,306
Speaker 0: I once spent an entire game Basically guarding the enemy intelligence quote-unquote as an enemy pyro and I just sat in their flag room and people would walk in and look and be like Oh someone's defending it and walk away.

626
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:47,960
Speaker 0: and I had an engineer there with a century and I never destroyed a century.

627
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:57,440
Speaker 0: I just sat there and sat there and every time the team was like it's time to cap I would just kind of do something to make sure they capped and then I'd come back as no one ever suspected me.

628
00:45:57,741 --> 00:46:02,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, what seems like when I play a spy like I was having a little bit trouble at first Cuz what I was doing us.

629
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:06,282
Speaker 1: I was cloaking going across to their base then Disguising.

630
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:10,497
Speaker 1: then rim said, you know, you can disguise then cloak and I was like, oh, yeah.

631
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:11,440
Speaker 0: Oh, that's big.

632
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:12,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, that helped me out a lot.

633
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,040
Speaker 0: The only the inside I had it took till over the scene wasn't any amount of skill.

634
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,127
Speaker 1: It was knowledge that helped me out.

635
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:20,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was doing everything right.

636
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:23,303
Speaker 1: I can manipulate the spy to do everything He can do.

637
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:26,320
Speaker 1: it was just the knowing once I know I'm perfect.

638
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:37,640
Speaker 0: The only thing I did and I knew this but it took me a while to force myself to do it was when I'm spying Once I have revealed myself or been caught like once they're like people like realize and start shooting at me.

639
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:41,560
Speaker 0: I always tended to stand my ground and try to kill a couple more people and then die.

640
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:46,968
Speaker 0: That's what I do - what I realized is if I just cloak and run away They won't find me.

641
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,859
Speaker 0: and now I'm still in their base.

642
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:55,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing is like I use the cloak as a device to get across the open battlefield.

643
00:46:55,381 --> 00:47:03,020
Speaker 1: You know cuz on the open battlefield, right even if I'm disguised as the enemy team They see someone running out of our base and into there.

644
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,954
Speaker 0: Well, no more importantly they should be shooting everyone.

645
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:11,699
Speaker 0: they see always spies Cannot work in this game unless people don't know how to play Yep.

646
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 1: So the only thing I can do to get from my battlefield to from my base to their base where it disguised as effective in Their base at least effective against stupid people is by cloaking.

647
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:29,083
Speaker 1: So I'd use the cloak to cross from one base to the other but from then on I would rely on the disguise and I Wouldn't cloak again.

648
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:34,060
Speaker 1: And what I realized I got to do is I gotta like be disguised stab someone in the back and cloak.

649
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:35,566
Speaker 1: That's what I got to do.

650
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,720
Speaker 1: Yep, and I just know I just gotta remember to do it.

651
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,704
Speaker 1: It's not that I can't do it.

652
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:41,935
Speaker 1: It's it's the it's the knowing the knowledge.

653
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,583
Speaker 0: I Guess it's just.

654
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:48,660
Speaker 0: I really like the game and everything's great about it But more and more like the skill is capping out.

655
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,843
Speaker 1: I think I imagine if it was like 10 on 10 and 10 amazing players for his 10 amazing players They were all coordinated.

656
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:57,968
Speaker 1: I think it'd be a stalemate forever.

657
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:02,240
Speaker 1: And you know happens if there's a stalemate even the uncoordinated games are stalemate.

658
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,324
Speaker 0: All right, I gotta say this too.

659
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:06,195
Speaker 0: when we first started playing this I the sudden death.

660
00:48:06,336 --> 00:48:07,440
Speaker 0: I thought it was a cool idea.

661
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:11,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the problem with a lot of these games in the past was that they would go on forever.

662
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:14,855
Speaker 1: It's like you'd play and play and play for hours and hours and hours.

663
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:17,611
Speaker 1: No, we capture the flag Or no one would get a lead and nobody read.

664
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,080
Speaker 1: thing is wetting wouldn't go anywhere.

665
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:29,208
Speaker 0: So a lot of the games would set it where there'd be like a one or two hour Usually a one hour time limit on a mat and it would be if no one won by the end Whoever had the most points won.

666
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:31,921
Speaker 0: and usually you got like I think weapons factory It was.

667
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:35,700
Speaker 0: you got ten points per player per flag cap.

668
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:44,166
Speaker 0: So if you had ten players a flag cover with a hundred points and each player got an additional point every time they killed an Enemy so theoretically killing

669
00:48:44,206 --> 00:48:49,703
Speaker 1: games or it's like you get like a hundred points for capturing the flag and like one point for touching The flag.

670
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, just anything to break up little ties and just whoever has the most point of the end wins.

671
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,540
Speaker 0: But sudden death could have been cool except one sudden death has a time limit.

672
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:10,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like and to sudden death is just game theory ruined sudden death And I tried in three separate games to try to explain this concept of people But no one got it.

673
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:19,160
Speaker 1: in any sudden death situation and there's a sudden death is where okay Whoever gets the next point wins and no one can respawn.

674
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,907
Speaker 1: There's no respawning.

675
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,975
Speaker 1: So if you die, you're dead like counter-strike now.

676
00:49:23,477 --> 00:49:31,720
Speaker 0: in that case Game theory wise you have no option but to camp and defend and never go on the offensive.

677
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:32,543
Speaker 1: yeah, get it.

678
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:44,984
Speaker 1: hopefully you switch to engineers and medics and heavies and those sorts of things and Snipers possibly maybe even spies and you just sit there and wait for the enemy to come to you and die on your ultimate Defense

679
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:45,670
Speaker 0: because

680
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:51,616
Speaker 1: soon as enough of them die You can all go over on the offense and beat the one or two guys left in easily.

681
00:49:51,897 --> 00:50:02,720
Speaker 0: because in this game defense is king generally and a 100% defense cannot be broken by 100% offense no matter what is even with moderately skilled players.

682
00:50:03,162 --> 00:50:05,510
Speaker 1: So think of this unless your defense is all scouts.

683
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,240
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a Team Fortress equivalent of Pascal's Wager.

684
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:13,700
Speaker 0: Forget the fact that Pascal's Wager was completely fallacious is completely fallacious.

685
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,272
Speaker 0: Yes, well is and was it's complete garbage and it's been disproven like a thousand different ways.

686
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:22,484
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the matrix of What happens.

687
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:28,385
Speaker 0: let's say I camp my team camps and the enemy team camps stalemate Alright stalemate.

688
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:29,631
Speaker 0: everyone loses.

689
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:33,047
Speaker 0: the game tries to make a point like yes You're all losers, but you know what?

690
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,540
Speaker 0: I tied the other team even though I lost.

691
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:39,680
Speaker 1: I'd rather everyone be losers than my team be losers and the other team be winners.

692
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:44,340
Speaker 0: Yes Because the net gain or the net law the net loss is less the net gain is more.

693
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:46,687
Speaker 0: You're better off being the same as your enemy.

694
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:52,633
Speaker 1: if that was like a tournament at the CPL for a cash prize or something That wouldn't be too bad.

695
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:56,347
Speaker 1: If we were all losers I'd rather have it that way than the other guys get the prize and I don't.

696
00:50:56,768 --> 00:50:56,929
Speaker 0: now.

697
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:03,889
Speaker 0: it's very Best-case scenario you win.

698
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,238
Speaker 0: worst-case scenario you tie.

699
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,968
Speaker 1: now Let's why why would you ever go on office?

700
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:13,063
Speaker 0: because office now you have a much less chance of winning Especially if they camp.

701
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:14,287
Speaker 0: it's the prisoners dilemma there.

702
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:18,863
Speaker 0: if you now your matrix is best-case scenario We win.

703
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:20,270
Speaker 0: worst-case scenario.

704
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,320
Speaker 0: It's not we tie it's we lose.

705
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:23,999
Speaker 1: So why would you do that?

706
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,922
Speaker 1: You've increased the chance even if you're all gods of Team Fortress 2.

707
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:35,085
Speaker 1: The only way that full-on offense is gonna work is if at least part of the other team is stupid and significant part of the other team.

708
00:51:35,186 --> 00:51:41,870
Speaker 0: as a result if you have intelligent players leading teams The prisoners dilemma tragedy the comments all those fun things.

709
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:46,707
Speaker 0: All they really mean is smart players will never attack another thing.

710
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:53,352
Speaker 1: if you're doing capture the flag, right and Someone else like your team has one flag capture, right?

711
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,720
Speaker 1: Let's say I capture the intelligence now, it's one nothing.

712
00:51:56,424 --> 00:51:57,831
Speaker 1: Why should we defend anymore?

713
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,118
Speaker 1: There's no reason to defend.

714
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:01,387
Speaker 0: Yes I can't explain this to people either.

715
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:07,612
Speaker 0: so many games go by where you have to get three caps to win and We've got two caps and the enemy team has none.

716
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:15,880
Speaker 0: or even if you're up by one If your team just goes a hundred percent offense, the odds are the enemy team is not also going to go a hundred percent defense.

717
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:23,995
Speaker 0: Even if they start capping you're gonna cap faster As long as you're using scouts to capture the Intel.

718
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:38,520
Speaker 0: or or You leave one engineer behind or at most one engineer in one pyro because the one engineer staying behind Prevents the empty net goal, but at the same time who cares if they cap as long as you can't you?

719
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:44,520
Speaker 1: It's like it's like when you're playing ice hockey, you know, and you take the goalie out because you need one more goal.

720
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:48,656
Speaker 1: So you take the goalie out and you have six guys on the ice trying to score and you.

721
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:49,520
Speaker 1: so it mostly works.

722
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,108
Speaker 1: It's the reason they do that you take down your defense.

723
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:55,900
Speaker 1: because why if you need three caps to win, right?

724
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,013
Speaker 1: And it takes let's say a minute to capture the flag right at going with a scout.

725
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,340
Speaker 1: You have one cap and they have zero.

726
00:53:02,982 --> 00:53:05,208
Speaker 1: Okay, fuck our defense full offense.

727
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:08,217
Speaker 1: We can even if we let them capture the flag.

728
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:09,280
Speaker 1: We'd let them just get it.

729
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,564
Speaker 1: No defense whatsoever.

730
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:13,775
Speaker 0: Plus they're not just gonna get it because yet you have the one.

731
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:17,193
Speaker 0: they have to get back into their base Where your guys are fucking them up anyway.

732
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:21,040
Speaker 1: Yep, so They get two caps in the same time.

733
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,534
Speaker 1: It takes you to get two caps and you win three to two.

734
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:25,216
Speaker 1: you in.

735
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:27,968
Speaker 0: now see In in FPS.

736
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:37,811
Speaker 0: is that require a lot more pure FPS skill Which again not good or bad because they definitely tried to limit the amount of raw Kind of silly FPS skill this game required.

737
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:44,554
Speaker 0: you end up with situations like that Instead of situations of the people who are better at the game tend to do better.

738
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:46,320
Speaker 1: you do end up see but that's his thing.

739
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,730
Speaker 1: Let's say play the same scenario out, but only skill matters, right?

740
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:51,936
Speaker 1: Okay, we're up by one.

741
00:53:52,137 --> 00:53:53,260
Speaker 1: Let's go on full offense.

742
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:59,699
Speaker 1: Okay Well, we would have gotten two caps and they would have gotten two caps meaning a final score of three to two.

743
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:13,120
Speaker 1: but Joe on our team wasn't as good at you know, Shooting his rocket and aiming it as Mike on their team and Joe died Even though Joe had the better knowledge and strategy and he was doing everything right.

744
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:14,508
Speaker 1: He just he was just slower.

745
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:21,556
Speaker 0: or Baldwin on the enemy team was a Preter naturally amazing optimal scout and he just kept a bunch of times.

746
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:22,620
Speaker 0: cuz he's so awesome.

747
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:31,590
Speaker 1: Yeah He learned to like amazing tricks had like cap so quickly and destroy engineers on his own with his skill Which things that normally couldn't be done.

748
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,500
Speaker 1: He achieved feats of amazingness.

749
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,874
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's the thing is there's no feats of amazingness in Team Fortress 2.

750
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,960
Speaker 1: It's your class has a limit.

751
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:41,540
Speaker 1: That's the best it can do.

752
00:54:42,624 --> 00:54:43,840
Speaker 1: Cannot take it any higher.

753
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:54,220
Speaker 1: The only time you will accomplish something amazing is when the other team is incompetent or if your team Works together in such an amazing way, but even then that will only work if the other team is a cop.

754
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,382
Speaker 0: I mean one time I was playing a weapons factory and I saw like.

755
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:07,853
Speaker 0: I went in on a suicide mission to take out a bunch of sentries and I somehow got the flag and I kept and The whole server was like what the fuck.

756
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:09,400
Speaker 0: and it wasn't skill.

757
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,753
Speaker 0: It was mostly like this crazy fluke where I just happened to get out.

758
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,560
Speaker 0: I can't pretend that I was that good.

759
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:19,325
Speaker 0: it was just like this crazy fluke of a thing and Like everyone's like wow.

760
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:20,709
Speaker 0: Damn one in a million.

761
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:25,804
Speaker 0: and in Team Fortress 2 things like that don't happen Nope ever.

762
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:27,028
Speaker 0: It's not like one in a million.

763
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:27,690
Speaker 0: It's like one in.

764
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:32,068
Speaker 1: they designed the game so well that it's too Perfect.

765
00:55:32,089 --> 00:55:33,782
Speaker 1: There's no Like.

766
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:34,746
Speaker 1: there's no loopholes.

767
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:35,992
Speaker 1: There's no there's no nothing.

768
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:37,538
Speaker 1: It's exactly as they wanted it.

769
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:42,140
Speaker 0: They've been making little game fixes like they made the pyro stronger.

770
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:49,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, the pyro is kind of useless because like you'd set people on fire But then they'd live long enough that so where they kill still kill the pyro.

771
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:51,120
Speaker 1: so they made his flamethrower more powerful.

772
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:52,430
Speaker 1: So now I think it disintegrates.

773
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:56,660
Speaker 0: be I think in a recent update They made the Rockets from the marine a little bit more damaging.

774
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,666
Speaker 0: I'm not sure exactly if they did or not, but I think that yeah, that was always the one thing I think they need to.

775
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:06,271
Speaker 1: that sort of annoying in the game is The pushback from getting hit by the turrets.

776
00:56:06,774 --> 00:56:08,140
Speaker 1: like but I'm a scout.

777
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:11,140
Speaker 1: Sometimes someone will put their turret in a narrow hallway, right?

778
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,559
Speaker 1: And all I want to do is run through the hallway perpendicular to the turret real fast.

779
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:19,833
Speaker 1: But what happens is I I'm willing to take the damage.

780
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:20,375
Speaker 0: No Scott.

781
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:23,784
Speaker 0: The thing is I can I can answer the Pushes me back.

782
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:24,627
Speaker 0: It pushes you.

783
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,093
Speaker 0: they did that on purpose.

784
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,177
Speaker 1: I know it's it's no.

785
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:28,826
Speaker 0: very specifically I agree with them.

786
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:34,379
Speaker 0: once I saw the rationale they decided, you know It's really hard to figure out how strong to make something like a century in a game like this.

787
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:37,780
Speaker 0: Because with AI like I used to mod stuff for doom, right?

788
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:45,773
Speaker 0: I could make an enemy that always hit you no matter what and I could make a century that always hit you no matter what And it invented damage or whatever.

789
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:57,090
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm What they did is they decided that they would make the centuries boolean in that if a century You come into a century's line of fire If you do not immediately take cover.

790
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 0: no matter what class you are you will die.

791
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:00,824
Speaker 0: It is a Boolean.

792
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:05,340
Speaker 0: you either will die or won't and you dying is dependent solely upon whether or not you take cover.

793
00:57:06,102 --> 00:57:16,611
Speaker 0: Now if you are able to take cover and there is no one attending the century like an engineer or a pyro Then you will always Boolean be able to destroy that century.

794
00:57:16,872 --> 00:57:23,198
Speaker 0: because you are able to take cover You will be able to trick it somehow and like around the corner rocket around the corner rocket.

795
00:57:23,418 --> 00:57:28,280
Speaker 1: Yeah I've killed centuries with the scout and a pistol by going and shoot.

796
00:57:28,762 --> 00:57:30,448
Speaker 0: She how many centuries I've sniped.

797
00:57:30,508 --> 00:57:33,620
Speaker 0: because people just don't realize that the sniper can take out a century in one eight.

798
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,184
Speaker 1: Yeah I was the scout.

799
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:39,801
Speaker 1: someone built a century at the top of their battlements and I was on the other battlements and I was a Scout.

800
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:47,023
Speaker 1: so I took out the pistol and I shot across the entire fort a whole bunch of times and it blew it up With the pistol.

801
00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:48,509
Speaker 1: Hey, what'd I do?

802
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,155
Speaker 1: It's alright doesn't shoot that far.

803
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:51,540
Speaker 0: I think we've ran it enough.

804
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:57,888
Speaker 0: The only other thing I wanted to say this just because I learned about it recently But the arts style.

805
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:03,030
Speaker 0: in Team Fortress 2 we commented a lot about how awesome it is Because it is really awesome.

806
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:09,900
Speaker 0: Like it fits this game So perfectly well and all the characters just look so great and so stylized and blah blah blah blah.

807
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:19,007
Speaker 0: The art for the game is actually based on the art of a turn-of-the-century Artist named JC Lane Decker.

808
00:58:19,027 --> 00:58:20,331
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?

809
00:58:20,732 --> 00:58:22,838
Speaker 0: L-e-y-e-n-d-e-c-k-e-r.

810
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:25,039
Speaker 0: Say that slower Lane Decker.

811
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:27,194
Speaker 1: I'll just try to figure it out.

812
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:30,000
Speaker 0: Len Decker I'll link to it or something.

813
00:58:30,201 --> 00:58:31,224
Speaker 0: You know what also.

814
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:36,259
Speaker 0: I want to say this because I don't think many people noticed it in the main screen routine fortress, too.

815
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:38,849
Speaker 0: There's a. there's a bunch of options there.

816
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:40,917
Speaker 0: And one of them is a developer commentary.

817
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:44,270
Speaker 0: I Recommend you click on that and do what it says.

818
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,619
Speaker 0: You'll probably learn a lot about the game.

819
00:58:47,922 --> 00:58:48,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got.

820
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:50,940
Speaker 1: I never actually watched those commentary things, but it's cool.

821
00:58:51,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Speaker 0: You walk around and there's like stuff like there's a room where there's two Spies stand in there red one in a blue one and there's dialog boxes all over the place.

822
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:09,079
Speaker 0: And if you shoot a dialog box that dialog box starts talking and player models near you Will act out the relevant things to show you what the developers are talking about.

823
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:18,559
Speaker 1: It's really really hot and you'll learn a lot about the game Commentary for like half-life 2 and I think half-life 2 episode 1 I just never watched him or listened to him and then maybe I should.

824
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:25,660
Speaker 0: Right and on that note Partly the reason I wanted to do this episode is to get all this team fortress to talk out of my system.

825
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,800
Speaker 0: So we stopped bringing it up all the time randomly.

826
00:59:28,363 --> 00:59:32,120
Speaker 1: I. well I didn't want to do the do it because we I think we talked about enough already.

827
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,910
Speaker 1: But well rim might talk about more time.

828
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,453
Speaker 1: So we did.

829
00:59:34,473 --> 00:59:35,580
