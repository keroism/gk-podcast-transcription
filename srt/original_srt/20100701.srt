1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,846
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, July 1st.

2
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:11,410
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,479
Speaker 1: I'm Rynn.

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,857
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:18,830
Speaker 1: Tonight, non-Legos.

6
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,208
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,070
Speaker 0: So Scott, you want to start with the fireworks or the bed wedding?

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,587
Speaker 1: Why did you?

9
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,309
Speaker 0: If you weren't going to say it, I was going to say it.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,430
Speaker 0: I mean, our listeners, they don't get the five seconds before I hit record.

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,140
Speaker 1: They're not supposed to.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,250
Speaker 1: That's why it's before.

13
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:43,481
Speaker 1: We have to come before.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:43,622
Speaker 1: Anyway.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,489
Speaker 0: That's what your mom said.

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,690
Speaker 1: So I'm laying in this bed doing the show or getting ready to do the show.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,430
Speaker 0: And now I got to take the futon out.

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:59,190
Speaker 1: Now the bed's wet because I had a water bottle with water and some of it dripped out onto the bed.

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,283
Speaker 0: I call mine the young master water bottle.

20
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:03,810
Speaker 0: That's not water.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,676
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a euphemism.

22
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:06,358
Speaker 1: It's literally.

23
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:09,549
Speaker 1: I had the water bottle with actual water in it.

24
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,509
Speaker 1: And it, you know, when I was done drinking, I fell over it.

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,707
Speaker 0: So apparently there were fireworks last night.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,712
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

27
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:21,548
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting in my bedroom working on something, which is actually getting scarily close to reality.

28
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:27,427
Speaker 1: It's actually the first thing I've done that might make money.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,990
Speaker 1: It'll make at least a dollar and has a potential of infinity dollars, as does everything.

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,669
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which thing you're talking about.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it doesn't involve you at all.

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,816
Speaker 0: At all?

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,530
Speaker 1: Really?

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

35
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,670
Speaker 0: So it's not a Dorf or anything?

36
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,029
Speaker 0: No.

37
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,428
Speaker 1: It's basically the only thing delaying the return of Dorf.

38
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:46,690
Speaker 1: Anyway.

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,356
Speaker 0: That's fine.

40
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,170
Speaker 0: We got to make that video.

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,905
Speaker 1: So I'm working and I'm actually on a roll.

42
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:50,430
Speaker 1: Right.

43
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,990
Speaker 1: And suddenly I hear this noise outside and it sounds like some jerk is like revving his fucking engine.

44
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,377
Speaker 1: I don't have an alley.

45
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,310
Speaker 1: You know, it's actually a road, but it's not.

46
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,308
Speaker 1: It's a less main road, which is why it's a road and not a street.

47
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,590
Speaker 1: Right.

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,863
Speaker 1: If it's a street, that's like a street.

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,673
Speaker 0: Well, that depends on where.

50
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,770
Speaker 0: I mean, right here we got streets, avenues, roads, lanes, and they all have the same numbers.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,372
Speaker 1: Yeah.

52
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,168
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

53
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,741
Speaker 0: It literally goes 44th road, 44th street, 44th avenue.

54
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,110
Speaker 1: Well, the streets in Queens, at least in our area of Queens, the streets go up and down and they're real important.

55
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:26,528
Speaker 1: The avenues go east and west over here, which is the opposite of Manhattan.

56
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:26,910
Speaker 1: Right.

57
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,394
Speaker 1: And they're still pretty important.

58
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:36,770
Speaker 1: And the roads also go east and west, but they're in between the avenues and they're less, they're less important than the, uh, than the avenues are.

59
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,050
Speaker 1: So the road behind my, you know.

60
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what about, cause Verde or Northern Boulevard is like the biggest road right here.

61
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,549
Speaker 1: That's a little out though.

62
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,309
Speaker 0: That's a Boulevard.

63
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,131
Speaker 1: Yeah.

64
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,516
Speaker 1: Boulevard, boulevards are serious.

65
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,222
Speaker 1: Anything that's different is serious business.

66
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,370
Speaker 1: Like Union Turnpike, serious business.

67
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,803
Speaker 1: Cause it's not, you know, it's a Turnpike.

68
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,788
Speaker 1: It's like, Oh, fuck me.

69
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:56,150
Speaker 1: Right.

70
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,689
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid, I was confused as to what Turnpike meant when I was really young.

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:10,003
Speaker 0: Cause like the only time I'd ever heard the word was in the context of a ride at Cedar Point called the Turnpike, which it was made in the fifties.

72
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:14,630
Speaker 0: and you drove fifties looking gasoline cars around a track.

73
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,251
Speaker 1: Anyway.

74
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,515
Speaker 1: So I hear this noise out there.

75
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:21,566
Speaker 1: It sounds like a dude revving his engine and it's slightly disturbing, but it goes away.

76
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:22,990
Speaker 1: and no, it doesn't go away.

77
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,737
Speaker 1: It sticks around and it keeps bothering me.

78
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,126
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what the fuck, dude, your car is working.

79
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,050
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

80
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,554
Speaker 1: And it doesn't even sound like a ricer.

81
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:33,205
Speaker 1: It sounds like some old shitty broken car with no muffler.

82
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,549
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Oh, fuck you.

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,909
Speaker 1: So then I go out onto the balcony and I'm going to just yell, shut the fuck up or something like that.

84
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,070
Speaker 0: Right.

85
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:40,670
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

86
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,879
Speaker 1: And when I'm out in the balcony, suddenly it doesn't sound the same anymore.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,310
Speaker 1: It sounds like thunder or perhaps thunder or perhaps cannons.

88
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,496
Speaker 1: And it does lights like flashing.

89
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,443
Speaker 1: I can't see around the corner of my balcony.

90
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,170
Speaker 1: So there's some flashing going on.

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,270
Speaker 0: So, so my question is at this exact moment, did you suspect fireworks first or were you still confused?

92
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,256
Speaker 1: Well, I was, I knew it was equally one of three things.

93
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:16,716
Speaker 1: Either lightning was around the corner where I, uh, there was bombs around the corner, I guess possible or fireworks around the corner.

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,548
Speaker 1: And so I go to the roof, which is on fire.

95
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:23,410
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.

96
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:24,032
Speaker 1: Sadly.

97
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:29,730
Speaker 1: Anyway, I go to the roof and there's like four or five neighbors already chilling up there and there's some firework action.

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,713
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Oh, come on.

99
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,295
Speaker 1: Seriously.

100
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,643
Speaker 1: It's like, you can't hold it in until Sunday.

101
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,830
Speaker 1: Are you like testing it or something?

102
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,134
Speaker 1: Testing the launch tubes?

103
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,826
Speaker 1: or are you fucking like getting rid of some extras?

104
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,110
Speaker 1: or what the hell are you doing guys?

105
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,214
Speaker 0: Might've been a different festival.

106
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:43,676
Speaker 0: Where were they?

107
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:44,199
Speaker 0: Over the river.

108
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,183
Speaker 1: It was out on the river.

109
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:46,550
Speaker 1: So they must've been testing, right?

110
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,880
Speaker 1: Or getting rid of some excess or something.

111
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,282
Speaker 1: I don't know.

112
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,249
Speaker 1: But yeah, those fuckers.

113
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:55,849
Speaker 0: I'll tell you about the karaoke guy that I had to dispatch.

114
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:02,466
Speaker 0: So, you know, we have in the fancy like big building and we're in the bedroom and it's really late.

115
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,670
Speaker 0: It's like two in the fucking morning.

116
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:04,132
Speaker 0: All right.

117
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:08,570
Speaker 0: And there's this guy and it doesn't bother me during the day because I don't hear it during the day.

118
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:16,110
Speaker 0: And even if I'm home, like I wouldn't be in the bedroom, but because the bathrooms like are connected to this positive air pressure thing.

119
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could, I can, I have that same problem.

120
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:24,670
Speaker 1: If you're in like my kitchen, this event or in my bathroom, this event, and I can hear like adjacent people through the vents.

121
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:29,689
Speaker 1: But if I, you know, close the bathroom door or, and I'm, you know, not right in the kitchen, I can't hear it.

122
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,097
Speaker 0: See, we can't hear adjacent.

123
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,579
Speaker 0: We can only hear up down and only in the- Yeah, it's up down adjacent.

124
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,190
Speaker 1: It's not left right adjacent.

125
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,210
Speaker 0: But only in some of the bathrooms because not all the apartments have two bathrooms.

126
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,653
Speaker 0: Ah.

127
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:46,510
Speaker 0: So the second bathroom, which is connected to the bedroom, there's a dude who lives above us who sings karaoke in Korean terribly.

128
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,230
Speaker 1: Like, how can he even, is he playing, maybe he's playing Korean rock band or something.

129
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,581
Speaker 0: He might be, but it's only him.

130
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,609
Speaker 0: I never hear anyone else.

131
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,390
Speaker 0: And he sings the same fucking songs.

132
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,369
Speaker 1: You sure he's not singing in the shower?

133
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,816
Speaker 0: No, he's definitely not because he's got a stereo going.

134
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:04,730
Speaker 0: He sings the same fucking songs over and over and over again forever, which is fine because I usually don't run into it.

135
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,010
Speaker 0: Like I'll go to pee and I hear it and I'm like, wow, that guy really sucks.

136
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,170
Speaker 1: Dude, you should record him and put him on the internet.

137
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,475
Speaker 0: One time I just started singing back at him.

138
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:19,190
Speaker 0: I was like, I didn't, and he stopped singing and then the singing went away for a while.

139
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,189
Speaker 0: I think at that moment he realized people could hear him.

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,768
Speaker 1: Maybe.

141
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,270
Speaker 0: But you seem to have forgotten that because we're like two in the morning and he's singing.

142
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:26,370
Speaker 1: Two in the morning?

143
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,230
Speaker 1: Louder and louder and louder.

144
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,088
Speaker 1: He must have been drunk.

145
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:29,889
Speaker 0: And louder.

146
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,568
Speaker 1: That's why.

147
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,184
Speaker 0: So finally I just get up and I go into the bathroom.

148
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:35,690
Speaker 0: I stand on the toilet.

149
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,590
Speaker 1: You could hear him in your bed all the way from the bathroom?

150
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,549
Speaker 0: Yes, with the bathroom door shut.

151
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:39,954
Speaker 1: Whoa.

152
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,417
Speaker 0: So I go in there and I listen for a bit.

153
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:45,446
Speaker 0: I'm like, dude, it's fucking two in the morning.

154
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:46,449
Speaker 0: Shut up.

155
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,990
Speaker 0: And he stops and the music keeps playing like the music, but he's not singing.

156
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:59,850
Speaker 0: And it's quiet for like a few minutes and then the song stops and then another song starts and then he starts to sing again.

157
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,009
Speaker 0: So I was like, what did I just say?

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,230
Speaker 0: And then I hear like a scrambling, scramble, scramble and the music stops, dead silence the rest of the night.

159
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,586
Speaker 1: You should find out who it is and go to the doorman.

160
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,013
Speaker 0: I know who it is.

161
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,380
Speaker 0: It's the apartment directly above me.

162
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,830
Speaker 1: Oh, well then you can go knock on his door.

163
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:30,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it happens again, I feel like I should just record it for a while and then just leave like a USB stick with MP3s of him singing like under his door.

164
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,846
Speaker 1: No, you should do is you should go up there, right?

165
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,950
Speaker 0: Well clearly, Scott, the USB stick is also a virus.

166
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,198
Speaker 1: No, what you do, you ready for this?

167
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,248
Speaker 1: This is the guaranteed win.

168
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:40,590
Speaker 1: You ready?

169
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:41,669
Speaker 1: I'm a genius.

170
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,510
Speaker 0: I've got a couple ideas.

171
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,326
Speaker 1: Now there will be demonstration of my genius.

172
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:45,950
Speaker 1: Are you ready?

173
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,636
Speaker 1: You go and you knock on his door.

174
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:48,520
Speaker 1: He opens the door.

175
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,086
Speaker 1: Vuvuzela in the face.

176
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:50,528
Speaker 1: That's it.

177
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:51,090
Speaker 1: Done.

178
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 0: Why not just play the vuvuzela through the vent?

179
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,410
Speaker 1: Because it'd be so much louder if it's just right in his face.

180
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,531
Speaker 0: I don't know.

181
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:01,810
Speaker 0: I kind of like the singing back at him as loud as I can.

182
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,090
Speaker 1: Vuvuzela is made of wind.

183
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,950
Speaker 1: Vuvuzela.

184
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,790
Speaker 1: Anyway, all right, let's check some news out.

185
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,502
Speaker 0: You have some news?

186
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:08,810
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

187
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's basically, there is nothing happening in the world.

188
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,662
Speaker 0: There's tons happening, just nothing.

189
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:14,290
Speaker 0: I have a lot to say.

190
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,664
Speaker 0: All right, there's news about homeopathy.

191
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,570
Speaker 0: I'm going to say the same thing.

192
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,008
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal news.

193
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,090
Speaker 0: There's news about like a kid getting arrested because he made a bomb out of dry ice.

194
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,948
Speaker 1: Not a big news.

195
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,850
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's more that all the news, all of you out there know exactly what I'm going to say about it.

196
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,520
Speaker 0: The BP oil spill, you know what I'm going to say.

197
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:32,950
Speaker 0: Politics, you know what I'm going to say.

198
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,087
Speaker 0: So, I don't know, what do you have?

199
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,549
Speaker 1: So there's a big steam sale going on.

200
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,929
Speaker 0: What are you going to say about that?

201
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,450
Speaker 1: It's basically got, no, I haven't bought any, I bought one game for $2.50.

202
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,014
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

203
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,390
Speaker 0: So, you have nothing to say about anything.

204
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,150
Speaker 0: So instead, you say that you have nothing to say about the steam sale.

205
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,166
Speaker 1: No, what I have to say about it is that it's kind of weak sauce compared to their usual sales where it's like, "Oh man, I got to buy some of

206
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:57,610
Speaker 1: everything.".

207
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,482
Speaker 1: This is sort of like, "Hey, where's the

208
00:08:59,885 --> 00:08:59,986
Speaker 1: beef?".

209
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,049
Speaker 1: You know, they got wicked low prices.

210
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,755
Speaker 0: Where's the beef?

211
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:04,570
Speaker 0: That's your reference?

212
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,610
Speaker 0: I don't think any of our listeners, or at least 99% of them have no idea what that is actually from.

213
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,528
Speaker 1: Well, then let them go to YouTube and find out.

214
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,030
Speaker 0: That was barely our generation.

215
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,590
Speaker 0: That was like the beginning of our generation was the end of that.

216
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,025
Speaker 1: Well, that's dumb shit for them.

217
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:21,289
Speaker 1: Anyway.

218
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:33,582
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like they got all these games, but it's like none of them are games that are like, I sort of learned my lesson with these steam sales, that like the first time I bought all these games and I barely played them, where you buy like some huge pack

219
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:35,070
Speaker 0: for $20.

220
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,350
Speaker 0: The id Software pack was the first one I ever bought.

221
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play like five of the games for a little bit, and then you hardly ever play them.

222
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,186
Speaker 0: Let's see, I'm looking at the deck pack right now.

223
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:43,490
Speaker 0: Let's see.

224
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,990
Speaker 0: I never even installed Doom 3 or the sequel to Doom 3 that I got.

225
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,191
Speaker 1: I definitely didn't beat Doom 3.

226
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,169
Speaker 0: I never even played it.

227
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,689
Speaker 0: I played like a little bit.

228
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,190
Speaker 0: I didn't install Indiana Jones or Hexen or Hexen or Hexen or Heretic.

229
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,729
Speaker 1: I played those back in the day.

230
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,990
Speaker 0: Loom, Master Levels, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 2, Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 3, Quake, Quake Castle Wolfenstein.

231
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:14,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically you got, you know, you get all these games, and even though it's only $2.50, right, it's like, "Hey, $2.50?

232
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,588
Speaker 1: That's a fucking breakfast sandwich,

233
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:15,809
Speaker 1: dude.".

234
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:20,490
Speaker 1: And if I'm not actually going to play these games, I just basically took a breakfast sandwich and threw it in the trash.

235
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:31,490
Speaker 1: So even if a game is a crazy low price, if you've played it already or if it's not something you're actually going to invest a lot of time in, it's not worth it, even when the price is wicked low.

236
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,603
Speaker 1: So like look at this, they got...

237
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,408
Speaker 0: Well, think about what this means.

238
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:41,029
Speaker 0: It's the same thing, you know, I don't really want to talk about it on Thursday, but that whole ASCAP thing that's happening right now.

239
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,548
Speaker 1: All right.

240
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:59,790
Speaker 0: It's the situation that, you know, everyone thinks us nerds are always mad about piracy and we're trying to fight for the right to pirate, but even way back, all we care about is the fact that so much stuff is free and we have so many options of entertainment that piracy is nothing compared to the fact that we're just apathetic about the majority of media.

241
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:12,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason that, you know, I think, you know, for piracy, right, is you have made something so difficult to obtain and I happen to want it now-ish, so piracy is an option.

242
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,990
Speaker 1: Now bear in mind, if you had made it, you know, available for a dollar like Steam does and I could have just gone and got it, I wouldn't have pirated because that's a pain in the ass.

243
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,150
Speaker 0: But at the same time...

244
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,309
Speaker 1: You made it a pain in the ass.

245
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:31,190
Speaker 0: At the same time, even when the game is a dollar, I'll sit there and I'll look at Steam and I'll be like, "Huh, that game's only a dollar.

246
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,185
Speaker 0: People said the game's pretty

247
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:32,388
Speaker 0: good.".

248
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,125
Speaker 0: And I'll look at it and I'll be like, "Do I really want to pay a

249
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:35,547
Speaker 0: dollar?".

250
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:36,815
Speaker 0: And it's not like.

251
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,628
Speaker 0: I'm going to say, "Fuck them, I'm pirating

252
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:38,769
Speaker 0: it.".

253
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:40,125
Speaker 0: I just don't play it.

254
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:40,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

255
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,750
Speaker 0: It's not even worth free to me, let alone a dollar.

256
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,770
Speaker 1: I know, it's like, should I install that thing and take up space on my hard drive?

257
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I have to click and wait and get some bandwidth going.

258
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:51,748
Speaker 0: It's going to take up like 20 megs.

259
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if I'm not actually going to play it, why would I do that?

260
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,770
Speaker 0: Wow, I guess I have Team Fortress Classic.

261
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,430
Speaker 1: Well, so does everyone.

262
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:02,028
Speaker 0: The dig!

263
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:02,870
Speaker 0: Right, right.

264
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,427
Speaker 0: Commander Keen.

265
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,810
Speaker 0: God, that's not even a stall.

266
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:05,490
Speaker 1: Why do you have the dig?

267
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,168
Speaker 1: I don't have the dig.

268
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,010
Speaker 0: It came with some pack I bought, I guess.

269
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,949
Speaker 1: What pack did you buy?

270
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,630
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

271
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,230
Speaker 1: Do you have other LucasArts adventure games?

272
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,950
Speaker 0: I think I have every LucasArts adventure game.

273
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,890
Speaker 0: You have Monkey Island and Loom.

274
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I have all of them.

275
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,239
Speaker 0: Really?

276
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,389
Speaker 1: I never bought that pack.

277
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,709
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I did.

278
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,030
Speaker 1: I played some of those on ScummVM, though, back a year back, though.

279
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,330
Speaker 1: I played Full Throttle all the way through.

280
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,850
Speaker 0: I got to say, of all those games, we don't want to turn this into a Tuesday show.

281
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,585
Speaker 0: Quest for Glory 2 is like...

282
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,090
Speaker 1: That's not a LucasArts game.

283
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:36,750
Speaker 0: I know, but that style of game, you know, click on stuff, type stuff, walk around, solve puzzles, that's the only one that I could actually play again, I think.

284
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,629
Speaker 1: I like the later King's Quest, because you got the right click to change your cursor and then you click on things.

285
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,669
Speaker 0: All the Quest for Glory's are like that, except two.

286
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,288
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

287
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:55,089
Speaker 0: Except the Quest for Glory's are actually decent games, but the ScummVM games, this may be heresy for some of you gamers, they're not even really games.

288
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:56,748
Speaker 1: No, they're basically...

289
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,630
Speaker 0: Like, at least Quest for Glory, the puzzles were like actual puzzles, and the games were mildly open-ended.

290
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:18,390
Speaker 1: It wasn't just crazy fucked up logic, so you get a fact, and then you basically, now that you got a fact, it's basically a movie, but because you've got a fact, you're not seeing all the alternate pathways to failure, you're only seeing the success.

291
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,029
Speaker 0: Oh, we did a whole panel on that.

292
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:32,229
Speaker 1: So a lot of the humor is out, and then, but the thing is, the failure really isn't fun, at this point in my life, because it takes a lot of time, and when I was younger, it'd still be great, and it's also no longer funny, most of it.

293
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think part of it was, you know that game you were just playing on the iPhone where you mix things together to make other things?

294
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,095
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,088
Speaker 0: ScummVM games are the same thing, they're just a novelty generator machine, and eventually you expose all the novelty and that's it.

296
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:45,527
Speaker 0: Yeah.

297
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,350
Speaker 0: They're barely games.

298
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,789
Speaker 1: You can just better off watching them on YouTube than playing them.

299
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you're under the age of six, or you got nothing better to do, I guess.

300
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,470
Speaker 0: Those are good games for like laptop, 12 hour plane ride, can't sleep.

301
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,767
Speaker 1: Very good.

302
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:00,789
Speaker 0: That's pretty much where I play a lot of games.

303
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:02,369
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

304
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,004
Speaker 0: So, you know, I'm going through these games, listing them right now, and you know what I see?

305
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,229
Speaker 0: Civ IV, Beyond the Sword, Warlords, Civ V, because I own it, and I can't play it yet.

306
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,409
Speaker 1: I didn't preorder it yet, because you know why?

307
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,287
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if I preorder it now or at the last minute, so why rush?

308
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,990
Speaker 1: Maybe it'll be a dollar, maybe it'll be cheaper, you know, later.

309
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,368
Speaker 0: I got something for preordering it.

310
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,410
Speaker 1: Well, then again, it could be more expensive later.

311
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I got something, but I'm not sure.

312
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,410
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll preorder it just because I know I'm gonna play it immediately, right?

313
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:37,448
Speaker 1: So, why not?

314
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,468
Speaker 0: I don't even remember preordering it.

315
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:40,988
Speaker 0: It's just here.

316
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,709
Speaker 1: All right, what do you got over there?

317
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:45,510
Speaker 0: I don't really have much, actually.

318
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:46,065
Speaker 1: All right.

319
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,209
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's summer.

320
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,729
Speaker 1: Heatwave's coming, maybe, that's gonna be cool.

321
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

322
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,970
Speaker 0: I'm just chilling.

323
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,150
Speaker 1: There's a holiday this weekend, so who knows what, oh, let's save that.

324
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're having some sort of party.

325
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,750
Speaker 0: What could we possibly have for the meta moment for that?

326
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,979
Speaker 1: There might be a disturbance in the show next week.

327
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,990
Speaker 0: All right, yeah, I guess we'll talk about that.

328
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,730
Speaker 1: Because of Independence Day.

329
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:20,350
Speaker 0: Now, I mostly got the fact that my whole hopper's been basically pushed back by preparations for Otacon and Kineticon and PAX and other big things that we're planning.

330
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, they really sort of infiltrated my hopper quite a bit.

331
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, my hopper got pushed back severely, but we've got a couple of videos coming.

332
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,009
Speaker 0: I guess we're getting into meta again.

333
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,347
Speaker 0: I don't know, it's Thursday, I got nothing.

334
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,069
Speaker 0: I really just want to play Counter-Strike right now.

335
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,609
Speaker 0: Of all the things I could do right now.

336
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,007
Speaker 1: You know what I really want to do right now?

337
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:39,169
Speaker 1: Eat dinner.

338
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:40,910
Speaker 0: Eh, I had a big ice cream.

339
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,030
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what, I'll mention one more thing, right?

340
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,329
Speaker 1: So, near my office, there was this place I used to always get a breakfast sandwich from.

341
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,469
Speaker 1: That's bad, don't do that.

342
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,109
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about learning the song from Okadono Ken.

343
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:02,690
Speaker 1: So, the breakfast sandwich place went out of business a while ago, and I haven't been able to find a place to get a decent breakfast sandwich near my work.

344
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,346
Speaker 1: The only place is Tim Hortons, which is like, ugh.

345
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,670
Speaker 1: It's like a combination Tim Hortons, KFC, Dunkin' Donuts, and Pizza Hut.

346
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,709
Speaker 1: All in one, all in one.

347
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,970
Speaker 0: So, I do not know if Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts have changed their recipes over time.

348
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,289
Speaker 1: I guess it's not a Dunkin' Donuts anymore, it used to be.

349
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:27,629
Speaker 0: Or if it's just that I have not eaten that sort of crap food in so long that I no longer am bamboozled by it.

350
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,070
Speaker 0: But I ate a Tim Hortons breakfast sandwich the other day, and it tasted like sugar.

351
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,730
Speaker 0: But it wasn't a donut, it was like a sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin, but it tasted like sugar.

352
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:43,122
Speaker 0: It was so sweet, I couldn't stand it.

353
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,610
Speaker 0: I threw the fucking thing away.

354
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,970
Speaker 1: So, across the street, there's a place called The Majestic, and you can get one there.

355
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,910
Speaker 1: But it's like $7, because it's all touristy and shit.

356
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,990
Speaker 0: Dude, for $7, I'm expecting some lox and like a Bialy.

357
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,573
Speaker 1: I know, right?

358
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:58,257
Speaker 1: But not even.

359
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:01,030
Speaker 1: You get lox and a bagel with cream cheese or $5.

360
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,823
Speaker 1: With the coffee, right?

361
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:02,190
Speaker 1: Anyway.

362
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,310
Speaker 1: So, there's this other place I discovered, because they had a chalkboard out on the sidewalk.

363
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,509
Speaker 0: Wow, this is suddenly New York.

364
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, the chalkboard on the sidewalk was like custom omelet, whatever.

365
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:22,605
Speaker 1: And I noticed that during lunch one day, because basically, there's this strip where there's an everything place, then there's a Qdoba, and then there's a Pret, and then there's another everything place.

366
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,005
Speaker 1: Oh, Pret sucks.

367
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,430
Speaker 0: I know, I don't know, all these people in my office like the fucking Pret.

368
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,019
Speaker 0: It's just like Cozy.

369
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,250
Speaker 0: Like, why do people eat at these places?

370
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,750
Speaker 1: I don't know why anyone eaten the sandwiches that come in a cardboard box, please.

371
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,759
Speaker 0: Well, Cozy doesn't even cook their food.

372
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,590
Speaker 0: You order like a hot pizza that it's not even cooked?

373
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,149
Speaker 1: At least Metro Cafe is like, you know.

374
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,756
Speaker 0: Thing is, I got a bunch of tweets, and people emailed me when I tweeted out like, "Yeah, fuck you Cozy.

375
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,287
Speaker 0: You've crossed me for like the fifth

376
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:48,630
Speaker 0: time.".

377
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:51,059
Speaker 0: And they were all like, "What are you talking about?

378
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,782
Speaker 0: Cozy's awesome.

379
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:52,727
Speaker 0: Your Cozy must just

380
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,029
Speaker 0: suck.".

381
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,486
Speaker 1: I'd rather go to fucking...

382
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:00,790
Speaker 0: So, listen kids, in full disclosure, it is three separate Cozy's in three separate geographic locations.

383
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,667
Speaker 0: If you think Cozy's good...

384
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:03,730
Speaker 1: You don't know what's good.

385
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,230
Speaker 1: What's the place that puts the sandwiches through the toaster?

386
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,249
Speaker 0: A lot of places do that.

387
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,170
Speaker 1: No, the place that was in, you know, the chain.

388
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, Quiznos is better than fucking Cozy.

389
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

390
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,910
Speaker 1: I mean, Subway's better than fucking Cozy.

391
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,294
Speaker 0: In fact, I wouldn't mind a Quiznos nearby because when I'm... You know, sometimes you get in that mood where you look at a Subway and you're like, "You know what?

392
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:24,685
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll eat

393
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,210
Speaker 0: Subway.".

394
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,790
Speaker 1: There's actually this place near my work called Fresh End Co.

395
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:30,670
Speaker 0: Oh, those places are pretty cool.

396
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,770
Speaker 1: It's actually like the sandwiches they have there.

397
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,610
Speaker 0: I was gonna say cool, and then I said good.

398
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,238
Speaker 1: You can get a sandwich there.

399
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,087
Speaker 1: that's Quiznos style, but it's like 10,000 times better.

400
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,710
Speaker 1: Anyway, and it's so cheap, it's like $6.

401
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,130
Speaker 1: So there's two everything places, right?

402
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,370
Speaker 1: But one of the everything places is only lunch, right?

403
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,970
Speaker 1: It doesn't do breakfast or dinner.

404
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,850
Speaker 1: And it's better than the first everything place.

405
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,269
Speaker 1: So we've never actually been to the first everything place because the second everything place is just so much better.

406
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,590
Speaker 1: But the first everything place I discovered today has breakfast.

407
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,127
Speaker 1: So I went to get a bacon, egg, and cheese on an English muffin.

408
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,058
Speaker 1: Dude used so much egg, right?

409
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:12,090
Speaker 1: He had egg, then he put the bacon and the cheese in the egg and folded the egg over the top.

410
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,417
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

411
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:14,710
Speaker 0: That was like an omelet sandwich.

412
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,269
Speaker 1: And then he put the egg into the English muffin.

413
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,749
Speaker 1: The English muffin was basically so tiny compared to the egg.

414
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,282
Speaker 1: It was like I had to eat the egg around the edge.

415
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,490
Speaker 0: It was basically a Gothic Lolita English muffin.

416
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:34,589
Speaker 1: I had to eat the egg around the edge before I could actually sort of hold on to the muffin.

417
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,270
Speaker 1: But it was only $3.

418
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,830
Speaker 1: You know, everything places usually charge like a big markup, but it was only $3.

419
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,890
Speaker 1: So I was like, hells yeah.

420
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,657
Speaker 0: Not bad.

421
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,410
Speaker 0: I'm still sampling.

422
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,070
Speaker 0: I walk by six different breakfast sandwich places on my way to work.

423
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,370
Speaker 1: You haven't tried them all yet?

424
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:49,646
Speaker 1: No.

425
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,409
Speaker 1: You've been to work more than six days.

426
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's two of these places I walk past every day and I look at them, I'm like, eh.

427
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:00,130
Speaker 1: Well, just go to one of them on Tuesday and one of them on Wednesday.

428
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, usually I'm either running late or like they just they don't grab me.

429
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,898
Speaker 0: And I walk past them and go to a place I've already been to.

430
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:12,690
Speaker 0: because while they're not the greatest, I know they're at least acceptable.

431
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,803
Speaker 1: Well, you can, you know, just try it out.

432
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:15,689
Speaker 1: It's not going to poison you.

433
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so imagine you're in this situation.

434
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,850
Speaker 0: You're really hungry and you have a choice of a place that you know is acceptable, not good, but acceptable.

435
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,649
Speaker 0: Or an unknown quantity that looks a little shady.

436
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,350
Speaker 1: Well, if it looks shady, I'm not going to go there no matter what.

437
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,970
Speaker 0: Because if I get the equivalent of a Tim Horton sandwich, what am I going to do?

438
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,650
Speaker 0: Throw it away and go to another place in the same morning?

439
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:37,570
Speaker 1: I would just eat it and deal with it.

440
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:38,395
Speaker 0: I'm done with that.

441
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,810
Speaker 0: I've started, if something's really bad, I just throw it away.

442
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,790
Speaker 1: But what if you're missing out on an awesome sandwich?

443
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not.

444
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,029
Speaker 1: That just happens to be in a shady place.

445
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:47,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, that could be.

446
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,849
Speaker 1: Because it means I went to the place I went to, the everything place that I went to and got this breakfast sandwich, is the shadiest looking everything place we have.

447
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,230
Speaker 0: The place that I keep walking past has had two competitors spring up like adjacent to it.

448
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,909
Speaker 0: So I have a feeling there's something going on.

449
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,910
Speaker 0: So anyway, things of the day.

450
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,090
Speaker 1: My computer went to sleep.

451
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,714
Speaker 0: That's fine.

452
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,269
Speaker 0: I'll talk about my thing of the day.

453
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:22,992
Speaker 0: I'm a reader of Fark and I just want to point out as an aside, Drew Curtis had an interesting talk where he basically said, "You know what?

454
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,470
Speaker 0: The wisdom of the crowds is bullshit.

455
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,701
Speaker 0: 99% of what anyone says on the internet is terrible.

456
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:29,725
Speaker 0: I should know.

457
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:30,547
Speaker 0: I run

458
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:30,828
Speaker 0: Fark.".

459
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,649
Speaker 1: That's right.

460
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,750
Speaker 0: So there's an article on Fark and this is why I read Fark.

461
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:43,150
Speaker 0: This is one of those things that is just so weird and amazing that I'm not really sure how to take it.

462
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,489
Speaker 0: It is an article that begs questions.

463
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:46,730
Speaker 1: All right.

464
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,230
Speaker 0: So there's an American Airlines flight, right?

465
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:50,797
Speaker 0: It's going to take off.

466
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,004
Speaker 0: People are on this flight.

467
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,989
Speaker 0: They're ready to go.

468
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:55,270
Speaker 1: They get stranded on the thing.

469
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:55,933
Speaker 0: No, no.

470
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:56,689
Speaker 0: They don't get stranded.

471
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:04,710
Speaker 0: So apparently maggots started falling out of the ceiling somewhere onto this woman.

472
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:05,771
Speaker 1: Okay.

473
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:15,730
Speaker 1: So obviously there was some sort of meat in the overhead compartment that was left there by a previous passenger and they failed to clean it out as per the requirements that they clean the airplane after each flight.

474
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,030
Speaker 0: So what they found, so obviously they take the flight back.

475
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:20,975
Speaker 0: There's a minor emergency.

476
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:23,630
Speaker 0: They're going to figure out what's going on with this maggot infestation.

477
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,121
Speaker 1: You don't really need to go back for that.

478
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,330
Speaker 1: You can just land at the nearest airport.

479
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,059
Speaker 0: No, they didn't take off yet.

480
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,830
Speaker 0: They taxied back to the terminal.

481
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,480
Speaker 0: They sit there and people look around.

482
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,570
Speaker 0: They're wondering if maybe it's something in the ceiling.

483
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,970
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a problem with the airplane.

484
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,629
Speaker 1: Maybe somebody actually brought maggots onto the plane in their carry-on.

485
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:48,870
Speaker 0: So apparently there was a suitcase brought on by one of the passengers just a carry-on full of meat that was full of maggots.

486
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:52,669
Speaker 0: And it was leaking maggots all over the place.

487
00:22:53,691 --> 00:23:02,610
Speaker 0: Now, how could this carry-on suitcase have been so sealed that maggots weren't falling out during that security check and everything?

488
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,610
Speaker 0: And then suddenly maggots, when it's on the plane.

489
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,730
Speaker 1: And how could the maggots weren't killed by x-rays?

490
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:10,049
Speaker 0: I don't think they would kill the maggots.

491
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,618
Speaker 1: Maybe it would multiply.

492
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,250
Speaker 1: That's why they started spilling out.

493
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,090
Speaker 1: They were strengthened by the x-rays.

494
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,730
Speaker 1: Because they were now radioactive super-strong maggots and they busted out of the luggage with their superpowers.

495
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,850
Speaker 1: Like the Hulk or Spider-Man.

496
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,610
Speaker 0: The article doesn't tell you anything more than that.

497
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,795
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, they found the suitcase.

498
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:28,407
Speaker 0: There were maggots in it because of spoiled meat in the

499
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,010
Speaker 0: baggage."

500
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,261
Speaker 0: And it doesn't say anything else.

501
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:34,050
Speaker 0: What kind of journalism is this?

502
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,530
Speaker 0: Obviously, we want to know who brought it on, why they brought it on.

503
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,909
Speaker 0: I want a police interview with the person like, "See, you brought a bag full of spoiled meat.

504
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,266
Speaker 0: Were there maggots in it when you put it in the

505
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:45,528
Speaker 0: bag?".

506
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,630
Speaker 1: Were there maggots who took it out of the bag?

507
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,210
Speaker 1: Why didn't you put it in a refrigerated container and send it by next day FedEx?

508
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,069
Speaker 0: See, that doesn't bother me that much.

509
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,250
Speaker 0: Because I'm assuming that this is a person who willfully put meat, possibly spoiled meat, in a carry-on bag.

510
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,910
Speaker 0: Probably not even in plastic.

511
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,296
Speaker 1: Are you sure it was actually meat?

512
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:05,150
Speaker 1: It could have been like, you know, bad bathtub cheese or something.

513
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:08,610
Speaker 0: It says meat in the article.

514
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,720
Speaker 1: Was it like just a dead animal?

515
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,930
Speaker 1: or was it actually a proper cut of meat?

516
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,376
Speaker 0: They don't say.

517
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,550
Speaker 0: There's a little video of the maggots.

518
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,089
Speaker 1: Because it could have just been like someone's pet died, you know?

519
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:22,110
Speaker 1: In the carry-on, in the overhead container.

520
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,209
Speaker 1: Well, no, he died and then he was bringing it somewhere to a pet cemetery far away, so he just put it in a carry-on.

521
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,210
Speaker 0: But then, so cut back to our wonderful Homeland Security people.

522
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:36,150
Speaker 0: You'd think they would have noticed the skeleton in the x-ray.

523
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,020
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.

524
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:40,988
Speaker 1: Don't talk to me.

525
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,829
Speaker 0: Just, this newspaper people.

526
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:45,789
Speaker 1: He de-boned it.

527
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,110
Speaker 0: The people who say, oh, newspapers.

528
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,000
Speaker 1: Was it fish?

529
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:49,709
Speaker 1: It could have been fish.

530
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,190
Speaker 0: When newspapers go away, that we're going to lose journalism, there already isn't journalism.

531
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,989
Speaker 0: This article told me nothing that I needed to know.

532
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,285
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there already isn't journalism at 99% of newspapers, right?

533
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,910
Speaker 1: It's pretty much, because all the local newspapers, they get all their news from the big newspapers.

534
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:09,270
Speaker 1: And basically, there's only actually like two or three sources of actual journalism.

535
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,670
Speaker 1: And at those sources of actual journalism, such as New York Times and such, the majority of the journalists there aren't actually real journalists.

536
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,389
Speaker 1: So it's like you have a small, the smallest percentage of journalism places have a small percentage of actual journalists, and that's it.

537
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,046
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

538
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:29,729
Speaker 0: It's going to bother me, because I'll never be able to find out what the deal was.

539
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,130
Speaker 1: You know, you would have been better off not knowing it even happened.

540
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,717
Speaker 0: I know.

541
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,390
Speaker 0: Thanks, Fark.

542
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:34,570
Speaker 1: That's why I don't read Fark.

543
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:46,030
Speaker 0: But it's one of those things I would love for there to be a website that was like a collaborative thing that was designed solely, you know, integrated with phone apps and everything, to geotag, you know, like give location coordinates and things.

544
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,685
Speaker 0: And basically, it's a what the fuck website, where you just say, "What the fuck was up with

545
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:50,908
Speaker 0: this?"

546
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:57,240
Speaker 0: And you give as much information as you have, and then maybe other people will tell you what the fuck it was up with, whatever it was.

547
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,930
Speaker 0: you're wondering what the fuck it was up about.

548
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,770
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you're walking by, and like a boot just falls from the sky, like lands in front of you.

549
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,190
Speaker 0: And it's full of, like, gerbils, and they're fine, and they run off.

550
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:07,757
Speaker 0: You're like, "What the

551
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:08,061
Speaker 0: fuck?".

552
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:11,126
Speaker 0: So you post, and the guy's like, "Yeah, I dropped my gerbil

553
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:11,327
Speaker 0: boot.".

554
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,089
Speaker 1: It was Currybo's shoe.

555
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:19,290
Speaker 1: So, here's my thing of the day.

556
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,090
Speaker 1: What is man?

557
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,652
Speaker 1: No.

558
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,489
Speaker 1: What is the best Gundam of all Gundams?

559
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,310
Speaker 1: Freedom.

560
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,054
Speaker 1: That's right.

561
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:26,730
Speaker 1: Freedom Gundam is the best Gundam.

562
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,050
Speaker 1: So, here's a video, and in this video, this guy builds Freedom Gundam.

563
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:37,304
Speaker 1: In fact, he builds the same exact Freedom Gundam model that I have, which is the first Gundam model I ever built, the 1/100th Freedom Gundam.

564
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,742
Speaker 0: Alright.

565
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,569
Speaker 1: And he does it fast-forward, right, in the video, so it takes a few seconds for it to do that.

566
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,970
Speaker 1: Then he builds another Freedom Gundam model that happens to be four feet tall, but that is not the important part, the fact that it was large.

567
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,070
Speaker 1: That is not that impressive.

568
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,925
Speaker 1: The impressive part is that he makes it out of paper.

569
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:10,270
Speaker 1: He basically prints out 178 sheets out of his desk jet, and he gets an exacto knife and some glue and some folding in his hands, and he builds a four-foot-tall Freedom Gundam exactly like the plastic one.

570
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:10,776
Speaker 0: Whoa!

571
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:14,270
Speaker 1: And he basically does this, you know, also in fast motion.

572
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:23,990
Speaker 1: So, it took him two weeks of sitting on the couch with a piece of cardboard on his lap, and, you know, scissors and whatever, but it takes you about four minutes to watch.

573
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:49,390
Speaker 1: So, you watch four minutes of fast-forwarding, and you can see what the funniest thing about this, right, is you basically get four weeks of this dude sitting on the -- two weeks of this guy sitting on the couch, you know, building this model, and you see people occasionally come to sit with him on the couch and just sort of chat him up, and you notice, like, these people who sit with them on the couch, like, they're just, like, flipping around with their cell phones and whatever the whole time or just not doing anything, and this guy, he's building something.

574
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:51,410
Speaker 1: So, don't be the guy with the cell phone.

575
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,430
Speaker 1: Be the guy making a model out of paper.

576
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:54,570
Speaker 1: All right.

577
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,367
Speaker 1: Don't be the other guy.

578
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,770
Speaker 1: And also, four-foot-tall Freedom Gundam.

579
00:27:57,915 --> 00:27:58,307
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck.

580
00:27:58,572 --> 00:27:58,925
Speaker 0: Not bad.

581
00:27:59,491 --> 00:27:59,908
Speaker 1: Shit, yeah.

582
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,070
Speaker 0: All right, Fark did a little bit of digging.

583
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:08,689
Speaker 0: It was a woman who brought the suitcase on, and she was on the flight, and that's all they know.

584
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,609
Speaker 1: No one asked her?

585
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,489
Speaker 0: I don't know.

586
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,886
Speaker 0: This is just Fark being like, "Hey, here's the best we could come up

587
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:14,087
Speaker 0: with.".

588
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:15,748
Speaker 1: Call her on the phone.

589
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,587
Speaker 1: Be like, "Why did you have

590
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:17,688
Speaker 1: meat?".

591
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:23,508
Speaker 0: But, bonus points, there's a screenshot someone took, and they posted it on Fark, off the article, right?

592
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:27,529
Speaker 0: And there's contextual advertising on the news site that reported it.

593
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:28,650
Speaker 1: For selling maggots?

594
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,327
Speaker 0: Selling meat.

595
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,663
Speaker 0: And the first post, "Carry in

596
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:35,005
Speaker 0: luggage."

597
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:37,670
Speaker 0: That's a good joke.

598
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,470
Speaker 0: The rest of the posts are garbage.

599
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:40,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

600
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:41,699
Speaker 1: "Carry in

601
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:41,944
Speaker 1: luggage.".

602
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:43,570
Speaker 0: So, the meta moment.

603
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,369
Speaker 0: Kineticon is next weekend.

604
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,628
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck me.

605
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,870
Speaker 0: Yes, Jesus Christ.

606
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,829
Speaker 0: Fuck me in the eye.

607
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,270
Speaker 0: We run panels there.

608
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,110
Speaker 0: It's going to be awesome.

609
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,320
Speaker 0: July 9th, 10th, and 11th.

610
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:53,510
Speaker 0: We'll be there.

611
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not just doing panels.

612
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:57,369
Speaker 1: We are in charge of the panels.

613
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,150
Speaker 1: Like, who is the boss of panels?

614
00:28:59,616 --> 00:28:59,748
Speaker 1: Us.

615
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,590
Speaker 1: Us is the boss.

616
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,889
Speaker 0: And there have been some problems along the way.

617
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,129
Speaker 0: I can tell you that much.

618
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,490
Speaker 1: We're doing the best we can, considering our late induction.

619
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,970
Speaker 1: But, next year, they'll be much better.

620
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,405
Speaker 0: Yes.

621
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,910
Speaker 0: Also, the New York Anime Festival Comic Con, off in the future, will be there doing stuff.

622
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:14,490
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

623
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,650
Speaker 1: October 8th, 9th, 10th is going to be the weekend of doom.

624
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,030
Speaker 0: The biggest fucking weekend ever.

625
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,670
Speaker 0: There's the NerdNYC Board Gaming Night Friday.

626
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,990
Speaker 1: October 8th, that night, 7 o'clock at Think Coffee downtown, NerdNYC Board Game Night.

627
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,010
Speaker 0: Also, that is the beginning of 10-10-10, the Burning Wheel Extravaganza in Queens.

628
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:40,068
Speaker 1: Yes, the Burning Wheel was originally released on 5-5-5, so it's 10-10-10, Burning Wheel Con on the 8th, 9th, and 10th.

629
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,788
Speaker 1: Now, watch out.

630
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,960
Speaker 0: If you can't do modulus math, you won't be able to figure out when the next one is going to be.

631
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:44,507
Speaker 1: I know.

632
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:58,020
Speaker 1: And, even worse, right, the New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival double mega convention in the New York, in the Jacob Javits Center on the west side is also the 8th, 9th, and 10th.

633
00:29:58,413 --> 00:29:58,966
Speaker 0: So, it's anime.

634
00:29:59,472 --> 00:29:59,890
Speaker 1: Of October.

635
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,670
Speaker 0: And comics, and gaming, and we'll be there doing big shit.

636
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,930
Speaker 1: But, before then, about a month before then, on Labor Day weekend, PEX West.

637
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:09,310
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

638
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:11,429
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

639
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,170
Speaker 0: And, by the way, PEX West will be there.

640
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,689
Speaker 0: We're doing numerous events.

641
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,770
Speaker 1: Yeah.

642
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,490
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is Still the Lies of Locke Lamora.

643
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:23,369
Speaker 0: It's not the best written book, but it's really fun.

644
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,188
Speaker 0: Really fun.

645
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,329
Speaker 0: You'll probably enjoy it.

646
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,288
Speaker 1: I chose it because it was a fun and easy book that would, hopefully, people would read it for fun.

647
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,330
Speaker 0: It's like Lupin in a fantasy world, basically.

648
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:33,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

649
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,270
Speaker 1: But, you see what I'm talking about.

650
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,510
Speaker 1: It has that, we set up a fantasy world, but the story isn't about the fantasy world.

651
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,630
Speaker 1: It's just in the fantasy world.

652
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,870
Speaker 1: So, like, the deal with, like, why are there these towers of crystal and shit?

653
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,470
Speaker 1: Well, we're not going to really explain, or that has nothing to do with the story.

654
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,470
Speaker 1: They're just part of the setting.

655
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,150
Speaker 1: All right.

656
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:49,843
Speaker 1: Let's go.

657
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:50,746
Speaker 0: Yep.

658
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,290
Speaker 0: I don't know what other meta we have.

659
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,710
Speaker 0: Next week, basically, for the next two weeks, gig nights will be on and off again.

660
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,090
Speaker 1: You may not live in the United States.

661
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,029
Speaker 1: You may not know that it is the 4th of July this weekend, which means we don't have to work on Monday.

662
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,889
Speaker 0: It's the day where we kicked your albionic asses.

663
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:03,910
Speaker 1: Right.

664
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,250
Speaker 1: So, that means that who knows- You like my alliteration?

665
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:15,348
Speaker 1: Who knows what kind of shows we're going to be doing next week, considering, like, Friday, you know, Thursday night or maybe Friday morning, we're running off to Kineticon and Monday we don't have work.

666
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:19,110
Speaker 1: So, it's pretty much a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday next week, and who knows if we're.

667
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,950
Speaker 0: I don't think we're going to do any shows next week.

668
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,990
Speaker 1: We're going to do some show.

669
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,289
Speaker 0: We might do one show.

670
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:24,629
Speaker 1: What show should we do?

671
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:25,129
Speaker 1: I don't know.

672
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:25,929
Speaker 0: I got an idea.

673
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:26,990
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do something.

674
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, next week, who knows about the status of our podcast.

675
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,670
Speaker 1: Of course, but maybe not the Phantom.

676
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,010
Speaker 0: So, we did a show on Lego.

677
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,528
Speaker 1: A long time ago.

678
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:40,789
Speaker 0: So, we realized, you know, we needed a show to do.

679
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,850
Speaker 1: And I came up with an idea, a genius idea.

680
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,770
Speaker 0: Clearly, we would do a show on UnLEGO.

681
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:53,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, because there's a lot of UnLEGO, so that we can definitely cover enough, you know, material to make an entire episode of Geek Nights.

682
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,009
Speaker 1: We're talking about all the various UnLEGOs.

683
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:59,030
Speaker 1: So, I- Pick an UnLEGO, or you shall begin with it.

684
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:04,929
Speaker 0: See, it's tricky because what we each pick as our first one will say a lot about our personalities, I think.

685
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,849
Speaker 1: I think it's, no, it's actually just gonna say about what I have the most to talk about.

686
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,010
Speaker 0: Eh, no, because the one that I think stands out the most in my head is Tinker Toys, because nothing else was like Tinker Toys.

687
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,810
Speaker 1: That's the one with the little wooden balls with the holes and the sticks.

688
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:16,325
Speaker 1: Yes.

689
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,110
Speaker 1: I actually, like I, you know, I knew Tinker Toys, but I never really had them.

690
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,590
Speaker 0: I think my- Tinker Toys date back to World Fucking War 1.

691
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,721
Speaker 0: I know.

692
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,890
Speaker 1: My grandma, I think, had one bucket of them.

693
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,310
Speaker 1: And I know of some friends who had them.

694
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,090
Speaker 0: There were also, Kelvin played with them in Kelvin and Hobbes.

695
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I never really had them or used them that much or really explored any of their possibilities.

696
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,210
Speaker 0: In my mind, they were much more kind of, there was a lot more you could do with them.

697
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,530
Speaker 0: They were just more versatile and more weird.

698
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,290
Speaker 0: You could make big, weird contraptions, the likes of which you really couldn't make with other things.

699
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they didn't really move.

700
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,049
Speaker 0: You know, you could- Nothing back then moved.

701
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,110
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it did.

702
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:54,650
Speaker 0: What?

703
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,250
Speaker 0: Construction or constructo?

704
00:32:57,884 --> 00:32:57,948
Speaker 1: No.

705
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:58,947
Speaker 1: The erector set.

706
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,089
Speaker 1: I had the erector set.

707
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, honestly, I didn't like the erector set.

708
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,470
Speaker 1: Oh, you see?

709
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,290
Speaker 1: This is the thing, right?

710
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,142
Speaker 1: So, I had, right?

711
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,370
Speaker 1: I had my freaking mom's brother's erector set.

712
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had the same deal.

713
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,810
Speaker 0: Basically, the whole family was super full of nostalgia for erector sets.

714
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,749
Speaker 0: So, they got me an original real deal erector set.

715
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:24,590
Speaker 0: And I already had a bunch of other kinds of things that were more updated.

716
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,550
Speaker 0: So, the erector set was kind of difficult.

717
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,890
Speaker 0: I couldn't make anything interesting with it.

718
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,430
Speaker 1: Oh, see, I had this old erector set, right?

719
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,530
Speaker 1: And it had all this crazy- It even had like a motor and some crazy shit.

720
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,830
Speaker 1: I couldn't even make it work because it was just so old and crazy.

721
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:41,529
Speaker 1: But the thing that was awesome about the erector set, right, was that you could- You had actual screws and nuts.

722
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,450
Speaker 1: It was like you're actually doing for real hardware.

723
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,570
Speaker 1: It wasn't like some, you know, like snap together child-friendly thing.

724
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:55,350
Speaker 1: It was like, "Here, here's a bunch of pieces of fucking metal with holes in them and screws and nuts that are the right size for the holes.

725
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:56,176
Speaker 1: Go

726
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:56,502
Speaker 1: nuts.".

727
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:59,790
Speaker 1: And you could actually, you know, you can make like there's some wheels.

728
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,370
Speaker 1: I made some cars, some other stuff with that.

729
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,750
Speaker 0: See, I guess much more fun than erector sets.

730
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:09,710
Speaker 1: But then, actually, later on, they like the re- You know, erector set disappeared for a while or at least lied low.

731
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,130
Speaker 1: But then it made a slight resurgence.

732
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,230
Speaker 1: And I had like one more modern erector set thing that was like a helicopter of some kind.

733
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:20,790
Speaker 1: And it actually was relatively compatible with the original erector set.

734
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:27,250
Speaker 1: It was just more modern, you know, less cut yourself, more safe for the modern times kind of situation.

735
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,659
Speaker 0: See, I had this set of toys.

736
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,889
Speaker 0: I have no idea what they were called.

737
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,309
Speaker 0: Maybe someone can help me out.

738
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:42,909
Speaker 0: They look kind of like erector sets, but they were- Because this is mostly of flat green pieces of plastic with large holes kind of interspersed, like along their lengths, and the holes had kind of ridges around them.

739
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:50,330
Speaker 0: So you could use these plastic bolts and screws and nuts and things to connect them together.

740
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,750
Speaker 0: And they were kind of like a big plastic erector set.

741
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:56,010
Speaker 1: It might have just been wussy erector set.

742
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,910
Speaker 0: No, because they actually- you could do things like make large swords and actually hit people with them.

743
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,943
Speaker 1: You could make a fucking sword with an erector set.

744
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:04,790
Speaker 1: Watch the fuck out.

745
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,110
Speaker 0: But they were also bendy, so you could make really interesting shapes with them.

746
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:09,910
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

747
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,650
Speaker 0: And actually, I would use them to make these very elaborate vehicles to put my mask men in, and then see if they would survive.

748
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,090
Speaker 1: See, erector set is like more of an engineering thing, right?

749
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,770
Speaker 1: You can't just make like a long stick, right?

750
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,261
Speaker 1: You got to think about it like a bridge.

751
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,149
Speaker 1: You got to tress it and stuff like that.

752
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,910
Speaker 0: Well, if you're talking about wussifying things, there's always connects.

753
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:30,061
Speaker 1: Yeah, my brother had connects.

754
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:31,610
Speaker 1: I didn't really do too much of it.

755
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,910
Speaker 0: They kind of, like by the time we got connects, was right about when I was getting to the end of that era in my life.

756
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,250
Speaker 1: And the problem with connects is that it was really only strong- the links were strong in only one direction.

757
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:50,069
Speaker 1: So if you wanted to make anything that was actually durable and stiff and could actually be for serious- You had to basically fully truss it.

758
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,157
Speaker 1: You had to work in both dimensions.

759
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:57,950
Speaker 1: You could make a sword, but if you made a flat sword, which is pretty easy, it would be all floppy.

760
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,689
Speaker 1: You had to make a sword in the shape of a plus to actually get it to be kind of strong.

761
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,990
Speaker 0: Which was good in a way that it was more for building structures rather than building a sword that I hit my brother with.

762
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:14,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was very similar to erector set, but it only worked at certain angles, and you snapped instead of screwing.

763
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,410
Speaker 1: So you lost the screwing aspect of it.

764
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,790
Speaker 0: But notice how they would pop in and out the sides, which really limited your structural integrity.

765
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,893
Speaker 1: That's what I was just saying.

766
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:29,529
Speaker 1: Any link was only strong in one direction, which means you needed to go in multiple directions to get any sort of strength.

767
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:39,446
Speaker 1: Plus, honestly, you couldn't do that much interesting with them, and most of the interesting things were- Yeah, other than following the directions, it was actually pretty hard to come up with something original that wasn't just like, "I made a gun.

768
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:39,747
Speaker 1: It's an

769
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:40,329
Speaker 1: L."

770
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:45,963
Speaker 1: "I made a box with a stairway inside," or something.

771
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:57,770
Speaker 0: I gotta say, though, I don't know if I should save it for last or just jump in the middle, but of all those sorts of things, the best, far and away, bar none for me, were waffle blocks.

772
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,390
Speaker 1: You mean just fucking the fluffy foam things?

773
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:02,752
Speaker 1: What?

774
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:05,790
Speaker 0: No, these were big pieces of very sturdy plastic.

775
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:14,270
Speaker 0: For a little kid, they were huge, flat pieces of plastic with interlocking notches along the edges.

776
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:14,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

777
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:15,330
Speaker 1: Okay.

778
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,550
Speaker 0: But they were hard plastic.

779
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,036
Speaker 1: They made those still, but they're foam.

780
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,890
Speaker 1: They're like jigsaw puzzle pieces, but they're all identical.

781
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, but these, well, they weren't all identical.

782
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:24,378
Speaker 0: Some had holes in them.

783
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:28,570
Speaker 0: You could mount them on the sides, not just in the middle.

784
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:29,289
Speaker 0: Oh, right, right.

785
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:32,739
Speaker 0: But you could make large structures that could hold your own weight.

786
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,770
Speaker 0: I would make entire forts, walls to block off parts of the house.

787
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is something to be said, right?

788
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,298
Speaker 1: It's like none of the other things.

789
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:45,230
Speaker 1: When you're working with, say, Lego, you're making things that are miniature size.

790
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,155
Speaker 1: It's like you're making toys.

791
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:52,430
Speaker 1: Unless you're rich, you're not making Legos that are the size that can interact with the real world.

792
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,063
Speaker 1: But some of these other ones, like erector set, you're also usually making something small.

793
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,629
Speaker 1: Unless you have so much erector set, you could make a real go-kart.

794
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:01,230
Speaker 1: you could sit in.

795
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,661
Speaker 1: But that's a lot of fucking erector set.

796
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,144
Speaker 0: One time I remember we would always make, my brother and I, we'd make a boat in the living room.

797
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,470
Speaker 0: Like a gigantic with a floor.

798
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,449
Speaker 1: You'd put it in the pool?

799
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,772
Speaker 0: No, it wouldn't float.

800
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:14,337
Speaker 0: But we'd make it on the floor, right?

801
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:17,243
Speaker 0: With a hull and walls and a deck.

802
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,630
Speaker 0: And then we'd basically fight off the pirates from the outside with Nerf guns.

803
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:20,977
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,788
Speaker 0: Oh, and also there were Wii waffle blocks, which were like two or three inches by two or three inches.

805
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:28,370
Speaker 0: They were much smaller.

806
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,068
Speaker 1: Was that for adding detail to the big waffle blocks?

807
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,176
Speaker 0: No, they were incompatible.

808
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:32,545
Speaker 0: They were just like a smaller scale.

809
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:34,859
Speaker 1: They were basically- So I hate that when the shit's incompatible.

810
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,950
Speaker 1: Like why isn't Duplo compatible with Lego?

811
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,868
Speaker 0: They kind of were.

812
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:38,345
Speaker 0: No.

813
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,106
Speaker 0: I used them.

814
00:38:39,991 --> 00:38:40,954
Speaker 0: You know why I used them?

815
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:46,030
Speaker 0: The Duplos were the old cyclopean ruins of ancient giant civilizations.

816
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,394
Speaker 1: They're not compatible.

817
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:49,678
Speaker 1: They really got to work on that.

818
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,910
Speaker 1: I think that what they should do for Duplo, right, is because you get a Duplo and like you got a big Duplo.

819
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,596
Speaker 1: And it's got like eight big circles on it, right?

820
00:38:56,616 --> 00:39:02,510
Speaker 1: What they should do is they should just make Duplo just have Lego sized dots on top, right?

821
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,135
Speaker 1: So it's just, it is a Lego.

822
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,000
Speaker 1: It's just fucking big, right?

823
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:09,470
Speaker 1: Then it would be way more awesome and Lego would be compatible with it.

824
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,857
Speaker 1: It would just be, you know, Lego pieces that were gigantic.

825
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:16,590
Speaker 1: And it would actually help you out with your Lego later on when you grow, you graduate.

826
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,054
Speaker 1: Because then you want to build a big castle, like big.

827
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,497
Speaker 1: You just do blow it up.

828
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:27,430
Speaker 1: You get to forget, you know, instead of having a million small Legos to build a big flat wall, it is just a lot of pieces that make a mess.

829
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,211
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:31,421
Speaker 0: Of course, if you're going to make a big thing, I mean, like the waffle blocks are like this big.

831
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,103
Speaker 0: I'm gesturing.

832
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,370
Speaker 0: No one else can see, but they're like, they're gigantic.

833
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,956
Speaker 1: Yeah.

834
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:36,433
Speaker 1: All right.

835
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,884
Speaker 1: Did you have any other non-Legos?

836
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,510
Speaker 1: Because I had- I had quite a few.

837
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:47,029
Speaker 0: Actually, my favorite thing with waffle blocks though, which was always dangerous, was I'd make the tallest stairway I could make and then climb it until I broke it.

838
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:49,330
Speaker 0: Or turn it into bridges over gaps.

839
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,830
Speaker 1: If you made it too tall, wouldn't you hurt yourself?

840
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,029
Speaker 0: Yes, I hurt myself often.

841
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,323
Speaker 1: I guess that makes them the most dangerous non-Lego, right?

842
00:39:57,343 --> 00:39:58,830
Speaker 1: Because the other ones are not dangerous at all.

843
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,670
Speaker 0: I would argue that actually the Tinker Toys were the most dangerous.

844
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:02,074
Speaker 1: What?

845
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:02,387
Speaker 1: How so?

846
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:08,890
Speaker 0: Because they consisted of hard, brittle, easily snapped into basically stake pieces of wood.

847
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,318
Speaker 1: They're little tiny sticks.

848
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,590
Speaker 1: They're no more dangerous than pick-ups.

849
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,041
Speaker 1: They're like pick-up sticks.

850
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:13,790
Speaker 1: They're not dangerous.

851
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,369
Speaker 0: Pick-up sticks are reasonably dangerous.

852
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,906
Speaker 1: Or what's that game where you pull the sticks out and the marbles fall down?

853
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:18,530
Speaker 1: Same sticks.

854
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,698
Speaker 0: No, they were wood.

855
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:23,950
Speaker 1: They actually, if you broke one in half- Not like- My pick-up sticks are wooden.

856
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,569
Speaker 0: If you broke these in half, you could stab a kid right through the chest with it.

857
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,010
Speaker 1: Well, you had a serious Tinker Toy then.

858
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,170
Speaker 1: I think that's just the way they were.

859
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 1: I never saw a Tinker Toy that was that serious.

860
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,137
Speaker 0: You ever snap one in half?

861
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,509
Speaker 0: They snap into basically a stiletto.

862
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,911
Speaker 1: Alrighty.

863
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:40,510
Speaker 1: I see that you are much practiced with stabbing.

864
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,926
Speaker 1: You have a third sibling that was murdered.

865
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:47,021
Speaker 1: I don't know.

866
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:53,090
Speaker 1: The other ones I had to- If I think back, the ones I actually used quite often were Lincoln Logs.

867
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,910
Speaker 1: Really, you couldn't do anything with Lincoln Logs except make log cabins.

868
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,730
Speaker 0: Why was it so satisfying, though?

869
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:01,865
Speaker 1: The only pieces you had were long, short.

870
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,530
Speaker 1: You had the one that was half, so it was flat on the bottom.

871
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,074
Speaker 0: Oh, I had more.

872
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:09,149
Speaker 0: You had the green slats.

873
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,689
Speaker 1: I had the green slats and the plastic things that held together the green slats.

874
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:13,789
Speaker 0: See, I didn't use those.

875
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:14,509
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

876
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,130
Speaker 0: Those were wussy, but the sizes were- How did you hold your roof together?

877
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,610
Speaker 0: You know the sizes, there were the three long ones with the notch in the middle and the two ends.

878
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,484
Speaker 1: Well, there were three long ones.

879
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:23,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

880
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the two long ones, like the short ones, and there's the one long ones.

881
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:28,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one longs, right?

882
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,130
Speaker 1: I forgot about those, so you mentioned them, but yeah, I do remember them.

883
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,748
Speaker 0: So, I would use those to make columns.

884
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:34,368
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

885
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:44,950
Speaker 0: And basically, I'd use those to make structures that had awnings and arches coming out of them, or I'd have a deck three stories up with a column coming all the way down.

886
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,079
Speaker 1: See, my problem is I just didn't have enough Lincoln Logs.

887
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:49,288
Speaker 1: I pretty much had one log cabin, and that was it.

888
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,876
Speaker 0: I also had four long ones.

889
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:55,790
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

890
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:55,999
Speaker 1: Yeah.

891
00:41:56,331 --> 00:42:06,290
Speaker 1: I didn't have any, so I obviously, I just had a set that was like a single log cabin set, so I couldn't really expand a lot with my Lincoln Logs, but now I wish I had more.

892
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,410
Speaker 0: See, so what I would do with them is I usually make- Do they still make that shit?

893
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:10,787
Speaker 0: I'd assume so.

894
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:11,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

895
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:20,590
Speaker 0: I'd make big structures, but instead of using the slat holding plastic, I would put the slats flat across the top and build another structure on top of that one.

896
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,113
Speaker 1: Oh.

897
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:23,758
Speaker 0: I fucking love my Lincoln Logs.

898
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,868
Speaker 0: And then I'd put a firecracker at the base.

899
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:36,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Lincoln Logs, they don't get enough respect or attention, but the fact that we both had them and both liked them and used them a lot, pretty much second to Lego, I was using Lincoln Logs.

900
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

901
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,806
Speaker 1: You know?

902
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:37,720
Speaker 1: I don't know.

903
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,729
Speaker 1: I had- And all I was doing was building the same log cabin over and over again.

904
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:49,850
Speaker 0: See, what I really do is I don't remember the names of really any of these products, but I would combine my Legos, but I can't talk about any of the Lego, obviously, so I'll skip that.

905
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:53,210
Speaker 0: I'd make Lego cities, but I had micro machines.

906
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,730
Speaker 1: Micro machines don't count.

907
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,796
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but here's what I'd do.

908
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,829
Speaker 0: So I'd use the micro machine like villages, right?

909
00:42:58,471 --> 00:43:01,470
Speaker 0: And I'd connect them to this road building system that I had.

910
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 0: that was just like this third party completely independent toy where you'd connect like these roads together.

911
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,450
Speaker 0: It had intersections and lanes and everything.

912
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,610
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, I mean, I had this particular micro- Ah, but here, I'll link it to the stuff.

913
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:22,029
Speaker 0: So I'd use those and I'd interface them finally with the wee waffle blocks and the wee waffle blocks would be used to make the suburbs.

914
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:30,490
Speaker 0: And I'd basically make this gigantic heterogeneous city between hot wheels and road systems and micro machines and waffle blocks and Legos.

915
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:38,590
Speaker 1: I actually had this one particular micro machine set, right, where you bought them individually for like five bucks, which is like the easiest toy to get.

916
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you could connect them all together.

917
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,162
Speaker 1: Because every time you go to the store, you're like, "Hey, mom, buy me one of those for 10 bucks.

918
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:43,827
Speaker 1: Hey, buy me one of

919
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:43,988
Speaker 1: those.".

920
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,810
Speaker 1: And then you eventually get so many of them, you can connect them all together.

921
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,470
Speaker 1: Did you ever get the two city centerpiece units?

922
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,950
Speaker 1: No, my brother had the big van that opened up.

923
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,330
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we had the van and there was another one.

924
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,830
Speaker 0: And we combined those with the little ones and everything else to make an entire city.

925
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,815
Speaker 1: But I had these little gray plastic rectangles and they folded in half.

926
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:10,928
Speaker 1: And they had all these accessories that you'd put inside when you fold it in half and they would seal it.

927
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:18,470
Speaker 1: And you'd open it up, like in a gas station, for example, and you would open it up and you'd put these decals on there and the gas station pieces would come out.

928
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,709
Speaker 1: You'd put them on top.

929
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:21,270
Speaker 1: And then you had these little cars.

930
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:29,270
Speaker 1: So every set came with a highway intersection and some set pieces and some cars.

931
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,650
Speaker 1: And you just kept getting enough of these.

932
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,748
Speaker 1: It was like the greatest deal.

933
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,750
Speaker 0: I remember the guy would talk really fast in all the commercials and that was how I would sell them.

934
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:35,749
Speaker 0: Remember that guy?

935
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,109
Speaker 1: All right, so let's go to things that are actually, you know.

936
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:47,290
Speaker 0: The point was that I'd take the wee waffle blocks, but they were like one aspect of a basement-filling city that I would build over the course of an entire weekend.

937
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,170
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's, you know, it's like no one had enough of a single toy to go all out.

938
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:59,750
Speaker 1: You had to combine your toys, you know, and your different constructing things in some way to go large, right?

939
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,002
Speaker 1: You know, unless you're rich, you didn't have so much Lego.

940
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:04,910
Speaker 1: you could just cover the whole fucking basement, you know.

941
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,670
Speaker 1: You only had enough Lego to build like a few castles.

942
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:12,230
Speaker 1: So if you wanted to add something in there, you had to add something in there with some non-Lego.

943
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,789
Speaker 1: Because, you know, you had this Lincoln Log sitting there.

944
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,190
Speaker 1: It's like, well, I can't just ignore that shit, right?

945
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,770
Speaker 1: Just let it sit in the closet, you know.

946
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:20,550
Speaker 1: I don't have enough Lego to do what I want.

947
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:22,228
Speaker 1: I got to bust something else out.

948
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,172
Speaker 1: Now, let's see.

949
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:27,970
Speaker 1: The only other two, I barely had any of it, but the Play Mobile.

950
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:29,267
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

951
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,330
Speaker 1: Because Play Mobile really, you don't build so much with it, but it's like it competes with the Lego men, right?

952
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:41,230
Speaker 1: And the thing with Play Mobile is that it has pretty much anything you can imagine, they got it, right?

953
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,220
Speaker 1: Pirates, they got it.

954
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,090
Speaker 1: Ninja, they got it.

955
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,628
Speaker 0: But because it was like 60% compatible with Lego...

956
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,408
Speaker 1: Zombie, they got it.

957
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,590
Speaker 1: It was kind of...

958
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,509
Speaker 0: I would take the weapons and like file them down a little bit to get them to work.

959
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,790
Speaker 1: Play Mobile's really more about the guys than it is about the building, you know.

960
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,850
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I mean, they just have so many freaking sets.

961
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,288
Speaker 1: Like, you can't imagine like a single thing that they do not have.

962
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:08,410
Speaker 1: You know, if it's like fucking helicopter, fucking army, fucking just like wizards.

963
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,870
Speaker 1: And it's like they must sit there and think of every possible setting for any possible story you could possibly imagine.

964
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,749
Speaker 1: And any possible character you would need in that setting and any possible building you would need in that setting, there's a Play Mobile set for it.

965
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:28,730
Speaker 1: You know, whereas Lego tends to stick to a setting and just sort of make, you know, the full like a whole run on it.

966
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:32,790
Speaker 1: You know, Play Mobile will just make like one or two things per setting.

967
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:34,430
Speaker 1: Like maybe a big, a medium, and a small.

968
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,209
Speaker 1: And then they'll do as many settings as they can.

969
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,208
Speaker 1: Whereas Lego does just a few settings.

970
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,889
Speaker 1: And then they concentrate on them real hard.

971
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,370
Speaker 1: Like, let's make a hundred castle sets.

972
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,605
Speaker 1: Whereas Play Mobile's got like... We got three castles.

973
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:45,910
Speaker 1: We're good.

974
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,090
Speaker 0: One thing that I had, I don't remember what it was called, but it was a whole series that eventually died out.

975
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:57,310
Speaker 0: It was basically eye beams and towers and all this kind of stuff that would construct together.

976
00:46:57,753 --> 00:46:59,889
Speaker 0: Like you could make all sorts of different structures with them.

977
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,438
Speaker 0: And you could combine the sets.

978
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,769
Speaker 0: They were all compatible with each other.

979
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,750
Speaker 0: But you'd make like a huge structure, like a radio broadcasting tower or a skyscraper.

980
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:13,310
Speaker 0: And then they gave you like these four different, basically, bombs that would destroy them.

981
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:13,808
Speaker 0: What?

982
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:14,947
Speaker 0: They were designed...

983
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,150
Speaker 1: This isn't what I was going to talk about.

984
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,290
Speaker 0: No, but you could build them like Lincoln Logs or K'Nex or anything.

985
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,930
Speaker 0: Because, you know kids, you'd eventually build like a gigantic tower out of something.

986
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:24,889
Speaker 0: And then you'd destroy it.

987
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,170
Speaker 0: And you're interested in like the way it destroyed.

988
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,550
Speaker 0: Imagine a system, like a toy, that was designed to be destroyed.

989
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,850
Speaker 0: And in fact was designed to where when you tried to destroy it, it fell apart in an awesome way.

990
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,428
Speaker 1: I never heard of such a toy.

991
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,130
Speaker 0: I had every set of it and all my friends did too.

992
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,870
Speaker 0: They were huge among like my play group in like second grade.

993
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,130
Speaker 0: I have no idea what they were called.

994
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,630
Speaker 0: The first set was the simplest.

995
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,865
Speaker 0: It was just like eye beams and connectors for them.

996
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:49,590
Speaker 0: They were like brown.

997
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:51,470
Speaker 0: And then they got more and more complex.

998
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,250
Speaker 0: One was like this white and orange radio tower.

999
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,329
Speaker 0: One was like an oil rig kind of thing.

1000
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:57,202
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

1001
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,118
Speaker 0: It was pretty fucking badass.

1002
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,149
Speaker 0: I need someone out there to tell me what it was.

1003
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other thing I had a lot of was constructs, right?

1004
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,149
Speaker 1: I don't know how many people out there know constructs.

1005
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,490
Speaker 1: But basically the way it works, you have these plastic pieces, right?

1006
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:13,570
Speaker 1: That are just sort of long and of various different lengths and colors.

1007
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:18,010
Speaker 1: And then they have at the ends of each piece is a place to snap.

1008
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,930
Speaker 1: And they give you these little tiny square pieces.

1009
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,549
Speaker 1: And you basically can, you know, a square piece has a connector on all eight sides.

1010
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,550
Speaker 1: All six sides, not eight sides.

1011
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:28,631
Speaker 1: Right?

1012
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:32,110
Speaker 1: So you can connect, you know, these long pieces, the beams.

1013
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:35,070
Speaker 1: And you basically put a connector at every joint.

1014
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,309
Speaker 1: And you can just go nuts.

1015
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,530
Speaker 1: And sometimes they'll like give you a piece of plastic that you can like snap to fill in one of the sides.

1016
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:44,030
Speaker 1: And then like I had the best set.

1017
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,530
Speaker 1: I had like this one where there's a spaceman and he had a spaceship.

1018
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,610
Speaker 1: And there's an alien and he had a spaceship.

1019
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:51,670
Speaker 1: And they're like totally like the coolest looking alien dudes.

1020
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,730
Speaker 1: They were totally evil.

1021
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,790
Speaker 1: And they gave you like this cool, like before Lego did the outer space.

1022
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,970
Speaker 1: Like this set the tone of the outer space style for that kind of stuff.

1023
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,169
Speaker 1: And, you know, the best thing was because you had the plastic pieces to fill in.

1024
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:09,770
Speaker 1: You can actually make like these big surfaces with them.

1025
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,650
Speaker 1: So you could do is you could like make sort of like a, you know, a flat surface.

1026
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,970
Speaker 1: And then a more elevated flat surface and then something else.

1027
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,450
Speaker 1: And then you could, you know, use that as a platform.

1028
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,429
Speaker 1: And you put your big flat Lego bases on top of that.

1029
00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:24,175
Speaker 1: Right.

1030
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:25,270
Speaker 1: To keep them off the floor.

1031
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:30,150
Speaker 1: And actually you could put like a castle up high or a tree and then a castle down low.

1032
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:31,148
Speaker 1: And then a boat.

1033
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:34,190
Speaker 1: You know, you get you can make it as like the foundation for the Lego.

1034
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,370
Speaker 1: It was a very, very good combination there.

1035
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:43,830
Speaker 1: It was also had a motorized thing for it, but I never really, you know, I never really had great success with anything that was motorized.

1036
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:44,987
Speaker 1: You know, I never really.

1037
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:46,986
Speaker 0: Because they're always got a chintzy.

1038
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:47,430
Speaker 0: They never work.

1039
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,390
Speaker 1: The Lego Technic worked, but I didn't have motorized ones.

1040
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,010
Speaker 1: I had cranked gear ones, you know, but none of my motorized things work.

1041
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,830
Speaker 1: And I think it's because I never got the more expensive motorized sets.

1042
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,549
Speaker 1: I always got the cheapest possible ones that sucked ass.

1043
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,569
Speaker 1: I didn't get like the Mindstorm that actually works.

1044
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,530
Speaker 1: You know, I got like if I can put 2D batteries in here and push a button and it spins around.

1045
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,355
Speaker 1: Gee, thanks.

1046
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:10,369
Speaker 1: That helps.

1047
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,010
Speaker 1: I think that's all the ones I had.

1048
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:17,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, we couldn't come up with much else to talk about.

1049
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,729
Speaker 1: You didn't have any others?

1050
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,869
Speaker 0: Not that I can recall offhand anymore.

1051
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, constructs were...

1052
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,890
Speaker 0: No, I suddenly was reminded of a toy that I think almost everyone's forgotten about.

1053
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:30,790
Speaker 0: Remember the Nerf fencing system?

1054
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:31,405
Speaker 1: No.

1055
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:35,589
Speaker 0: It was gigantic, awesomely constructed Nerf swords.

1056
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,730
Speaker 0: And the like the hilt had basically four targets sticking out of it.

1057
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:43,810
Speaker 0: And you had to push in the four targets on your opponent's sword.

1058
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,430
Speaker 1: It's like the vaguest of vague recollections.

1059
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,470
Speaker 1: It's like so vague, I don't even know if it's...

1060
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,730
Speaker 0: Basically, I remember having this and it's suddenly like all these memories of like playing with it.

1061
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,869
Speaker 0: And getting frustrated with trying to hit the targets, just hitting my brother over the head.

1062
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,530
Speaker 1: We had to look it up on YouTube.

1063
00:50:59,056 --> 00:50:59,185
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1064
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,680
Speaker 1: Cause you know there's gonna be a video of it.

1065
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:01,910
Speaker 1: Or a commercial.

1066
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,710
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1067
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,830
