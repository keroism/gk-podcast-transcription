1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,728
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, June 15th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,029
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:13,879
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,744
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:24,300
Speaker 1: We are going to talk about cartoon cartoons from around 1995 to 2003.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,197
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:32,450
Speaker 1: So for a long time, you know, before COVID, my life was very different, as many people could say.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,170
Speaker 1: But, you know, I used to go to an office every single day and I used my city bike, the like bike share in New York.

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,730
Speaker 1: Was not nearly as widely deployed in the past as it is now.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,715
Speaker 1: There weren't as many docks.

11
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,123
Speaker 1: It didn't cover as much of the city.

12
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:46,350
Speaker 1: There weren't that many bikes.

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,870
Speaker 1: So I used my bike for a lot of things.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,310
Speaker 1: As a result, I never put like a rack on the back of it or any of this other stuff because I use this bike so often.

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,990
Speaker 1: And most of the use of it was like day to day, short distance biking.

16
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,910
Speaker 1: And only occasionally, like every other weekend or so, would I do a long ride.

17
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:06,670
Speaker 1: So I didn't want to overburden the bike with a bunch of extra weight.

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,230
Speaker 1: Now, fast forward to 2022.

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:20,070
Speaker 1: I use the bike share for pretty much all short bike rides, because if you don't, your bike will get fucking stolen because it's, you know, New York in 2022.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,430
Speaker 0: It depends, but mostly.

21
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,534
Speaker 1: I mean, I have had two bikes stolen.

22
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:29,429
Speaker 1: Two thirds of all the bikes I have owned as an adult have been stolen since I moved to New York City.

23
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:36,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've managed to avoid that by not leaving bikes lying around ever.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,928
Speaker 1: But now I'm at a point where my main bike, I really only use it for rides that are like more than 40 or 50 miles.

25
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,650
Speaker 1: Like I don't even get that bike out of the basement unless we're going a long distance.

26
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:55,090
Speaker 1: So I find I just put a rack on it because if I'm biking that far, I don't want to carry a backpack.

27
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,583
Speaker 1: So I got a bike rack on the back.

28
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:57,330
Speaker 1: I got a nice one.

29
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:58,774
Speaker 1: And I got some panniers.

30
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:02,123
Speaker 1: And I got to say, this is a trend.

31
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:04,650
Speaker 1: I've said this a lot about things that I buy.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,190
Speaker 1: This has been a theme on Geek Nights of either buy the best of something or the barely minimum viable piece of crap of something.

33
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,101
Speaker 1: Very rarely do you want something in between those two.

34
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,090
Speaker 1: I got the best panniers.

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,855
Speaker 1: And I've learned something kind of specific.

36
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:33,930
Speaker 1: If you want bike bags or car accessories like a bike rack for a car, like basically hardware for things like sports, it's not like there's just one company that makes the good ones.

37
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,778
Speaker 1: There is one country that makes the good ones.

38
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,664
Speaker 1: Then that country is Germany.

39
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,410
Speaker 1: France is a close second.

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,378
Speaker 1: Amsterdam and like the nether, like there's good stuff there, too.

41
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:48,490
Speaker 1: But Germans like Thule and Ortlieb.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,970
Speaker 1: Holy shit is the stuff they make just better in every conceivable way.

43
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,530
Speaker 0: There's not necessarily a lot of competition in those areas, right?

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,456
Speaker 1: And these are highly specialized.

45
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,202
Speaker 1: Most people don't need bike panniers.

46
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:04,556
Speaker 1: And if they do, they don't need to like, they don't need the best panniers.

47
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,990
Speaker 1: But these Ortlieb panniers that I got, they're so light.

48
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:12,462
Speaker 1: It's hard to believe they're as sturdy as they are for how little they weigh.

49
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,529
Speaker 1: I'm really excited about these things.

50
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,836
Speaker 0: I mean, it is sort of annoying, right?

51
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:24,049
Speaker 0: That like when you have, if you look at say a hobby like computers, right?

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:32,390
Speaker 0: There's, you go on Newegg or wherever and it's like there's, you know, obviously Newegg, you know, there's plenty of vendors to choose from.

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,082
Speaker 0: But it's like there's just so many of everything that you could possibly need, right?

54
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:40,010
Speaker 0: So much competition, like so many different video card companies.

55
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,120
Speaker 0: It's like any weird possible thing you can get easily, right?

56
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:49,810
Speaker 0: But cycling is a huge thing worldwide, right?

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:58,570
Speaker 0: Yet, if you want to get stuff, you know, and it's not just, you know, you know, some things you can just get right pretty easily.

58
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:06,774
Speaker 0: But for, you know, other things, it's like, wow, why can't, you know, it's like there's a lot of companies making bike shoes, but it's like, there's not, where can you go?

59
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:11,830
Speaker 0: that actually has like a full selection of many brands and many sizes and many styles.

60
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,570
Speaker 1: There used to be a place, I used to get good bike shoes on Zappos, but they pretty much went to crap.

61
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,730
Speaker 1: So even the fancy bike shops in New York City, like REI or Paragon, I tried to go to like get new bike shoes, get Emily some bike shoes.

62
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,505
Speaker 1: They have like three options.

63
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:26,889
Speaker 1: That's it.

64
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:27,472
Speaker 0: Yeah.

65
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,556
Speaker 0: They have like a handful.

66
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:32,410
Speaker 0: So they have some, but the selection they have is just like a few, right?

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,901
Speaker 0: They don't have like a large, you know, and it's not just a supply chain thing.

68
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,690
Speaker 0: You know, some cases it is, but it's like, no, it's always sort of been like this.

69
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:50,530
Speaker 1: Also, what I found is that especially with a lot of bike stuff, most bikers don't care that much because whatever they get for whatever thing, like I want a basket or I want a bag.

70
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,858
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter.

71
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,710
Speaker 1: They get some top heat garbage and it's good enough.

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:08,050
Speaker 1: But if you have a specialized use case or you care a lot about some specific aspect, like I wanted panniers that are 100% waterproof because I'm going to be biking like to Rochester from Queens with these things.

73
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,650
Speaker 1: Like I got to put my clothes and like stuff in them like it's a suitcase.

74
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:17,890
Speaker 1: If it rains on like Tuesday on that bike trip, I can't just not keep biking.

75
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,950
Speaker 1: So already actually waterproof is a big step beyond kind of waterproof.

76
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,269
Speaker 1: And that applies to most things, not just bike bags.

77
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:31,850
Speaker 1: So or like I want to really easily be able to put them on the bike and take them off the bike.

78
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,170
Speaker 1: Not everyone would care about that, but I care about that a lot.

79
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:41,950
Speaker 1: But I got to tell you, a lot of these bike bags look great, are great, not easy to actually remove from your bike.

80
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,785
Speaker 1: The ones that are easy to remove, but also don't just fall off.

81
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,930
Speaker 1: A lot more expensive.

82
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:55,650
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the Timbuktu one I have, you know, it's relatively easy, relatively easy to remove, but it's still somewhat of a pain, right?

83
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,590
Speaker 0: It's like you hook these two clips and then you got to go down low with a little velcro strappy thing.

84
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:06,430
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, I go to Ortlieb, this highly specialized like German company that makes bike panniers.

85
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,222
Speaker 0: Pretty much anyone you see who has panniers, those are the ones they almost always have.

86
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,370
Speaker 0: I rarely see another brand out there.

87
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,073
Speaker 1: Oh, even funnier.

88
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,210
Speaker 1: Well, I see people with these shadow top peak ones, but they look like crap.

89
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,010
Speaker 1: So the other day I was biking with Emily in Proxmant Park and out of nowhere, I see the pannier I want to buy on someone's bike.

90
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,478
Speaker 1: And I point at it.

91
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,910
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, that's the one I'm thinking about getting.

92
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,678
Speaker 1: And the guy like notices and he bikes up to it.

93
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,744
Speaker 1: He's like, I see you checking out my Ortlieb's.

94
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,168
Speaker 1: I've had these things for 11 years.

95
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:33,690
Speaker 1: They're the best.

96
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:34,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

97
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

98
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,550
Speaker 0: That's a company that makes a really strong bag.

99
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

100
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:41,163
Speaker 1: So that's my exciting story.

101
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,308
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

102
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,669
Speaker 0: You bought a bag.

103
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,736
Speaker 1: I bought a bag.

104
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:47,470
Speaker 1: That's exciting times for him and Scott.

105
00:06:50,271 --> 00:07:06,250
Speaker 1: So there is some news, regardless of any other factors around Made in Abyss, like the Magakabian weird, the manga being something I don't recommend you read, but the anime, I am invested enough to where I want to know what the deal is.

106
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:11,945
Speaker 0: I mean, I think I, it's like, I watched it back when we did an episode.

107
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:13,950
Speaker 0: So you can search geek nights and figure out when that episode was.

108
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,570
Speaker 1: We had some theories.

109
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,712
Speaker 0: That's when I watched it.

110
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:22,070
Speaker 0: And I liked it enough that I watched that whole first season and I have positive memories of what I watched.

111
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,737
Speaker 0: And I actually remember quite a bit of the content, right?

112
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,350
Speaker 0: It's like they were in a city on top of a hole and like an orphanage.

113
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,884
Speaker 1: And then the hole is the last unexplored part of the planet.

114
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,230
Speaker 1: And there's shit down there.

115
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,880
Speaker 0: There are people who go down the hole, but most people don't because that's a bad idea.

116
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,590
Speaker 0: And there's some elevator to the bottom of the hole where evil experiments happen.

117
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,217
Speaker 1: It's a lot like deep sea diving.

118
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:45,549
Speaker 1: It's easy to go down, but it's difficult to come back up.

119
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:48,776
Speaker 0: The kids had some reason to go down the hole.

120
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:55,470
Speaker 0: I forget what that was, but they're going to go down there and then they stop at like a house where some evil shit happens.

121
00:07:56,411 --> 00:08:08,650
Speaker 1: Also the broader meta story of whatever's down there, like there are ancient skeletons of humans buried everywhere, praying in a weird position and they're all facing this hole.

122
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,970
Speaker 1: And that's like the meta story of what's up with that hole.

123
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,082
Speaker 0: And then they stop at a forest cave and the forest cave is nicer.

124
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:20,170
Speaker 0: Some good stuff happens there, but that's where the season ended.

125
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,913
Speaker 0: And I was like, what?

126
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:24,269
Speaker 0: I thought I was going to get a complete story in that first season and I wasn't.

127
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:34,249
Speaker 0: And then like Rim said, yeah, I heard from other people that the manga is really effed up with like children's stuff.

128
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:34,850
Speaker 0: It's not good.

129
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,198
Speaker 0: It's not good stuff.

130
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:37,570
Speaker 1: Do not read that manga.

131
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,792
Speaker 0: You can read on Wikipedia.

132
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:46,210
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know from firsthand experience, but I just been warned and I confirmed with like Wikipedia and whatnot.

133
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:55,250
Speaker 1: Everyone who has interacted with both has said to the effect, the anime cut a lot of that shit out and toned everything down and made this palatable.

134
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,491
Speaker 0: Yeah.

135
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:11,430
Speaker 0: But you can tell that the manga creator clearly has some fetishes, which like to each their own, but the certain lines that are, you know, not safe for most people.

136
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:21,170
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I can watch like a Ichi the Killer, but I'm not going to read the whatever abyss manga.

137
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:30,410
Speaker 1: So my news is the second season of the anime, which is coming and is going to premiere on July 6th, like in Japan real soon.

138
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,701
Speaker 1: There's a third promo video.

139
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:34,210
Speaker 1: that's basically a trailer for the season.

140
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,970
Speaker 0: Is it going to be the end of the thing, though?

141
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:46,870
Speaker 1: Because it's like, so this trailer shows what looks like ancient times, some humans looking for a lost city, finding the city.

142
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:51,169
Speaker 1: The city clearly looks like a crashed spaceship at the bottom of a hole.

143
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,328
Speaker 0: And it makes sense.

144
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,210
Speaker 1: And it keeps showing these humans praying in a very particular way.

145
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,259
Speaker 0: Is it a?

146
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,350
Speaker 0: is it a prequel to The Prince of Nothing?

147
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,107
Speaker 0: Is that what it is?

148
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,032
Speaker 1: You know what?

149
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:09,150
Speaker 1: I originally posited that this show, what it what it's about is very similar to what The Prince of Nothing is about.

150
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,570
Speaker 1: And having seen this trailer, I'm going to triple down on that assumption.

151
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:17,870
Speaker 1: Just like Orbital Children is the prequel to the culture books.

152
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:27,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, I don't know if I'm actually going to go, even though I really enjoyed the first TV series when I watched it, that I have some enough memories of it.

153
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,949
Speaker 0: It's like it's been so long that it's like.

154
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:36,010
Speaker 1: I thought that, too, but I watched the trailer and suddenly all the questions I had in my brain came back to the surface.

155
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,890
Speaker 0: I think I have to rewatch the first season, which I don't really want to do either.

156
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,369
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know.

157
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:41,772
Speaker 1: We'll see.

158
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,870
Speaker 1: But I'll watch this when it comes out.

159
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,108
Speaker 1: If you don't watch it, I'll watch it.

160
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:52,830
Speaker 1: And I'll be able to tell you pretty quickly, much like with Attack on Titan, is what's in the basement worth it or is this some bullshit?

161
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,347
Speaker 1: Because Attack on Titan, it is definitely not worth it.

162
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,656
Speaker 0: Anyway.

163
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:02,470
Speaker 1: In some other news that's very similar, we already talked about this.

164
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:10,810
Speaker 1: Not going to press it, but you know, we now have the G Kids English language theatrical trailer.

165
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,689
Speaker 1: It just dropped today for this film.

166
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:17,607
Speaker 1: It's going to screen in the US on August 12th.

167
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,850
Speaker 1: So two months from now, we can see, you know, in theaters or by whatever means.

168
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:27,810
Speaker 1: I feel like I'll be able to put on a mask and go see this at like the Museum of the Mahoo-ing Image or whatever.

169
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,930
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if they usually don't show it there on the first run.

170
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,129
Speaker 0: We'll have to see what happens.

171
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:32,751
Speaker 1: Yep.

172
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:36,609
Speaker 1: I didn't see where it's going to open in the US, where we can see it in New York.

173
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:41,370
Speaker 0: G Kids usually has a website where you can buy tickets and find theaters near you.

174
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,346
Speaker 0: Gonna go see this.

175
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,710
Speaker 1: Having watched this trailer now in English, I'm extremely excited about Inoue.

176
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,249
Speaker 1: Hot damn.

177
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:57,810
Speaker 0: I do, you know, just on the more general, still hottest topic in the land of the US anime industry, you know, the Funimation Crunchyroll merger.

178
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,475
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

179
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,190
Speaker 0: I just, right, I never want to, you know, I think we just, we emphasize it all the time.

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,150
Speaker 0: But, you know, anime movies are where it's at, obviously, right?

181
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,195
Speaker 0: There aren't that many of them each year.

182
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:15,665
Speaker 0: that aren't just Pokemon Movie 100 or One Piece Movie 1000 or whatever.

183
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,554
Speaker 1: Digimon 50.

184
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:25,510
Speaker 0: And in terms of the United States, they're pretty much all brought over by G Kids.

185
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Speaker 0: G Kids is the distributor, publisher, whatever they technically are, right?

186
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,470
Speaker 0: They're the ones who bring over the anime movies to the United States.

187
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:39,070
Speaker 1: On one hand, I don't want a monopoly on these things, but on the other hand, they are fucking knocking it out of the park.

188
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,950
Speaker 0: But the point is, G Kids is not Funimation.

189
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,210
Speaker 0: It's not Crunchyroll, right?

190
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:55,370
Speaker 0: It is pretty much, you know, they do, they obviously bring in other animated works from other parts of the world as well, which I think are not, don't get enough play.

191
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:59,229
Speaker 0: Because, you know, pretty much if G Kids has their hands on it, it's probably worth your time.

192
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:08,170
Speaker 0: But, you know, just people, you know, people just, I think they compartmentalize the movie and TV parts of the anime world.

193
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,790
Speaker 0: And it's like, actually, you're talking about this company, you know, Funimation, Crunchyroll, whatever, controlling all the anime market.

194
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,943
Speaker 0: But actually, G Kids is right over here, guys.

195
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:18,849
Speaker 0: Here it is.

196
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:25,850
Speaker 1: Sadly, I canceled my Crunchyroll because I'm watching a lot of non-anime cartoons lately.

197
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:27,191
Speaker 0: Yep.

198
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,339
Speaker 0: I mean, I just, I canceled every single streaming service.

199
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,509
Speaker 0: I have no, I mean, except for Amazon Prime Video, which I just have because, you know.

200
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:35,192
Speaker 1: Yep.

201
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,330
Speaker 1: Well, there is still a bunch of stuff I'm actively watching on Netflix.

202
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:47,670
Speaker 1: Some anime, a bunch of Star Trek, oh, Star Trek's leaving Netflix for that Paramount thing, which, eh, not super jazzed about that.

203
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,810
Speaker 0: I mean, like, there are, like, every streaming service might have one or two things that I might watch.

204
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,790
Speaker 1: Oh, I only keep the streaming service if we are actively watching something and when we finish it.

205
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,350
Speaker 0: Like, I got HBO Max, I watched a nice handful of stuff, piles of stuff on there, right?

206
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,210
Speaker 0: And then I canceled it.

207
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,110
Speaker 0: And then it's like, yeah, then it's like, alright, that's it, cancel.

208
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,848
Speaker 0: I'm gonna resubscribe.

209
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:11,610
Speaker 0: I'm waiting.

210
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,188
Speaker 1: When, uh, our flag means Death 2 comes out.

211
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:24,650
Speaker 0: There is no single streaming service out there that has enough things for me to want to pay for a whole month and watch it all, so I'm just waiting until that happens.

212
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,274
Speaker 1: I sadly think for us-.

213
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:41,950
Speaker 1: Well, I still gotta say, one of the best animated anythings I have seen in decades is Arcane, which is only on Netflix.

214
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:44,989
Speaker 1: Holy shit was that good.

215
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:55,410
Speaker 1: But you could wait because there is a season 2, so you could just wait until there's a season 2, get Netflix for a month, watch it, and then we'll do a big show on it.

216
00:14:56,131 --> 00:15:04,250
Speaker 0: I mean, it's also, you know, I think a lot of people, other than me, like, really want to watch things, like, as soon as they come out for some reason.

217
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,670
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not wine, I guess wine gets better with age.

218
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:08,390
Speaker 0: It's not milk.

219
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,989
Speaker 1: Depends on the wine.

220
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,350
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, yeah, but I'm just saying it's not milk, right?

221
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,729
Speaker 1: It's like- Cheese, cheese, milk also gets better with age.

222
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:19,849
Speaker 0: Not if it's just sitting in your fridge aging.

223
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,428
Speaker 1: I mean, wine just sitting in a bottle, like, not stored properly does not get better with age.

224
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:31,047
Speaker 0: The point is, is that movies, television, they don't change with time.

225
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,310
Speaker 0: You might change.

226
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,137
Speaker 1: You know what we're watching on Netflix right now.

227
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,890
Speaker 1: that's not, like, the cartoons I just described?

228
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:40,764
Speaker 1: Star Trek Deep Space Nine from, like, the 90s.

229
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:41,830
Speaker 1: Like, that's what we're watching.

230
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,350
Speaker 0: Well, things also don't get better with age, so just because it's old doesn't mean you should be watching.

231
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:48,671
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

232
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:50,136
Speaker 1: I'm saying there was no rush to watch it.

233
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:51,943
Speaker 1: This is just, we wanted to watch that.

234
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,549
Speaker 1: That's why we're still playing for Netflix right now.

235
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:58,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess if I like Star Trek things, I would all, you know, this, I guess that's another thing, right?

236
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,890
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you look at, there are certain properties, right?

237
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:11,650
Speaker 0: Star Trek being, like, maybe one of the top ones, that there is a pre-existing plethora of content, right?

238
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:20,370
Speaker 0: It's like Star Trek had multiple, even as someone who doesn't like Star Trek, you know, I know it had multiple TV series that were very long.

239
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:21,348
Speaker 0: Some of them.

240
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:22,588
Speaker 0: Several of them.

241
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:27,370
Speaker 1: I'll bet you, who does not watch Star Trek, could name more than one captain of a starship.

242
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,491
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

243
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:33,822
Speaker 0: Anyway, and there's many movies, right?

244
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:34,203
Speaker 0: Many.

245
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:37,130
Speaker 0: I've seen more than one, I guess.

246
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:44,030
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, and they're making more, right, at some steady-ish rate.

247
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,334
Speaker 0: In fact, it's exploded.

248
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:50,290
Speaker 1: Since Lower Decks came out, there has been a, my cup overflowed on Star Trek right now.

249
00:16:50,771 --> 00:17:02,010
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like, if you just have a thing like that, that you like, it's like, then suddenly, it's like, it's worth it for you to subscribe to a streaming service, because you can just watch and watch and watch and watch and watch, right?

250
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:16,690
Speaker 0: But there is not a single, everything that I like tends to either be a single movie, or maybe a trilogy of movies, or maybe, you know, even we talked about James Bond, it's like there's only so many James Bond movies, you can watch them all.

251
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,829
Speaker 1: If there was a James Bond specific streaming service, I would subscribe to it for a month, and then I would cancel it.

252
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,011
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

253
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:32,190
Speaker 0: It's like, there's nothing that I like, that I'm into, that has just piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff.

254
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,042
Speaker 0: It's like, and things, for example, like Galaxy Express 3-9, an anime series with hundreds of episodes, right?

255
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,668
Speaker 0: Fist of the North Star, an anime series with hundreds of episodes?

256
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:41,530
Speaker 0: I've seen them all.

257
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,273
Speaker 0: I've seen every episode of those things.

258
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:43,974
Speaker 0: I'm done, right?

259
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:47,521
Speaker 0: It's like, what are you gonna do now, right?

260
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:51,989
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and I'm not gonna watch, I'm not doing one piece in it, so...

261
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:01,110
Speaker 1: But I think you should watch Arkane more, because it is one of the best animated series of any kind to come out anywhere in the world in the last decade.

262
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,946
Speaker 0: My life is only gonna be so long, so we'll see what happens.

263
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:08,070
Speaker 1: You got any news?

264
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,409
Speaker 0: Will I dedicate part of my life to it, or not?

265
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,245
Speaker 1: You got any news?

266
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,097
Speaker 0: I don't have any news.

267
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,890
Speaker 0: There's not too much news going on, you know, it's summertime.

268
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,650
Speaker 1: Well, you've got a Geek Nite, because you did think that this was worth spending some of your limited life to consume.

269
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:38,910
Speaker 0: I did, yeah, so since I'm not working right now, and I won't be working until mid-July, and I'm working on the Geek Nite's website pretty much for my full-time job right now, and I made some significant progress today also, but, you know, I'm taking some time to read some of these books I already have on my shelf that have been sitting there unread.

270
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:48,389
Speaker 0: So I read a manga by Osamu Tezuka, right, which means you know it's gonna be good, called Wonder 3, I guess the original title might have just been W3.

271
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,666
Speaker 0: And boy, you know, I didn't, like, I thought it was gonna be about, like, three superheroes or some shit, like.

272
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:56,970
Speaker 0: I didn't actually know the plot.

273
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:06,690
Speaker 0: It's like, and once I found out the plot, it was a surprise in that it wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't a surprise in that it was an extremely Osamu Tezuka plot.

274
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,655
Speaker 0: It's like, this is the plot of a Tezuka manga, it sure is.

275
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:23,990
Speaker 0: So the plot of W3 is that there are some aliens at, like, the Milky Way Galactic Council, right, but of course Earth is primitive and barbaric, and they don't know about that, and they're not members, right, it's like Earth doesn't even know there's aliens yet.

276
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:36,510
Speaker 0: And these aliens at the Galactic Council, they look at Earth, and they're like, wow, how primitive and barbaric, should we just exterminate this planet with an anti-proton bomb because it's so awful?

277
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:40,799
Speaker 0: Let's vote, because we're democratic and everything is good here, right?

278
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,570
Speaker 0: And they vote, and it's a tie vote, spoilers, this is the first page, basically.

279
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,601
Speaker 0: Right?

280
00:19:47,901 --> 00:20:08,590
Speaker 0: So they're like, okay, I'll tell you what, we'll send three of our best aliens, right, agents, you know, the W3, to go to Earth with an anti-proton bomb, and they'll decide after a year whether to set the bomb off and leave, or to just come back.

281
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:14,590
Speaker 1: What's funny is, there is, that is superficially very similar to the plot of Wind of Amnesia.

282
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:32,730
Speaker 0: Well, the book itself, in the foreword, claims similarity to Lilo and Stitch, the way that, you know, Kimba the White Lion is similar to The Lion King, so I'll leave that up to your judgement.

283
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:39,970
Speaker 1: Once I read it, I can make that judgement, because scrolling down a little bit, I can see why that might be the case.

284
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:54,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the aliens, right, they disguise themselves as animals, they befriend a kid, there's, you know, humans fighting, right, which makes, you know, things look bad to the aliens, but obviously some of the fighting humans are good, some of the fighting humans aren't, you know, are bad.

285
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:16,650
Speaker 0: There's conflict within the village the kid lives in, in terms of, like, the evil landlord, while there's also worldwide conflict between, like, Country A and the secret Phoenix agent group or whatever, right, and everything's tied together, and there's a badass proton bomb that's scary, an anti-proton bomb that's scary as hell.

286
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:31,346
Speaker 0: And yeah, it was, if you like a Tezuka manga, and you like, you know, that kind of, it was pretty good, I enjoyed it, it's one big thick book, you just read the whole thing, you know, if you can get a copy of it.

287
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:34,390
Speaker 0: I kickstarted it a long time ago.

288
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,688
Speaker 1: I guess I'll borrow your copy.

289
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:44,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was thoroughly enjoyable, it's not like it was the best Tezuka manga ever, but, you know, it was good.

290
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,733
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

291
00:21:53,833 --> 00:22:11,970
Speaker 1: So, you know, I've mentioned this on the show before, but one thing when I travel in the US, what something me and Emily really like to do is when we can take Amtrak, you know, take the train instead of flying or driving or anything, but in particular, whenever we can, we love to take those Amtrak sleeper cars, because they're

292
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,670
Speaker 0: way- We're talking about this in the train episode.

293
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,299
Speaker 1: They're way nicer than you'd expect, and they're way cheaper than you'd expect.

294
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,950
Speaker 1: So, of course, America's train infrastructure is pathetic compared to almost the entirety of the rest of the world.

295
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,312
Speaker 1: In fact, as an aside, I learned something interesting.

296
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:47,730
Speaker 1: A big chunk of Spain, the country of Spain, almost completely uninhabited, because Spain has one of the densest rail networks on Earth, and as a result, almost everyone in Spain lives on the rail lines, and basically people just don't live in the places the trains don't go.

297
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:51,373
Speaker 1: That would be a model for the future, but I digress.

298
00:22:51,953 --> 00:23:11,530
Speaker 1: So, this is a video of someone in Japan traveling around, and they use Japan's fantastic train network, but they specifically, this video, is they ride Japan's cheapest sleeper car train, the absolute bottom of the barrel sleeper train in Japan.

299
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:20,039
Speaker 1: This is what it's like, and I gotta tell you, I would give anything for America to have something even half as good as this.

300
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:22,721
Speaker 1: It's so good.

301
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:24,563
Speaker 1: This is such a cool thing.

302
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,045
Speaker 1: This video's great.

303
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,066
Speaker 1: I encourage you to watch it.

304
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:31,090
Speaker 1: We could have this if we just had the will to have this.

305
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,009
Speaker 1: So, what do you got?

306
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:42,259
Speaker 0: Alright, so, I don't know if people outside of New York are aware, there is a place called the Morgan Library.

307
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,901
Speaker 0: Why is it called the Morgan Library?

308
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:48,787
Speaker 0: Well, it's because there was a person who you probably know, J.P.

309
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,449
Speaker 0: Morgan, like J.P.

310
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:51,410
Speaker 0: Morgan Chase Bank.

311
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,109
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the evil oligarch.

312
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:56,853
Speaker 0: Evil old wealthy dude from the early 1900s.

313
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, that dude, right?

314
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:08,746
Speaker 0: And he lived in a fucking mansion in Manhattan, and he lived in a time where there was no TV, where there was maybe some radio, maybe, right?

315
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:12,650
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there was the Broadway News Theater, right?

316
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,488
Speaker 0: You know, for being someone so wealthy, we are better entertained than J.P.

317
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:18,090
Speaker 0: Morgan was.

318
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:21,550
Speaker 1: We are better entertained than emperors from ancient times.

319
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,072
Speaker 0: Indeed, but J.P.

320
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:29,897
Speaker 0: Morgan was wealthy in the early 20th century, and thus, and late 19th century, right?

321
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:43,249
Speaker 0: And therefore, he had a giant mansion in Manhattan, and he had so many books, he built his own damn library on his own estate in Manhattan, right?

322
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:44,850
Speaker 0: That's how wealthy this dude was.

323
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:51,239
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's now a museum in the 20th, 1st century, it's a museum, right?

324
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:58,970
Speaker 0: So you can just go there, and it recently renovated, it's got a new garden, there's apparently some Roman antiquities in the garden.

325
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:08,430
Speaker 0: It's been a while since I've been there, so maybe the next time I go to the dentist, I will pay it another visit, now that it's all reopened and redone and whatnot.

326
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,194
Speaker 0: You know, it's right across the street from my dentist, so, you know.

327
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:13,576
Speaker 0: But that's not the news.

328
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:21,507
Speaker 0: The news is that one time, I think the last time I was at the Morgan Library, was because they had an exhibit of J.R.R.

329
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,550
Speaker 0: Tolkien's artworks, right?

330
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:28,316
Speaker 0: It was like a limited time exhibit, like in the upstairs area, right?

331
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:39,790
Speaker 0: And you know, some of those paintings and illustrations were things I had seen in the past, in part or in whole, you know, like the map from the front of the book, and you know, things of that nature, right?

332
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,722
Speaker 0: But many of them were artworks that I had not seen, and they had the originals there, which was, you know, it was really good.

333
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:52,370
Speaker 0: I was very happy that I took the time to go to that exhibit when it was there.

334
00:25:53,390 --> 00:26:00,895
Speaker 0: However, if you are not so fortunate enough to live within such distance, and the exhibit's not there anymore, right?

335
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:13,804
Speaker 0: If you are not so fortunate as to live near the Morgan Library during that time period where that could be seen, or if it's, I guess, on display anywhere else at any future time, well, the estate of J.R.R.

336
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:31,861
Speaker 0: Tolkien, which is an intellectual property, you know, evil organization, basically, that sues anyone who tries to do anything with any lords or any rings, or any hobbits, or anything, they have completely redone the token official, the token estate website.

337
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:39,010
Speaker 0: So, if you were to go to the official website of the token estate, right, which is, is it just tokenestate.com?

338
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's tokenestate.com.

339
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:46,475
Speaker 0: If you go there and you click on, you know, it's got many sections, right?

340
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:50,058
Speaker 0: But the section that's my thing of the day is the painting section.

341
00:26:50,118 --> 00:27:05,510
Speaker 0: If you click on that, then you can see there are illustrations, maps, and calligraphy, and pretty much everything I saw at that exhibit, they just have scanned in on this website, and you can just look at it on your computer without getting up off your ass.

342
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:23,968
Speaker 0: So, I've seen all these things in person, but at the time I saw them, there was no other way to see them without, I guess, being a member of the estate, or whatever, have access to their archives or something, but no, they're now scanned and on this website for free, you just click and look at them, there they are, right?

343
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:26,590
Speaker 0: So, enjoy.

344
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:45,006
Speaker 1: So, as a little aside, because you just made it a very clear illustration of the fantastic wealth of JP Morgan, I just want to point out that JP Morgan, if you translate that to modern day US dollars, maybe had a couple billion at most.

345
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,408
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, fucking Jeff Bezos today has 130 billion.

346
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:56,410
Speaker 1: Two orders of magnitude more wealth than the JP Morgan that did everything Scott just described.

347
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:04,279
Speaker 0: Part of that is simply because of the wealth of society as a whole, right?

348
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:12,950
Speaker 0: If you think about what was the market cap of humanity at the time, percentage-wise, JP Morgan might have been close, right?

349
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,433
Speaker 0: It just wasn't as much total wealth, right?

350
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:34,310
Speaker 0: Our society is now billions more people making and using billions more things, with billions more resources have been mined, you know, the wealth of humanity is greater, so to get a true measurement, you'd have to measure it as a percentage of the total wealth of humanity.

351
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:41,590
Speaker 1: But, simultaneously, wealth has been concentrated in the modern era increasingly into ever smaller numbers of hands.

352
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:45,070
Speaker 0: And I think it's about the same number of hands.

353
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:47,530
Speaker 1: It actually does seem to be fewer.

354
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:49,434
Speaker 0: Fewer hands?

355
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,959
Speaker 0: There were billions fewer hands existing.

356
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,450
Speaker 1: Yes, why do you think I'm a fucking communist at this point?

357
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,555
Speaker 0: Anyway, it doesn't make JP Morgan good.

358
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:06,302
Speaker 0: He collected a bunch of shit in his library, though, and you can just go check it out.

359
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:12,090
Speaker 0: You can't read the books, though, I guess you'd have to arrange it with them, but you can go in the library and look at all the books, which I've done.

360
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:18,821
Speaker 1: I guess the last thing I'd say is part of the reason people like JP Morgan did things like.

361
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:23,610
Speaker 1: that was back then, the income tax in the US was like 90% if you were that rich.

362
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:31,910
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he made a library because that was how you entertain yourself in the early 20th century and he could afford to build a whole building and fill it with books.

363
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:36,050
Speaker 1: You could also dodge taxes by doing stuff like that.

364
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:39,570
Speaker 0: And it wasn't made into a public thing until he was dead.

365
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:50,068
Speaker 1: So in the moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book Nine Fox Gambit, we will do the show on this on Thursday and then I will announce what I'm going to choose for the next book.

366
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,230
Speaker 1: I actually should decide.

367
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:53,577
Speaker 1: I haven't decided yet.

368
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,050
Speaker 1: I haven't been free to choose what book I'm going to read.

369
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,317
Speaker 0: That gives me more time.

370
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,669
Speaker 0: I had the listener decide and then I guess I'll have more time.

371
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,458
Speaker 1: Maybe I should break from sci-fi and go in a different direction.

372
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,970
Speaker 1: I got to look at my pile of unread books that I have purchased for some stupid reason.

373
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,089
Speaker 0: Remember the lesson of Genji, right?

374
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,130
Speaker 1: It's not going to be The Count of Monte Cristo, don't worry.

375
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:20,650
Speaker 0: Choose a book that we're actually going to read and finish reading and do an episode on so we can keep the streak alive.

376
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:27,970
Speaker 1: Luckily, we're approaching the "I can lay on the beach and read all day" times and real easy to read a book if I go to the beach at all.

377
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:29,251
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,580
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I know you're still working on the website.

379
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,683
Speaker 1: Big stuff's coming there.

380
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,210
Speaker 1: No cons until at best.

381
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:40,250
Speaker 1: There's really good odds that I will be at PAX West doing a panel.

382
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,610
Speaker 1: Emily will likely also be at PAX West doing a panel, not a different panel for different reasons.

383
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:56,010
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens, but even in the best case scenario, I cannot foresee us being at PAX West and doing anything other than a panel or two.

384
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,356
Speaker 1: I'm not going to be there playing games.

385
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:00,409
Speaker 1: I'm going to be wearing a mask in and out like I did at the last two PAXes.

386
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,027
Speaker 1: And I don't know what we're going to be doing in the future in terms of public appearances.

387
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:05,550
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

388
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:08,535
Speaker 0: We'll work stuff out, right?

389
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:12,890
Speaker 0: But if you're in or around New York City, it's warm out now, right?

390
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:19,987
Speaker 0: That's a good time if for some reason you really want to see us outside listening to the podcast.

391
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:20,970
Speaker 0: Is it enough for you?

392
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:28,516
Speaker 0: You know, come to any of the places that we gather online, right?

393
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:40,010
Speaker 0: You know, our Discord, our forum, Twitter, email us, you know, our old website that will hopefully soon be replaced with a new website.

394
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,849
Speaker 0: You know, see what's what.

395
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:51,870
Speaker 1: So I'm going to take you back to a time, a time before you could watch stuff on the Internet.

396
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:56,321
Speaker 1: And in that time, Scott and I watched a lot of cartoons.

397
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:58,910
Speaker 1: There was there's areas of cartoons that came out.

398
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:04,461
Speaker 1: And that time is between the year 1995 and the year 2003.

399
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:08,670
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about Cartoon Networks, Cartoon Cartoon.

400
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:09,851
Speaker 0: Yep.

401
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:17,790
Speaker 0: So, you know, basically the way things went down in my life, at least, is that, you know, I started off with only the broadcast TV for quite a while.

402
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:24,308
Speaker 0: And so I only the only cartoons I got to see were Saturday morning cartoons on the major networks.

403
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,010
Speaker 0: Right.

404
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,519
Speaker 0: And before school, you know, there were a few cartoons on sometimes.

405
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,428
Speaker 0: And then after school, there would be cartoons like syndicated onto a local station.

406
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:35,768
Speaker 0: Right.

407
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:36,690
Speaker 0: Something like that.

408
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:38,514
Speaker 0: And that was it.

409
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:42,710
Speaker 0: So and it's like there were a lot of shows I wanted to see that I just weren't on.

410
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,764
Speaker 0: Or it's like, you know, it's like I'd seen them at some point, but they weren't on now.

411
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:48,249
Speaker 0: So tough.

412
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:48,590
Speaker 0: Right.

413
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,927
Speaker 0: Then we got Cable eventually and Cable had the Nickelodeon.

414
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:53,470
Speaker 0: Right.

415
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:00,069
Speaker 0: But the Nickelodeon and those early times was mostly, you know, it's like all I really wanted to watch was more cartoons.

416
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:00,410
Speaker 0: Right.

417
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:09,010
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't want to watch, you know, like I did watch some, but, you know, I didn't want to watch all those live action things that were on there as much as I just wanted to watch more cartoons.

418
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:15,308
Speaker 0: But most of the cartoons they were showing were just other than the Nicktoons.

419
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:16,090
Speaker 0: Right.

420
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,372
Speaker 0: And and such.

421
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:23,242
Speaker 0: It's like most of it was like reruns and Looney Tunes and all that.

422
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:23,443
Speaker 0: Right.

423
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:26,308
Speaker 0: It's like you weren't getting a lot of original new things.

424
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:26,950
Speaker 0: Right.

425
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:38,627
Speaker 0: And so Cartoon Network was a thing I knew existed, but it was not on our cable as an option for until, like you said, mid to late 90s.

426
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:40,710
Speaker 0: It suddenly was now available.

427
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:45,184
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, my God, it's actually a TV network that actually shows nothing but cartoons.

428
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:45,706
Speaker 0: Hooray.

429
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:46,930
Speaker 0: That's what I want to watch.

430
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:55,967
Speaker 0: And I watched it and it was at the time full of plenty of reruns and old Hanna-Barbera cartoons and things I had seen.

431
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:56,268
Speaker 0: Right.

432
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:08,246
Speaker 0: But they had the cartoon cartoons, which is basically they had their own Cartoon Network studio that was somewhat related to, you know, the remnants of Hanna-Barbera.

433
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,610
Speaker 0: I don't actually understand how that worked.

434
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:14,398
Speaker 1: I read a bunch about it right before we did.

435
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:17,543
Speaker 0: If you care, you can read a bunch about it.

436
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:18,927
Speaker 1: We're not going to do it.

437
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,330
Speaker 1: We're not going to do a history lesson.

438
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,478
Speaker 1: But the only thing that I think is important is what we'll say is that Fred Siebert was instrumental in all of this.

439
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:32,010
Speaker 1: happening in the lineage from Hanna-Barbera to Cartoon Cartoon is important and fascinating and pretty direct.

440
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:39,719
Speaker 1: But we're not going to go through that history because at this point I would mostly read Wikipedia at you and you can do that yourself.

441
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,850
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a podcast out there dedicated just to Fred Siebert or just to Cartoon Cartoon.

442
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:46,670
Speaker 1: Right.

443
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,266
Speaker 0: But also, regardless, however, however it happened.

444
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:49,889
Speaker 0: Right.

445
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,770
Speaker 0: Hanna-Barbera somehow had their logo on there, along with the cartoon cartoons in the early days.

446
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,473
Speaker 1: But I'm going to give one other full disclosure.

447
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,354
Speaker 1: This is more for my part.

448
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:09,170
Speaker 1: I watched a bunch of these shows, but 1995, by that point, I was already like seven years deep into being a mega weeb.

449
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,955
Speaker 1: I was already watching anime and getting fan subs.

450
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:19,730
Speaker 1: And I was one of those, I was a young weeb who started to have a very low opinion of American cartoons and American animation.

451
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,779
Speaker 1: You know the type who very performatively watch anime to the exclusion of everything else?

452
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,290
Speaker 1: I was very much like that for seven-ish years before Cartoon Cartoon came out.

453
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:36,576
Speaker 1: So while I watched a bunch of these shows, at the time at least, I had a very low opinion of many of them.

454
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:40,880
Speaker 1: And some of them I never actually watched more than a handful of episodes of.

455
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:46,451
Speaker 0: I mean, but Cartoon Network also was good for the, you know, would drag in the weebs.

456
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:46,691
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:49,779
Speaker 0: Because they had their Toonami block going on around at the same time.

458
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:50,320
Speaker 0: Right.

459
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,972
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it's like, hey, there's the things I wanted to rerun.

460
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:57,820
Speaker 0: We're getting rerun on Toonami and eventually Adult Swim.

461
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:05,019
Speaker 0: And then, you know, the cartoon cartoon was like, it's like, you know, it's like you sort of had this full package deal.

462
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,320
Speaker 0: Right.

463
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,374
Speaker 0: It's like watch the Voltron, watch the Macross.

464
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:08,857
Speaker 0: Right.

465
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:09,540
Speaker 0: Well, Robotech.

466
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,530
Speaker 1: Cartoon Network was for American anime, like accessible to Americans on TV animation.

467
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:20,494
Speaker 1: Cartoon Network in that era was the game.

468
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:24,580
Speaker 1: Like they were the ones they were doing pretty much the best job I think you could possibly do.

469
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:26,181
Speaker 0: Yep.

470
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:35,620
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the cartoon cartoons, the way they started out is there was actually some other show called like the What a Cartoon show or something, which I saw a handful of times.

471
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,643
Speaker 1: Well it had that little Fred Flintstone logo.

472
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:39,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

473
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:48,115
Speaker 0: That was an interesting show because you could, even in those times with my, you know, middle school, high school brain, I understood sort of that.

474
00:36:48,135 --> 00:36:52,640
Speaker 0: like that show was basically showing pilots for other shows.

475
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,019
Speaker 1: Specifically, you might recognize some of these, you know, names, Dexter's Lab, Johnny Bravo, Curtis the Cowardly Dog, I.M.

476
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:00,180
Speaker 1: Weasel.

477
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:08,899
Speaker 0: I think the very first, the very first episode of What a Cartoon show was the pilot for Powerpuff Girls and the pilot for Dexter's Lab.

478
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:09,119
Speaker 0: Right.

479
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:09,440
Speaker 0: I think.

480
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:10,940
Speaker 1: That is correct.

481
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:12,202
Speaker 0: Okay.

482
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:12,803
Speaker 0: I was correct.

483
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:13,224
Speaker 0: Look at that.

484
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:16,031
Speaker 0: Of course, cartoons are the things I can remember.

485
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:16,212
Speaker 0: Right.

486
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:17,515
Speaker 0: Cartoons are the easy maps.

487
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:18,477
Speaker 0: Right.

488
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:19,540
Speaker 0: I can't remember anything else.

489
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:33,278
Speaker 0: And it's like, you see, you'd watch that and you see these pilots for shows and, you know, it's like you sort of, you know, somehow those then when they became real full on shows, it sort of felt like natural and connected.

490
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:34,019
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,740
Speaker 0: In some way.

492
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:35,502
Speaker 0: Like that.

493
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:36,745
Speaker 0: Ah, yes, of course.

494
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:40,436
Speaker 0: Like that's now just a regular show that has more episodes.

495
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:40,757
Speaker 0: Right.

496
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:41,880
Speaker 0: That makes perfect sense.

497
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:48,374
Speaker 1: Plus, as a kid, like in that era, I didn't really know like what a pilot was or like how the industry worked.

498
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,216
Speaker 0: I knew what it was.

499
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:50,820
Speaker 1: I didn't know how the industry worked.

500
00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:03,818
Speaker 0: I didn't know that many details, but I understood that you would make a single pilot episode, put it out there, see if people liked it, and then decide whether to make a full show or not based on how well it was received.

501
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:04,179
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,020
Speaker 0: I understood that much.

503
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:20,539
Speaker 1: But also Cartoon Cartoon slid in and filled this gap where even forgetting the anime as a kid, there was this distinct gap in quality between I would see Looney Tunes from like the 50s and 60s.

504
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:25,111
Speaker 1: And then I would see what most animation looked like on American TV.

505
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:28,320
Speaker 1: And it felt like it was all crappy to my kid brain.

506
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:36,009
Speaker 1: And I didn't understand like, yeah, a lot of the Looney Tunes were made for theatrical releases, like don't really quite internalize all that at the time.

507
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:45,520
Speaker 1: But even to my weeb anime addled brain, when the Cartoon Cartoons came out, my brain said, wait a minute, these are pretty good.

508
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:54,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, they weren't good in, you know, animation wise on the level of Looney Tunes.

509
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:54,428
Speaker 0: Right.

510
00:38:54,488 --> 00:39:08,900
Speaker 0: But compared to, you know, the stuff that we had been seeing on like Saturday morning cartoons, right, or after school, right, in terms of stuff that was made, you know, in the United States in the present time.

511
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:09,721
Speaker 0: Right.

512
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:12,765
Speaker 0: It was vastly superior, mostly in terms of writing.

513
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:15,148
Speaker 0: But the animation was also pretty good, too.

514
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,730
Speaker 0: And this is pre HDTV.

515
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:17,211
Speaker 0: Right.

516
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,716
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, and all a lot of those shows, right?

517
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:23,860
Speaker 0: It's like, I watched the Dexter's Lab recently one episode.

518
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:25,496
Speaker 1: And I did too.

519
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,509
Speaker 0: They're on streaming services.

520
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:28,940
Speaker 0: And you know what, they hold up and they're funny.

521
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,420
Speaker 1: I referenced in a conversation a particular rhythmic laugh and no one understood what the fuck I was on about.

522
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:46,071
Speaker 1: And I had to show a YouTube video to a bunch of my team leads, like a bunch of team leads I work with at work who are all easily 10 to 15 years younger than me.

523
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:51,358
Speaker 1: And I watched the clip first to make sure like, yeah, it was as funny as I remembered.

524
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:52,279
Speaker 1: It holds up.

525
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:57,119
Speaker 1: Also, that was the most high concept episode of Dexter's Lab ever.

526
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:01,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

527
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:02,810
Speaker 0: Of the ones I remember.

528
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:08,730
Speaker 1: I think the easiest thing to do would be to go down this list in chronological order and speak to these shows a little bit.

529
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:09,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

530
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,350
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, the first one, I think Dexter's Lab, I think was the first one.

531
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:13,830
Speaker 1: It was.

532
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,693
Speaker 0: I've got Wikipedia up in front of me.

533
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,437
Speaker 1: Dexter's Lab, April 28th, 1996.

534
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:28,251
Speaker 1: So I was a freshman in high school and Dexter's Lab appeared on TV in 1996.

535
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:40,390
Speaker 1: And Dexter's Lab, I remember being really funny and having watched a few episodes recently, it is not as densely comedic as a modern cartoon aimed at kids.

536
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:50,170
Speaker 1: Like the craft has advanced, but at the same, and it wasn't as funny as The Simpsons, which had already been airing for some time by the time Dexter's Lab came out.

537
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:56,050
Speaker 1: It is not even close to as funny as even an average episode of The Simpsons at that point.

538
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,850
Speaker 1: But I got to say, Dexter's Lab was different from most other cartoons that I saw.

539
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:11,990
Speaker 1: And that is why I watched it, despite having access to both The Simpsons and anime in the year 1996.

540
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,930
Speaker 1: I would chuckle at a Dexter's Lab.

541
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:24,990
Speaker 0: The thing I remember the most about it was that before seeing an episode when I merely knew the show existed, I remember having feelings that like it wasn't something I would be interested in.

542
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,671
Speaker 0: Right.

543
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:29,630
Speaker 0: But then I remember watching it and it being nothing like what I thought it was going to be like.

544
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,450
Speaker 1: I mean, it made references to Dungeons and Dragons, the only cartoon.

545
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,550
Speaker 0: That was one episode.

546
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:40,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was only one episode compared to the rest of anything that I could see.

547
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,550
Speaker 1: Nothing talked about D&D except Record of Lotus War.

548
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,910
Speaker 1: And even that was extremely indirect.

549
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,311
Speaker 0: Right.

550
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:53,470
Speaker 0: But, you know, I think the thing with Dexter's Lab is that each episode is really just like one joke.

551
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:54,191
Speaker 0: Right.

552
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,879
Speaker 0: It's like you could shrink, you know, but what?

553
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:02,730
Speaker 0: in a 30 minute, 20 minute block, they actually split it up into several episodes.

554
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:08,950
Speaker 0: It's not like a Simpsons where, you know, Simpsons, you generally have a three thread plot, right?

555
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,886
Speaker 0: A plot B plot that intertwined over the course of 20 to 30 minutes.

556
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:21,850
Speaker 0: Whereas in a Dexter's Lab, you know, you get basically in your 20 to 30 minute time slot, you get several episodes, not all of which might even be Dexter's Lab.

557
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:27,368
Speaker 0: You might get a Justice Friends or Monkey, right, which are probably better than Dexter's Lab sometimes.

558
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:28,751
Speaker 0: Right.

559
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:34,070
Speaker 1: But yeah, they were all variations on a theme like the Omelette du Fromage episode.

560
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:34,511
Speaker 0: Right.

561
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:34,972
Speaker 0: Exactly.

562
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:40,110
Speaker 0: Omelette du Fromage is like, you know, an S tier episode of Dexter's Lab, a legendary one for all time.

563
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:41,457
Speaker 0: But it's just one joke.

564
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:41,798
Speaker 0: Right.

565
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:44,030
Speaker 0: All you can say is Omelette du Fromage.

566
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:44,592
Speaker 0: Right.

567
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:47,666
Speaker 0: It's like you get the joke, you know, you know, and it's like it does.

568
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:48,330
Speaker 0: it goes on.

569
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:48,974
Speaker 0: You know, it's what.

570
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:51,050
Speaker 0: how long is just the Omelette du Fromage?

571
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:51,867
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

572
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,420
Speaker 0: Five, ten minutes tops.

573
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,782
Speaker 0: Right.

574
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,850
Speaker 0: It's maybe seven minutes.

575
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,130
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly how long it is, but it's like it's a few minutes long.

576
00:42:59,591 --> 00:42:59,751
Speaker 0: Right.

577
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,215
Speaker 0: It's a little bit stretched out.

578
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:03,381
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's it's.

579
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 0: you know, they mix it around a little bit.

580
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,475
Speaker 0: But it's one joke.

581
00:43:07,596 --> 00:43:07,757
Speaker 0: Right.

582
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:10,069
Speaker 0: Every episode of Dexter's Lab is basically one joke.

583
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:11,674
Speaker 0: Good joke.

584
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:12,257
Speaker 0: Right.

585
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,202
Speaker 0: Some better than others.

586
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:14,469
Speaker 0: Some more clever than others.

587
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:15,511
Speaker 0: Right.

588
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:22,809
Speaker 0: But and then you get a few of those combined together as like a little mini anthology and, you know, you're good to go.

589
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:26,314
Speaker 0: So it's good to watch.

590
00:43:26,455 --> 00:43:32,009
Speaker 0: But it's like I think some of the not you know, some of the non legendary episodes.

591
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:32,450
Speaker 0: Right.

592
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,610
Speaker 1: Well, they like like all old media, they like they drag a little bit like the tie.

593
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:38,151
Speaker 0: You might want it.

594
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:38,432
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:43,290
Speaker 0: It's like you could fast forward like a minute and be like, I'm not missing it.

596
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:50,250
Speaker 1: Because the thing that the reason the Simpsons remember the Simpsons was around its prime during this era.

597
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:57,050
Speaker 1: The reason the Simpsons was so far and above beyond most other cartoons, what it wasn't just aimed at younger kids.

598
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:08,170
Speaker 1: But to that was edging into what we would consider modern writing and modern storyboarding and modern like television in terms of density of content.

599
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:15,430
Speaker 0: I think Dexter's Lab had the modern writing in terms of the type of jokes, the way it told the jokes, the way, you know, it animated the characters.

600
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,082
Speaker 0: It's really just the voice acting being good.

601
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:21,710
Speaker 1: It's the density of contact of content.

602
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,481
Speaker 1: Most old shows everywhere feel sparse by modern standards.

603
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:30,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Lab.

604
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,290
Speaker 0: Dexter's Lab holds up would watch right if it was on Johnny Bravo.

605
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:41,910
Speaker 1: I feel like you could watch a very short compilation of key moments and I don't remember much beyond.

606
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:43,758
Speaker 1: It was just one joke.

607
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:44,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

608
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,250
Speaker 0: All of Johnny Bravo.

609
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,490
Speaker 0: If each episode of Dexter's Lab is a different joke, every episode of Johnny Bravo is one joke.

610
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:51,831
Speaker 0: Right.

611
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:53,702
Speaker 0: Which that doesn't mean it's going to be bad.

612
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:54,869
Speaker 0: That's not necessarily negative.

613
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:55,090
Speaker 0: Right.

614
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:59,062
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote is one joke.

615
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,490
Speaker 0: The whole and it's several episodes of one joke.

616
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:01,831
Speaker 0: Right.

617
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:02,514
Speaker 0: And that works.

618
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:05,768
Speaker 0: But for Johnny Bravo, it's not a great joke.

619
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:06,110
Speaker 0: Right.

620
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:14,550
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, there's a chauvinist dude who is not too bright and he gets into shenanigans and gets what he deserves.

621
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,092
Speaker 0: The end.

622
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:21,010
Speaker 1: There is one legendary episode where he becomes a woman and has to deal with the bullshit of men.

623
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:24,550
Speaker 1: That was appropriately subversive for its audience.

624
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:31,150
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I struggle to remember anything like Johnny Bravo.

625
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:38,829
Speaker 1: My brain just has this almost dolly like conglomeration of all Johnny Bravo episodes into two episodes.

626
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,068
Speaker 1: The Johnny Bravo and then the one where he's a girl.

627
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:47,390
Speaker 0: I don't remember really specific episodes too much either.

628
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,719
Speaker 1: I only watched it when it was on.

629
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:52,010
Speaker 1: Usually between other things I was trying to watch.

630
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:57,570
Speaker 0: I think the strongest parts of the show were actually the character design of Johnny Bravo himself.

631
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:59,235
Speaker 0: It's a really good character.

632
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,059
Speaker 0: This triangle dude with this hair.

633
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:00,280
Speaker 0: Right.

634
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,875
Speaker 0: It's like he's basically two triangles.

635
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:16,290
Speaker 0: And like I've actually it's like, you know, for as whatever as the show is, I think the character is somewhat remembered by people of a certain age.

636
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:25,210
Speaker 0: Like just like this week, I saw one of those triangle stands, little chalkboards outside a restaurant that had a Johnny Bravo joke on it.

637
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,719
Speaker 0: And I was like, whoa, what's up with that?

638
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,010
Speaker 0: It's like, who's working in this restaurant at my age?

639
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:34,233
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

640
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:50,570
Speaker 1: I should have taken a picture of it, though, because actually the other day in midtown, I was I was walking in a different part of where I usually walk and I saw a coffee shop and they drawn a. they had a picture of Kenshiro and is like, you are already caffeinated.

641
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:54,123
Speaker 1: That was just on the on the chalkboard outside.

642
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,309
Speaker 0: There you go.

643
00:46:56,952 --> 00:47:04,030
Speaker 0: So Johnny Bravo, it was like, you know, it was one of those shows where like when it was on, I would watch it if it was on.

644
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:11,810
Speaker 0: But that's because the nature of television in those days, I would never have been like, oh, I have to go watch it or watch it on purpose or anything like that.

645
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:20,970
Speaker 1: Cow and chicken, I'll admit, I saw like one episode of it and my kid brain said, this is just a rip off Ren and Stimpy.

646
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,866
Speaker 1: And I never looked back.

647
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:26,094
Speaker 0: So it was Ren and Stimpy-ish, right?

648
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:40,050
Speaker 0: It was a bit out there and stylistically, aesthetically, a little bit, you know, duckman-ish, maybe even at times, just the weirdness of what was going on.

649
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,629
Speaker 1: Wow, we should do a fucking show on Duckman.

650
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:47,249
Speaker 0: I haven't watched nor do I remember enough Duckman to do it.

651
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,889
Speaker 1: My family was into Duckman like our grandpa.

652
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:57,030
Speaker 1: We would sit down as a family, parents and grandparents and kids together.

653
00:47:57,312 --> 00:48:00,149
Speaker 1: And we we have all seen all of Duckman.

654
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:04,390
Speaker 0: It was hard for me to watch all of it because it wasn't on at a consistent time.

655
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,905
Speaker 0: Like I couldn't get, you know, you know, my family easily.

656
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,390
Speaker 1: We would all like tape shows, removing the commercials and pass those VHS tapes around anyway.

657
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:19,410
Speaker 0: So Cow and Chicken was this weird show that also included, you know, sort of anthology, other episodes of things in there.

658
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:19,711
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:26,270
Speaker 0: Like they think that I Am Weasel that eventually became its own show was originally a segment on the Cow and Chicken.

660
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:27,909
Speaker 1: That makes sense because I am Weasel.

661
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,130
Speaker 1: I bucketed in my brain together with Cow and Chicken.

662
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:36,810
Speaker 0: I actually didn't realize they were different shows on the same way that Monkey and Justice, whatever were also part of Dexter's lab.

663
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,212
Speaker 0: Right.

664
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:38,589
Speaker 0: Same, you know, and whatnot.

665
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,029
Speaker 0: So but yeah, the Cow and Chicken was just sort of like this.

666
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:45,842
Speaker 0: It definitely didn't feel like it felt sort of like.

667
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:47,950
Speaker 0: is this actually for children kind of deal.

668
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,870
Speaker 1: I mean, see also Ren and Stimpy.

669
00:48:51,651 --> 00:49:04,150
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I think, you know, aesthetically art style, a bit Ren and Stimpy-ish with the loose lines and the, you know, the sort of, you know, a little bit of gross out kind of action going on there.

670
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,511
Speaker 0: Right.

671
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:10,770
Speaker 0: But content wise, I felt it more was in line with Rocko's Modern Life.

672
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:18,890
Speaker 0: And I don't know for sure, but like there was the red guy who was sort of like the villain guy who had a similar shape.

673
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:21,228
Speaker 1: I remember that red guy, the devil looking guy.

674
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:35,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, he had a similar shape and I think pretty sure the same voice actor as the next door neighbor fishy guy in Rocko's Modern Life and a similar character kind of thing.

675
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:36,131
Speaker 0: Right.

676
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:39,650
Speaker 0: So there are a lot of parallels there.

677
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:48,490
Speaker 0: But yeah, again, it wasn't a show that I would go out of my way to watch on purpose or like I was a fan of or that anyone would be a fan of that I could think of.

678
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,553
Speaker 0: But it had.

679
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:51,655
Speaker 0: it wasn't awful.

680
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:53,038
Speaker 0: It had merit.

681
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:59,629
Speaker 0: And like if it was on, I wouldn't turn it off unless it's unless, you know, something better was going on.

682
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:05,090
Speaker 0: But in an era of, you know, pull television instead of push television.

683
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:06,931
Speaker 0: Right.

684
00:50:07,011 --> 00:50:14,810
Speaker 0: I do have one anecdote, though, related to this and that I was in summer camp and we went to an amusement park as a field trip.

685
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:19,966
Speaker 0: And at the amusement park, I there was a little carny game.

686
00:50:20,026 --> 00:50:21,190
Speaker 0: I forget which carny game it was.

687
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:24,184
Speaker 0: It might have been shoot the water in the clown mouth or something like that.

688
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:25,370
Speaker 0: And I won.

689
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:34,070
Speaker 0: And I got a probably bootleg plush chicken, specifically the chicken from Cow and Chicken.

690
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:37,859
Speaker 0: I think I may have it somewhere still.

691
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:38,421
Speaker 0: I don't know.

692
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:41,628
Speaker 0: But there you go.

693
00:50:43,111 --> 00:50:46,207
Speaker 0: I might have been a bootleg one because I think it also fell apart.

694
00:50:46,288 --> 00:50:46,609
Speaker 0: I don't know.

695
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:53,890
Speaker 1: I got to check because we could talk about Powerpuff Girls, but I would be shocked if we have not done an entire show on the Powerpuff Girls.

696
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,750
Speaker 0: Well, we could have done a show on the movie that we saw at the dollar theater.

697
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,530
Speaker 1: We have never done a show on the Powerpuff Girls, the show or the movie.

698
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:01,707
Speaker 0: You just deleted it.

699
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:09,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, Powerpuff Girls is interesting because it was like there was that the ones we've talked about so far.

700
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:15,910
Speaker 0: I guess that those were all sort of in existence when I got Cartoon Network and started watching the shows.

701
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,064
Speaker 0: It's like all four of those, Dexter's Lab, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken.

702
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:20,290
Speaker 0: Those are all there.

703
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:25,170
Speaker 0: Those felt like, you know, at the time they felt like those were the cartoon cartoons.

704
00:51:25,771 --> 00:51:30,469
Speaker 0: And when Powerpuff Girls came out, like originally, you know, I guess there was already that pilot that people had seen.

705
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:34,586
Speaker 1: But like when Powerpuff Girls came out, I was like, what is this show?

706
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:35,610
Speaker 1: And I was on board.

707
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,352
Speaker 0: Right.

708
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:39,525
Speaker 0: When it became its own show, it was like a big deal.

709
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:40,690
Speaker 0: It was like a new one.

710
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:48,330
Speaker 0: It was like, whoa, it's like there's another one that's coming into existence and it's an exciting one that's doing different and cool.

711
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:50,397
Speaker 0: And, you know, I'm on board with it.

712
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:52,142
Speaker 0: And like, you know, there was like this.

713
00:51:52,704 --> 00:51:54,289
Speaker 0: there was hype at that time.

714
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:54,570
Speaker 0: Right.

715
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,119
Speaker 0: Like new show, actually good.

716
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:57,941
Speaker 0: Wow.

717
00:51:58,122 --> 00:51:59,005
Speaker 0: Let's watch this.

718
00:51:59,105 --> 00:51:59,286
Speaker 0: Right.

719
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,390
Speaker 0: Like I was watching those.

720
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,417
Speaker 0: Like there'd be new episodes once a week.

721
00:52:02,457 --> 00:52:03,923
Speaker 0: And I was why I was getting there.

722
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,690
Speaker 1: I was still watching Powerpuff Girls.

723
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,134
Speaker 0: Go out of my way to watch it.

724
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:13,310
Speaker 1: And when we were in college at RIT, I was still watching like new episodes of Powerpuff Girls as they came out.

725
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,195
Speaker 1: And that's the point where I wasn't just a mega weeb.

726
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:20,210
Speaker 1: I was running the fucking RIT Anime Club and I was still watching Powerpuff Girls.

727
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,314
Speaker 0: This was right.

728
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,859
Speaker 0: So more than the other shows.

729
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:23,080
Speaker 0: Right.

730
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,989
Speaker 0: Going out of my way to watch this.

731
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:26,190
Speaker 0: Right.

732
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:31,130
Speaker 0: Going to the dollar movie theater on Wednesday night to watch the movie for 50 cents.

733
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:39,050
Speaker 1: That is still one of the best values I've ever gotten outside of piracy in terms of money spent per unit entertainment.

734
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:40,571
Speaker 0: Yeah.

735
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:43,057
Speaker 0: It's like Powerpuff Girls with some fucking show.

736
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:43,358
Speaker 0: Right.

737
00:52:43,438 --> 00:52:44,942
Speaker 0: It's like the episodes.

738
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:48,350
Speaker 0: actually, you know, they were mostly monster of the week type situations.

739
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:48,872
Speaker 0: Right.

740
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:53,349
Speaker 0: Usually it was Mojo Jojo, even though you wanted there to be a lot more episodes about him.

741
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,417
Speaker 0: Oh, him.

742
00:52:56,437 --> 00:53:00,490
Speaker 1: Him is a standout and bold character design that I appreciate.

743
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:04,998
Speaker 1: And while there are problematic elements, it could have been a lot worse.

744
00:53:05,038 --> 00:53:11,910
Speaker 1: They handled that character shockingly well for a late 90s to early 2000s pop culture show aimed at kids.

745
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:14,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

746
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:14,152
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:19,888
Speaker 0: You know, it was really, you know, it was quite a show because you had, you know, first of all, you got the three characters.

748
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:20,009
Speaker 0: Right.

749
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,092
Speaker 0: All significantly different.

750
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,097
Speaker 0: Right.

751
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:26,820
Speaker 0: You know, they all got their own.

752
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 0: You could have a Bubbles episode.

753
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:29,686
Speaker 0: Right.

754
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:30,588
Speaker 0: You could have a Blossom.

755
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:30,929
Speaker 0: Right.

756
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:31,370
Speaker 0: You could have a...

757
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,362
Speaker 1: You could have a The Professor episode and it would totally work.

758
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:35,065
Speaker 1: And it did work.

759
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:36,270
Speaker 1: And they did it a bunch of times.

760
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:36,811
Speaker 0: Yep.

761
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:40,799
Speaker 0: And then you get different combinations of different villains going on.

762
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,420
Speaker 0: Right.

763
00:53:41,481 --> 00:53:45,970
Speaker 0: It's like, even though I felt like there weren't, at least in the early seasons that I saw.

764
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:46,751
Speaker 0: Right.

765
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,419
Speaker 0: In the late 90s, there weren't enough different villains.

766
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,809
Speaker 0: It felt like they kept reusing like Amoeba Boys over and over again.

767
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,774
Speaker 0: Or Mojo Jojo over and over again.

768
00:53:56,794 --> 00:54:00,341
Speaker 0: It was like, it was still right.

769
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:04,588
Speaker 0: Enough different combinations and enough plot lines that were all interesting.

770
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,290
Speaker 0: Right.

771
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:11,299
Speaker 0: And, you know, even though there wasn't some serial overarching long-term plot.

772
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,660
Speaker 0: Right.

773
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:17,310
Speaker 0: It was always just, you know, episode of the week, monster of the week, whatever.

774
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,713
Speaker 0: It did it really well.

775
00:54:19,733 --> 00:54:20,714
Speaker 0: Right.

776
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:21,937
Speaker 0: It was always entertaining.

777
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:28,088
Speaker 0: A mix of, you know, mostly humor, but also, you know, some serious elements.

778
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:28,649
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:29,310
Speaker 0: Going on there.

780
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,817
Speaker 0: And they mixed in a lot.

781
00:54:34,518 --> 00:54:39,590
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, you would think like you watched, you know, the Rocko's Modern Life and the Cow and Chicken and Ren and Stimpy.

782
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:45,348
Speaker 0: And those were the shows putting in the jokes that are actually for adults, but that go over the children's heads.

783
00:54:45,368 --> 00:54:45,890
Speaker 0: Right.

784
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:53,190
Speaker 0: And it's like, you think Powerpuff Girls isn't one of those shows, but Powerpuff Girls was one of those shows times like a million.

785
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,853
Speaker 0: It was just so crafty at it.

786
00:54:55,973 --> 00:55:05,987
Speaker 0: I remember, you know, also maybe not the most tasteful joke, but I specifically remember an episode where Mojo Jojo gets locked in the prison in a cell with a large individual.

787
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:14,579
Speaker 0: And it is heavily implied that Mojo Jojo is going to drop the soap.

788
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:20,950
Speaker 0: And while that's not an appropriate joke in general, to put that in a children's show in the 90s.

789
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,720
Speaker 0: Because, you know, a kid watching it just thinks, oh, Mojo Jojo went to jail.

790
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:26,502
Speaker 0: Right.

791
00:55:26,863 --> 00:55:29,030
Speaker 0: But an adult is going to think something very different.

792
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:40,947
Speaker 0: So, and the fact that the show, you know, I think more than any of the other shows, you know, it had staying power and that it was redone.

793
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:42,250
Speaker 0: Wasn't there an anime version?

794
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,473
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's been a newer version.

795
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:53,610
Speaker 1: Multiple attempts to bring Powerpuff Girls back in a variety of places, different aged audiences, anime, comics.

796
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,257
Speaker 0: There's some merchandising and right.

797
00:55:56,317 --> 00:56:00,970
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like a lot of these shows, I think, you know, had some GBA video games and whatnot.

798
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,555
Speaker 0: But I feel like Powerpuff Girls had the most.

799
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:03,437
Speaker 0: Right.

800
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:07,530
Speaker 0: It's like that was the big one that sort of dwarfed all the others.

801
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,690
Speaker 1: So we've gone on for a while, so we probably move wrap up pretty soon.

802
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,870
Speaker 0: Well, we're getting to the time when I stopped watching television.

803
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,471
Speaker 1: Exactly.

804
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:17,150
Speaker 1: So briefly, what I say is I never watched Ed, Edd n Eddy, but.

805
00:56:18,432 --> 00:56:22,130
Speaker 0: Ed, Edd n Eddy is like has a lot of cachet on the Internet.

806
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,031
Speaker 1: Oh, it does.

807
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:33,550
Speaker 1: And I would say it is it speaks very powerfully to people who are a little bit younger than me and Scott because I've noticed our friends who were like three or four years younger than us.

808
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,309
Speaker 1: Edd n Eddy was like their fucking show.

809
00:56:37,171 --> 00:56:45,370
Speaker 0: I watched a handful of episodes, you know, it's like but, you know, it wasn't super my thing, but I saw its merits.

810
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:45,953
Speaker 0: Right.

811
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:48,589
Speaker 1: If I were if I had been a little younger, I was.

812
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:49,471
Speaker 1: Yep.

813
00:56:49,691 --> 00:57:03,410
Speaker 1: I could see because it it really captured from what what what of it I've seen, like what it's like to be a suburban kid when your family is not really that wealthy, like middle class to lower middle class kids live in real lives.

814
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:16,330
Speaker 1: I'd say that a show like Bob's Burgers is an evolved form of some of the kinds of humor and the way the show would like approach this type of environment.

815
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:20,202
Speaker 1: It's I think it's a very stand up show that I just didn't watch a lot of.

816
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,733
Speaker 1: And holy shit, it went till 2009.

817
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:23,894
Speaker 0: Yep.

818
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:25,509
Speaker 1: There was a decade of Ed, Edd n Eddy.

819
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:26,471
Speaker 0: All right.

820
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:33,250
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of those shows, they went for a long time, but didn't necessarily have that many episodes produced each year.

821
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:33,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:35,933
Speaker 0: So but yeah, that was.

823
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:42,800
Speaker 0: it's like this weird show and that like it was actually kind of huge, but was kind of a sleeper in that it didn't get.

824
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:52,270
Speaker 0: you know, it lasted that long, had that many episodes was pop, you know, popular enough, but it didn't have all the big extra stuff that like Powerpuff Girls had.

825
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:57,110
Speaker 0: So there might be a video game out there somewhere, but not many, I imagine.

827
00:57:57,712 --> 00:58:00,439
Speaker 1: And Courage the Cowardly Dog was actually a pretty OK show.

828
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:04,250
Speaker 1: Obviously, I was I was barely watching TV by then.

829
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:15,730
Speaker 1: But one thing I remember distinctly was that one, it was very easy to read that the show is from the dog's perspective and it's all actually just normal stuff happening and the dog just doesn't understand.

830
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:28,270
Speaker 1: But two, the backgrounds and the setting were so terrifying and isolating and surreal that that stood out, despite how little of that show I actually watched.

831
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:29,510
Speaker 0: Yeah.

832
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:34,650
Speaker 0: I mean, it was, you know, aesthetically and artistically, it was sort of like a masterpiece of a show.

833
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:39,949
Speaker 0: But, you know, at the age I was at the time I was right, I didn't appreciate that very much.

834
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,840
Speaker 0: And I didn't, you know, I wasn't that I didn't hate it, but I wasn't that entertained by it.

835
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:49,070
Speaker 0: So like I wasn't, you know, going out of my way to watch it at the time it came out.

836
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,410
Speaker 0: But, you know, now I can, you know, knowing about it, I can appreciate, you know, what went into it.

837
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,978
Speaker 0: And I was like, I'm glad that something like that was made.

838
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:00,410
Speaker 0: But I also understand why it didn't become mega popular.

839
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:04,789
Speaker 0: But actually, you know, it did considering what it was like, hey, that's pretty good.

840
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:05,372
Speaker 0: Right.

841
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:09,930
Speaker 0: I don't think a thing like that can happen really nowadays, which is kind of sad.

842
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:11,834
Speaker 1: Yeah.

843
00:59:11,854 --> 00:59:12,135
Speaker 1: And yep.

844
00:59:12,276 --> 00:59:16,930
Speaker 1: I mean, cartoon cartoon was a pretty important part of like the evolution of American cartoons.

845
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:28,370
Speaker 1: And it's kind of sad that Cartoon Network in the era after Cartoon Cartoon did slow like start backing away from animation, which we've talked about at length.

846
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:36,810
Speaker 0: I mean, there were the ones that came after that, like, you know, I didn't see very much of because I didn't watch a lot of television after that time.

847
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,357
Speaker 0: You know, I went to college and stopped watching TV.

848
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,870
Speaker 0: But I have heard good things about some of those shows.

849
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:44,331
Speaker 0: Right.

850
00:59:45,234 --> 00:59:50,170
Speaker 0: And it's actually, you know, it's kind of sad that like they don't make you know, they don't have this going on anymore.

851
00:59:50,431 --> 00:59:50,651
Speaker 0: Right.

852
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:56,430
