1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,096
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday June 26th.

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,842
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,070
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:20,050
Speaker 1: Tonight we discuss why video games are currently out of season.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,332
Speaker 0: Well Scott refuses to let me turn off the AC.

7
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,798
Speaker 0: so if you hear any humming in the background.

8
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:34,320
Speaker 0: It's all him.

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,680
Speaker 1: I didn't refuse to turn it off.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,947
Speaker 0: I just asked if you would turn it off and I said no and then you bitched about it And you had bitch.

11
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,225
Speaker 1: all I did is said hey Why don't we leave it on?

12
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:45,160
Speaker 1: and you know why don't we do a little test to see just how much noise it makes?

13
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:47,288
Speaker 1: And you didn't say anything.

14
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,270
Speaker 1: after that I said, I guess it's still on you I'm gonna turn it off turn it off turn it off.

15
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:54,888
Speaker 1: I'll turn it off all right Did anyone hear a difference?

16
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:56,174
Speaker 1: I just turned the air conditioner off.

17
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:56,455
Speaker 1: does it?

18
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,520
Speaker 1: does it sound any different now?

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:07,199
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I didn't really bother testing partly because I had to turn the air conditioner off to do that and partly because I can't know It'll really sound until I do all the processing and the filtering and it's just not worth it.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a feeling that it won't be that much sound.

21
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:12,440
Speaker 1: of course the air conditioner is right behind me.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,860
Speaker 1: So it would be more than if say the air conditioner on the other side of the room.

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is also the issue that with the compressor whenever we're not talking It would just get rid of the air conditioner, but then it would come back as we talked.

24
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:34,265
Speaker 1: It's it's tough call But well you have a small sample of air conditioner geek nights to listen to and tell us how it sounds because if you can't Hear it I'm keeping that bitch on.

25
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:35,830
Speaker 1: cuz it is warm today.

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,492
Speaker 0: God damn.

27
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:42,568
Speaker 0: Yeah warmer than yesterday, so You Didn't do this typical.

28
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:43,110
Speaker 1: run through it.

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,291
Speaker 0: No.

30
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,600
Speaker 0: I didn't cuz otherwise we would get predictable.

31
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so it's a gaming day isn't it?

32
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,100
Speaker 1: and I've been playing too many games lately.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,109
Speaker 1: So this is gonna be kind of weird me either.

34
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,737
Speaker 0: luckily that gave us something to talk about.

35
00:01:55,777 --> 00:02:04,919
Speaker 0: see originally We're gonna talk about sieve - then I realized we already talked about sieve - I think I don't really remember talking about sieve - it's Listed as the primary thing of a show from a long time ago.

36
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:08,158
Speaker 1: I have to go listen to that show to see what the deal was.

37
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,126
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz you're gonna go back.

38
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,699
Speaker 0: you have time to go back and listen to that.

39
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:25,519
Speaker 1: I actually today I was sitting at work And I listened to the podcast on my iPod except for the ones that didn't feel like listening to and I actually went around to pod websites of podcasts downloaded mp3s Directly and then listen to them with my headphones plugged into my work PC.

40
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,156
Speaker 0: I've tried to do that several times, and I still can't find any podcast worth listening to.

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,829
Speaker 1: I mostly did it for Episodes of podcasts I do listen to.

42
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,337
Speaker 1: that came out after I left to go to work.

43
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,109
Speaker 1: wow That's kinda cuz I was out.

44
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,456
Speaker 1: I needed something to listen to.

45
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,020
Speaker 0: what was I gonna do I guess cuz I only listen in the car.

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,479
Speaker 0: I only update my iPod like once a week, and then I pretty much just listen to Dave and Joel and NPR.

47
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I listen at work, so I need I need some more content cuz the awo hasn't been updating so much.

48
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,204
Speaker 1: I actually went around.

49
00:02:54,325 --> 00:03:01,820
Speaker 1: you know all the the anime type podcast that we're friendly with and how they all have all the links on The side you know like animal door links to Ninja consultant links Dave and Joel.

50
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:07,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah And I clicked on every single one of those on all of the sites to actually get the whole picture.

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,732
Speaker 1: I had a whole row of tabs for every single one.

52
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:25,134
Speaker 0: I didn't listen any of them Right, but there's video game day, so I'm sure you've heard about all this crap with the ESRB, and how they've rated this game Adults only and how the albionic people decided they don't want this game to come out.

53
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:28,332
Speaker 0: and then I'll Sony Nintendo said yeah We don't want it to come out either.

54
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,627
Speaker 0: change it Take two.

55
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:37,029
Speaker 0: basically said all right We're not gonna change the game Because that goes against everything we stand for.

56
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,852
Speaker 1: oh do they really?

57
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:44,356
Speaker 0: I thought they were gonna change delay it and make it m Well what they said is they're just gonna shelve it and for now and that's it They're not gonna release it.

58
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:49,022
Speaker 0: And I don't think they're sure what they're gonna do yet unless there's been news since the last news I read.

59
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,949
Speaker 1: well they spent a lot of money developing it.

60
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,173
Speaker 1: they better make some money on it.

61
00:03:52,394 --> 00:04:10,311
Speaker 0: see now if I were them One I'd probably talk to my lawyers to see about if there's any way to bring a lawsuit against the ESRB or any Organizations behind them for perhaps holding take two to a higher standard than other game Companies due to previous events that might have angered the ESRB.

62
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,300
Speaker 1: yep because I've never played manhunt one or two.

63
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:23,080
Speaker 1: But I am pretty confident based on the information I've read in many many places that manhunt two isn't really any more violent than manhunt one.

64
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,751
Speaker 0: Well, I did watch the trailers for manhunt two, and it didn't.

65
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:27,880
Speaker 0: I've read books that were a lot worse than that.

66
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,159
Speaker 0: There's no adults only rating on my book.

67
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,226
Speaker 1: I think it's just a case of that.

68
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:39,605
Speaker 1: people are still holding video games to like some other standard than the other mediums when it comes to censorship and violence and ratings.

69
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:47,531
Speaker 1: you know if you make if you took like a movie that's rated R like you know the matrix right and You make a video game out of it.

70
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:56,596
Speaker 1: It's gonna be rated M. possibly you know if you if you have a Movie with like one boob right that like what's a movie with one boob in it?

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,053
Speaker 0: well I can think of a movie with three.

72
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:02,265
Speaker 1: yeah Try to think of a.

73
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,729
Speaker 0: catch our ass to Mars.

74
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,975
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know.

75
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,138
Speaker 1: pick a movie with one boob in it.

76
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:11,689
Speaker 0: I don't know The Metroid movie that's coming out.

77
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,177
Speaker 1: that's not gonna have any boobs.

78
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:13,840
Speaker 0: it's gonna have one.

79
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,420
Speaker 1: That's an inside joke if I ever heard one.

80
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:25,511
Speaker 1: Anyway doesn't make your favorite r-rated movie that's got some titties in it and imagine making a video game out of that.

81
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:31,034
Speaker 1: it would be adults only with the same content and That's just the bullshit that we have right now.

82
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:38,321
Speaker 0: Well the thing is in America We have the you know G PG PG 13 are a a NC 17.

83
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,011
Speaker 0: I kept wanting to say X and adults only but no it's NC 17.

84
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:41,473
Speaker 1: and then X.

85
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,300
Speaker 0: no X is not a rating.

86
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,047
Speaker 1: One X is a rating?

87
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:45,811
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

88
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,479
Speaker 0: no they got rid of that a long time ago.

89
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,955
Speaker 1: I thought the triple X was not a rate.

90
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:54,599
Speaker 0: no no The issue with that because I actually did a bunch of this in the argument class star IT.

91
00:05:55,242 --> 00:06:01,500
Speaker 0: The X rating was originally intended to be you know beyond our and it wasn't necessarily intended to be for pornography.

92
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:07,077
Speaker 0: It was just the next rating like that the top rating, but they didn't trademark or whatever.

93
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:14,730
Speaker 0: so people just Self-applied the rating X mostly for pornography Mm-hmm and they didn't want to be associated with all that.

94
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:15,755
Speaker 0: there's a big problem.

95
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:22,020
Speaker 0: eventually they said screw it Let's make some other thing and just give up on X. That's the much much abridged version.

96
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,671
Speaker 0: But no X is not a valid rating for movies.

97
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,220
Speaker 1: Oh actually I just read really quickly.

98
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:36,434
Speaker 1: They had an X rating yes, yeah, and then because it wasn't trademark Oh like I said anyone could put an X rating on their movie like I said.

99
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:46,156
Speaker 1: and then Because they use the X rating so much They they invented NC 17 like I said yep all right spot on all right.

100
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:47,600
Speaker 0: see we research things.

101
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 0: You get that from the Wikipedia.

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,839
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe maybe no.

103
00:06:54,742 --> 00:07:02,060
Speaker 0: No, actually I remember when I was a kid that there were two theaters in the area that didn't even bother with the rating system.

104
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,569
Speaker 0: They pretty much let anyone into any movie, and that was great.

105
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:16,515
Speaker 1: There is no law whatsoever that says I mean if you brought a kid to a rated X movie, right There's no law that says you cannot bring a kid to a rated X movie more other than possible.

106
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,760
Speaker 0: child endangerment laws.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,720
Speaker 0: There are laws that say you know you can't endanger a minor whatever and basically I think it's contributing to the delinquents of a minor.

108
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:25,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:38,726
Speaker 1: So if you had a kid and you brought him to a rated R movie right then it would pretty much be up to the court to decide Based on that movie and exactly what you did whether you were guilty of this other Crime.

110
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,820
Speaker 1: that doesn't have anything to do with movie ratings whatsoever.

111
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:47,970
Speaker 1: There's no law that says a theater has to keep out people from certain rated movies except for you know Port straight-up pornos.

112
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,979
Speaker 0: the sad thing was though It didn't really affect me because I became old enough pretty much right around that time.

113
00:07:53,542 --> 00:08:00,100
Speaker 0: But a bunch of parents in town got into this uproar about oh Lord this movie theaters are letting the kids in to see these bad movies.

114
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,165
Speaker 0: We got to put a stop to that.

115
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:10,219
Speaker 0: so they came down hard on the movie theaters and basically Gave him the ultimatum of enforce these things or we will somehow destroy you and the theaters just all caved in.

116
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,293
Speaker 0: yeah But the theaters to their credit did something cool.

117
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:19,794
Speaker 0: They started checking Everyone's ID no matter what and it was very annoying to a lot of adults.

118
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,600
Speaker 1: That's a cool theater right there.

119
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:31,024
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is what I hate so much is that these people they cave in so quickly to these loud Minorities and Like that.

120
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:31,546
Speaker 0: what's that thing?

121
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,520
Speaker 1: the parents television that sends in most of the pretty much?

122
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,671
Speaker 1: 99% of the complaints to the FCC are from one group of people.

123
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:44,054
Speaker 1: yeah, right most people in this country I'm very confident want to see lots of violence and lots of sex.

124
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,600
Speaker 1: That's why those things get big ratings.

125
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,660
Speaker 1: That's why those things get big ticket sales.

126
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:52,676
Speaker 1: That's what everyone wants to see except for this very small mine loud minority of people.

127
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:56,552
Speaker 1: and if theaters Just freaking had some balls think about how much money.

128
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:57,537
Speaker 0: There's not just theaters.

129
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,711
Speaker 0: It's the theaters It's the government is the contact.

130
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:08,202
Speaker 1: if they had some balls And they just told those people to shut up Then you would see you wouldn't see a lot of people go hooray because they're quiet Majority.

131
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:13,720
Speaker 1: what you would see is that them make a lot of money from a lot of teenagers going to see freaking violent movies.

132
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:19,119
Speaker 0: And maybe those teenagers we get used to seeing violence and then not I don't know engaging is there's really?

133
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:20,837
Speaker 0: no I can't make a logical argument for that.

134
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:37,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that I don't think it would be such a big deal at all because while people like to see these things And I really want to see art be unconstrained and just let people do what they will so long as the creation of the art Itself does not actively harm people or things or up.

135
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,757
Speaker 0: well Maybe not things, but people are animals or anything like that.

136
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:48,237
Speaker 0: Like it shouldn't be illegal to have a movie where a guy gets shot all bloodily Unless you shoot a guy all bloodily in order to film it.

137
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,409
Speaker 1: well It could be a stunt guy who wants to get shot.

138
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,052
Speaker 1: No.

139
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:53,376
Speaker 0: There's there's problems with that.

140
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:57,100
Speaker 0: I know I know but Some hobo you shoot him in your film.

141
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,990
Speaker 1: No, you can't do that, but that's I don't think.

142
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 0: that's the problem that the rating systems are supposed to know solving.

143
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:15,797
Speaker 1: I actually do think there should be rating systems because on paper what a rating system does is it provides Information and does nothing more than provide information, and there's always good to provide more information.

144
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:25,692
Speaker 1: in my eyes You know if you buy a book and it says on the back this book contains violence and boobies That's great that the book says that on the back It's more information about the contents of the book.

145
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,060
Speaker 0: the problem with that?

146
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:32,778
Speaker 0: Stores and governments and people use these rating systems to restrict what other people do.

147
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:37,733
Speaker 0: I mean look at this Because Nintendo and Sony have full control over their consoles.

148
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:45,400
Speaker 0: They can just say to these people all right We're not gonna carry any adults only games so dying of fire and these people have no recourse.

149
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,440
Speaker 0: That's why I wish PC gaming would just explode back with a fury because no one controls the PC gaming market.

150
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one can stop your game from coming out.

151
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:54,629
Speaker 0: Yep.

152
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 1: See I don't really also don't have a problem with like Maybe not laws, but stores having a policy that says you know Kids can't buy if you're like a 12 year old you can't buy an M-rated game.

153
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,786
Speaker 1: I don't really have a problem with that either, but if a parent wants to buy the M-rated game and give it to their kid That's fine.

154
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,460
Speaker 1: You can't stop them from doing it.

155
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:18,712
Speaker 1: That's why this pisses me off that they made an AO game right.

156
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:22,223
Speaker 1: so you sell the AO game in the stores to Adults.

157
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:25,837
Speaker 1: only the fact that now people won't sell the game.

158
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:26,720
Speaker 1: This is the problem.

159
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,072
Speaker 1: I don't mind if the game is rated AO.

160
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:30,580
Speaker 1: I don't mind if the game exists.

161
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:33,656
Speaker 1: I don't mind if a parent buys it and gives it to a three-year-old.

162
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,279
Speaker 1: they can do that.

163
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:39,056
Speaker 1: But if a store won't sell the game even to an adult me I can't buy it.

164
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:40,180
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

165
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,309
Speaker 0: But at the same time there's nothing wrong with that.

166
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:45,883
Speaker 0: if I own a store you can't coerce me into selling things I don't want to sell.

167
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:49,940
Speaker 0: the only exception to that I think are pharmacies, but that's another thing altogether.

168
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:56,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that the store does have a right to not sell it if they don't want to but it's still sort of ass.

169
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,674
Speaker 0: and yeah I think the problem is that the way American and maybe Western in general consumerism is gone.

170
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,499
Speaker 0: is that very few?

171
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,628
Speaker 0: Retail stores control the majority of the markets.

172
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:11,340
Speaker 1: It's the same way that very few newspapers and TV stations control the media.

173
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:12,280
Speaker 1: You know yeah.

174
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:22,515
Speaker 0: So as a result if the big ones Decide not to sell something all the little ones usually follow suit for as far as I can see no reason because here's what they Could do and I wonder why people don't.

175
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:27,280
Speaker 0: in this case It's more difficult because it wouldn't be easy to just release this game on the PC.

176
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,959
Speaker 0: I don't think especially since it was we in PlayStation as opposed to Xbox.

177
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:39,560
Speaker 0: and then Anyway, what you do is if your game won't be sold in these places you market it as this is the game.

178
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,405
Speaker 0: That's too hardcore for Walmart.

179
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,271
Speaker 0: No one will sell this game.

180
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, except us.

181
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,580
Speaker 0: you can buy it directly from us online.

182
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,609
Speaker 0: We gave the ESRB the finger.

183
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,015
Speaker 0: Just give us your credit card.

184
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,300
Speaker 0: We'll send you your violent seat.

185
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,088
Speaker 1: That's what I would do.

186
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:57,640
Speaker 1: is I would say okay This game is illegal in Britain because Britain doesn't have freedom of speech apparently right?

187
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:03,285
Speaker 0: Oh, I would so set up some sort of gray market in Britain I know, but that's fine.

188
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:07,140
Speaker 1: the game is illegal in Britain cuz Britain is a backwards nation without freedom right now.

189
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,231
Speaker 0: But in the US, the only reason that this game isn't sold in the u.s.

190
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,577
Speaker 1: Is because the retail establishments the Walmart the GameStop etc.

191
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:19,240
Speaker 1: won't sell it.

192
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:29,460
Speaker 1: There's no law that says this game can't be sold here except for the fact that I guess also the system the consoles That the game is gonna be on don't want the game published on their consoles.

193
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:35,826
Speaker 1: This is why what I would do is if I was take two is I would just turn it into a PC game and sell It on Steam BAM

194
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:44,120
Speaker 0: and in the meantime because it might take a while to do that I would just keep marketing it as Nintendo and Sony are afraid of this game.

195
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,672
Speaker 1: Yep, all these people would sign up to steam.

196
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,200
Speaker 1: They would all download the game.

197
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,674
Speaker 1: Maybe I wouldn't use steam if I couldn't make a deal with valve.

198
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:51,720
Speaker 1: I do the direct to drive.

199
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,349
Speaker 0: I'm sure valve would be more than willing to game tap.

200
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,260
Speaker 1: There's like a bunch of different online game selling solutions out there.

201
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:02,860
Speaker 1: It's not too hard to convert a game from a ps3 game to a piece for a one-off like that.

202
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:06,500
Speaker 0: It'd be trivial to just sell the game straight up.

203
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,095
Speaker 0: It gets sent to you via a file transfer mechanism after the credit card number come.

204
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:12,660
Speaker 1: That's what the direct to drive thing is.

205
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:13,081
Speaker 1: It's.

206
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:16,555
Speaker 1: it's it basically this website where you can yeah, just buy.

207
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:17,740
Speaker 0: there's a lot of ways to do that.

208
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,101
Speaker 0: There are.

209
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,055
Speaker 1: there are many ways to do it and I don't see why they don't.

210
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:23,246
Speaker 1: if the game is done They should just.

211
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,940
Speaker 1: it would take them maybe a few weeks to set something like this up.

212
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,490
Speaker 0: Maybe it might take longer than that.

213
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,180
Speaker 1: if they I mean depending on how they coded it Depends on how they coded it but they coded it properly.

214
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,091
Speaker 1: Especially there is the problem especially if it's a 360 game.

215
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:36,280
Speaker 0: There is the problem of PC gaming in general.

216
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,888
Speaker 0: I mean you don't have the right controllers.

217
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,011
Speaker 1: I almost every USB controller sucks And that's why they have to do Xbox 360 controllers for PC.

218
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,576
Speaker 0: Oh, but it's not an Xbox game.

219
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:46,660
Speaker 0: It's a PlayStation Wii game.

220
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:47,305
Speaker 1: I know it's.

221
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,273
Speaker 1: that's another mistake.

222
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:53,298
Speaker 1: They made Yeah, if you're anything you make one a Xbox Wii game not an X Wii ps3 game.

223
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:54,364
Speaker 0: I don't know that.

224
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:59,500
Speaker 0: I guess that what it boils down to is I don't see any Ideological problems with what happened.

225
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:08,040
Speaker 0: The problem is more that the implementation of our society in terms of things like this Has ended up fucking us out of a game a game that I probably didn't care about.

226
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,603
Speaker 0: I don't know.

227
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,210
Speaker 1: It's because it was a Wii game now.

228
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:11,597
Speaker 1: I'm actually kind of interested.

229
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:18,705
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe because the best game on the Wii right now is still Insert game here.

230
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,595
Speaker 0: I don't have anything funny because I haven't touched.

231
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:21,620
Speaker 0: the Wii is covered in dust.

232
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,925
Speaker 0: It hasn't been turned on in weeks.

233
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:24,591
Speaker 1: We hasn't been turned on in over a month.

234
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,980
Speaker 1: All right, so my news is quick.

235
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:39,433
Speaker 0: if you have a 360 and the date is June 27th, which it should be because I don't know how many of you listen Well, I know exactly how many of you listen to the show at night, but I won't go there.

236
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:39,694
Speaker 0: Yep.

237
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:45,578
Speaker 1: You should be Going into your little Xbox Live shopping marketplace, whatever they call it.

238
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:52,184
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't have one and you should be buying car Casa C. They are CA SS Oh and any.

239
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:54,411
Speaker 0: I insist that you do so.

240
00:15:54,692 --> 00:16:02,800
Speaker 1: if you listen to this show and you have an Xbox 360 And you do not buy carcass own you are hereby no longer permitted to listen to this show.

241
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,930
Speaker 0: No, so you practice it.

242
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:04,880
Speaker 0: You're a bad person.

243
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:08,557
Speaker 1: I want to see carcass own in every game or tag I see in that forum.

244
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 0: now I kind of wish I had an Xbox.

245
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:16,177
Speaker 0: The only reason I don't is honestly that I don't have enough time to play video games because I want an Xbox games I want on it.

246
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:24,487
Speaker 0: yep, I would probably play carcass own more than anything on that thing because you see in our front row crew and in the Extending no conventions and everything.

247
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:35,077
Speaker 0: in all of my life since I've started playing carcass own I have about an 80 to 85 percent win rate to this day and as Scott was pointing out This is probably the truest test I could

248
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:35,379
Speaker 1: have

249
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:43,328
Speaker 0: Because I would be forced to play against the masses the masses out there who are probably going to spend a lot of time playing It for whatever achievement points they might get.

250
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:47,405
Speaker 1: it would also display your worldwide rank over time And yeah, I just kept winning.

251
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:53,109
Speaker 0: you'd eventually be number one in carcass own and if I wasn't or if I'm rising in the ranks You could know who to fight.

252
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,612
Speaker 1: Yep.

253
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:54,859
Speaker 1: You would know who is better than you.

254
00:16:55,101 --> 00:17:05,571
Speaker 0: So if you guys want to see me either Attain my greatness get to the top of Maslow's pyramid or if you want to see me crash and burn in a glorious flame Of suckage bias at 360.

255
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,880
Speaker 0: Yeah bias next 360.

256
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would actually buy one in a second if I had a single moment of the day in which I wanted to play video Games, but did not have a video game to play.

257
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, funny how we're gonna get to that in a little bit funny how we're gonna get to that.

258
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,119
Speaker 1: Yeah carcass own It's an awesome German board game.

259
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,847
Speaker 1: But now instead of buying a board game and having to find friends to play it with you You can just play it on the 360.

260
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,275
Speaker 0: ever actually do a show on carcass own.

261
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,480
Speaker 1: I think we just rate up.

262
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:31,930
Speaker 1: I think we did we showed.

263
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,319
Speaker 0: if if we didn't let us know we will.

264
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,190
Speaker 1: I'll search for it right now.

265
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:36,760
Speaker 0: carcass own is a great game.

266
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:45,290
Speaker 0: I mean aside from being just a great game that stands the test of time well better than settlers or other entry-level game We did in May of 2006.

267
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,796
Speaker 0: All right, then I'll stop there.

268
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:47,780
Speaker 0: carcass own is badass.

269
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:49,583
Speaker 0: You must buy it.

270
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:59,260
Speaker 0: end of story things of the day.

271
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,599
Speaker 0: I Have to talk about this because it touches on a lot of issues that are dear to me.

272
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:10,220
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go into a lot of depth about Exactly how I feel mostly because if anything that would be a separate show.

273
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:16,880
Speaker 0: In fact, I imagine might be a good Thursday because the Thursday we got going now for this Thursday is kind of a crap cop-out.

274
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:27,151
Speaker 0: but there's a video that exploded all over dig today of a bunch of kids in some city and Apparently they were skateboarding and a cop didn't like it.

275
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,234
Speaker 0: He told him to stop.

276
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:28,816
Speaker 1: they did.

277
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:29,920
Speaker 1: there are no skateboarding sign.

278
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:31,029
Speaker 0: I'll get to that.

279
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:36,220
Speaker 0: Okay, and The one of the kids I don't know if he was planning on an encounter with the cops.

280
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:45,948
Speaker 0: If he's just a brilliant kid who realizes that in this modern society, that's really the only way to protect yourself from incidents Especially involving authority figures.

281
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,300
Speaker 1: and why watch some ACLU instructional videos?

282
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:54,220
Speaker 0: But he seemed he had what appeared to be a hidden camera on him not maybe as a cell phone cam.

283
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:55,650
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't a cell phone cam.

284
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,395
Speaker 0: Definitely not.

285
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:56,979
Speaker 1: All right, and

286
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:12,780
Speaker 0: Basically the cop ends up head locking throwing to the ground threatening to pepper spray chases one of the kids around for a while there tries to run away and The situation just escalates and escalates and escalates and then all these kids end up being arrested for all sorts of crimes

287
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,287
Speaker 1: Like what besides

288
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,220
Speaker 0: obstruction of justice resisting arrest battery?

289
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,187
Speaker 0: The list goes on for a while.

290
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:22,500
Speaker 0: as the guys yelling at them all the crimes they've committed one of the kids starts crying.

291
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,301
Speaker 0: now, of course the internet is Outraged.

292
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,929
Speaker 0: as you might have guessed the internet is.

293
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:30,811
Speaker 1: it should be.

294
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:33,880
Speaker 0: well, then the internet seems very easy to outrage.

295
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:40,920
Speaker 0: I mean go to dig and every other story is usually people outraged about something whether or not it was justified.

296
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,520
Speaker 0: Yep, and the outrage usually goes well beyond a justifiable response.

297
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,700
Speaker 1: Well, I haven't actually gotten the details of this story other than what you just said.

298
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,388
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if I should be outraged or not.

299
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,640
Speaker 0: Well, I will boil it down very simply.

300
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:57,620
Speaker 0: There is a law against skateboarding in these public places that the kids were violating.

301
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,936
Speaker 0: The kids did ignore the cop and tried to just keep skateboarding and/or run away.

302
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 0: It's true.

303
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, the cop was a total dick.

304
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:16,063
Speaker 0: I will give the kids that this cop and his cop friend Basically acted like assholes and could have handled the situation I think better.

305
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:21,060
Speaker 0: there is the line at which you know teaching these kids a lesson would have been the good thing to do.

306
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,498
Speaker 0: I think they stepped a little bit beyond the line.

307
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:40,269
Speaker 0: However, the internet has reacted crazily to the point that the police station involved has been Succumbing to a flood of phone calls and emails from diggers and youtubers Expressing how horrible this cop is now.

308
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,498
Speaker 0: They should be fired and skateboarders writes and blah blah blah.

309
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:43,804
Speaker 0: Now here are the issues.

310
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:53,360
Speaker 1: as I see them and I'm gonna break this down without just watch the video It's definitely different from the video where the kids are Skateboarding and some random dad with his daughters tried to wrestle around with them.

311
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,225
Speaker 0: No, this is one of those.

312
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:55,976
Speaker 1: obviously the kids were in the right this one.

313
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:56,680
Speaker 1: It's kind of gray.

314
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,780
Speaker 1: It's like the kids were in the wrong, but the cops are also a little brutality.

315
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:04,756
Speaker 0: But at the same time the cops were perfectly justified legally and all their responses.

316
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:17,296
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Here are my observations from this rule number one if you are going to run away from the police Do not do so unless you expect you will be able to get away.

317
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:20,204
Speaker 0: Yeah Because I have.

318
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:24,598
Speaker 0: I'm going to say this because the statute of limitations is out on all of my previous crimes.

319
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:32,700
Speaker 0: as far as I am aware, I have run from the police before on Dozens of occasions and I got away in all of those occasions.

320
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:42,096
Speaker 0: Had there been any doubt in my mind that I was going to get away I would not have run away from the police because if you run and you get caught you're fucked.

321
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,684
Speaker 0: if you run and they knew Who you were already?

322
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,010
Speaker 0: It's game over.

323
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,673
Speaker 0: You're done.

324
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:48,400
Speaker 0: Do not run away from the police.

325
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:59,640
Speaker 1: It's sort of like one of those like the way that a lot of criminal law works is like if you do something It's illegal but then every little tiny thing you do sort of adds on to it like robbing a convenience store.

326
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,720
Speaker 1: Okay, robbing a convenience store if you had a gun on you?

327
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:10,340
Speaker 1: Oh if you brandish the gun if you fired the gun every step every tiny thing you do adds like five years.

328
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:21,428
Speaker 1: So if a cop is coming after you for say stepping on the grass in the park and you run you just added like Running and like resisting arrest.

329
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:29,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you don't want those you'd rather just get in trouble for stepping on the girl You got to do is do with that kid in City of God did.

330
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:35,560
Speaker 1: yep Yeah, but if you do manage to get away for running then you can even avoid the stepping on the grass.

331
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:38,357
Speaker 1: So yes It's if you can get away get away.

332
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,639
Speaker 1: if you can't Just stop because you'll just get a ticket for stepping on now.

333
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,720
Speaker 0: Yes, perhaps if I ever need a special I could do rims guide on how to run away from the police.

334
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,667
Speaker 0: Yeah but that might land me in trouble.

335
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:52,927
Speaker 1: so don't run if you haven't done anything illegal yet because Running will be the first illegal thing you do.

336
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:56,520
Speaker 1: And yes, if you didn't do anything illegal, you can just wait to go to court.

337
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,650
Speaker 0: But anyway, that is probably the most.

338
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,759
Speaker 1: I'm not a lawyer neither am I.

339
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:08,475
Speaker 0: lesson number two skateboarding is illegal in a lot of places where it probably shouldn't be.

340
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:17,300
Speaker 0: yeah, and I Really disagree with these towns these cities that try to make skateboarding and rollerblading and anything kids would do for fun on the street illegal.

341
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:25,640
Speaker 0: But at the same time if there is a law and you're going to civil disobedience it You've got to go all the way in the civil disobedience.

342
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:32,733
Speaker 1: You've got to get basically every kid in town to skateboard down Main Street And then when the police come I'll stop and say officer we were all skateboarding.

343
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:38,839
Speaker 1: I suggest that you take it all of us Yeah, and do it every day cuz you know what kids your parents have to pay.

344
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:46,860
Speaker 0: those Truer words have never been said because I guarantee that the ticket is already more than your allowance.

345
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:48,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what are they gonna do?

346
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,594
Speaker 0: dock your wages?

347
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:50,157
Speaker 0: You're not working.

348
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:50,720
Speaker 0: You're a punk kid.

349
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:58,859
Speaker 1: Yep, if every punk kid in town skateboards down Main Street every day and the police ticket all of you your parents will eventually say The law has to change.

350
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,527
Speaker 1: Yep, now they might make it worse.

351
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:07,079
Speaker 1: like you go to jail, but then every parents gonna have all their kids in jail every day You'll make friends with the cops.

352
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,306
Speaker 1: It'll be a good old time.

353
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:19,321
Speaker 0: plus it helps if you get your parents to go along with it Because your parents are probably sick you sitting inside playing video games all the time and they don't want you to go out and do Drugs, they don't want you to go out and vandalize things We

354
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:21,690
Speaker 1: should do next Thursday or this Thursday on this.

355
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,079
Speaker 0: yeah, there's the whole idea of kids need things to do.

356
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:25,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah watch the video.

357
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,647
Speaker 0: I'm not on the kids side 100%.

358
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,501
Speaker 0: I'm not on the cops side 100%.

359
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:38,215
Speaker 0: It's a complicated situation that I think really encompasses a lot of issues that are facing modern kids in modern America And I'll leave it at that.

360
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 0: So, um, but the cop was a dick.

361
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,832
Speaker 1: There are a lot of video games out there and you know a lot of people.

362
00:24:45,133 --> 00:25:02,800
Speaker 1: we always yell at people for mispronouncing things Usually standard English words, of course many video games have names that are not English words and The games don't include audio especially old games and there's usually no way to know the connect the correct pronunciation of these games.

363
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:08,088
Speaker 0: See now that this funny because before we grew up in the era where there was Nintendo But there wasn't an internet so much.

364
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,200
Speaker 1: Yeah for all we knew it wasn't Nintendo.

365
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,160
Speaker 1: It could have been 19 dough until they had TV commercials.

366
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:17,360
Speaker 0: Now the same thing happened with words like anime and manga versus anime and manga.

367
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:20,393
Speaker 0: And I think there's one good example of this.

368
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:27,833
Speaker 0: where I grew up Everyone pronounced it Crystallis, but in other places of America like down in Philly.

369
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:33,608
Speaker 0: It was pronounced crystallis and These areas kind of emerged on their own.

370
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:35,674
Speaker 1: How many people do I know say Mario?

371
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:36,396
Speaker 0: Yep.

372
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:40,108
Speaker 1: It's Mario It's an Italian first name.

373
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,033
Speaker 1: We know how to say it.

374
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:41,475
Speaker 1: This is this.

375
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,500
Speaker 1: one was not a mystery.

376
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:48,061
Speaker 0: well, that was more of an accent than people just deciding how to pronounce my no, but it's Mario.

377
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:49,586
Speaker 1: that is the correct pronunciation.

378
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one said Sonica the Hedgehog except maybe the French.

379
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,005
Speaker 1: Oh The hedgehog.

380
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:56,271
Speaker 1: he is a blue and fast.

381
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:57,818
Speaker 1: He runs away like the French.

382
00:25:57,838 --> 00:25:58,160
Speaker 1: we do.

383
00:25:58,964 --> 00:25:59,737
Speaker 1: He is a hero.

384
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:02,385
Speaker 0: No offense to the French.

385
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:04,173
Speaker 0: You're a lot better than those albionic fools.

386
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:05,860
Speaker 0: You don't ban video games.

387
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have as many sexy video games as you can get as well.

388
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:10,439
Speaker 0: You should.

389
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:12,366
Speaker 1: So here are.

390
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:12,929
Speaker 1: there was a funny.

391
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,800
Speaker 1: it was on dig so everyone's probably seen it.

392
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,406
Speaker 1: But here are the video games.

393
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:20,160
Speaker 1: that are the seven the top seven mispronounced video game names.

394
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:22,374
Speaker 1: Number one as soon as I saw it.

395
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:25,446
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, yeah This is an old NES game.

396
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:26,632
Speaker 1: I'm very fond of and it is.

397
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:32,023
Speaker 1: the title of the game is spelled FAX ANA do you?

398
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:36,237
Speaker 0: I heard I always said Faxanadu when I hit anyone who said anything else.

399
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:39,918
Speaker 1: be correct pronunciation and this is actually something I learned here.

400
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:49,380
Speaker 1: is You know Xanadu like, you know The mansion and Citizen Kane and the DDR song only with a FA in front of it as an ado Fazanadu?

401
00:26:49,581 --> 00:27:00,358
Speaker 1: Ah, yep, and actually the it says here incorrect pronunciation Fax Anna do and You know why it's Fazanadu.

402
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,565
Speaker 1: Why Oh Fazanadu?

403
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,049
Speaker 0: is it like Faux Xanadu?

404
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:07,317
Speaker 1: like you know Xana's a combination of Xanadu and Famicom.

405
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:10,079
Speaker 0: Ah Total ah.

406
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:11,765
Speaker 0: That kind of takes.

407
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:15,120
Speaker 0: that's kind of like when you think about you realize that Pokemon is just pocket monsters.

408
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,980
Speaker 1: The second one is actually one that I lost a pronunciation debate on so I know the critic pronunciation now.

409
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:29,311
Speaker 1: It is actually a manga slash anime slash RPG spelled Capital Y lowercase s ease not wise.

410
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,716
Speaker 1: Yeah ease ease.

411
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:31,658
Speaker 0: I said wise.

412
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:33,305
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I I said wise.

413
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:42,168
Speaker 0: but here's the thing when I got when I got to college and I hadn't said the name of this game because there was no reason for it to come up In fact, I never actually beat that game on the s.

414
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 1: there's a lot of games and there's a picked up the screenshot here.

415
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,974
Speaker 1: I think it's a promotional picture for ease six.

416
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:51,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's water of Napish, I think it was wanderers from.

417
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:52,652
Speaker 0: ease was the one on the SNES.

418
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:53,094
Speaker 0: I forget.

419
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:54,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, my brother liked that game a lot.

420
00:27:54,941 --> 00:28:00,820
Speaker 1: I just never see someone with a manga or an anime or video game and the title is spelled y s. it's ease.

421
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,310
Speaker 0: But when I got to college someone said I think it was katsu.

422
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:04,414
Speaker 0: He said he's.

423
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:05,278
Speaker 1: he said I think he said Isu.

424
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:07,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is he said it right?

425
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:10,777
Speaker 0: Yep, and my brain immediately made this calculation.

426
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,166
Speaker 0: Wow I'll bet I was saying that wrong.

427
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,531
Speaker 0: He said it before I did.

428
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:17,100
Speaker 0: I'm gonna defer to him unless other information presents itself.

429
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,842
Speaker 1: Well, he's Japanese.

430
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:22,517
Speaker 0: You should us saving myself from the problem that Scott had and was made the fool of later.

431
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,340
Speaker 0: for yeah I kind of argued against the ease and I was also wrong, but I knew not to argue.

432
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:32,854
Speaker 1: Anyway, the next one is one that I've never pronounced wrong, which is su ik o den.

433
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:34,960
Speaker 1: So we could end its sweet good end.

434
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,380
Speaker 1: Alright, I gotta I don't know how anyone mess that one up.

435
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,351
Speaker 0: I gotta ask because this one always bothered me is no banagas ambition on there?

436
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:42,896
Speaker 0: because more people?

437
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:47,514
Speaker 1: that one isn't a matter of Mispronunciation it's a matter of not seeing all the letters.

438
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,602
Speaker 0: people in my life called it No bungas.

439
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,031
Speaker 0: ambition because I I had that problem too.

440
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:58,539
Speaker 1: because if you look at the word no banaga very quickly You don't see that oona in there and it just looks like no bunga.

441
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,343
Speaker 1: I like.

442
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:11,380
Speaker 1: I thought if you asked me how to spell it I would have said no B-u-n-g-a, but if you look at it carefully because of you know The Roman letters when you put them in that arrangement you have to look at it carefully to realize it says no banaga.

443
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:16,862
Speaker 0: See I will give people a little bit of a pass because it's obvious to us now that you know We're smart.

444
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,389
Speaker 0: We listen to Japanese a lot.

445
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,140
Speaker 0: So we're kind of used to Japanese and wrote all that stuff.

446
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:25,540
Speaker 0: So when we see that word it makes sense no banaga.

447
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:35,900
Speaker 0: But if you're not like when I first started watching anime when I wasn't used to Japanese I just kind of didn't really read words that weren't in English and just kind of pronounced them haphazardly.

448
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:36,424
Speaker 0: Yep.

449
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:40,064
Speaker 1: Well, the next game is Called ahem.

450
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:43,657
Speaker 1: It actually this the article says we don't know how to pronounce it.

451
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:44,359
Speaker 1: pronounce this.

452
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:47,580
Speaker 0: Are you pronouncing words purposefully badly?

453
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,456
Speaker 1: Well, it actually says here in their article We say the name of this game is supposed to be mispronounced.

454
00:29:54,496 --> 00:29:55,360
Speaker 1: do your worst, right?

455
00:29:55,761 --> 00:30:06,815
Speaker 1: The way you spell the name of the game is P O P O L O C R O I S and that is pronounced Popola Croix, if you don't know how to say that you're there's nothing wrong with you.

456
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:10,487
Speaker 1: Yeah, Popola Croix I remember a kid when I want to argue with me.

457
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:10,848
Speaker 1: bring it.

458
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,440
Speaker 0: That's how that said who was very excited about a new game.

459
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,553
Speaker 0: He got dr.

460
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:16,139
Speaker 0: Chows.

461
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,982
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah.

462
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:18,463
Speaker 1: Wow.

463
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:18,883
Speaker 1: Yeah.

464
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:24,248
Speaker 1: The next one is actually pretty sad that people mispronounce pronounce this it's Day sex.

465
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, day is X as in day of sex machina.

466
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently some people say deuce X or D Or day of sex.

467
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,676
Speaker 0: ninth grade Greek literature called day Is X is the correct pronunciation?

468
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:41,590
Speaker 1: The next one is one rim likes the magic of Scheherazade.

469
00:30:42,253 --> 00:30:43,540
Speaker 0: It's not that hard to say that word.

470
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:51,077
Speaker 0: people not sure Zade not sure Cherezade Cherezade most people seem to say Cesarade.

471
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,482
Speaker 1: the next one is one.

472
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:54,127
Speaker 0: that's that game sucked.

473
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,679
Speaker 0: by the way, I like I wanted to like that game.

474
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,031
Speaker 0: I forced myself to like that game Like.

475
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,083
Speaker 0: literally I would play the game and I'd say to myself this game is great.

476
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:04,710
Speaker 0: It's just like all those other RPGs.

477
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:06,174
Speaker 0: Check out all these spells.

478
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:07,558
Speaker 0: I can plant things and think.

479
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,186
Speaker 0: so many secrets so many secrets this kid.

480
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:11,129
Speaker 0: No, thank you suck ass.

481
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,220
Speaker 1: Yep, the next one is Pokemons Pokemon Pokemon Pokemon.

482
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:29,430
Speaker 0: the correct pronunciation is Pokemon partly because they added in America that Accent a girl above the E to make sure you say poke instead of Pokemon because poke man is kind of yeah perverted.

483
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,100
Speaker 1: So the other pronunciations while fun are admittedly incorrect.

484
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,446
Speaker 0: It's Pokemon my Pokemons.

485
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:36,910
Speaker 0: Let me show them to you one star.

486
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:43,855
Speaker 1: Yes, okay to monster Okay, and those are the seven Mispronounced game names.

487
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:46,486
Speaker 1: if you mispronounce them incorrectly from here on out.

488
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:47,309
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with you.

489
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:51,630
Speaker 1: Well, actually one of my pet peeves is like if someone mispronounces something, right?

490
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,750
Speaker 1: I I correct them, you know, and then it's like they've heard the correct pronunciation.

491
00:31:57,172 --> 00:31:59,260
Speaker 1: They are capable of pronouncing it correctly.

492
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,984
Speaker 1: They do so at least once, you know, they say it correctly But then they come around to it again and they say it incorrectly.

493
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:10,404
Speaker 1: the next time like someone will say Manga and I'll say no manga and they'll say all right manga.

494
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,830
Speaker 1: and then a minute later They'll say well, I was reading this manga and I'm like you just said manga.

495
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:17,098
Speaker 0: Now at least what the fuck.

496
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:18,264
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

497
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:26,377
Speaker 0: if it's an accent thing Like people who say Mario or the same people to say water and while I make fun of them for their accent I can't fault them for mispronouncing.

498
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:27,441
Speaker 1: This is an accent.

499
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,203
Speaker 1: We're talking here.

500
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:30,290
Speaker 1: They were just capable of saying it the correct way.

501
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:31,169
Speaker 1: They just did it.

502
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,261
Speaker 0: Well, there's no accent that forces you to say manga instead of manga.

503
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:36,970
Speaker 1: and I will say there's an accent that forces you say aluminium.

504
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,397
Speaker 0: I Prefer saying aluminium.

505
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,830
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's an accent that forces that to happen.

506
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:44,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, true true true, but I'm okay with that.

507
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:49,447
Speaker 0: In fact, I somewhat prefer aluminium and I like spelling is also an accent that forces you to say coke.

508
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:51,855
Speaker 0: Ah We're not getting into that.

509
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,882
Speaker 0: Are you sure we're not getting into that?

510
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:56,210
Speaker 0: because the numbers are still pretty much 50/50.

511
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,760
Speaker 0: The front the battle line is pretty much at Rochester, New York.

512
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:00,502
Speaker 1: Yeah.

513
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:11,303
Speaker 0: Oh, well, so we'll get right to the chase Despite the fact that video game I mean if we look at all the geekeries know the different days of the week we do and we talked about this and kind of our origin shows.

514
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,181
Speaker 0: but Video gaming is the one that I have the most history with.

515
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:20,539
Speaker 0: it's my nearest and dearest and I think it's shaped my life As a whole more than any other of my geekeries.

516
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:21,362
Speaker 0: in the long run.

517
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:28,577
Speaker 1: just for the fact that it shaped my childhood So irrevocably, I mean when I was a little kid I was NES in in the single digits.

518
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:32,931
Speaker 1: the anime the manga the comics came around and I was like 10 or 11.

519
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:40,755
Speaker 1: My mother played the Atari 2600 Played the Atari 2600 with her med super breakout action.

520
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:44,139
Speaker 0: My grandpa played his Atari right up until his death.

521
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:56,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, and So did my grandma before any other geekery was inset, you know, I didn't have a computer until the double digits Even though I was using computers in kindergarten school, you know Apple twos.

522
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,978
Speaker 1: I didn't have that much time with them, you know.

523
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:05,614
Speaker 1: and everything else we did was mostly like, you know Outside in the backyard like normal kids and sports and those sorts of every young things I remember.

524
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:06,886
Speaker 0: I had big conflicts in my life.

525
00:34:06,946 --> 00:34:07,330
Speaker 0: right sitting.

526
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 0: I'd be sitting in front of the X like that extra TV Because my parents are watching a movie or something and it'd be sunny outside and I had pitfall and I wanted to play pitfall.

527
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:21,330
Speaker 0: But I also wanted to go outside and I wasn't sure what to do because they were both equal.

528
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:28,396
Speaker 1: Yep Often what I would do is ride a bike down the street and then play Nintendo at someone else's house or go get them Bring them back to my house.

529
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:28,980
Speaker 0: Yep.

530
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'd go swimming in the pool.

531
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:33,489
Speaker 1: Then we dry off go inside and play video games.

532
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,370
Speaker 0: See we never rode to someone's house to get him when we were really young kids.

533
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,824
Speaker 0: We'd always just call up and it was the phone.

534
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,974
Speaker 1: We always just rode bikes down We always use the phone and there's.

535
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,685
Speaker 0: it was like we none of us wanted to like.

536
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:44,790
Speaker 0: we were awkward on the phone.

537
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,406
Speaker 0: Cuz no, we're little kids, but we had this ritual where we'd I'd get the phone.

538
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:53,062
Speaker 0: I'd call my friend So I dial 881-1892 which was my friend.

539
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,489
Speaker 0: Joe Ogilvy lived down this way to give away a phone number.

540
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

541
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:57,579
Speaker 0: They haven't yet one.

542
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,844
Speaker 0: I didn't give away the area code.

543
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:03,284
Speaker 0: All right, and two, um They haven't lived in that house for probably two decades.

544
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,410
Speaker 1: whoever lives there is in trouble.

545
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:09,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they figure out the area code to which I am referring that's not hard to figure out what the Internet's.

546
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:12,719
Speaker 0: and actually no Because the area code changed.

547
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,445
Speaker 0: so it doesn't matter.

548
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:23,136
Speaker 0: Oh pun but anyway And I'd be like is Joe there and the parents would say just a minute and then Joe would pick up and say hello And I'd say want to play.

549
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,550
Speaker 0: he'd say, okay, we'd both hang up and then we'd meet on the street.

550
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:33,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would just have you would just knock on each other's doors and then they would you basically either You know, can you go or can you not go?

551
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,122
Speaker 1: It's pendant on your parents pretty much and it would.

552
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:39,862
Speaker 1: most of the time it was like yeah go I always notice as a kid like once in a while.

553
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:41,834
Speaker 1: It would be like no we're going out to dinner You can't go.

554
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:47,110
Speaker 0: it'd be like whoever knocked on the door Always brought the person whose door they knocked on away.

555
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,777
Speaker 0: You never knocked on someone's door and then went in.

556
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:52,233
Speaker 0: you always knocked on the door and then like let's go and then you dragged Him out.

557
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:52,616
Speaker 0: Yep.

558
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,726
Speaker 1: That's what the kids do.

559
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,569
Speaker 1: Anyway Video games are the oldest geekery.

560
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,870
Speaker 1: I've been video gaming longer than any other geekery except you might say like baseball card collecting.

561
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,461
Speaker 1: But I stopped doing that.

562
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:04,730
Speaker 0: you collected baseball cards.

563
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,969
Speaker 1: Well, you know when I was a little kid, my dad would like buy one pack every weekend.

564
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:10,959
Speaker 1: News dad, you know is that kind of thing?

565
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,990
Speaker 0: I had a few but I always stuck them in my bike spokes.

566
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't do that.

567
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,801
Speaker 1: I kept him on the floor.

568
00:36:15,861 --> 00:36:18,010
Speaker 0: My brother collected him so I can't really make fun of you.

569
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,030
Speaker 1: I got him sitting over there and then I stopped as soon as I stopped collecting things and wasting money on that.

570
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,415
Speaker 1: Right after you know, I gave up.

571
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:27,970
Speaker 1: basically I switched from baseball cards to superhero cards to magic cards.

572
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:29,310
Speaker 1: I was like good magic cards.

573
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,199
Speaker 1: These actually have a game associated with them.

574
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,083
Speaker 1: screw those other cards.

575
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:35,379
Speaker 1: and then I said wait this game And then I gave up all collecting.

576
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,490
Speaker 0: It's a good thing magic cards didn't come with bubble gum.

577
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:38,839
Speaker 1: Yeah without magic cards.

578
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,169
Speaker 1: I might still be collecting today.

579
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,189
Speaker 1: I would have ever realized collecting was a waste of time and money and space.

580
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:48,103
Speaker 1: But yeah video game is the oldest most revered geekery yet lately.

581
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,670
Speaker 1: I haven't been doing any video gaming at all.

582
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:59,036
Speaker 0: Well, I blame three factors and it's not a lack of time so much because there are times when I could choose to play a Video game and I choose to do something else instead.

583
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:00,641
Speaker 0: and I think number one.

584
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:08,402
Speaker 0: Is that the Wii at least for us is Absolutely useless because no games have come out for it.

585
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we've said talked about this a whole lot.

586
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,630
Speaker 0: This would be like the third or fourth time and I played Soul Calibur on the Wii more than I've played any Wii game.

587
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,624
Speaker 1: Yep, and that just to sum it up one more time.

588
00:37:18,644 --> 00:37:19,930
Speaker 1: I don't want to go into this whole lot.

589
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,150
Speaker 1: Is that the Wii as a vast potential as a gaming platform?

590
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,582
Speaker 1: Incredible potential more potential than possibly any other gaming platform ever created?

591
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:31,050
Speaker 1: that potential is largely unfulfilled.

592
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:37,562
Speaker 1: In fact, if the Wii was just a GameCube with a better CPU The games currently available for it.

593
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,711
Speaker 1: Don't even feel that meager potential It's.

594
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:50,538
Speaker 1: that's how bad it is and I'm confident the potential will be fulfilled within a year or so partly because the DS was in the same boat and the DS is still Awesome.

595
00:37:50,720 --> 00:38:00,352
Speaker 1: Yep, and Until that potential is fulfilled the Wii will remain sitting there off and barely used and that's a whole lot of gaming that I Would be doing.

596
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:07,918
Speaker 1: if there was a game right now that actually fulfilled more than 50% of the Wii's potential I would not be able to resist playing it.

597
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,334
Speaker 1: but as it stands there's pretty much nothing on the Wii Yeah that I can resist.

598
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,570
Speaker 0: I don't have so much trouble resisting playing Wario where we I don't even need to resist.

599
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,834
Speaker 1: I have no desire whatsoever Exactly.

600
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,890
Speaker 0: So in fact you would have to coerce me into playing it at this point.

601
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,118
Speaker 1: Yep, so the Wii is just sitting there dormant.

602
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,987
Speaker 0: All right, but friend you just said the DS is awesome.

603
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:27,750
Speaker 0: It is awesome.

604
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:28,496
Speaker 1: It's holy shit.

605
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:28,960
Speaker 0: Awesome.

606
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,994
Speaker 0: I blame one Pokemons fatigue.

607
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:35,407
Speaker 1: Yep currently, you know the way the DS works is.

608
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:39,150
Speaker 1: it is very awesome And there are very many many very awesome DS games.

609
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:50,456
Speaker 1: but to really get the most out of a lot of them you need the multiplayer action and Well right now while you know the past few weeks we've been sitting in our houses we're going on trains to work.

610
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:56,078
Speaker 1: all the single-player action on the DS has been cleared out and Only multiplayer action is left.

611
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:56,922
Speaker 0: See we're in different.

612
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:03,010
Speaker 0: we're in different states because for me I still haven't even gotten past the first level of Kirby's canvas curse.

613
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:10,990
Speaker 0: Well, you know that's and I haven't beaten the second Phoenix right game and I stopped playing Pokemon and I never finished Princess Peach.

614
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:11,936
Speaker 0: Though fuck that game.

615
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:13,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't finish it either.

616
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,250
Speaker 0: I will I beat it.

617
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,910
Speaker 0: I got to the end and then she's like no you gotta go save all the rest of the guys that you didn't save.

618
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,515
Speaker 1: I said what fuck that?

619
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,422
Speaker 0: wait, and I just never played it again.

620
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,188
Speaker 1: I'd be like four levels of Princess Peach.

621
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:24,710
Speaker 1: then I was done.

622
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:25,735
Speaker 0: It was fun.

623
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:26,799
Speaker 0: It was just you know easy.

624
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,110
Speaker 1: Yeah didn't provide much of a child.

625
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,650
Speaker 0: And actually I mean sadly one of the games that I love the most on the DS was still the new Mario Brothers.

626
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:40,210
Speaker 0: But I got to admit the new Mario Brothers was trivially trivially easy and I really didn't die in beating.

627
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:48,189
Speaker 1: It was also trivially easy and it had absolute almost no replay value other than going back to get all the big coins and actually Got four worlds worth of big coins.

628
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,293
Speaker 1: Yeah complete sets.

629
00:39:49,735 --> 00:40:01,530
Speaker 0: and then I stopped because it was tedious and I don't know why because Mario world has a lot more replay value and so does Mario 3. and I'm not sure if that's just me and my bullshit nostalgia Or if there's a difference, but I think I'm gonna get it.

630
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:12,274
Speaker 1: But the reason for that I think is because in Mario world and Mario 3 Usually beat the game without beating all the levels and there was a lot of places to explore and levels to go to and things To do.

631
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:18,884
Speaker 1: yeah, we did talk about New Super Mario Brothers when I beat it the first time I beat it straight through.

632
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:23,708
Speaker 1: I beat almost every single level on the first Try in one shot and there wasn't any.

633
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:23,950
Speaker 1: you know.

634
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:30,109
Speaker 1: There there was no content left for me to take in other than finding a few secrets, which I didn't really care about.

635
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:49,158
Speaker 0: also I mean all the the secrets and the things in Mario 3. in Mario world were kind of hard to get and You had to play through parts of the game, especially in Mario 3 to get to him but in this new one the big mushroom was pretty much a useless gimmick and the tiny mushroom was annoying and The shell just killed you like.

636
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:52,230
Speaker 0: there was no benefit to these things and there was no mystique about them.

637
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:53,459
Speaker 0: But the hammer suit.

638
00:40:53,923 --> 00:40:56,054
Speaker 0: one was awesome Two was amazing.

639
00:40:56,094 --> 00:41:00,588
Speaker 1: three was fantastic and for more mystique than any other item in any video game ever.

640
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:06,330
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, definitely except possibly the hammer in Zelda 2 before I had gotten the hammer.

641
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,997
Speaker 0: Yes But the the thing about it once I got the hammer.

642
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:16,270
Speaker 1: the mistake about the hammer suit that gives it more mystique than say You know this most powerful gun in Metroid or the BFG or something like that.

643
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:19,310
Speaker 1: Is that it is not something that is required to beat the game.

644
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,070
Speaker 1: You could beat the game without even knowing it's there where I'll go hammer and Zelda - you're gonna get it.

645
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,216
Speaker 0: I'll go one step further.

646
00:41:24,738 --> 00:41:30,617
Speaker 0: the hammer suit in Mario 3 transcended a hitherto Untranscendent boundary.

647
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:32,730
Speaker 0: you crossed this line.

648
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:41,750
Speaker 0: You were able to get a power and become like one of your enemies in a game Where traditionally there was no such possibility.

649
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:47,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, the possibility of getting the power of an enemy in Mario was amazing to me.

650
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,230
Speaker 1: is that's why Kirby's Adventure was awesome.

651
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,261
Speaker 0: Yes, I love those Kirby games.

652
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,810
Speaker 1: We should actually get the Kirby's Adventure.

653
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,212
Speaker 1: I think this.

654
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:54,658
Speaker 1: they remade it for the GBA.

655
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,747
Speaker 0: Yes, but I think there were.

656
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:57,390
Speaker 0: I mean my different.

657
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,750
Speaker 0: I mean, I have plenty of single-player content, but Phoenix, right?

658
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,730
Speaker 0: I got kind of fatigued trying to play it through it in one go just because it was mostly the same game.

659
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,875
Speaker 0: it was just you know, I like the game, but I got fatigued and Pokemon was the same thing.

660
00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:16,813
Speaker 0: I just got fatigued and then at that point I'm really starting to crave Multiplayer action.

661
00:42:16,853 --> 00:42:21,070
Speaker 0: I'm really starting to crave direct competition against my friends as opposed to single-player combat.

662
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,990
Speaker 1: Yep, and that would that niche would be filled by Pokemon except because of my Pokemon fatigue.

663
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:35,190
Speaker 1: I beat Pokemon the single-player But I'm really fatigued and I have no desire to level up my Pokemon and craft my team necessary for multiplayer.

664
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:38,838
Speaker 1: but without that team I have no desire to play the multiplayer.

665
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:44,668
Speaker 1: and it's also unless other people also have their team set They have no desire to play the multiplayer with me.

666
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:52,295
Speaker 1: So it's gonna take quite a bit of time of losing Pokemon fatigue for me to go back and train up a team And have that be enjoyable.

667
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:52,777
Speaker 1: Yep.

668
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:56,390
Speaker 0: Now, I think the other concern is that I like all this multiplayer stuff.

669
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,755
Speaker 0: I like to play against other people.

670
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,621
Speaker 0: I want to compete with other people.

671
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:05,998
Speaker 0: I want to interact in a shared space in some way and We just rock the board game something fierce.

672
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,930
Speaker 0: and I actually am trying to end this show as quickly as I can Because Alex is sitting in the other room waiting for us to come down and play a board game.

673
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we bought four board games and

674
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:16,108
Speaker 0: while

675
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:28,506
Speaker 1: you know We try to keep the Tuesday shows even between board games and video games with some RPGs here and there if we buy four board Games, we're gonna be playing those board games before we're gonna play a video game.

676
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:29,730
Speaker 1: That's just how it is lately.

677
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:42,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's a board game sitting there, we've only played once in our lives and it's a multiplayer board game That's really strategically deep and is say super paper Mario Which I've beaten a little bit over half of.

678
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:56,554
Speaker 1: I'm basically gonna completely ignore super paper Mario unless there's nothing else to do at all and when I'm also in addition to that personally when I'm sitting around the house with nothing to do and I need a Solitary activity.

679
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:19,569
Speaker 1: I'm either going to work on something like maybe housework or eating or you know something for the conventions or the show or something like that or I'm gonna read some comics and I got a lot of comics and books sitting there and lately I'm just in the mood to go for those before I go to beat super paper Mario, which is which is good But it's one of those games where I'm gonna play once and never play again.

680
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:30,606
Speaker 1: so waiting on beating the second half is actually kind of okay, okay, because it sort of prolongs the Usability of the Wii until this games actually come for come out for it this holiday season.

681
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,115
Speaker 0: I don't know to me I mean, I never.

682
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:38,727
Speaker 0: I didn't even play through Twilight Princess yet in fact I'm two hours into it and I'm not really sure why because I really like that game and I could.

683
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:44,329
Speaker 0: I do have time to Sit down and play an hour or two every other night and just start progressing through it.

684
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:54,275
Speaker 0: It seems like it might just be a personal problem I have where I have seasons of like and dislike of certain things and sometimes it's video game season Sometimes it's board game season.

685
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:55,378
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's counter-strike.

686
00:44:55,438 --> 00:45:06,010
Speaker 1: I'm generally getting the feeling that like I'm in me I really don't have a desire anymore to go out and play video games Like I don't seek them out so much.

687
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:10,906
Speaker 1: But well some games but a lot of those games I can't play or don't have time for.

688
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:14,242
Speaker 1: like I can't sit down and play Civ for you know civilization for hours and hours.

689
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:15,610
Speaker 1: right now, you know, I can't do that.

690
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:22,570
Speaker 1: But what happens is when new video games come out like let's say that Metroid corruption came out for the Wii, right?

691
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:38,736
Speaker 1: it has such a strong pull that I can't resist it and I go and I buy it and then I sit down and basically I Would come home every day and play it and play it and play it and play it do the show eat play it and play Play it play it play it until it's beaten and then I put it on the shelf and wouldn't play it anymore because I have Eliminated all its lure

692
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:39,661
Speaker 0: for me.

693
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:41,710
Speaker 0: It's more than I go through cycles.

694
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:50,482
Speaker 0: It's kind of like my man cycle my rim cycle and right now the cycle that I'm feeling cuz I I have my super fast computer And half-life 2 and I really kind of want to play.

695
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:52,230
Speaker 1: I couldn't resist half-life 2 at all.

696
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:54,217
Speaker 0: I I'm having trouble resisting it.

697
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:56,083
Speaker 0: I am but it's so.

698
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,448
Speaker 1: that is the strongest pull.

699
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:00,881
Speaker 1: the Half-life episode 1 2 comes out.

700
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:02,670
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be able to do anything else until it's beaten.

701
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:08,390
Speaker 0: The kinds of games that are available to me that I haven't beaten yet that are single-player on my consoles.

702
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:09,629
Speaker 0: You know I DS and the Wii.

703
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:12,286
Speaker 0: For some reason that's not the season.

704
00:46:12,307 --> 00:46:12,690
Speaker 0: I'm in now.

705
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:24,620
Speaker 0: I was in that season before those games came out and by the time those games came out right now I desire really tactical really deep really immersive Really like maybe half-life but more.

706
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:27,430
Speaker 0: the things I get out of German board games are games like it has life.

707
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,816
Speaker 1: It's more cinematic experience.

708
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:32,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's my real draw right now is games like advanced wars.

709
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:42,190
Speaker 0: But I've already beaten every advanced wars game entirely and I realize now that I forgot I bought Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and I stopped playing it a long time ago.

710
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:43,899
Speaker 0: I think it's time to pick it back up.

711
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,267
Speaker 1: buy that I didn't know we had that.

712
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:46,820
Speaker 1: I have it I kind of want to play that.

713
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:47,770
Speaker 0: I bought it real cheap.

714
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,250
Speaker 0: I started it, and then I think I forget what distracted me.

715
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,015
Speaker 0: I think the Wii came out, and I just they're gonna be a Fire Emblem DS Probably.

716
00:46:55,036 --> 00:46:55,946
Speaker 1: I kind of want that.

717
00:46:56,027 --> 00:47:00,026
Speaker 0: now I'm really feeling that the problem is I keep forgetting that.

718
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:02,497
Speaker 0: I mean I just now remembered I have Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.

719
00:47:02,537 --> 00:47:03,059
Speaker 0: I never played it.

720
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,270
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna play that tomorrow on the way to work.

721
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,810
Speaker 1: I also think that the final problem is that all things we do in the summer have to compete with the outside of the house.

722
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:19,684
Speaker 0: Yes I'm like a winter they do not Especially since a bunch of us have decided to take up rock climbing and all these other things.

723
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:28,127
Speaker 1: well so a new board game that is Strategically deep can compete with outside, but hey super paper Mario really can't.

724
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:31,358
Speaker 1: it's good And I want to play it, but it can't compete with outside.

725
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:34,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I guess it does just come down to things all.

726
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,091
Speaker 0: I mean.

727
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:43,269
Speaker 0: there's the competition for every minute of my waking life and right now all the other forms of entertainment are tickling my fancy So much more powerfully.

728
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:49,918
Speaker 0: Yeah Which is kind of sad because I really like video games and I can imagine the kinds of games That were they put in front of me.

729
00:47:50,038 --> 00:47:52,450
Speaker 0: I would play them to the exclusion of all these other activities.

730
00:47:52,952 --> 00:48:00,037
Speaker 0: But the games I imagine I are there already own and beat or I forgot about which means I'm gonna start playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance a whole bunch.

731
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:03,465
Speaker 1: or they don't exist or I don't know about them And I'm not gonna waste.

732
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:09,490
Speaker 1: you know I have better things to do than spend time looking for them because I really just don't like spending time looking for things.

733
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh well.

734
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:11,636
Speaker 0: You know what screw this.

735
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:12,559
Speaker 0: I solved my problem.

736
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,510
Speaker 0: I'm felt playing tactics advance tonight, and at least maybe tomorrow.

737
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:18,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, well no more video game drought for me.

738
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:23,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, uh I'm gonna go play some board games and expect board game shows for the next week or two.

739
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:23,928
Speaker 1: God.

740
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:30,010
Speaker 0: But then we got conventions coming up - yeah, and then we're gonna go and have arcade shows once we get to the shore.

741
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:31,456
Speaker 1: Oh, that's true.

742
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:35,090
Speaker 0: I guess all right, but I'm really feeling the urge to go play power.

743
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,095
Speaker 1: Oh, that's another thing.

744
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,703
Speaker 1: the last reason.

745
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:38,890
Speaker 1: I'm not playing video games.

746
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:46,190
Speaker 1: There's one genre of game that I feel an urge to play more than any other board game outside or anything.

747
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:47,380
Speaker 0: What genre is that?

748
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,388
Speaker 1: the rhythm game?

749
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,589
Speaker 1: But of course we can't play DDR in our house because it shakes the house.

750
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:54,496
Speaker 1: well We don't own the guitar heroes.

751
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:58,070
Speaker 0: We could play DDR if we play it on the deck, and I'm not gonna do that.

752
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,270
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go to the shore and do the arcade machine.

753
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,803
Speaker 1: I'm gonna probably play DDR for hours and hours to bring my Nalgene over there.

754
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:04,365
Speaker 0: God.

755
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:05,610
Speaker 0: We're gonna be those guys.

756
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:07,641
Speaker 0: I haven't been that guy in a long time.

757
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:08,445
Speaker 1: It's fine.

758
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:09,330
Speaker 1: I gotta be that guy.

759
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:14,808
Speaker 1: This is my legs right now are literally like there are muscles in my leg twitching like they want to step on arrows.

760
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:20,226
Speaker 0: you realize I am doing twitching right now in my feet all the steps to shooting star on maniac.

761
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:22,342
Speaker 0: because I play that song so many times I got to memorize.

762
00:49:22,363 --> 00:49:34,958
Speaker 0: yeah If there's ever a question I love guitar hero, and I think it's awesome, but DDR is so much more staying power Plus the fact that you get exercise plus I'm holding out and buying the guitar hero.

763
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:43,652
Speaker 1: because while I could get a ps2 and a guitar hero pretty cheap I'm waiting to see which system in the long run has the most rhythm game Action.

764
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:51,669
Speaker 1: because if I buy a ps2 sure I have access to the existing ps2 rhythm game library and guitar hero 1 2 And I think the 80s version that's coming out.

765
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:58,890
Speaker 1: But the 360 has guitar hero 2 and I don't know what guitar hero games in the future are those also gonna come for the?

766
00:49:59,070 --> 00:49:59,431
Speaker 1: Ps2.

767
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:10,013
Speaker 1: what DDR games in the future are gonna come for which systems I want to get if I'm buying a console That's not the Wii because I have a feeling the Wii is not gonna be the awesome rhythm game machine although it might be I won't.

768
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:16,912
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna buy a console other than the Wii unless that is pretty much the home of the most rhythm game action Period.

769
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,156
Speaker 0: yeah rhythm games.

770
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:20,624
Speaker 1: I love when I first saw I gotta wait and see.

771
00:50:20,704 --> 00:50:23,655
Speaker 0: the first time I played DDR I was converted from.

772
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:26,970
Speaker 0: while that's stupid - I have found my new calling in life.

773
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:31,130
Speaker 1: Yep, I saw it, and I people kept playing it, and I looked at it and said that's the stupidest thing.

774
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,939
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother and I was stupidest thing.

775
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:35,210
Speaker 1: I'm not even a bother as the soup and I damn it.

776
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:46,170
Speaker 0: There's that one social night where you were off playing D&D and I played DDR by myself on a projector for like three hours And then you came back, and you were like what the fuck you do when you're playing that stupid game.

777
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,166
Speaker 0: And I was like do it once do it.

778
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:58,609
Speaker 1: once I said oh I must try everything once before knocking and then I tried it And I didn't want to admit to myself that it was yeah, and then we played until they kicked us out.

779
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:05,123
Speaker 0: Yep, my I remember how much my feet hurt the next day, so See I think that's all we got to say about.

780
00:51:05,203 --> 00:51:11,829
Speaker 0: I would like to say you guys out There are really lucky because if our house allowed us to play DDR There wouldn't be as many geek nights out there.

781
00:51:12,272 --> 00:51:15,209
Speaker 0: And if we own Guitar Hero wouldn't be as many geek nights out there.

782
00:51:15,854 --> 00:51:17,728
Speaker 0: And if we had both that'd be the end of the show.

783
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,737
Speaker 1: yeah But it's not video game season.

784
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:25,073
Speaker 1: so if you notice a lack of video game related shows It's not video game.

785
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:30,936
Speaker 0: It's anime board game comic season at least until it snows again anime season It'll be anime season.

786
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:32,462
Speaker 1: when the more new shows, I don't know.

787
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:39,330
Speaker 1: maybe in late September I'm probably gonna actually season for watching a lot of anime, but it's not the season for new anime.

788
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,594
Speaker 1: That was you know a few months ago.

789
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:41,216
