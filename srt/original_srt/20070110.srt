1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,189
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 10th.

2
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:08,279
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and I'm rim and this is geek nuts.

3
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,040
Speaker 0: tonight we review Initiality.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,380
Speaker 0: Let's do this Unless you've been living under a rock in the world of the interwebs.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,795
Speaker 0: There is one thing which has been dominating the news since yesterday or yesterday.

6
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,433
Speaker 0: Yeah yesterday and We're not talking about it today at all.

7
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,518
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna mention it.

8
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,560
Speaker 1: You mean that a fruit company.

9
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:42,640
Speaker 0: It could be something having to do with that, but we're not gonna talk about it at all.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,453
Speaker 0: They made that phone whatever that you already said.

11
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:45,855
Speaker 0: too much.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,382
Speaker 1: I Something.

13
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:51,373
Speaker 0: let's talk about anime or manga comics or whatever.

14
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,520
Speaker 1: I think we're mostly gonna talk about anime today.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,245
Speaker 0: That's I have a feeling that we will talk a great deal about anime today.

16
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:12,160
Speaker 1: I mean if you couldn't gather from the Interesting opener we used up might be a little bit of a special episode.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,977
Speaker 0: Special isn't even begun to describe how awesome this episode will be and not special like the ballad boy down the street.

18
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:27,819
Speaker 0: No Well, I guess depending on your point of view it could be special like that.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,504
Speaker 0: What are you talking about it?

20
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:30,549
Speaker 0: but in a good way?

21
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kids a maven.

22
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:40,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, I'm gonna jump right into the news here cuz there was actually a lot of anime news a lot of it.

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:47,416
Speaker 1: Not gonna talk about any great detail because I don't really care and I think you know My sentiments exactly as to how I would feel about this news.

24
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:54,960
Speaker 1: For example Nana possibly Theoretically plans in quotes to air in the u.s.

25
00:01:55,462 --> 00:02:01,435
Speaker 0: Well at the end of every Nana episode they have this girl I don't is she like the voice actor or something or I don't know what she is.

26
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,322
Speaker 1: It's not as room Yeah and she.

27
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:08,460
Speaker 0: she sits in Nana's room and she talks about the show and she tells you what like.

28
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,204
Speaker 0: Oh the soundtrack is available.

29
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:10,746
Speaker 0: go buy it.

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,012
Speaker 1: She tells you what to buy and when.

31
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:16,602
Speaker 0: yeah, and she's like, oh there's a new Nana DVD.

32
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,429
Speaker 0: go buy it and stuff like that.

33
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:25,311
Speaker 0: So at the end of one of the recent episodes episode 31 Yeah she said Nana is gonna be on TV in the US holy crap.

34
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:30,319
Speaker 0: and no US anime company or Cartoon Network or anyone has said anything about that.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,126
Speaker 0: So we'll wait and see.

36
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,856
Speaker 0: and cuz you mean Japanese people wouldn't know if she was lying.

37
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:42,780
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe they mean by airing in America that they're going to broadcast it at high strength over the ocean.

38
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,492
Speaker 0: That would be so awesome.

39
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:45,660
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

40
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,448
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, so one piece.

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,880
Speaker 1: how many movies do you think one piece is made?

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,880
Speaker 0: I know they've made too many.

43
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:59,780
Speaker 0: Well, the thing I don't know is are the one-piece movies Are they summary movies of the TV series?

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:19,920
Speaker 0: because if so That's actually a good thing because now you can get the whole TV series and just like you know a few hours instead of watching hundreds upon hundreds of episodes or reading volumes and volumes of manga if they're not summary movies if they're actually like at Important parts in the TV series you have to insert a movie because that part of the plot is so crazy.

45
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:24,520
Speaker 0: And that's bad because now not only is a hundreds of episodes, but it's a fistful of movies, too.

46
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,226
Speaker 1: I have a feeling I mean once.

47
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:27,852
Speaker 1: obviously you can tell her ignorance.

48
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,100
Speaker 1: Neither one of us have seen a single one of these movies.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,740
Speaker 0: yeah, I've watched four episodes of one piece in my life and I've read about ten volumes of manga and that's that's way too much as much as I'm gonna read.

50
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:45,400
Speaker 1: But I imagine it's a lot like the Sailor Moon movies, which I've seen all of in that or the cowboy bebop movie.

51
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:46,228
Speaker 1: They don't.

52
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:59,330
Speaker 1: I mean they take place Theoretically at a point along the actual TV continuity and I guess you could consider them Canon, but nothing in them Affected the the actual plot in any way.

53
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,040
Speaker 1: like you could take him or leave him basically standalone story.

54
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,097
Speaker 0: Well, it's obviously one of those three things We don't know which because we don't know anything about one.

55
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:13,458
Speaker 1: of course That was a spoiler for every Sailor Moon movie because if you watch them all Sailor Moon dies But yet somehow she's not dead by the end.

56
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,140
Speaker 0: I guess it wouldn't be a movie without doing that.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Speaker 1: I think Dave and Joel were bitching about that in the Sailor Moon our movie where every movie is like don't use the super Extra power to save the day you'll die.

58
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:30,559
Speaker 1: She says but I have to for the sake of the world and then she just doesn't die for some reason.

59
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

60
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:41,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chevalier, which we've seen two episodes of and which my opinion of the first episode was a hundred percent awesome I opinion the second episode was 50% fail.

61
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,696
Speaker 1: So it's still you know, right around to see.

62
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,496
Speaker 1: a solid C is Coming to the anime network.

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,151
Speaker 1: Regardless of whether or not it's a good show as far as I'm concerned I think Chevalier is gonna do real well in the US.

64
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,120
Speaker 1: among the anime networks viewers.

65
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,200
Speaker 0: It's definitely better than a lot of the other anime that came out this season.

66
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,460
Speaker 0: So I think in this next round of upcoming shows is gonna be one of the top shows even though overall it might.

67
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,389
Speaker 0: Who knows if it's a great show or not?

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,840
Speaker 0: I think it's an average show even if it's not great.

69
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,559
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that is gonna be fun.

70
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it's possible for that show to go into the realm of bad.

71
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,360
Speaker 0: I think the worst it can be is average which is you know, if there's nothing else to watch.

72
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,722
Speaker 0: I really

73
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:33,016
Speaker 1: imagined myself getting the same enjoyment and the same type of enjoyment out of Chevalier That most people get out of say Fist of the North Star or giant robot shows, you know, it's bad You know, it's nothing to be proud of and yet you love every second of it.

74
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,482
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

75
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:39,988
Speaker 0: I put it on the same level as say Probably Gonkutsu or something like that.

76
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,570
Speaker 1: I don't know.

77
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,920
Speaker 1: I think Gonkutsu was probably a lot better than Chevalier.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,040
Speaker 0: I don't know.

79
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,119
Speaker 0: I actually kind of like the first episode of Chevalier more than I like.

80
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,889
Speaker 0: You know the Gonkutsu I've seen.

81
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,931
Speaker 1: well, you haven't read the Count of Monte Cristo One of the greatest works ever written in French.

82
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I don't got time for that shit.

83
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:57,040
Speaker 1: You can't even knock that book off in like two weeks.

84
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:02,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, I knocked off a lensman book in three days and that provided crazy amounts of enjoyment.

85
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:11,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really care about any of the rest of this other than a Bobobo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Season.

86
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,810
Speaker 0: we seem to be the only people who can say that correctly.

87
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,196
Speaker 1: I don't know how hard.

88
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,666
Speaker 0: there's seven There's seven bows.

89
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,273
Speaker 0: So you do four and then three.

90
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:20,839
Speaker 0: Bobobo Bo Bo Bo Bo.

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,740
Speaker 1: We showed that at our anime club back in Rochester when it first aired in Japan as soon as it was fansub.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,202
Speaker 1: You know what?

93
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:28,851
Speaker 1: We said the name right.

94
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,440
Speaker 1: even then how can people still be getting it?

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,145
Speaker 0: How all these people like?

96
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:36,420
Speaker 0: whenever they see the name on paper, they just go up Bobo Bobo, whatever it's called.

97
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:44,547
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it's not that hard Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo, but I can't fail to say it properly Not difficult.

98
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,100
Speaker 1: we did a tutorial before we showed it in the club.

99
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,699
Speaker 1: We were like, it's Bobo Bobo pause Bobo Bo.

100
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:55,060
Speaker 1: And we made everyone say it before we showed it to a guy who attacks with his nose hair.

101
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,165
Speaker 1: God that show.

102
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,178
Speaker 0: it's worth it to watch like one or two episodes for the like.

103
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,088
Speaker 0: It's it's the wackiest of wacky comedies.

104
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,275
Speaker 1: You gotta watch that show up to Don Pachi.

105
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,820
Speaker 1: There's nothing left after that.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,442
Speaker 0: That's about.

107
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 0: I think that's about right because Don Pachi shows up and it's funny because all we got is Don Pachi.

108
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:14,318
Speaker 0: But then after that, I don't think it goes anywhere At least not from what I saw.

109
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you haven't gathered it, I'm just reading off the anime news network.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,951
Speaker 1: But the actual news we want to talk about is in Scott's round.

111
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:21,915
Speaker 1: Yes.

112
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:22,959
Speaker 0: I have the good news here.

113
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,813
Speaker 0: So Viz who this doesn't really do DVDs?

114
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:27,135
Speaker 0: do they?

115
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,540
Speaker 0: they're mostly the manga, right?

116
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,585
Speaker 0: I'm sure they do some anime.

117
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:34,539
Speaker 0: But anyway, well, they definitely do anime because that's what this news says.

118
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:41,960
Speaker 0: Viz has licensed the Death Note anime, right which is still on the air in Japan, which is kind of crazy.

119
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:52,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean usually the anime companies in Japan seem to have this deathly fear that someone in America will Resell the American cheap DVDs back to Japan's.

120
00:07:52,831 --> 00:08:02,600
Speaker 1: they never let anything get licensed and released over here Until long after they've sold their $70 DVD even though if Japanese people really wanted to they could just bit torn the shows.

121
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like or wait or wait.

122
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:16,680
Speaker 0: Anyway, they have licensed the Death Note anime because they already putting out the Death Note manga which they're almost done putting out and But they haven't licensed it in the usual fashion.

123
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:34,609
Speaker 0: They have licensed the download to own and download to rent rights Which means pretty much that you're going to be able to download the Death Note anime I assume with a dub of some sort in the United States Legally with some DRM's.

124
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,600
Speaker 1: if only it weren't the DRM's I'd be all about that.

125
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,557
Speaker 0: You know, we always say hey, how come you don't bring this stuff over faster bla bla bla bla bla.

126
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:47,740
Speaker 0: and Viz is like Hey, we're bringing it over when you want like, you know, and you seem to like digital.

127
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,440
Speaker 0: So here we're bringing it to you digitally.

128
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,173
Speaker 0: But the DRM is the one mistake.

129
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:59,139
Speaker 0: people have a hard enough time Bit torrenting and getting their codecs to work now, you're gonna want him to put some DRM shit in there.

130
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,211
Speaker 0: It's just not gonna happen.

131
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:13,269
Speaker 0: You know, I mean while They might have an advantage in that this license is gonna make the fan subbing stop at least the you know Open easy to get at fan subbing stop.

132
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,020
Speaker 0: So it might be easier to get the episodes from Viz.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,720
Speaker 0: it's The DRM is gonna stop a lot of people and their underground fan subbers are still gonna end up winning.

134
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:37,028
Speaker 1: see now if they were somehow doing it with iTunes or in some sort of DRM that people are already accustomed to or Some sort of DRM that was widely used or a service maybe that offered a lot more than just this They'd probably do a lot better.

135
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:46,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably but if it's just that like I could see myself installing some horrible DRM thing if there was enough good stuff On it and the price was right.

136
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:47,544
Speaker 0: I wouldn't.

137
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,328
Speaker 0: but okay.

138
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:57,135
Speaker 1: Well, like say there was a service where for ten cents you could get any anime that's ever been released in the u.s Keep forever for you.

139
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,905
Speaker 1: It's just DRM too little so you can't give it to other people.

140
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,390
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's kind of weird.

141
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,830
Speaker 0: It's like if it's on my computer, right?

142
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,289
Speaker 0: It's like I don't want to install DRM software on my computer because that feels like.

143
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:14,430
Speaker 0: you know I have my computer can do this thing and you've taken you know, you're restricted my computer.

144
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,059
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like iTunes right which you have.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,450
Speaker 0: no iTunes only screws you if you buy stuff from iTunes.

146
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:23,823
Speaker 0: It doesn't screw you if you just use it to handle regular old mp3s.

147
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:24,144
Speaker 0: true.

148
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,148
Speaker 1: You haven't bought anything.

149
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:25,590
Speaker 0: That's right.

150
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:39,455
Speaker 0: But if they sold like, you know a set-top box or some sort of pay-per-view on your cable box or something like that That would totally fly because they're not really restricting anything You can't already do you know?

151
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:46,293
Speaker 0: if they had like just push buttons on my cable remote and pay a dollar to watch Death Note That would be pretty hot I don't know.

152
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:58,442
Speaker 1: regardless of whether or not we'll use the service or anyone we know will use the service I think this is definitely a step in the right direction and I I hope it's at least at least they've Recognized that they got to do something and they're making a move.

153
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,350
Speaker 0: They just haven't made the final move.

154
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it just comes down to somehow getting the licenses early on.

155
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:16,550
Speaker 1: Like maybe I'd say wait a little bit to make sure that the show is popular in the US by keeping an eye on the fan Subs license the shit out of that stuff right away and have it come out right away.

156
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:22,187
Speaker 1: And if the Japanese companies won't let you do whatever they just did to let the jet to get away with this.

157
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:29,370
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, honestly, I'll bet the reason they're getting away with this is that the system will probably not allow people in Japan.

158
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:35,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably either won't allow people in Japan or people in Japan will be.

159
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,737
Speaker 0: you know, Drm didn't have to pay money.

160
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:43,790
Speaker 1: So it's not like they're you know, re importing anything Yeah, but it'll still charge so much less than a DVD.

161
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:50,150
Speaker 0: I mean if it costs plus even though it'll still be behind what's on TV in Japan right now.

162
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,138
Speaker 0: You know, it's not gonna.

163
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,309
Speaker 0: it's not like they're getting a DVD.

164
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,950
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't compete with the DVD to purchase in Japan.

165
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:04,280
Speaker 0: it competes with the TV to watch in Japan and it can't beat that because in Japan the TV's got episode 10 and over here.

166
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,121
Speaker 0: We've got episode 1. so it you know It's not stopping anyone from buying DVDs or watching TV in Japan.

167
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,329
Speaker 0: Even if Japanese people can access it.

168
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:24,129
Speaker 1: Oh one last news before I get away from this whole news thing because I just noticed this and I actually read it and I realized That is something a lot of you'll probably care about even though it's barely related to anime.

169
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:28,201
Speaker 1: Avatar apparently is going to have a number of live-action movies.

170
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,106
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the.

171
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:31,530
Speaker 0: is it the same avatar?

172
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,279
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz I saw that very specifically.

173
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,270
Speaker 1: This is avatar the Nicktoons cartoon.

174
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,930
Speaker 1: This is not related to the other avatar movie.

175
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:46,590
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I saw some news today about an avatar movie, but that's where the confusion is.

176
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,890
Speaker 1: There's a movie called avatar coming out from James Cameron.

177
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:58,050
Speaker 1: independently of that Some guy got the rights to make a bunch of live-action avatar movies based on avatar the last airbender.

178
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,685
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna do a show on avatar once.

179
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:05,899
Speaker 1: I've seen more of it But suffice to say I think that show is the top dog.

180
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,710
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it and I remain skeptical.

181
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,589
Speaker 0: things of the day.

182
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:24,055
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is an animation, but it is not a Japanese Animation.

183
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:24,822
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

184
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:25,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

185
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,670
Speaker 0: I'm following your trend from earlier in the week going with some Warner Brothers animations.

186
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,237
Speaker 1: Warner Brothers a yep.

187
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:35,882
Speaker 1: It's either one of two things.

188
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,173
Speaker 1: My guess is that it's the Famous.

189
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:40,799
Speaker 1: I know he has done it.

190
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,628
Speaker 0: I don't know how he has done it, but I know he has done it.

191
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,573
Speaker 0: Nope It's not what it is.

192
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,243
Speaker 0: It's oh, he's hiding in the stove.

193
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,990
Speaker 0: Hey, he's not he's not in his stove.

194
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:54,422
Speaker 0: I did it backwards.

195
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,170
Speaker 1: Good job.

196
00:13:55,491 --> 00:14:02,242
Speaker 1: Anyway, one of your most famous jokes ever one of the best bits and animation ever created as far as you're concerned And you messed it up.

197
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:02,789
Speaker 0: That's right.

198
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:15,070
Speaker 0: This is perhaps my favorite Looney Tune there is and this kind of shit isn't on TV anymore because well It shows a guy putting someone else in an oven turn it on the gas and throw it a match in there.

199
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:16,214
Speaker 1: It's one of the.

200
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,250
Speaker 1: I really I remember this as a kid and I remember it was not long ago.

201
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,991
Speaker 1: We were before we realized it was on the internet and we could just watch it any time We wanted.

202
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:29,630
Speaker 1: we were talking about all these moments and quotes from old cartoons that we remember so dearly.

203
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,830
Speaker 0: When I was a kid Looney Tunes was on all the time.

204
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:39,436
Speaker 0: You could always find it on some channel or another and this one no matter how many times they came on It was always funny just to hear him say.

205
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,843
Speaker 0: Oh, he's hiding in the stove.

206
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:49,234
Speaker 0: Hey, and also it has the famous line Get it dead net And It's just.

207
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:53,190
Speaker 0: it's such a great cartoon and it's only seven minutes long and it's on YouTube.

208
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,916
Speaker 0: I don't know how long it'll stay on YouTube.

209
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,084
Speaker 0: Someone might find it and get rid of it.

210
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:03,050
Speaker 0: But whatever you'll be able to find it Again, yeah, it'll come back up and it's actually a pretty high quality YouTube.

211
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:08,731
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary when I look at it because this is made in 1954 or 55 54.

212
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:20,164
Speaker 0: I was like, wow, it's old, you know I saw this on TV and like the 80s and 90s and I was a kid a hundred times and It was funny every single time just like the first time and it still is.

213
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:21,590
Speaker 0: I can still watch it a hundred times.

214
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:22,527
Speaker 0: It's that great.

215
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:37,030
Speaker 1: so in the interest of not wasting any minutes before we get to the meat of tonight's episode initial My thing of the day is real simple.

216
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:41,989
Speaker 1: This has been around the internet for a while But it was recently dug up and it's something everyone should read it.

217
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,581
Speaker 1: I had never actually read it you'd think someone like me would have.

218
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:49,108
Speaker 1: it is a very detailed graphical description of how ice rinks actually work.

219
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,793
Speaker 1: and And Zambonis.

220
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:54,970
Speaker 1: and before you think ruin Zambonis before you think rim that's kind of lame.

221
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,377
Speaker 1: You don't know how an ice rink works.

222
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,947
Speaker 1: There's no way you know how it works unless you're from Canada.

223
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:01,528
Speaker 0: You're wrong.

224
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,339
Speaker 1: You don't know.

225
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,950
Speaker 1: it doesn't work the way you think it does.

226
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, how do they freeze all that ice and make it all flat and shiny and skate on it without killing people?

227
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how do they make those lines appear?

228
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,410
Speaker 1: They don't paint the stuff under the ice.

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,521
Speaker 0: No, they paint it on the floor under the ice.

230
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:18,144
Speaker 1: No, they don't.

231
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:19,290
Speaker 1: you didn't even read it.

232
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,735
Speaker 0: Did you that they have to?

233
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:23,203
Speaker 1: no no, no, you know what they do what.

234
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:27,277
Speaker 1: they layer a thin layer of ice Mm-hmm, then another thin layer of ice.

235
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,596
Speaker 1: then they paint that ice white Uh-huh, then there's another layer ice.

236
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:38,530
Speaker 1: then they paint the lines on that layer of ice and then they cover that with a whole bunch More eyes, huh?

237
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,951
Speaker 1: The actual surface is kind of nappy.

238
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:41,751
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

239
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:42,652
Speaker 1: Well, that's a word.

240
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,012
Speaker 1: I haven't used since middle school.

241
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:44,892
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

242
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:26,347
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that's some good stuff right there.

243
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:37,578
Speaker 1: see initial D didn't just get me interested in cars It didn't just give me a very high quality B anime to enjoy and yell and scream about.

244
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,212
Speaker 1: it Didn't open me up to the world of racing manga.

245
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:48,315
Speaker 1: it in addition to all of that It gave me eurobeat and super eurobeat music that to this day.

246
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,957
Speaker 1: I can always dance to such energy.

247
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,506
Speaker 0: See initial D. Let's see.

248
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,615
Speaker 0: We first saw it at anime club and they showed four episodes.

249
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:58,257
Speaker 1: Yeah bear in mind.

250
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:01,147
Speaker 1: We weren't even Running the anime club.

251
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,920
Speaker 1: We were just some freshmen sitting in the front row heckling.

252
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,801
Speaker 0: Yep, and you know, I wasn't really paying much attention to it because we were all heckling and such so I didn't really get into It.

253
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,146
Speaker 0: I was just like got a race.

254
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:12,889
Speaker 0: Whoo.

255
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,254
Speaker 0: We don't know if he wins or not.

256
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:15,920
Speaker 0: Ooh, whatever the show was crap.

257
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,562
Speaker 1: Let's help that.

258
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,306
Speaker 1: It was just generally kind of a boring.

259
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:22,377
Speaker 1: Alright, so car racing with bad PlayStation 1 animation.

260
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:22,898
Speaker 1: What's this?

261
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:28,000
Speaker 0: Yeah Not exactly the most best first impression made by an anime.

262
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:36,674
Speaker 1: Yeah And the fourth episode because they only show four episodes of something at club Aided on the cliffhanger of well, does he win the race or not?

263
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,420
Speaker 1: And we all thought I don't care.

264
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really didn't give a shit.

265
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,358
Speaker 0: I could have lived the rest of my life not knowing whether he won that race or not.

266
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:47,078
Speaker 1: now I remember very clearly we were talking about how boring that anime was.

267
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,008
Speaker 1: now much We disliked it now stupid it was.

268
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:53,138
Speaker 0: and all that on the way back to our dorms and you know What most people who watch this show?

269
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,879
Speaker 0: They stick with that opinion for the rest of their lives and you can't really blame them.

270
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:03,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though we what I think it was me you asked So do you think he really wins or not?

271
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
Speaker 1: And we talked about it a little bit before we gave up and went to play battle tech or something.

272
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:12,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was good times But battle tech is definitely better than it'll be Now.

273
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:27,420
Speaker 1: there is often the fallacy that just because the first impression of something is bad The rest of it must be bad Which has screwed a lot of people out of a lot of awesome things like Probably the best hockey game I ever saw where two of the people with us left before the crazy end.

274
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:36,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people, you know They they don't like something or they do like something prior to experiencing it and they've already decided before they've seen it.

275
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,144
Speaker 0: You know, they don't like it.

276
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:37,365
Speaker 0: They go.

277
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,592
Speaker 0: What's this an anime about?

278
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,040
Speaker 0: cars screw that?

279
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,360
Speaker 0: And then even if you show it to them, they already don't want to like it.

280
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,230
Speaker 0: So they're never gonna like it and that's fine for them.

281
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:57,892
Speaker 1: now for some godforsaken reason and to this day I don't know why cuz we know it's not like we had free time other than you know, the infinite free time We were already wasting playing battle tech and Dungeons & Dragons and board games.

282
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:58,334
Speaker 1: Yep.

283
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,600
Speaker 1: We went to an initial D marathon.

284
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:06,996
Speaker 1: I think we planned to show up Gather everyone we knew who was there skip out early and play a game or something.

285
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:13,980
Speaker 0: That might have been the plan I don't remember but I do remember sitting there and watching all 26 episodes of the first season of initial D.

286
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,601
Speaker 1: I remember.

287
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:25,212
Speaker 1: I remember we decided we were all gonna go watch the fifth episode find out if he won or not and then leave Mm-hmm, but then it was kind of good.

288
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,120
Speaker 1: So we wanted to see if he's gonna win the next one.

289
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,046
Speaker 0: I think what happened?

290
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:39,345
Speaker 0: I think part of it was sort of a peer pressure thing Like when we saw it at Anime Club, there were a lot of people there So everyone most of the people there had the vibe of and so we also had the vibe of it when we went to see the marathon.

291
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,292
Speaker 0: there were very few people there and it was.

292
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:52,675
Speaker 0: we were actually able to like pay attention to the Eurobeat music and you know feel the energy of the show and have it absorb into our bodies and Then it sort of melted us into the seats and we couldn't get away see.

293
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:56,532
Speaker 1: several of our friends said All right He won the race great and then they left.

294
00:20:56,572 --> 00:21:00,167
Speaker 1: and they're like rim and Scott Because no one called a scrim back then.

295
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:03,720
Speaker 1: obviously no one calls a scrim now except are you listeners?

296
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,887
Speaker 0: Can't be bothered to type anyway.

297
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, his real name is Scott prime.

298
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,326
Speaker 1: No anyway So they're like rim and Scott.

299
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,554
Speaker 1: Why aren't you leaving this terrible terrible show?

300
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,180
Speaker 1: and we looked at them and said shut up.

301
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,359
Speaker 1: I want to find out if he wins the gum tape deathmatch.

302
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:23,370
Speaker 0: That's right fucking gum tape deathmatch for the win man.

303
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,300
Speaker 1: This show went from 0 to 60 in about seven episodes.

304
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,700
Speaker 0: I mean No one can say that the animation in this show is good.

305
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,189
Speaker 0: In fact, it's ass in the first season.

306
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,119
Speaker 0: The animation is as the characters are fugly.

307
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:50,254
Speaker 1: I mean, how could no Buru Furu say who has done stuff for x-driver and You're under arrest and all these other great anime?

308
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:53,931
Speaker 1: at least character design wise Make these characters.

309
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:55,040
Speaker 1: I don't know.

310
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,000
Speaker 1: Well, the answer is because they look like that in the manga and he had no control.

311
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,271
Speaker 0: Yes, the manga of initially is by Shuichi Shigen.

312
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,840
Speaker 0: Oh and it is almost identical to all the anime.

313
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:14,716
Speaker 0: There is a slight difference in the first season of the anime in the chronological order of events Between the first season of anime and the manga and they're roughly equivalent.

314
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:15,680
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

315
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,969
Speaker 1: Yeah the only if you're gonna read the manga.

316
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,116
Speaker 1: all I'm gonna tell you is that what you must do is Get some eurobeat and play it in the background while you read.

317
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,060
Speaker 0: I do that all the time.

318
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:34,520
Speaker 1: If you don't do that, you're really gonna miss out on pretty much everything that makes initial Yeah, also like the third or fourth race in the manga is like the climax.

319
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:40,180
Speaker 0: They save that race to the end of the first season and they took some races after it and moved it before.

320
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,551
Speaker 0: So, you know you got to pick one or the other.

321
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:53,099
Speaker 0: but after the first season of the anime Starting with the second season of the anime they pretend as if everything that happened was just like the manga and they forget that The first season changed the order of events.

322
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:58,920
Speaker 1: So we're not gonna talk about the manga and I highly recommend you watch the anime first or just watch the anime.

323
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're almost identical.

324
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,860
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter, you know.

325
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:06,555
Speaker 0: Basically, all you really want to watch is the first season of the anime and possibly the movie.

326
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:18,899
Speaker 1: possibly the movie is pretty good Yeah, but we're gonna talk mostly about the first season which begins great gets great ends Amazingly and it ends on a note where you don't need any more.

327
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,611
Speaker 1: It didn't need to pull the one piece and keep going.

328
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,138
Speaker 1: don't watch anything past that.

329
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:26,429
Speaker 0: no I mean you could if you're really really like it.

330
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:29,558
Speaker 0: keep watching because it's not as good after that.

331
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:33,920
Speaker 0: after that It's mostly races and the other half of the show kind of fades away.

332
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:35,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz everyone.

333
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,460
Speaker 1: here's the basic problem with people that they saw this show.

334
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,560
Speaker 1: They thought it was about stupid car racing and made-up drift racing and they left.

335
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,506
Speaker 1: But that's only half the show.

336
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:53,251
Speaker 1: the other half of the show is funny high school romance kids Dealing at each other running around causing trouble

337
00:23:53,633 --> 00:24:00,795
Speaker 0: and there's definitely a story of you know Figuring out what you want to do when you grow up when you you know I mean and that how many kids in this country does that identify with?

338
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:01,680
Speaker 0: where they're all like?

339
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,348
Speaker 0: I don't know what I want to do.

340
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:10,459
Speaker 0: I'll go to college and be undecided and blue You know, that's what initial D is about is figuring out what the hell you want to do and going for it.

341
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:18,320
Speaker 1: I mean Starting to care about something for such a seemingly vapid and just silly show about drift racers in the mountains of Japan.

342
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:32,180
Speaker 1: this ship the show actually has quite a few poignant moments and really actually and I'm not kidding has a Pretty good message that is executed very well and just a little bit moving.

343
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,412
Speaker 0: Yeah after that though after the first season.

344
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,296
Speaker 0: It's just drift racing.

345
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:35,638
Speaker 0: Yeah

346
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:50,779
Speaker 1: so if you like the racing part and you don't care about the fact that it katani likes this girl and Itsuki's a loser, but he's funny and then he gets into a car accident If you just want to watch Takumi race while music plays the rest of initial D is all for you

347
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,999
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you're a normal person the first season is where the action is.

348
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:03,527
Speaker 1: But like there's a scene near the like middling end like kind of on the rising tide of the show before the climax and everything We're talking me.

349
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:07,921
Speaker 1: the main character goes out and washes his car Scene.

350
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:11,993
Speaker 1: that is a that is probably I'd say in the top 50 scenes of anime ever.

351
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,477
Speaker 0: Oh could be very well.

352
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:16,915
Speaker 1: not top 10 No way, but it's animated so poorly.

353
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:30,899
Speaker 1: then yeah But that's the power of the show that as dumb as it might seem the concept and as silly and joke ish and unrealistic as it might be This scene where he washes his car is actually really moving.

354
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:38,219
Speaker 0: But I mean if you haven't seen you know the show and you you're not really paying attention to it Then that scene it just means nothing.

355
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,688
Speaker 0: But once you know what has come before.

356
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:53,792
Speaker 0: you know, you see this guy who didn't care about shit, you know He was racing because his dad told him well He guess he cares about girls and he was racing so he could get you know Free gas from his dad who would you know give basically pay him to race.

357
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:59,620
Speaker 0: and then you know now here He is washing the car that no one told his dad didn't tell him to wash it.

358
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,476
Speaker 1: He just washed up his own volition and then he stands there looking at it and he kind of has this look of.

359
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,906
Speaker 0: I found my Way, yeah, it's good stuff.

360
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,820
Speaker 1: Of course now I mentioned a bit, you know funny high school style humor.

361
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:15,720
Speaker 1: It's not like all that other anime high school humor.

362
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,580
Speaker 0: No, it's not like this isn't like a full metal panic thing where there's robots and then wacky anime high school.

363
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 1: It's realistic high school at least insofar as saved by the Bell was a realistic representation of high school.

364
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:33,500
Speaker 0: Well, it's not so much saved by the Bell basically, it doesn't really concentrate on the school that much.

365
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,974
Speaker 0: It's just characters who are high school age.

366
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:45,870
Speaker 1: All right, let me put it this way It would be very very very realistic if it weren't for the fact that these racing gangs exist Yeah, and the fact that the way they talk to each other,

367
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,680
Speaker 0: you know, it's actually more kind of like a happy days kind of thing.

368
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,050
Speaker 1: Actually, yeah, I never really thought of it that way.

369
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,316
Speaker 0: I just thought of that just now.

370
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:53,980
Speaker 1: it kind of is.

371
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,750
Speaker 1: I mean most of the scenes will show like a bunch of these guys hanging out at a diner along the mountain Yeah, or hanging out at the gas station where they all work.

372
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,580
Speaker 0: Yep, and they're not really hanging out in the school so much.

373
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:08,253
Speaker 1: So what is the plot of initial do you might ask there?

374
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:09,639
Speaker 0: Okay ready get this.

375
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:15,559
Speaker 0: there's a guy and He is the economy Fujiwara and his dad.

376
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:20,519
Speaker 0: Him and his dad live alone and there his dad runs a tofu shop and he goes to school.

377
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:26,420
Speaker 0: The dad sells tofu not only out of his shop, but he delivers tofu to many places.

378
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,899
Speaker 0: One of those places is Akina hotel.

379
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,392
Speaker 0: Well, Akina is where they live and there is a mountain Mount Akina.

380
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:43,079
Speaker 0: at the top of this mountain is a Hotel for tourism to the mountain and the mountain has like a nice lake that you can go to if you go up the mountain And it's a nice touristy place.

381
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:55,073
Speaker 0: Yeah but the the road going up to the mountain is kind of old and windy because it's a very steep very windy road that you have to go very slow and is very dangerous and There's lots of drift racing that goes on up there.

382
00:27:55,657 --> 00:28:01,574
Speaker 0: Anyway This dad, you know Fujiwara dad Boonter crazy Boonter.

383
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,480
Speaker 1: Boonter is the best character in the show hands.

384
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,972
Speaker 0: I was just gonna say that Boonter was the best character in the show.

385
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,540
Speaker 1: Goddamn is Boonter great?

386
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:13,797
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to deliver the tofu to the top of the mountain at the crack of dawn because well It's a pain in the ass.

387
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:15,666
Speaker 0: So he makes his son do it.

388
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:22,860
Speaker 0: when the sign his son was in middle school and not allowed to drive He made him do it because well, you know, it's on a back road in the middle of the night.

389
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,192
Speaker 1: It's like four or five in the morning.

390
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:30,013
Speaker 1: the Sun isn't even up yet and From what people have told me at least in places like that in Japan.

391
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,460
Speaker 1: There's no one driving at night.

392
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,152
Speaker 1: You're not gonna run into anyone.

393
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,220
Speaker 0: There's no speed track.

394
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:50,440
Speaker 0: I mean imagine if you lived in a tofu shop all alone and like the boonies and You had a you know a kid in seventh grade and he had a little tiny car and he could drive it Just not legally and you all you needed him to drive was up the mountain at night, you know at 4 in the morning.

395
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,392
Speaker 0: I think he could I think he could manage.

396
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:57,099
Speaker 1: so the kid does it Constantly every morning is to get up and drive this tofu up before he does.

397
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,486
Speaker 0: now The thing is tofu sits in water.

398
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:01,091
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, no, we can't get to that yet.

399
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,480
Speaker 1: Okay, see Takumi doesn't like doing this.

400
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,888
Speaker 0: Oh, he doesn't like doing it.

401
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,839
Speaker 0: He wants to go to bed just like you and me.

402
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:13,780
Speaker 1: So he starts driving as fast as he can and every day he gets a little bit faster.

403
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:14,186
Speaker 1: He just got.

404
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,019
Speaker 1: I mean he can't floor it.

405
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,380
Speaker 1: Obviously he'd fall off the mountain and die.

406
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,869
Speaker 1: But he drives the car as fast as he possibly can to get this done with and go back to bed on this incredibly dangerous mountain road.

407
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,965
Speaker 1: and one day he goes a little too fast around the corners and Destroys the tofu.

408
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,734
Speaker 1: you see now I can get to what Scott was talking.

409
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:31,538
Speaker 0: So his dad beat him.

410
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,045
Speaker 1: Yes, dad beat.

411
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:38,909
Speaker 1: I mean it's not like the stupid live-action initial D movie Which you should ignore and avoid like the plague.

412
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,434
Speaker 0: Yes, the live-action.

413
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:41,698
Speaker 0: It's only movie is bad.

414
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:48,220
Speaker 1: Very bad Yeah, I mean when bunta beats his kid in the live-action Chinese initial D he beats him half to death.

415
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:52,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, now he just kind of whacks him on the head with the newspaper like, you know, funny anime style.

416
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:57,856
Speaker 0: Anyway, so when he gets home dad's like are you messed up the tofu?

417
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,000
Speaker 0: cuz tofu sits in water?

418
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,540
Speaker 0: And if you disturb it too much then you can ruin it so you can't drive too recklessly.

419
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:13,880
Speaker 0: So he puts a cup of water in the car and he says as long as the water stays in that cup when you drive Then the tofu won't be messed up because the tofu is also in water.

420
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:23,800
Speaker 0: So Takumi's all pissed now because he has to drive slow again But he eventually learns to drive in a way that he can go fast without disturbing the water.

421
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,659
Speaker 1: Now fast forward several years and this is where the anime begins.

422
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:55,659
Speaker 1: Street racing gangs Roam the earth not really just.

423
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,410
Speaker 1: there's mountains all over Japan and no one drives on him at night.

424
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:05,090
Speaker 1: So punk kids with rice cars hang out and drift race around and have fun on the mountains.

425
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:08,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, they form little gang and they take it in the anime.

426
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:15,743
Speaker 0: The characters take it more seriously than people do in real life, but that's necessary Yeah, or else there's no point.

427
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:16,426
Speaker 1: some of them don't.

428
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:20,180
Speaker 1: the speed stars Until trouble happens, they don't take it that sir.

429
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:20,903
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

430
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:22,830
Speaker 1: but there's a bunch of little teams.

431
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:31,096
Speaker 1: there's the Akina speed stars and there's the night kid yogi night kids and the Akagi red sun who will get to.

432
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:40,135
Speaker 1: yeah now the red sons are a team that is run by two brothers Takahashi Ryosuke and case.

433
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:40,516
Speaker 1: okay.

434
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:47,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're the Takahashi brothers and their dad is a doctor a rich doctor So they have lots of money to buy fancy cars now.

435
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,344
Speaker 1: These guys are also super bishonen and they have super fast cars.

436
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:59,228
Speaker 1: one of them drives an rx-7 FC And one of them drives one of the best cars ever made the rx-7 FD.

437
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:03,830
Speaker 0: There are awesome cars because they have Wankel engines not piston engines.

438
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:08,111
Speaker 0: And if you don't know what that is, look it up because it's freaking on or watch the show and you'll learn a little bit About it.

439
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:12,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, the closest thing you can get to it nowadays is a used rx-7 or an rx-8.

440
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:13,590
Speaker 1: now think of this.

441
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,616
Speaker 1: Here's a scale of how good this car is.

442
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:20,510
Speaker 1: a used beat-up rx-7 goes for more than most brand-new cars today.

443
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,311
Speaker 1: Yeah Like are and actually there was a guy at my work who had an rx-7 FD and he took me for a few spins in It.

444
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,388
Speaker 0: and good fucking God It's quite an awesome car.

445
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,630
Speaker 1: You would not believe how fast that guy could take it around corners.

446
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:43,430
Speaker 1: Anyway anyway, so they're rich and the ryosuke the smart one.

447
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,190
Speaker 1: You see Rose K is the smart bishonen one and case K is the wild and reckless emotional bishonen one.

448
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:53,728
Speaker 1: But they're both really smart and they're both coincidentally street racers.

449
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,721
Speaker 1: So he decides before he goes to doctor school.

450
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,310
Speaker 1: at the end, you know, he's gonna leave he's gonna go to doctor school.

451
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:05,300
Speaker 1: he wants to take his little team and Conquer every mountain in.

452
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:06,910
Speaker 1: where are they?

453
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,930
Speaker 0: Genma gun gun gun my gun my prefecture.

454
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:18,193
Speaker 1: He wants to beat every street racing team on every mountain in the prefecture before he goes to medical school to prove that he is A badass.

455
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:21,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he's already sort of famous for being a badass street racer.

456
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,023
Speaker 0: So, you know and every mountain of course has a street racing team.

457
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:26,770
Speaker 0: a mountain without a street racing team is unthinkable.

458
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:34,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so all he has to do is to go to every mountain see who's there Practice on that course a little bit and then beat them with his awesome fast car.

459
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,989
Speaker 1: So the first mountain they pick they because it's in the middle of stick nowhere and they know that no one there can drive.

460
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:48,670
Speaker 1: worth of Shit is Mount Akina and they have their plan, you know We're gonna start here and then we're gonna conquer the whole blah blah blah blah.

461
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,430
Speaker 1: And this is where the cunning plan goes horribly awry and where the anime begins.

462
00:33:54,053 --> 00:34:01,350
Speaker 0: When one of them is practicing, you know learning the course because they you know The Akina speed stars are a bunch of schmucks and they can't really race at all.

463
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they're just wannabes.

464
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,721
Speaker 1: their leader Ikitani.

465
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:08,998
Speaker 0: he gets and he's a good character and I like him But he can't drive for shit.

466
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,389
Speaker 0: He's also a loose passed out in the third corner.

467
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,770
Speaker 0: Anyway They're practicing on this course.

468
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,768
Speaker 0: So one night case a case driving down the mountain and he sees some headlights in his rearview mirror.

469
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,350
Speaker 0: now He's racing down this mountain.

470
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:32,003
Speaker 0: So if he sees headlights in his rearview mirror that can only mean Someone is going as fast or faster than he is going.

471
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:35,094
Speaker 1: so he speeds up, you know, whatever I'll leave this guy in my does.

472
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,248
Speaker 1: no one's better than me except my brother and that's debatable.

473
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:45,409
Speaker 0: and you know The only people around are people on his team and the Akina speed stars are a bunch of schmucks No one else would be racing down this hill.

474
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,022
Speaker 0: So, you know, he knows it's not his brother because he can tell by the headlights.

475
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:54,510
Speaker 1: so he's like, uh, well So he keeps going and going and this car keeps pace with him.

476
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,060
Speaker 1: And finally he sees what kind of car it is.

477
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,670
Speaker 1: He's debating what kind of car it is Like.

478
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,995
Speaker 0: he's like oh is it this kind?

479
00:34:59,035 --> 00:34:59,657
Speaker 0: is it that kind?

480
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,721
Speaker 0: all these fast cars?

481
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:03,753
Speaker 1: and then he sees it and it's a Hachi Roku.

482
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:09,035
Speaker 0: now Hachi Roku in Japan Japanese means eight six It's a toy.

483
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:12,029
Speaker 0: basically this car, you know, it what do they call it the?

484
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:13,273
Speaker 0: Train.

485
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:21,507
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, it's a. it's a Toyota true a no 86 which really means that it's a Toyota Corolla.

486
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:29,450
Speaker 0: effectively It's a Toyota Corolla from 1985 with a hatchback, but it's got this like 86 ae engine or whatever.

487
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:31,175
Speaker 1: No, the ae 86 chassis.

488
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:32,620
Speaker 0: That's right as opposed.

489
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:32,961
Speaker 1: Yeah.

490
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's you can also get the knot.

491
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,842
Speaker 0: It's the sportiest Toyota Corolla available in 1985.

492
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:42,201
Speaker 0: It's actually a very famous Racing car in Japan.

493
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:48,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in fact It's still used today for a lot of nostalgic value and it's still a pretty good car if you modify it properly.

494
00:35:48,791 --> 00:36:00,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean basically the reason they chose this car is because there's a guy called the drift King Who's like a famous drift racing guy in Japan a real guy and he actually comes up in the show once or twice.

495
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:05,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and This guy famously drove the 86 is car of choice for his drift racing.

496
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:16,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look search around for drift videos from Japan and look for actual ones on courses Not like punk kids burning rubber in a parking lot and you'll see what this is all about.

497
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:22,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's half Racing and half showing off and another half.

498
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:23,729
Speaker 1: I guess there's three halves rice.

499
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think it's a lot less rice than you see on the streets though.

500
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:31,604
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, Japan is very different than America.

501
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:32,448
Speaker 0: It is.

502
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:36,979
Speaker 1: it is so He thinks what this crap old car?

503
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,290
Speaker 1: and he puts the pedal to the metal and they the guys keeping pace with him.

504
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,718
Speaker 1: He's thinking what the hell's up with this.

505
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:52,734
Speaker 1: and then in the critical moment there's he knows there's a sharp corner coming up because it could bends around and then it bends back around and he slows the hell down because He doesn't want to die.

506
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,403
Speaker 1: You can't go around that corner fast.

507
00:36:54,745 --> 00:37:01,485
Speaker 1: It's Carl to spin out I'll crash and this hot chiroku just goes on full bore and he's thinking.

508
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,430
Speaker 1: Oh, no, this guy was an amateur.

509
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:04,837
Speaker 1: He totally fucked up.

510
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:04,958
Speaker 1: Now.

511
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,626
Speaker 1: He's gonna die and I'm gonna have to watch it.

512
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:26,210
Speaker 1: Oh, no, and then Now the anime slows down into slow motion at this point to show this car Drift a little bit to the one side lose traction and some of the tires and then rebound around the corner and disappear into the distance.

513
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,421
Speaker 1: Kzk spins the hell out cuz he doesn't know what he just saw.

514
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:37,545
Speaker 0: He says the words on side And then he says was that a fucking ghost?

515
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:38,772
Speaker 0: Oh my god What the fuck.

516
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,102
Speaker 1: and he just sits there doesn't know what the hell has.

517
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:46,615
Speaker 0: he totally just got pulled by a Crap old car.

518
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:54,821
Speaker 0: This is as if you were racing down a street in a Corvette and of Frickin you go past you.

519
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:56,350
Speaker 0: that's what this is like.

520
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,154
Speaker 0: That's why it's awesome.

521
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,768
Speaker 1: Now if you haven't guessed Takumi's driving this car.

522
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:08,150
Speaker 0: Yes It's sort of like the show keeps you in suspense like oh who's driving that car?

523
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,140
Speaker 0: They don't let you know, but you're pretty sure.

524
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,250
Speaker 0: oh, it's like in Trigun is he washed the stampede?

525
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,135
Speaker 0: They don't let you know.

526
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:27,650
Speaker 0: They try to keep it a secret from you for like four or five episodes, but you freaking know You know, it's actually pretty fun though, because if you act if I didn't just spoil it for you, which isn't the big spoiler

527
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,393
Speaker 1: Oh god, no

528
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:30,502
Speaker 0: now there are much bigger things to spoil.

529
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:35,253
Speaker 0: an initial D like Shingo like Shingo, but You're you could.

530
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,130
Speaker 0: actually if you've never seen the show before you could actually be in quite a bit of suspense.

531
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:40,858
Speaker 0: Like is he driving the car?

532
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:42,185
Speaker 0: How is he so good?

533
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:45,330
Speaker 0: They don't even tell you all the stuff We've told you until like episode 3.

534
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,869
Speaker 1: Yep And there's a lot of suspense among the characters as to who's driving this car.

535
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:56,049
Speaker 1: Cuz the Akina speed stars suck and they know they're gonna lose and they take this really seriously.

536
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,179
Speaker 1: and one day They're like, they don't know that Takumi can drive.

537
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,990
Speaker 1: them even know that his dad really has a car.

538
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:07,891
Speaker 0: They know talk to me like he's their friend who works at the gas station But they think he doesn't know shit about cars because he doesn't really know shit about cars like.

539
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:15,297
Speaker 1: there's a really funny scene where they're watching some videos of this drift king racing and they're talking about Inertial drift and how to do it.

540
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:18,668
Speaker 1: then Takumi's like but they're in Takumi's like, what do you guys?

541
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:19,270
Speaker 1: this is dumb?

542
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,276
Speaker 1: What you're talking about.

543
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,867
Speaker 1: and they're like, you don't know anything about this.

544
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:27,549
Speaker 1: talking me says Yeah, you just kind of turn the wheel like this and then like this and tap the brake and they look at him Like he's an idiot.

545
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,730
Speaker 1: But the gas station owner who knows all about racing because he's friends with crazy boota.

546
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,242
Speaker 1: We won't reveal much about boota, but you'll figure things out.

547
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he knows about drift racing.

548
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,481
Speaker 1: They both know about drift racing and he's thinking to himself.

549
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:44,070
Speaker 1: That was the answer of a professional racer.

550
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:49,740
Speaker 1: So we shouldn't really we've.

551
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,275
Speaker 1: I think we've explained enough about the show I think we have.

552
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:56,236
Speaker 0: if you if you're not already in suspense You're not gonna be so.

553
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:57,000
Speaker 0: more importantly.

554
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,310
Speaker 1: What are the important bits about this show?

555
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,990
Speaker 0: I mean the music is the number one most important part of this show.

556
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:38,242
Speaker 1: Hands-down, I mean every race has this music.

557
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:39,606
Speaker 1: without this you are.

558
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:40,630
Speaker 0: without this music.

559
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,416
Speaker 0: The show is basically completely worthless.

560
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:43,520
Speaker 0: We did it once even watch it.

561
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:47,754
Speaker 1: I watched an of race on mute And it was just boring.

562
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:51,025
Speaker 1: PlayStation 1 like watching someone play Gran Turismo.

563
00:40:51,045 --> 00:41:00,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, the graphics during the races are PlayStation 1 cars driving down like around some turns but with that music playing especially by the second or third race.

564
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:04,430
Speaker 1: You totally forget that and as far as you're concerned, this is a hundred percent real.

565
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:25,190
Speaker 0: That mute the music the Eurobeat music sort of like grabs you and fills you with like this certain kind of energy and you know Change the songs throughout the race depending and they always pick just the right one and you can totally you know Feel like the pressure and suspense of the race in you and as it goes down.

566
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,910
Speaker 0: So you don't really care about what's happening or who's gonna win?

567
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:37,946
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like, you know There's a race of cars and you're feel you're on this sort of downhill slope That's going around all these turns inside of you until the race is over.

568
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:43,018
Speaker 1: now There's some amazing Scenes that you wouldn't expect.

569
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:44,786
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the car washing scene, whatever.

570
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:51,451
Speaker 1: but even in the races I mean, I can't spoil any of this but I think Scott remembers the scene where there happened to be three cars going down the Mountain.

571
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:58,306
Speaker 1: Oh, man, and something happens to one of these cars and then there's the car in the back does something it's.

572
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:03,990
Speaker 1: I Remember the first time I saw that I was like, it's really a show of great scenes.

573
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:09,690
Speaker 0: It's like all the time they spend in the big like early parts of an episode or well not early parts of an episode.

574
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:17,690
Speaker 0: But it's the show sort of follows a pattern where okay Here's the characters the characters are progressing in his great big storyline.

575
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:25,395
Speaker 0: But there's also the you know intermittent races which take about like four to five episodes and usually it's like, okay Who's he gonna race god?

576
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:29,770
Speaker 1: I just realized that the format of the show is a lot like the cycle of domestic abuse.

577
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:32,639
Speaker 1: There's the calm right everything is great.

578
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,224
Speaker 1: They're just you know, walking around town.

579
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,210
Speaker 1: then tension starts mounting.

580
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:38,558
Speaker 1: There's rumblings that someone's gonna challenge.

581
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,581
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a race.

582
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,166
Speaker 1: then there's the race.

583
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:42,310
Speaker 1: It's coming up.

584
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:43,477
Speaker 1: They build up the right.

585
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,690
Speaker 0: they build up to a race for a couple episodes.

586
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:50,790
Speaker 0: Then there is a race and then the races last like an episode or an episode and a half every race.

587
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:56,270
Speaker 1: There's like the pre race where there's like everyone's getting ready and there's the tension of what's gonna happen.

588
00:42:56,652 --> 00:42:57,616
Speaker 1: Who's gonna race?

589
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:58,621
Speaker 1: you wouldn't think that.

590
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,489
Speaker 1: but half the early race is part of the tension.

591
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,106
Speaker 1: is Who's actually going to be racing in what cars where and why and what stakes?

592
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:07,209
Speaker 1: and then?

593
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:18,030
Speaker 1: The like the first episode of the race covers like the first three quarters of the race Like one episode and then they'll cliffhang you and finish the race in the next episode.

594
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,490
Speaker 1: God, this show is a bunch of cliffhangers in a row and then another calm after the race.

595
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:28,710
Speaker 0: And the other thing the show does is every time you think you have it figured out they introduce some other doubt.

596
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:32,296
Speaker 0: so, you know, it's like You'll be watching the races.

597
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:34,203
Speaker 0: You'd be like I know who's gonna win this race.

598
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:35,970
Speaker 0: It's obvious who's gonna win this race.

599
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,194
Speaker 0: Why would I even watch it?

600
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:40,707
Speaker 0: and then they put some doubt in there and they add doubt every time.

601
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:46,624
Speaker 0: and like they've added Doubt a hundred times for every single race they add more doubt and you're like, there's no way.

602
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:47,567
Speaker 0: they've done this.

603
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:52,059
Speaker 0: every single race They've added doubt and I was right what the hell.

604
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,430
Speaker 0: and then they add doubt again and you're totally fooled every time this.

605
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:00,163
Speaker 1: And there's also the real street.

606
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,409
Speaker 1: racers don't need women.

607
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:03,736
Speaker 0: That's just a funny running game.

608
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,241
Speaker 1: There's a lot of funny.

609
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:09,757
Speaker 1: I mean, I think the charm of this show What really makes it goes that it's got the.

610
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,904
Speaker 1: it's basically a fighting show with cars.

611
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:13,630
Speaker 1: It's got the racing element.

612
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the fights aren't like Dragon Ball where they last ten episodes and nothing happened.

613
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they drive the plot very directly and they're very well done.

614
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,397
Speaker 1: But that alone does not make a good show.

615
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:26,245
Speaker 1: that makes a C anime by default with nothing else.

616
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,128
Speaker 1: That's a C anime.

617
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,758
Speaker 0: hell It's a D anime.

618
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,505
Speaker 0: It depends.

619
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:41,276
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, but it also has all a lot of characters and while the characters aren't as fleshed out as say Spike Spiegel from cowboy bebop They're very fleshed out.

620
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,144
Speaker 0: they react even though they look ugly as hell.

621
00:44:43,425 --> 00:44:44,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't worry about their lips.

622
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,307
Speaker 1: I don't know that there was some sort of chemical deformity in this town.

623
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:49,030
Speaker 0: It must be.

624
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,610
Speaker 0: But that Lake Akina full of boys.

625
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:59,956
Speaker 1: but there's a large cast of characters and you'll start identifying with them and you'll see Kenji of like Kenji blah blah blah.

626
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,560
Speaker 1: What are you doing here at the gas station?

627
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,810
Speaker 0: He's such a side character Kenji, but you totally know him.

628
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:08,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then Sako and Mako in the silady.

629
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:09,784
Speaker 0: it's those two good people.

630
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:11,710
Speaker 1: Oh man, plus they have good music, too.

631
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have really good music.

632
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,248
Speaker 0: So Initial D is The best B anime.

633
00:45:26,388 --> 00:45:28,837
Speaker 0: no one's gonna say this is a great anime of all time.

634
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:29,760
Speaker 0: It's not even close.

635
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,884
Speaker 1: It's not on the a-list.

636
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:34,720
Speaker 0: No one can possibly argue that this is good, but it is fun.

637
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:41,200
Speaker 0: It's sort of like playing a board game that you know, the board game is bad It's just rolling dice and moving a guy around the board.

638
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,158
Speaker 0: But for some reason you have a lot of fun with this one.

639
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:46,590
Speaker 0: I think those two other ones part of what it is.

640
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:59,939
Speaker 1: They took what would otherwise be a pedestrian concept You know car racing and they took all the elements of a good show and they put them in there And they did every part of Initial D as well as you could ever have expected them to do it.

641
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:09,332
Speaker 1: And as a result the the show is more than the sum of its parts and I Highly recommend this show.

642
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:13,528
Speaker 1: if you were a fan of anime Watch the first five episodes.

643
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,677
Speaker 1: just trust us if you don't like it after that.

644
00:46:16,737 --> 00:46:27,274
Speaker 1: You really don't like it whatever, you're just not a human being and we'll hate you forever, but But no seriously give this show a chance and this isn't like, you know.

645
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:28,860
Speaker 1: give fist of the North Star chance.

646
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:30,268
Speaker 1: Really give this show a chance.

647
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,716
Speaker 0: Oh, there's one more warning.

648
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:32,480
Speaker 0: word of warning.

649
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:39,064
Speaker 0: If you get the DVDs of Initial D, oh Fuck you Tokyo pop.

650
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:39,946
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

651
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:45,220
Speaker 0: Okay, Tokyo pop licensed Initial D to be on DVD in the United States.

652
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,435
Speaker 0: I think that license has been transferred and someone else is gonna re-release it correctly.

653
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:51,242
Speaker 0: Oh, I think Funimation I don't know.

654
00:46:51,262 --> 00:47:00,080
Speaker 0: I forget but if you get the Tokyo pop DVDs of Initial D When you put them in your DVD player, it will give you two choices.

655
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:06,165
Speaker 0: one choice will say classic and one choice will say Tricked out.

656
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:13,560
Speaker 1: now now choosing the tricked-out option Will basically condemn your firstborn children to the fiery abyss of hell for all eternity.

657
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:19,319
Speaker 0: Yes, what Tokyo pop did is they thought that they were gonna get Initial D on American television.

658
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:24,320
Speaker 0: now Eurobeat music is sort of would have been a very expensive to get that on.

659
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:33,002
Speaker 1: Yeah a vex track and move and all that that stuff was the hottest shit in Japan back then and it's still pretty hot shit all Things considered.

660
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:38,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would be very difficult for them to get that music onto American television.

661
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:47,933
Speaker 0: Also, they didn't think that music would appeal to Americans and such and they knew that the target audience for a show about drift racing Was more urban.

662
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:53,760
Speaker 0: I guess they thought The kind of people who go and watch too fast too furious.

663
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:57,932
Speaker 1: But their definition of urban wasn't what most people's definition of urban was.

664
00:47:57,972 --> 00:48:00,940
Speaker 1: their definition of urban was 12 year olds in suburbia, right?

665
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:16,512
Speaker 0: So what they did is when they dubbed Initial D, which is an average of an anime dub, you know, actually Spike Spiegel plays David Lucas who does Spike Spiegel and Roger Smith, you know Probably the best voice actor in all of anime in America.

666
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:18,200
Speaker 1: I don't think we should tell them who he plays.

667
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:19,685
Speaker 0: Oh good point.

668
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:33,400
Speaker 0: He plays a minor character who is very important and Hilarious, but also very bad also very bad, but he's the best voice actor in America ever anyway, um What was I saying?

669
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,265
Speaker 0: Alright, alright Tokyo pop.

670
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:42,403
Speaker 0: So what Tokyo pop did is they hired some people to make Terrible music.

671
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:44,992
Speaker 0: We're not worst music you've ever heard.

672
00:48:45,012 --> 00:48:52,074
Speaker 0: I know Gerald drive initial D initial dream initial D. Yeah, it's really bad.

673
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:53,638
Speaker 0: It makes you want to stab your eyes out.

674
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:54,240
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding.

675
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:56,640
Speaker 0: I almost did what do you want to stab your ears out?

676
00:48:56,781 --> 00:49:02,719
Speaker 1: If you stab your eyes out not only are you now blind and in pain But the music's still there and now you can't find the remote to turn it off.

677
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:10,752
Speaker 0: Well, the reason you you do want to stab your eyes out is because not only Did they add change all the music and initial D thus ruining the show?

678
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:24,970
Speaker 0: Not only did they dub it averagely But they applied base what amounts to 1980s, you know College punk kids special effects to all the races effectively.

679
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:25,612
Speaker 1: I it's.

680
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:28,381
Speaker 1: it's the modern equivalent of star wipes.

681
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:30,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically like during a race.

682
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:36,367
Speaker 0: They would do like split the screen up into like four squares showing the same thing.

683
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:43,930
Speaker 1: Oh Also in the dub, they rearrange a bunch of scenes cut out a bunch of controversial stuff and partly change the plot.

684
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,242
Speaker 0: They also change the names of the characters.

685
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,870
Speaker 0: Oh, I got to talk about that in a second.

686
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:54,685
Speaker 0: So watching it Dubbed or tricked out on the Tokyo pop DVDs is a completely different show.

687
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,110
Speaker 0: That's not worth watching ever.

688
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:58,218
Speaker 0: It's like it might be the worst show ever.

689
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:04,877
Speaker 1: I know Daryl Surratt played some bad American equivalent anime music.

690
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:11,498
Speaker 1: when they try to redo that stuff and I'm not gonna do that here because I respect for you guys Yes, you really do not want to hear this music.

691
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,066
Speaker 1: It is not even bad enough to be funny.

692
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:15,230
Speaker 0: It's inhuman.

693
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:23,291
Speaker 1: It's I'm sorry Tokyo pop but you need to force whoever did that to commit seppuku right now Right.

694
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:35,750
Speaker 0: So if you watch the classic version of initial D, you will get the original subtitled unedited initial D With the original eurobeat music and it is on the Tokyo pop DVDs.

695
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:38,618
Speaker 0: So it is worth watching just to get that.

696
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,530
Speaker 1: However, if you like the show, you're probably better off Netflixing it.

697
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:50,001
Speaker 1: I was just gonna say that and only buy it if you're the kind of person who would show scenes Over and over and over again.

698
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:55,404
Speaker 1: to people like we'll periodically grab Key DVDs from initial D and watch specific races.

699
00:50:55,424 --> 00:50:56,990
Speaker 0: We should totally watch one right after the show.

700
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:57,894
Speaker 1: I think we should.

701
00:50:57,914 --> 00:50:59,802
Speaker 1: I want to watch the one with the three cars going.

702
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:00,746
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

703
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:01,630
Speaker 0: Let's watch that one.

704
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,034
Speaker 0: That's right.

705
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,549
Speaker 1: That's my second favorite moment in the show.

706
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,330
Speaker 0: It might be anyway, the other thing is in the manga and in the dub.

707
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,893
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

708
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:12,190
Speaker 0: in the dub they have changed the names of some of the characters.

709
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz apparently Americans can't say things like Takahashi Rios.

710
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,830
Speaker 1: Okay, right Takumi.

711
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,960
Speaker 0: so for example, the main character is Takumi.

712
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:24,534
Speaker 0: they changed his name to tak and Let's see ikitani.

713
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:27,081
Speaker 0: I think they changed his name or something.

714
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,685
Speaker 1: No, I didn't actually read the stupid.

715
00:51:28,725 --> 00:51:32,013
Speaker 0: They changed his name to Cole and It's a key.

716
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:35,007
Speaker 0: They changed his name to Iggy like Iggy pop.

717
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:42,190
Speaker 1: Oh I'm not gonna say much about it's a key but suffice to say he provides a great deal of the humor in this show.

718
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:42,833
Speaker 1: Yes.

719
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:46,090
Speaker 0: Oh and they changed Takahashi Keisuke's name to Katie.

720
00:51:47,872 --> 00:52:05,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, that's in in the anime in the original manga and in the anime They actually say the characters names like Takahashi Keisuke, Takahashi Riosuke Ikitani, you know and it sort of adds something to it the way they say their names.

721
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:17,215
Speaker 0: they always say people's full names like You know Takumi Fujiwara, I'll remember that name, you know, and when they change the names it's like talk I'll remember you.

722
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,950
Speaker 0: It's like what the fuck you weren't that casual before?

723
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:25,930
Speaker 0: You were all serious and racing and that you know, yeah, that's well.

724
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:34,330
Speaker 1: That's also something that I mean aside from the full name thing Which is cool that Japanese has various levels of honor and defer deference that we really don't have in English.

725
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:38,481
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you could still do it properly without making the name silly.

726
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:41,570
Speaker 1: yeah, I think the answer is just to watch the sub.

727
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch the subtitled.

728
00:52:44,039 --> 00:53:01,248
Speaker 0: first season of initial D. It's worth your time if you don't get into it, you don't get into it, you know, but It's something you have to like Feel inside you in the third place Not the first place or the second place but the third place.

729
00:53:01,288 --> 00:53:01,750
Speaker 0: That's right.

730
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:10,161
Speaker 0: If you don't feel it in the third place, it's not gonna work for you You know, so in the very least watch the first five episodes.

731
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:18,023
Speaker 1: if you're a little more adventurous have a little more free time I'd say really watch the first 13 at least up through the salady race.

732
00:53:18,765 --> 00:53:20,610
Speaker 0: I think that's actually way after the 13.

733
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,694
Speaker 1: It might be I don't remember.

734
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:22,738
Speaker 1: I don't know.

735
00:53:22,758 --> 00:53:26,110
Speaker 1: the gum tape race has got a really good moment in it.

736
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:28,410
Speaker 0: Gum tape race is highest of quality.

737
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:35,310
Speaker 1: I mean, it sounds so stupid if you explain to someone the concept of a gum tape race or gum tape death man.

738
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:35,992
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

739
00:53:36,032 --> 00:53:41,370
Speaker 0: is they also like in in the original they called it like the gum tape death man, right?

740
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,293
Speaker 0: Like oh shits.

741
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:45,745
Speaker 0: and then in the manga, it's like yeah, it's like the duck the duct tape race.

742
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:46,929
Speaker 0: I'm like what?

743
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:54,559
Speaker 1: But really if you explain the concept to a person just out of the blue like hey How does this sound for an idea for a race?

744
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,390
Speaker 1: they would say that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

745
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:04,830
Speaker 1: But somehow watching them explain it in this anime makes it sound like the most awesome crazy dangerous amazing thing ever.

746
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it works.

747
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:07,480
Speaker 1: Well, it works.

748
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:07,982
Speaker 1: All right.

749
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,006
Speaker 0: Oh, it sure does man.

750
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:13,029
Speaker 1: Alright, I didn't expect the show to go in some of the directions it did.

751
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:24,732
Speaker 0: so that concludes the only time you will ever hear any anime podcaster praise initial D because I'm pretty sure everyone else hates this show and You might too, but we like it.

752
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,500
Speaker 1: Yeah you yeah, you know what?

753
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:31,637
Speaker 1: We don't make fun of you for your fist of the North Star or your great messenger.

754
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:33,528
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, I don't know.

755
00:54:33,649 --> 00:54:35,200
Speaker 0: I haven't actually seen those things.

756
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:40,059
Speaker 0: I like the idea of them, but I don't know if I'll actually like them when I watch them.

757
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:43,134
Speaker 0: Anyway, what are we gonna do tomorrow on the show?
