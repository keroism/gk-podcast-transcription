00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,230
Speaker 1: No, no, it's not even close to that now.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,281
Speaker 1: No, so I didn't realize that summer begins like so late.

10
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,029
Speaker 1: I always thought that I thought it was summer already, but it's not.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,902
Speaker 1: it's Summer now and like last night the Sun was out at like 830.

00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:49,190
Speaker 0: You know, it's even crazier.

14
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:54,552
Speaker 0: We live right now right on the far eastern side of this time zone Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:58,461
Speaker 0: when I was a kid, we lived on the other end of the time zone.

16
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:07,790
Speaker 0: It's the same time in Detroit that it is here Mmm, so the Sun would be up until about 9.

17
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,041
Speaker 0: Summer days were crazy long and it was awesome.

18
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,109

32
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:57,860
Speaker 1: You can't live ten geodude so it's gonna stay warm.

33
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,450
Speaker 0: you got any more any more things to throw in there.

34
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,034
Speaker 1: We used every inside joke or not.

00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:04,357
Speaker 0: There's one you're missing.

45
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,668
Speaker 1: It doesn't compare to warm today, which has to be brought back.

46
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:37,030
Speaker 0: See I remember at one point we started doing the opposite in the winter.

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,379
Speaker 0: I would say, you know warm today and then summer.

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,102
Speaker 0: I would say woman.

49
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,407
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

50
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,070
Speaker 1: this is on record.

51
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:42,896
Speaker 1: Someone go find out.

52
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:43,239

00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:52,950
Speaker 1: It's warm today So you need to find some other weather related inside.

55
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,221
Speaker 0: You know, it's not gonna do today.

56
00:02:56,724 --> 00:03:07,488
Speaker 0: snow rain Actually, it could rain at any moment in the summer doesn't really fit in the meta moment cuz it's not a geek nights thing It's just a rim thing.

57
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:13,314
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna be at the sifma conference in New York City on Wednesday, it's going like.

58
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,221
Speaker 1: I don't think I think there will be zero listeners.

59
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:20,440
Speaker 0: at the same time last year at sifma I tweeted out and a few people responded and I met some people.

60
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:21,986

Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who's a tech or a business person in the financial world is gonna be at sifma.

64
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:41,029

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,905
Speaker 0: the people who are doing this are gonna go through the tick data like the ticks Like something sold at this price now if they know.

68
00:03:54,945 --> 00:04:00,750
Speaker 1: if they know this Why don't they say now and my see a little blog post why they got to say it then why they holding on to this?

69
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:10,950
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure like I haven't been following up on the investigations after the flash crash But I'm pretty sure everything I'm about to see is already available and just someone smarter than me is gonna explain to me what?

70
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:11,587
Speaker 0: It means.

71
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,670
Speaker 0: But they're supposedly gonna go through the data and do some data mining stuff and be like, so here's what happened.

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,430
Speaker 0: Like check this out the order of events could have been predicted all this cool math stuff.

73
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:29,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, and at night I'm going to a lecture and a cocktail thing and the bunch of CEOs are gonna talk about I don't even know what but free drinks.

74
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,377
Speaker 1: Here's what you do right you bring.

75
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:34,206
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give you some disposable like plus who's a loss?

76
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,310
Speaker 1: no plastic Chinese.

77
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:37,996
Speaker 1: I should bring my boo boo Zilla The SIFMA.

78
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:44,089
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bring some plastic Chinese takeout Containers and you're gonna go in and fill them up with catered food and then bring them out and then go back in.

79
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,295
Speaker 1: Come on Why not?

80
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,710
Speaker 0: but I'll be at SIFMA.

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:59,945
Speaker 0: So if any of you are SIFMA types, you know, you're learning about financial sector technology and business and stuff like that I count apparently as a c-level employee.

82
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:00,730
Speaker 1: What does that mean?

83
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:10,899
Speaker 0: Basically, they have the demographics of SIFMA and they're like look like two-thirds the people who come are managing directors and one-third are like vice-presidents and you all these corporate titles.

84
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:20,953
Speaker 0: and then all the rest of the people who go to SIFMA are Class C employees which means any employee who has a stake in the company, but is not Corporate titled.

85
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:22,137
Speaker 0: No, okay.

86
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:24,925
Speaker 0: So basically until I become a VP.

87
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:26,810
Speaker 0: I'm a class C according to SIFMA.

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,143
Speaker 1: So there's no A or B. It's just.

89
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:32,532
Speaker 1: C means not Crap.

90
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:33,395
Speaker 0: C means rim.

91
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:37,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like everyone else is C. There's no D or F below you.

92
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,955
Speaker 1: You're already the C is the lowest.

93
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,725
Speaker 0: I don't know if companies send people at the lower tiers.

94
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,030
Speaker 0: I don't even know there are lower tiers.

95
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,617
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess they even let you.

96
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,320
Speaker 1: I mean, that's pretty.

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,450
Speaker 1: I mean, why don't they just say boss?

98
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:52,537
Speaker 0: lower boss not a boss Like a boss, all right.

99
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:55,494
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's it.

100
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:56,358
Speaker 0: Just it'll be interesting.

101
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:56,820
Speaker 0: I'll be there.

102
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,810
Speaker 1: Is that your news or is that just such just something?

103
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,620
Speaker 1: Okay, got any news wouldn't shouldn't that be met a moment?

104
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,090
Speaker 0: No, I'd already said why it shouldn't be a met a moment.

105
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,455
Speaker 0: Okay, this is not geek nights.

106
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,085
Speaker 0: Geek nights is not lecturing or doing a panel at SIFMA.

107
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,490
Speaker 1: So it's still opening bit actually.

108
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

109
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,047
Speaker 1: It's just rim is going to say let's let's do some news here.

110
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:21,810
Speaker 1: All right, so Barnes & Noble they make the Nook which is the sort of Android ish e-reader thing right it was $200.

111
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,437
Speaker 1: now it's Damn it.

112
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,370
Speaker 1: I mean they dropped that price like a fucking rock.

113
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:28,811
Speaker 1: The thing.

114
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:33,648
Speaker 1: Amazon dropped the price of the Kindle to like something else pretty low like 180 something.

115
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,790
Speaker 0: See, here's the problem.

116
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:43,170
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't buy one already is that I'm morally convicted about keeping for sale rights.

117
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,648
Speaker 0: yeah, that's the only reason I haven't bought one of these devices.

118
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:49,263
Speaker 1: and For a hundred bucks you buy something on Steam.

119
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,108
Speaker 1: You don't for sale rice.

120
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:53,184
Speaker 1: of that I know but I'd say we're a big hypocrite.

121
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,794
Speaker 0: So here's the thing With steam.

122
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,322
Speaker 0: I have no other way to play some of these games.

123
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:00,950
Speaker 0: I can still buy a book.

124
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:04,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what these books a lot of them are a lot cheaper than the same book.

125
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:05,247
Speaker 1: actually.

126
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:09,342
Speaker 0: so far They've not been as in every time I've bought a mass-market paperback.

127
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:11,530
Speaker 0: The Kindle version has been like a dollar cheaper.

128
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,130
Speaker 1: Well, here let me let me use our latest book club as an example.

129
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:18,363
Speaker 0: When I looked I found the mass-market paperback for $7 $6.99.

130
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:18,664
Speaker 0: free shipping.

131
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:27,531
Speaker 1: All right, I found the Kindle one at $7.99 on Amazon, but actually you can get a used one for $0.75.

132
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,615
Speaker 0: Never doing that again.

133
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:33,953
Speaker 0: the last time I bought a book used on Amazon it came it was readable It was in good condition.

134
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:35,618
Speaker 0: It smelled like lox.

135
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,685
Speaker 1: It's currently unavailable on the Kindle.

136
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:39,812
Speaker 1: Oh, so there you go There we go.

137
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,148
Speaker 0: So but anyway the hundred bucks on this thing in the.

138
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,262
Speaker 1: I bought used stuff on Amazon and it's always been pretty good.

139
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,030
Speaker 1: I got a high quality monstrous manual.

140
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:51,993
Speaker 0: Maybe I just got unlucky.

141
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:57,029
Speaker 0: I the fact that it smelled like a lox like not like rotten fish book like it smelled like lox.

142
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:05,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, I got a bagel ox and cream cheese on an amazing bagel for five dollars And that came.

143
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:08,028
Speaker 1: that technically came with a free soda or coffee, but I turned that down.

144
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,049
Speaker 0: really You should take it anyway and give it to the homeless person.

145
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,094
Speaker 1: There was no homeless.

146
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:15,430
Speaker 0: people around should take it it and then throw it away right there and just laughed at how wonderful capitalism is.

147
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,160
Speaker 1: But there was a cute girl making the bagels.

148
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:21,949
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you should have taken the free coffee But she she looked like she had plenty of coffee.

149
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,508
Speaker 1: She worked in the bagel place.

150
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,775
Speaker 1: She could have had infinite coffee.

151
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,721
Speaker 0: Are you sure she wasn't learning?

152
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure wasn't?

153
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:31,290
Speaker 0: wasn't a promotion?

154
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,456
Speaker 0: She's like, hey free coffee.

155
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:33,340
Speaker 1: No, there was.

156
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,164
Speaker 1: it was a big sign.

157
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,450
Speaker 1: outside was five hours big.

158
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:38,575
Speaker 0: So is that it?

159
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:39,559
Speaker 0: they're just lowering the prices.

160
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,450
Speaker 1: yeah, but I mean that's kind of a big deal.

161
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,102
Speaker 1: That's a really freakin low price for what you get right?

162
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:54,630
Speaker 1: I mean the only thing it's lacking real I mean, it doesn't have a very powerful processor or anything But it's powerful enough, you know, the only thing is that these things don't have like, you know, high quality screens.

163
00:08:54,691 --> 00:09:02,150
Speaker 0: They have a reader screen Which actually I would argue are higher quality for certain kinds of reading but much lower quality for other kinds of reading, right?

164
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,784
Speaker 1: But I mean for 150 bucks you can swap out the screen bubble.

165
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:10,430
Speaker 1: You need to get a video chip in there I don't know, but a hundred bucks what you're not swapping out that screen?

166
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:15,426
Speaker 1: No but the point is that the price is low enough to where it's sort of worth it to like.

167
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,782
Speaker 1: just buy it and hack the device and do something else with it.

168
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:18,670
Speaker 1: I mean, it's Android, right?

169
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,689
Speaker 1: So you can go to town at least on the nook which is the cheaper of the two.

170
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:22,937
Speaker 1: The Kindle is not as cheap.

171
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,594
Speaker 0: See if I bought it for a hundred bucks, you know It's 150.

172
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:29,548
Speaker 0: I'm saying but if it got to a hundred bucks, which it will I'd use it to read books.

173
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:31,669
Speaker 0: That's what I want.

174
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:32,554
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

175
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:37,114
Speaker 0: the people who want more than that are gonna buy an iPad and they'll think it's an iPad I can also read.

176
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:38,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the iPad cost?

177
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:39,248
Speaker 1: Let's go.

178
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,810
Speaker 0: Yeah People who buy the e-book readers just want them to read books.

179
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,158
Speaker 1: iPad starts at five hundred.

180
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,867
Speaker 1: so for the price of an iPad you can get like three nooks.

181
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,550
Speaker 1: that is pretty bad for the iPad.

182
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,930
Speaker 0: Remember the people who buy the iPad are not buying it for the e-reading.

183
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:07,390
Speaker 0: They use the e-reading the fact that it can do it to justify the purchase of the iPad because they say yeah It was expensive and it does, you know only these limited things, but it's also an e-reader.

184
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:08,776
Speaker 0: I didn't have to buy a Kindle.

185
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,765
Speaker 0: So it's like it's a hundred and fifty dollars cheaper.

186
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,130
Speaker 0: So it's $350.

187
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's weird though, right?

188
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,230
Speaker 1: is iPad five hundred bucks, right?

189
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,606
Speaker 1: But the iPhone if you get it unlocked is like six seven.

190
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:24,750
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous price.

191
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:37,370
Speaker 0: look something Americans always forget about is that miniaturization is very expensive and Even the cheap cell phones are really expensive to manufacture in a lot of cases and they use a lot of very high-end technology.

192
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:41,347
Speaker 1: But as of today, you can actually get the iBooks on your iPhone or your iPod touch.

193
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,070
Speaker 1: You don't need an iPad.

194
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if I can read something on that small screen for that long.

195
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:47,432
Speaker 1: Well, but the thing is that the you know It has the higher.

196
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:51,669
Speaker 1: if you get the iPhone 4 it's got the high-res screen with the 4x pixels.

197
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,758
Speaker 1: true I bet you could read on that motherfucker.

198
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I hope so.

199
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:55,948
Speaker 1: I bought one.

200
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:59,249
Speaker 0: good I feel like I'd like the bigger screen anyway for reading a book.

201
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:06,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wouldn't want to pay $500 for because I've always liked the books that have fairly large pages But that are extremely word-dense.

202
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:12,110
Speaker 1: My problem is you know, you the thing is like I'm not one of those zealots is like I gotta read it on paper.

203
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:18,570
Speaker 1: Right, you know what the in terms of just the experience forgetting about the DRM or the price or any of that sort of.

204
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,550
Speaker 1: You know meta stuff.

205
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms of just the experience of reading the number one thing that the digital readers are missing You know what?

206
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:25,784
Speaker 0: It is writing notes.

207
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,976
Speaker 1: No They have writing notes.

208
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:28,979
Speaker 0: They don't work that well.

209
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,501
Speaker 1: It works.

210
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:31,870
Speaker 1: Yeah bookmarks - they better bookmarks, you know.

211
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,540
Speaker 1: Better book, you know what they're missing.

212
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,009
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm doesn't smell good.

213
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:37,090
Speaker 1: I'm a book smeller Scott.

214
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,153
Speaker 0: So what you should do right?

215
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:45,358
Speaker 0: buy a pack like a bunch of boosters of like foreign magic cards real cheap and just tape it To my nose every time you go out.

216
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:48,370
Speaker 0: tape a new freshly open magic card to the back of your nook.

217
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,119
Speaker 1: You know for the that amount of money.

218
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,607
Speaker 1: I might as well just play some fucking CCG.

219
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:54,360
Speaker 0: I got a bit playing magic.

220
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,630
Speaker 0: that day was pretty fun except that you know The decks were kind of broken and you don't make any decisions after you start playing.

221
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:08,669
Speaker 1: She just played with some old cards with one of those Methods that what they were talking about were like you have one big deck and everyone shares it and you could you know What are those kind of things?

222
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,494
Speaker 1: There are a lot of.

223
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:12,543
Speaker 0: you know, very play magic the conquering.

224
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:13,688
Speaker 0: No one fucking remembers that.

225
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,295
Speaker 0: it came in I think scribe magazine.

226
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,360
Speaker 1: How does that work?

227
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:25,230
Speaker 0: So it came with this big hex map With land like land like planes and mountains all over it and then the middle was this monolith and I forget the exact rules.

228
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,496
Speaker 0: But you you had your wizard walked around Like he was on a hex.

229
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:39,090
Speaker 0: you summon a creature they're on a hex they move around on the hexes and You basically have to like conquer land to use it to tap to do shit.

230
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:40,416
Speaker 1: Why don't we do?

231
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:43,450
Speaker 1: why don't we make play magic with Dominion rules, right?

232
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,615
Speaker 1: You start you start with it.

233
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:52,498
Speaker 1: We you start with a deck right and we'll use I don't know like Artifacts as victory points, right?

234
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:57,214
Speaker 1: So an artifact is worth the number of victory points equal Playing that way.

235
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,530
Speaker 0: Why don't you just play cards use them to be me like rules to kill the other player.

236
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,706
Speaker 1: so everyone gets 20 health and your deck starts with 10 lands and you draw five

237
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,432
Speaker 0: or 10

238
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:12,950
Speaker 1: lands and like three one one creature if you seven seven lands and three one one creature This

239
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:17,710
Speaker 0: gets overpowered really quickly because you have enough money to buy a creature like a Siobhan dragon.

240
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,305
Speaker 0: You can just keep whipping that Siobhan dragon out over and over and over again.

241
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,430
Speaker 0: You don't care if it dies.

242
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,466
Speaker 1: So you start the game with.

243
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,156
Speaker 1: yeah The math doesn't work.

244
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:38,209
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I got a couple of quick news is I just want to mention partly because we're trying to kill time before the second half of the show But also because I think they're worth talking about.

245
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:50,979
Speaker 0: So there was a internet shitstorm and a little bit of a kind of real-world shitstorm about the fact that the Utah Attorney General tweeted the orders to execute someone which While some people said was in bad taste.

246
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,690
Speaker 0: I say why is one medium any different than any other medium?

247
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,256
Speaker 1: Oh, you put it in the newspaper.

248
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:56,018
Speaker 1: That's tasteful.

249
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:56,982
Speaker 1: He did it on TV.

250
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:57,644
Speaker 1: That's not.

251
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,291
Speaker 0: I mean go back to the year 15.

252
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,820
Speaker 0: Whatever is like how dare they record?

253
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,570
Speaker 1: I don't know how dare they announce it on the radio?

254
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:09,251
Speaker 0: So one I said 1500 and two, I don't know why there was no radio in 1500.

255
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,998
Speaker 0: Why either one of us did that accent.

256
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,850
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with 1500 cuz that's how they talked in the radio.

257
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:16,903
Speaker 0: Everyone from any year before 1930 talked.

258
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,349
Speaker 1: how dare they?

259
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:22,551
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know 1500.

260
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,056
Speaker 1: I don't think they spoke English.

261
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:28,450
Speaker 0: I'm sure he thought no they definitely did because he fit it into the hundred fifty characters.

262
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,663
Speaker 0: I just gave the go-ahead to Corrections director to proceed with gardeners execution.

263
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:33,907
Speaker 0: May God grant him the mercy.

264
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:37,219
Speaker 0: denied his victims Mm-hmm, and it was retweeted.

265
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:41,470
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of chaos about it, but I It's weird.

266
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,841
Speaker 0: I want to bring this up just to say that it's not newsworthy.

267
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:47,169
Speaker 0: that it was newsworthy like this is just.

268
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,513
Speaker 0: you know This is national extension.

269
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:53,367
Speaker 0: Twitter like things are a means of communication and the only reason they're not respected now.

270
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,350
Speaker 1: He texted it.

271
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:59,197
Speaker 0: Oh, no is because We broke up over.

272
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,060
Speaker 0: I am.

273
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:08,650
Speaker 0: what did will right say over and over again people don't Respect any new form of media until all the people who were around before it existed die.

274
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:12,370
Speaker 0: And then once it's just commonplace people don't think of it any differently from any other media.

275
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:15,379
Speaker 0: Yep, so video games people some people still don't respect them.

276
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,108
Speaker 0: Twitter's the same way that newfangled radio there.

277
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:20,376
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not older than me.

278
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:20,979
Speaker 1: Therefore.

279
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,609
Speaker 0: I don't respect it which comes into the same because there's another article I want to mention briefly that's related to this.

280
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,814
Speaker 0: There's this whole thing on.

281
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:37,750
Speaker 0: it was linked to on slash job about how according to a recent study Engineers the vast majority of them don't use Twitter and personally dislike Twitter and a lot of people hate on Twitter.

282
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,974
Speaker 0: I mean everyone out in the air.

283
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,119
Speaker 0: There's blogs like oh Twitter.

284
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,829
Speaker 0: I don't care about what kind of sandwich you ate today.

285
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,308
Speaker 0: and so far.

286
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:51,690
Speaker 0: This is a statistic that is completely accurate that I made up right now of the people who complain about Twitter.

287
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:54,879
Speaker 0: Don't understand what Twitter is and her complaint.

288
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,305
Speaker 0: It'd be like me complaining.

289
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,650
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think of a good example.

290
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:01,650
Speaker 1: It'd be like playing counters when rim said he didn't need tabs in his web browser.

291
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:07,420
Speaker 0: No It's more like if I started playing Said he didn't need a camera in his phone if I started.

292
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,247
Speaker 0: that it's not in any way related.

293
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,150
Speaker 0: It's not about needing.

294
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,256
Speaker 0: Say they don't need it.

295
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:14,206
Speaker 0: They're saying they don't like it.

296
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,269
Speaker 1: primarily You said you didn't like having a camera in the phone.

297
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,010
Speaker 0: Actually, I didn't because I wasn't allowed to have a camera at work.

298
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,357
Speaker 1: So you also didn't like it.

299
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:32,834
Speaker 0: in addition to that now because I couldn't bring my camera every day when I got to work I'd take my fucking cell phone and give it to the security guard and I had to get it back when I left because cameras Were banned from my facility.

300
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:34,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sucked.

301
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:34,479
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

302
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

303
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:40,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was in addition to you also Expressing dislike with the camera.

304
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:40,718
Speaker 0: No, not really.

305
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,124
Speaker 0: I mean the camera my phone was shady.

306
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:42,967
Speaker 0: I never used it.

307
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,437
Speaker 1: back then You didn't use it when you didn't have it.

308
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:46,281
Speaker 0: No, I had it.

309
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:48,030
Speaker 0: that I didn't use it because it took shitty pictures.

310
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,358
Speaker 0: It wasn't easy to get the pictures off.

311
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,170
Speaker 1: That's enough of this anyway.

312
00:16:52,212 --> 00:17:01,749
Speaker 0: most of the complaints about Twitter are people who are basically saying There is spam on Twitter and I go actively seek it out and read it in order to complain about it.

313
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,455
Speaker 0: Like don't these people realize?

314
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:06,223
Speaker 0: you only see the tweets of people you subscribe to?

315
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:11,398
Speaker 1: it's the same shit with the people who are like You know, oh my god, they publish my email address.

316
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,662
Speaker 1: It's a privacy violation.

317
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:14,828
Speaker 1: It's like so the phone book wasn't.

318
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:17,482
Speaker 0: I mean I'm not gonna go that way.

319
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,849
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the same situation here.

320
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,770
Speaker 0: It's just very specifically the issue that there is a medium whereby you subscribe.

321
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,518
Speaker 0: You say I want X in front.

322
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,250
Speaker 1: if someone says that it's because they don't understand how email works.

323
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,050
Speaker 1: Oh, no, the whole world got me email address.

324
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:39,042
Speaker 1: So you just make a fucking filter and you report a spam and you have a spam filter and no one who ever you know No one will be able to email you and they won't be able to do anything else.

325
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,990
Speaker 1: to you having your email address means nothing.

326
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,784
Speaker 1: They can't do anything to you at all period.

327
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,539
Speaker 1: All right Same with Twitter.

328
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,094
Speaker 1: if you don't follow the spammers They can't do anything to you period.

329
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:52,530
Speaker 1: your lack of understanding of technology is what opens you up to getting abused by the technology.

330
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,070
Speaker 0: I just want to leave the email example off because this is so much more direct.

331
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,355
Speaker 0: It's not like you know.

332
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:07,210
Speaker 0: with email at least someone can send you, you know, whatever filters you have There's a tiny possibility someone could send you an email that is bullshit that you didn't want and it got to you somehow.

333
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,075
Speaker 1: Actually this lately.

334
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:10,710
Speaker 1: They're actually the Gmail spam filters been getting a little weak.

335
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:15,085
Speaker 0: I've gotten about one spam every few days for the pad like just recently.

336
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:19,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, just very very recently I think someone figured out a trick that will soon be unfigured out.

337
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:29,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at least you know There's the tiny chance that like one spam will get through every now and then because there is still the capability for push Mm-hmm, but with Twitter, it's just pull.

338
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:34,150
Speaker 0: if you ever see a tweet that you didn't care about it is your dumbass fault.

339
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:35,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

340
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:38,410
Speaker 1: Sometimes I used to have a policy if you follow me, I'll follow you.

341
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,117
Speaker 0: I stopped that a long time ago.

342
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:40,699
Speaker 1: Stop that policy.

343
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,270
Speaker 0: I heard a lot of people's feelings when I unfollowed them all at once.

344
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,162
Speaker 1: I don't even how do people even know if you get unfollowed?

345
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:47,347
Speaker 1: It doesn't tell you.

346
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

347
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:48,974
Speaker 0: You can tell it.

348
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,603
Speaker 1: to tell you I've never gotten it.

349
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,528
Speaker 1: It never tells me.

350
00:18:51,608 --> 00:19:00,136
Speaker 1: anyway I unfollowed a whole bunch of people recently, but if I get a spam, right like someone adds me a spam Oh, I just block him without even thinking.

351
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:03,730
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a button in tweet deck that says block and report as spam.

352
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:06,740
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't have a report as spam button.

353
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,185
Speaker 1: I click that mofo right away.

354
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:09,168
Speaker 1: I had no prejudice.

355
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,093
Speaker 1: one guy He was.

356
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,339
Speaker 1: he was he was a real person.

357
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,244
Speaker 1: He was trying to like.

358
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,290
Speaker 1: he was like a job recruiter.

359
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,923
Speaker 1: He was like, hey you want to give me your phone number?

360
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:16,485
Speaker 1: We could talk.

361
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:18,824
Speaker 0: and I was like, eh So, how do you how do you get you?

362
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:19,389
Speaker 0: did he at you?

363
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,843
Speaker 1: I think you just look for technology people on Twitter.

364
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:22,226
Speaker 0: Okay.

365
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:22,890
Speaker 0: See here's the other thing.

366
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,486
Speaker 0: I don't read ads except when I'm at a convention or something.

367
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,310
Speaker 0: I never read ads.

368
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,150
Speaker 1: I have all these columns and stuff.

369
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,710
Speaker 1: What I do is I columns are actually pretty good because I have a geek nights column and I got a column.

370
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,177
Speaker 1: That's so I can see whatever your tell.

371
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:35,820
Speaker 1: whoever like.

372
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,289
Speaker 1: I can follow you and I have a column so I can see Anything you say and anything anyone says to you.

373
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,222
Speaker 0: Only read Twitter.

374
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:47,930
Speaker 0: really for the few people I follow and to self organize when I'm out in public at conventions and stuff.

375
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,836
Speaker 0: So I use all those like.

376
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:53,770
Speaker 0: I set up all the columns and timelines and everything like before packs.

377
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:58,107
Speaker 0: I think I rid of them all or turn them all off after packs because normally I only read the tweets from people.

378
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,082
Speaker 0: I Actually actively follow.

379
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,713
Speaker 0: Yeah But it just it.

380
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:10,529
Speaker 0: it amazes me that to this day so many people who complain about Twitter are basically All they're really saying is I'm a dumbass who doesn't understand this and I'm going to complain about it.

381
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,441
Speaker 1: It's a new fangled thing.

382
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:17,710
Speaker 0: I don't like it And the examples in this article are just hilarious.

383
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:33,861
Speaker 0: So what like the slash shot article actually links to like, you know Most tweets are useless crap like this and they link to this guy's Twitter and he tweeted and I quote Go That's a great tweet when he's talking about his team price scored.

384
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,205
Speaker 0: bang our hashtag.

385
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,530
Speaker 0: por, you know Portugal.

386
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,575
Speaker 0: I love my country.

387
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,360
Speaker 0: I love my team heart.

388
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,350
Speaker 0: OMG comma OMG OMG Portugal.

389
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,295
Speaker 1: Dude about some Portugal.

390
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:47,719
Speaker 1: that might be mad my tweet.

391
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,043
Speaker 0: I might start following this guy.

392
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:51,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I followed Vibhu Zilla for a while.

393
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:53,658
Speaker 1: It's also I followed that go go 13.

394
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:56,528
Speaker 0: Oh go go 13 is one of my all he ever says is that that that?

395
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:01,669
Speaker 0: yeah Occasionally, he'll add it someone and he'll just still say dot that that do Togo that that that.

396
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:05,308
Speaker 0: So, yeah, but I have a real news.

397
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,536
Speaker 1: That wasn't the real news.

398
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,421
Speaker 0: That was all just fluff.

399
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,164
Speaker 0: We're trying to kill time.

400
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,330
Speaker 1: It's taking a long time here.

401
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you wanted me to.

402
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,449
Speaker 0: do you want me to not use the real news?

403
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,830
Speaker 0: Yeah so we don't have to talk about this too long because I don't care about the details because I have funny things to say.

404
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,314
Speaker 0: so the article is VLC 1.1 Has to stop allowing Shoutcast support.

405
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:27,097
Speaker 1: why?

406
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,788
Speaker 0: because AOL won't let them anymore.

407
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:33,543
Speaker 0: now that I'm Question the first what the fuck shoutcast?

408
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:35,009
Speaker 0: and question the second what the fuck is AOL?

409
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:36,193
Speaker 1: Well shoutcast is.

410
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,360
Speaker 0: I know what shoutcast is 100 years old.

411
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,196
Speaker 1: who cares about shoutcast and who cares about AOL I think a lot of people.

412
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:45,587
Speaker 0: actually this article was like out of the early 2000s.

413
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:53,926
Speaker 0: It talks about shoutcast about nullsoft video land AOL It this is crazy, but apparently here's the deal.

414
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,539
Speaker 0: so Shoutcast you can like.

415
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,048
Speaker 0: there's a license where you can use it, right?

416
00:21:58,851 --> 00:21:59,035
Speaker 1: I didn't.

417
00:21:59,055 --> 00:21:59,669
Speaker 1: I thought it was open.

418
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,942
Speaker 0: I guess it's not completely open but the license is there.

419
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,108
Speaker 0: VLC was using it.

420
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,832
Speaker 0: Apparently the terms of the license don't allow you to use it in a project that itself has a viral license to make things more open Mm-hmm.

421
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,042
Speaker 1: So basically in other words, it's non GPL compatible.

422
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:17,510
Speaker 0: Yes, but the the language of it.

423
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,550
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna bother quoting and everything, but it's almost as though and I wonder if we're gonna start seeing more of this.

424
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:30,917
Speaker 0: They have made shoutcast very specifically free as in beer and not just not free as in speech But against free as in speech.

425
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,565
Speaker 0: that basically imagine if you have a reverse GPL.

426
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:44,450
Speaker 0: a license says you can use this for free But you can never use it with or in relation to any open source thing Or anything that requires something to be open source or anything viral.

427
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,760
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because you can just see.

428
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,170
Speaker 1: the problem is only the GPL is viral.

429
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,090
Speaker 1: None of the open source licenses have the viral nature of them.

430
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,269
Speaker 1: So you could just use the MIT license of the BSD license.

431
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,965
Speaker 1: But the thing is it's a lot of difficulty for VLC to switch.

432
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,733
Speaker 1: if they would have started out that way They'd be all good.

433
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:02,589
Speaker 1: But now to switch is a huge legal pain in the ass.

434
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:16,830
Speaker 0: Yeah basically The license clause prohibits the prohibits the redistribution of shoutcast with any product whose own license requires that it be quote Disclosed or distributed in source code form license for the purposes of making derivative works or redistributable at no charge.

435
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,682
Speaker 1: Well, maybe AOL will fix it or now not out.

436
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:21,490
Speaker 0: That's all you know part of this.

437
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,791
Speaker 0: That's just.

438
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:25,967
Speaker 0: it's an interesting idea that people might start making kind of like you can.

439
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,689
Speaker 0: you can make viral Licenses to do all sorts of crazy stuff.

440
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:34,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you can only use the software if you include a picture of your own penis and remember postcard wear.

441
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:36,420
Speaker 1: It's like if you use this send me a postcard.

442
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:44,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like that sort of concept though But at the same time it comes down to the whole thing of our eulas and things like that binding or not?

443
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,278
Speaker 0: Because if they are you've got to send the postcard.

444
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:50,630
Speaker 0: you're breaking the law and if they're not it's it's open season on everything.

445
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:52,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, well this is you know lately I've been sorry.

446
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:53,728
Speaker 1: It's it's weird.

447
00:23:53,788 --> 00:24:05,134
Speaker 1: It's like You know, you look at the GPL and it's like well if we don't if everyone used MIT and BSD license stuff Right, then, you know, for example of Linux We're not GPL right.

448
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:11,350
Speaker 1: a lot of the contributions to Linux come from say Nvidia and Red Hat and these IBM and real companies.

449
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:23,210
Speaker 1: right, so if Linux kernel were MIT licensed would and videos still help, you know Submit their patches back to Linux kernel or would they just maintain their own branch?

450
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,691
Speaker 1: Would they?

451
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:25,414
Speaker 1: you know, you don't know.

452
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:29,569
Speaker 1: so the GPL sort of makes sure that they have to do the first which is good.

453
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:34,390
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, it's like, okay nothing I'm gonna do is gonna have a GPL license.

454
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,754
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use MIT license.

455
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:43,339
Speaker 1: go nuts, you know, if you want to use my code, you know for whatever you want to do It's it's just free party to think.

456
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,510
Speaker 0: it's the idea that you know, we want things to be open and free.

457
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:49,327
Speaker 0: But something you know, there's the two alternate philosophies.

458
00:24:49,428 --> 00:25:06,230
Speaker 0: one hand It's make everything free and just let's have fun and the other idea is Make everything free But not completely free because we're gonna use the fact that we can control the freedom to force other people to make things more Free, so I'm a little less free, but I force other people to be a little more free and it's 50/50.

459
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,255
Speaker 0: I'm completely ambivalent.

460
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:08,961
Speaker 1: Yeah, we wouldn't be like without the GPL.

461
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:11,010
Speaker 1: We wouldn't be hacking any routers or anything, you know.

462
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,395
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's just interesting.

463
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:20,009
Speaker 0: but there's a second part of this apparently that license for the furthest video land, you know stuff.

464
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:26,664
Speaker 0: video land would be forced to bundle some nullsoft adware if They continued to use shoutcast.

465
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:27,489
Speaker 1: Why?

466
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,412
Speaker 1: Do that which?

467
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,598
Speaker 0: it scares me nullsoft adware?

468
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:35,750
Speaker 0: remember when nullsoft was the good guys and then AOL bought them like the worst possible outcome.

469
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:39,050
Speaker 0: Yep, nullsoft are the same people mean they made winamp.

470
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:51,769
Speaker 1: They've revolutionized a lot of the internet and pretty much when in the windows days Right in like, you know the late 90s Like about a decade ago you had a Windows computer and you had pretty much a nullsoft suite and that was that was your computer.

471
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,737
Speaker 1: You had every nullsoft thing.

472
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:58,030
Speaker 1: you had a new teller you had a winamp you had a whole thing going on And that was that was your computer.

473
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,750
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day All right, so I just read this article here.

474
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,000
Speaker 1: It's actually a PDF which is annoying.

475
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,435
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, right, but basically this guy says pi is wrong.

476
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:22,897
Speaker 1: So immediately you're like No Not wrong it right.

477
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:35,540
Speaker 1: But then he goes on and he's like really I'm not saying that pi is not irrational I'm not saying pi is not transcended and I'm not saying the numerical calculation of pi is incorrect.

478
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:49,523
Speaker 1: What he's saying is that instead, you know pi Should mean two pi it should be three is six point two, whatever whatever and not three point one, whatever whatever right and I can.

479
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:53,060
Speaker 1: at first I was like, ah, that sounds good to me.

480
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:03,240
Speaker 1: but then on second thought I was like that doesn't sound good to me because All right You know if you take pi and multiply it by I you get a crazy fucked up number.

481
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:11,300
Speaker 1: And then if you take e a crazy fucked up number to that power you get negative one, which is awesome Which is amazing.

482
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,984
Speaker 1: the I Two pi, you know what that is, huh?

483
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:20,329
Speaker 1: One.

484
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,876
Speaker 1: No, so that turned me back around.

485
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,100
Speaker 1: I was like, oh it should be two.

486
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,143
Speaker 0: What about radians?

487
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:26,809
Speaker 0: What about the radius based math?

488
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,294
Speaker 1: Well, that's just the thing right?

489
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:31,145
Speaker 0: It's like I are squared That's true.

490
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:33,280
Speaker 1: But if you think about it, right you have a circle, right?

491
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,139
Speaker 1: So a circle is two pi right and half the circle is one pi.

492
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:52,193
Speaker 1: So if we had the whole circle if we switch if we replaced pi with two pi So right then a quarter of the circle would be 1/4 pi and a half a circle would be 1/2 pi and a 3/4 of a circle would be 3/4 pi.

493
00:27:52,294 --> 00:27:57,639
Speaker 1: and that would actually be like Yeah, kind of makes more sense and it would be easier to teach kids.

494
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,570
Speaker 0: Would it be really easier to teach kids though?

495
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it would be.

496
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,322
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

497
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,305
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm sorry.

498
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:10,300
Speaker 1: I think I'm sort of liking the 2 pi but I'm also not completely liking the 2 pi.

499
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,467
Speaker 1: You know, it's like no.

500
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:12,888
Speaker 1: Yes.

501
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,603
Speaker 0: No, you know, this is one of those rare situations where I think a forum poll Is the best way to go.

502
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:23,420
Speaker 1: that should we replace pi with two pi so that you know pi better is high.

503
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:34,312
Speaker 1: No longer means three point one four one five nine, but it now means six point two eight three Sign three point one four one five nine pi I times three.

504
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:34,774
Speaker 0: Let's go.

505
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,095
Speaker 0: Let's go.

506
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,220
Speaker 0: We totally stole this from MIT.

507
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

508
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,911
Speaker 0: so This is just beautiful because we talk a lot or at least.

509
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:47,028
Speaker 0: we used to talk a lot about fonts and how people don't put Enough thought into typography.

510
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:51,700
Speaker 1: I try to put thought into photography, but I don't Typography, but I don't know shit about it.

511
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,395
Speaker 1: So I fuck it up.

512
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:57,460
Speaker 0: But in general like good fonts can make an already good thing look so much better.

513
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,770
Speaker 0: Like it's one of the reasons why Apple stuff just looks.

514
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,240
Speaker 1: they're the only ones who actually care about fonts for reals.

515
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:06,640
Speaker 0: So if a lot of people didn't believe us or they railed on us or they argued with us.

516
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,504
Speaker 0: Behold this picture.

517
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:22,827
Speaker 0: if there is ever a real a rationale for thinking about what font to use this picture epitomizes it in one glorious but related word Would it be Uranus?

518
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,514
Speaker 0: it's some kind of fantasy?

519
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,780
Speaker 1: I love me a Uranus joke.

520
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:28,774
Speaker 0: So the meta moment, I guess we should get into that.

521
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:32,594
Speaker 0: Oh notice I'm not gonna talk about sifma here because geek night doesn't get on.

522
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:36,754
Speaker 1: kinetic on is July 9th and such all right.

523
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:45,277
Speaker 1: so go to Hartford Connecticut And we will be there in charge of panels, and we're doing panels, and it's gonna be crazy.

524
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:45,979
Speaker 1: good nut go nuts.

525
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:46,320
Speaker 1: awesome.

526
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,238
Speaker 1: There's awesome gaming awesome everything.

527
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:55,240
Speaker 1: yep The current book club book selection is the lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch.

528
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:59,152
Speaker 1: It is a fun part of time fantasy ish novel.

529
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,516
Speaker 0: I haven't read it yet Scott did.

530
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:01,840
Speaker 0: I'm ordering on Amazon tonight.

531
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,388
Speaker 1: You don't want me to just lend it to you.

532
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:04,314
Speaker 0: No.

533
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to lend it to me I guess I'm not.

534
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:06,826
Speaker 1: I already read it.

535
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,292
Speaker 0: so all right give it to me.

536
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,196
Speaker 1: save you some money.

537
00:30:09,256 --> 00:30:10,059
Speaker 0: It's like it to me.

538
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right I don't.

539
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:13,648
Speaker 0: we have much other matter.

540
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,960
Speaker 1: No do we have any other matter now?

541
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,672
Speaker 1: We got sex is Labor Day weekend.

542
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:20,280
Speaker 1: Holy shit back Seattle.

543
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,585
Speaker 0: I got the hotel.

544
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:22,508
Speaker 0: we get our plane tickets.

545
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,596
Speaker 1: actually my dad said he would.

546
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:25,700
Speaker 1: he has a zillion miles.

547
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:26,382
Speaker 1: We can't.

548
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:34,750
Speaker 1: he doesn't have any jet blue miles, but we might be able to go for free on a non jet blue, so I mean I would prefer jet blue, but if it's free.

549
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,700
Speaker 1: I would go on a shit airline if it's zero dollars.

550
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:39,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep, so I'll see.

551
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:40,068
Speaker 1: if he can.

552
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:43,280
Speaker 0: you know cuz my experiences with continental are always super nice.

553
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:44,488
Speaker 0: It's just I'm gonna see.

554
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:50,758
Speaker 1: I'm gonna see if there's like a Virgin America Option cuz they have the Wi-Fi and shit, but you can't fly your Lufthansa or anything.

555
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:53,450
Speaker 1: well I don't think Lufthansa goes to Seattle now.

556
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,920
Speaker 1: probably be like us air American air Delta.

557
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,169
Speaker 0: We're not flying us air.

558
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,955
Speaker 0: the odds are those.

559
00:30:57,995 --> 00:30:58,580
Speaker 0: leave us behind.

560
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:00,626
Speaker 0: They've had some trouble lately.

561
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:01,228
Speaker 0: I don't trust him.

562
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,800
Speaker 0: I'll see what I would rather pay than fly us air free.

563
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:07,340
Speaker 1: Well, you know it's a lot of monies to save so I don't care.

564
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:10,676
Speaker 0: I've been fucked by us air three times in my life.

565
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:11,460
Speaker 1: I've been fucked by everyone.

566
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,460
Speaker 0: I've never flown us air and not been fucked by them in some manner.

567
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,830
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll call him and I'll see what the deal is.

568
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,020
Speaker 0: so we'll get some us air or your dad my dad.

569
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can call us air.

570
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:20,690
Speaker 1: We'll see.

571
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,380
Speaker 0: cuz we I want to get the plane tickets early.

572
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,589
Speaker 0: We waited a little too long for the packs.

573
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:25,634
Speaker 0: plane tickets last.

574
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:26,457
Speaker 1: yeah, all right.

575
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,080
Speaker 1: I'll call them.

576
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:29,260
Speaker 0: You guys should go to packs.

577
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:34,580
Speaker 0: We're doing at least a couple of panels and something else secret and awesome.

578
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,620
Speaker 0: That's still in the works that we can't announce yet that we're still working on secret mode.

579
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:40,760
Speaker 0: I was just I was as vague as possible there.

580
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:45,225
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know Any other metas?

581
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,028
Speaker 0: I think that's it.

582
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:48,778
Speaker 0: you stream comes and goes when we feel like it go to front row.

583
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:50,285
Speaker 1: crew calm It's our website.

584
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:52,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, join the forum forums awesome.

585
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,568
Speaker 0: So net neutrality okay, I can't believe.

586
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:57,795
Speaker 0: we we I think we talked.

587
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,600
Speaker 1: we've talked about it on the show enough.

588
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,560
Speaker 1: I think this is sort of a rerun we have own.

589
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:14,272
Speaker 0: We've never done a show about network neutrality and in fact We have only done three shows in the history of geek nights where the word neutrality appears in Any part of the text associated with the episode.

590
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,059
Speaker 1: I feel like we've talked about it so much.

591
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:22,560
Speaker 0: Well if we have we either didn't type it in or your search is broken if it's a rerun.

592
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:26,133
Speaker 1: We've done how many hundreds of episodes without reruns?

593
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:31,553
Speaker 0: so on Monday to December 15th 2008 we had a news about net neutrality.

594
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:31,734
Speaker 0: now.

595
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,500
Speaker 0: No one understands what it means okay?

596
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,987
Speaker 1: What was the main bit in that episode?

597
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,276
Speaker 0: Uh let's see Kindles and things.

598
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:40,911
Speaker 1: well so in this show We did a news about Kindles and things.

599
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:41,596
Speaker 0: well now.

600
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:41,878
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

601
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:43,905
Speaker 1: It's the reverse shows.

602
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:44,327
Speaker 1: come folks.

603
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:45,149
Speaker 0: It's the reverse show.

604
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,192
Speaker 1: reverse show plus.

605
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,115
Speaker 0: that was in December.

606
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:47,958
Speaker 0: so now.

607
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:50,106
Speaker 0: We're in June Six months apart.

608
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:51,471
Speaker 1: all right for us.

609
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,720
Speaker 1: the reverse show inverse geek nights.

610
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:16,794
Speaker 0: Anyway on July 5th 2006 we talked about Google talking about network neutrality as a news and on July 3rd 2006 we made fun of Ted Stevens Because he didn't know what tubes were.

611
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,123
Speaker 0: yes now He knew what tubes were.

612
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,549
Speaker 0: he didn't know what an internet was.

613
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,874
Speaker 1: well apparently didn't know.

614
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,626
Speaker 1: maybe he was right about what an internet Was and wrong about what tubes were.

615
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:24,048
Speaker 1: you don't know.

616
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,619
Speaker 0: maybe maybe he was wrong about both.

617
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,069
Speaker 1: So so a cat is a series of uvulas.

618
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,766
Speaker 1: You obviously don't know what a uvula is.

619
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,804
Speaker 1: Anyway the so net neutralities.

620
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:41,749
Speaker 0: I'm gonna straight up.

621
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:52,389
Speaker 0: This is an issue that see it seems like only technology professionals and even then only a small subset of technology professionals Understand and care about the issue.

622
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:58,062
Speaker 0: now That's key because there are techs who understand it and don't give a shit, and there are people who give a shit But don't understand it.

623
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:11,478
Speaker 0: hmm But I feel like only telecommunications people and then a small subset of other people in the tech world understand it and everyone else Seems to always fall back on arguments about well Where does it say that they have to be neutral?

624
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,447
Speaker 0: and our point is that it doesn't and it should?

625
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:17,420
Speaker 1: well I mean, that's just something that's in general on the internet right.

626
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:22,235
Speaker 1: is that people especially if they're lawyers or lawyer types Right or like D&D types.

627
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:25,125
Speaker 1: You know like law and books with rules in them.

628
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:31,248
Speaker 1: They have a hard time Separating a discussion about what's right and wrong and what's legal and illegal.

629
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,500
Speaker 1: you'd be like I think X is wrong, and they'll be like well.

630
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,110
Speaker 1: Where does it say that X is is illegal?

631
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,590
Speaker 1: I'd be like I didn't say that X is legal or illegal.

632
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,041
Speaker 1: I'm only discussing whether I think it's right or wrong.

633
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:43,868
Speaker 1: What does the law have to do with it?

634
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:44,230
Speaker 1: nothing?

635
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,482
Speaker 1: I mean are we gonna go back to 1920?

636
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,609
Speaker 1: you know and I'm gonna say I?

637
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,387
Speaker 1: Think that you should allow the colored people to sit at Walgreens.

638
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:56,980
Speaker 0: You'd be like Where does it say that the Constitution?

639
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,067
Speaker 1: kind of kind of right people were but you understand.

640
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,529
Speaker 1: my point is that they right.

641
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,174
Speaker 1: so You study.

642
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:05,461
Speaker 1: there's nothing to do with law right and that's part of.

643
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,049
Speaker 1: actually the issue is that there is no law whatsoever.

644
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:13,588
Speaker 1: the internet Is completely unregulated almost completely unregulated and part of this problem is well?

645
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,683
Speaker 1: It's unregulated which is good for us right?

646
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:19,150
Speaker 1: so Wild West we can do the stuff We want to do on the internet freedom.

647
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:25,135
Speaker 1: At the same time the evil businesses can do what they want to do on the internet Which is anti freedom.

648
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:29,550
Speaker 1: so should we make some laws to keep those businesses in line and regulation?

649
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:36,870
Speaker 1: But no that regulation will also take away our freedom, so it's like god There's evil businesses doing things to take away freedom.

650
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:38,093
Speaker 1: How can we stop them?

651
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:42,987
Speaker 1: the only way to stop them for sure is to have the government take away freedom.

652
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:43,770
Speaker 1: It's like no.

653
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:47,150
Speaker 0: And even then you know we say the evil companies.

654
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:56,084
Speaker 0: But I still think that much of the internet if not most of the internet at least you know what people define as the internet Should be pretty much completely unregulated.

655
00:35:56,104 --> 00:36:00,924
Speaker 1: Wild West yeah Because I mean it's only the only companies that are really evil.

656
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:03,893
Speaker 1: right in terms of internets are Companies.

657
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,390
Speaker 1: that for example Cisco right, but it's Cisco evil not to us.

658
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:10,119
Speaker 1: But they're evil that they help China do censorship right.

659
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,490
Speaker 1: and then you also have evil like Time Warner.

660
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:15,498
Speaker 1: They will blow our Comcast.

661
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:18,570
Speaker 1: They will block your torrents and throttle you and that is evil.

662
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,978
Speaker 1: But no one else is really even.

663
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,407
Speaker 1: what about what everyone else on the internet is not evil?

664
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,117
Speaker 0: well Not necessarily evil It's just.

665
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:35,509
Speaker 0: it's evil I'm willing to put up with because the internet has shown me over the years that it Flourishes best when no one has any way to tell anyone else what to do except by force.

666
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:36,192
Speaker 1: yeah But they're not.

667
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:37,296
Speaker 1: eat their own bones.

668
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:39,204
Speaker 1: No one else is evil in a routing way.

669
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:47,992
Speaker 0: well in general Technological solutions solve problems on the internet much more readily than legal solutions Do.

670
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:49,701
Speaker 0: oh yeah because the but the end of then.

671
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,370
Speaker 0: again it shouldn't be this way.

672
00:36:51,410 --> 00:37:01,365
Speaker 0: It's only this way because the law can't keep up and the people who make the laws Often have a vested interest or a secondary vested interest by way or no knowledge in maintaining.

673
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:06,480
Speaker 0: and But the part when we say net neutrality.

674
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,370
Speaker 0: when I say net neutrality, I mean we're technology professionals.

675
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:14,013
Speaker 0: I'm a senior engineer in the financial sector in telecommunications Fancy.

676
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:18,247
Speaker 0: yeah, like you know it's like I don't make too much of it, but we're professionals like.

677
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:19,290
Speaker 0: this is our professional opinion.

678
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,227
Speaker 0: This isn't like when we talk about any other topic when we're just two guys like.

679
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:23,950
Speaker 0: we talk about anime.

680
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:24,913
Speaker 0: We like anime.

681
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:25,996
Speaker 0: we talk about anime a lot.

682
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:27,480
Speaker 0: We don't make it.

683
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:28,764
Speaker 0: We do anime panels.

684
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:32,874
Speaker 0: We but we're not like Industry professionals.

685
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:41,548
Speaker 0: really when it comes to anime we talk out of our asses a lot And again we talk more out of our asses the further from our realms of professionalism that we get.

686
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:42,932
Speaker 0: we talk about Astrophysics.

687
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:43,876
Speaker 0: you all have seen the results.

688
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:53,250
Speaker 0: Oh you use your appeal to authority over not quite okay, but in my Technology professionalistic opinion, I guess I meant to say technologically professional opinion.

689
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:56,201
Speaker 0: We need network neutrality.

690
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:57,586
Speaker 0: You know not network neutrality.

691
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:58,610
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the internet.

692
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:05,748
Speaker 0: We don't need like neutrality on the internet and this ephemeral thing because the internet is just a series of interconnected internet works.

693
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:18,390
Speaker 0: We need neutrality on the base plane the actual like low-level network the stuff that connects stuff all the glue of the internet Should be neutral should be dumb At least dumb in terms of the content.

694
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:27,198
Speaker 0: It should be a hundred percent agnostic to the content going over it and it should just be a kind of vast plane or us Wild west people ride across and shoot Buffalo.

695
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:30,570
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and anything less than that is a recipe for disaster.

696
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:32,862
Speaker 1: I mean the whole issue started right where.

697
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:36,789
Speaker 1: basically, you know We pay your ISP, right?

698
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:42,172
Speaker 1: You pay your ISP to get a connection to the internet and you give lay a flat rate for unlimited or in some countries Bet.

699
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:45,210
Speaker 1: you pay for a certain amount of bandwidth depending on where you are.

700
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,990
Speaker 1: Maybe you pay for more speed or who knows what and you're connected and when you're connected you can go to any website.

701
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,460
Speaker 1: You know, you can do anything.

702
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,515
Speaker 1: you can go to any RSC server You can.

703
00:38:53,838 --> 00:39:00,270
Speaker 1: you can route your pat You can send any packet to any IP address and any packet they send back to you will get to you unless you're in China.

704
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,788
Speaker 0: Now they can choose not to listen to you.

705
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:02,630
Speaker 0: That's fine.

706
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:09,755
Speaker 1: and those Pat and all the routers in between you and them will make a you know a best effort to get those packets to You as quickly as possible.

707
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:10,598
Speaker 0: and they have to.

708
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,273
Speaker 0: yes, the middle should have to deliver messages Now.

709
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:20,694
Speaker 0: it does get tricky really because there are situations where temporarily for the greater good of a network Someone would want to.

710
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,762
Speaker 1: that's not that you know, it's not a best.

711
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:24,570
Speaker 1: It's a best effort right if it's broken?

712
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:25,779
Speaker 1: Well, I made my best effort.

713
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:26,222
Speaker 1: It's broken.

714
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:28,233
Speaker 1: I couldn't do it So it didn't happen.

715
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:32,366
Speaker 1: but the issue started where some of the ISP said hey look at this.

716
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:38,050
Speaker 1: right on this side We got customers connecting and paying us to go to send their packets on our networks.

717
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:43,190
Speaker 1: But on the other side Google is sending packets over our networks and they're not paying us anything.

718
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,790
Speaker 1: So anyone who sends a packet over our network, they got to pay and that was what they said in the first.

719
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,538
Speaker 1: That was their original Instigation of this issue.

720
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,110
Speaker 0: now there already is a lot of paying.

721
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:52,875
Speaker 0: I mean the internet.

722
00:39:53,297 --> 00:40:04,010
Speaker 0: we people like to think of it as a big web, you know the internet routes around trouble but really Most of the traffic flows in the United States and flows through a very small number of very important nodes and data centers.

723
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there's a big old sprint link.

724
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,855
Speaker 1: That's like this gigantic, you know, five The internet.

725
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:18,790
Speaker 0: there's a difference between an internet lowercase I and the internet uppercase I. The internet is composed of a bunch of networks that all connect to each other and internet works.

726
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:23,789
Speaker 0: So someone owns like a big network and some you know packets have to get from Google to me.

727
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:34,456
Speaker 0: They might go through Joe's network or Bob's network and the internet only works because Joe and Bob Agree to let anything that comes in from networks They're connected to through.

728
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:35,701
Speaker 0: but it was a turn.

729
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:38,090
Speaker 0: they can send anything they want to send through everyone else's network.

730
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,109
Speaker 1: There's a great talk I think it might have been a TED talk where this guy goes up and he's like who is hitchhiked in their lives.

731
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:43,832
Speaker 1: and they Were old people.

732
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:47,343
Speaker 1: so they raised their hands like who's hitchhiked recently and Nova almost nobody.

733
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:49,730
Speaker 1: and he's like who would hitch who would hitchhike?

734
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:50,857
Speaker 1: And almost nobody.

735
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:54,443
Speaker 1: so he's like, alright So the thing is on the internet.

736
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:55,310
Speaker 1: you hitchhike every day.

737
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:00,950
Speaker 1: You basically hand off your packets to someone and then you trust someone else with your packets and you trust that they're gonna get them.

738
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:04,062
Speaker 1: That's like just taking your mail out to the street.

739
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,448
Speaker 1: some cars are driving by.

740
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:10,998
Speaker 1: you say hey, man You want to take this to Texas for me and they say I'm not going to Texas But I'll hand it to some other car.

741
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:17,120
Speaker 1: I want to get close close to Texas as I'm gonna get You know and eventually your letter gets to Texas.

742
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:19,730
Speaker 1: and you know in the real world, would your letter get to Texas?

743
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:20,654
Speaker 1: Probably not.

744
00:41:20,674 --> 00:41:21,240
Speaker 1: Would you do that?

745
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,785
Speaker 1: Probably not.

746
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,396
Speaker 1: in the internet It's the only internet.

747
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:25,750
Speaker 1: everything you do is exactly like that and it works.

748
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:32,530
Speaker 0: But the only reason things get there is because by and large everyone in between is not a jerk and not a dumbass.

749
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:47,190
Speaker 1: Yep Now people if we lose sometimes in someone's a dumbass you get trouble like when Pakistan screwed YouTube But or when your packets come back to you Right, and sometimes someone's a jerk like when China blocks everything.

750
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,990
Speaker 0: Now we can't talk about the rest of the world.

751
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,453
Speaker 0: We can really.

752
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:53,490
Speaker 0: you know net neutrality right now is an issue only in the United States.

753
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:55,530
Speaker 0: We live in the United States the rest of the world.

754
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,369
Speaker 0: You have to have your own debates as to what your society wants its internet to be.

755
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:00,276
Speaker 0: But we have the biggest internet.

756
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,485
Speaker 1: we have all the Internet's most of it.

757
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:03,488
Speaker 1: Most of the internet.

758
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:06,820
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so it's this is that we invented the internet.

759
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:25,810
Speaker 0: We're really only talking about like internal to the US but I really like Cellphone providers are the worst example of this because they already violate all sorts of these principles and I feel like really data Communication infrastructure is as important as electrical infrastructure and water infrastructure in the modern industrialized world.

760
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:32,050
Speaker 0: Yeah Pretty much stream of data coming into my house right now has more impact on my life than the water and the electricity.

761
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,610
Speaker 0: Well, I need the electricity to get the data, but I could use my laptop for quite some time and still get internet.

762
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but the thing is need electricity for your router to work.

763
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,390
Speaker 0: I could plug it into my UPS.

764
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,801
Speaker 0: I like eight hours.

765
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:44,346
Speaker 1: There you go.

766
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:48,089
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I use the internet in beacon a couple times when the power was out.

767
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:51,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I know the files equipment beyond the router is all UPS.

768
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,870
Speaker 0: There's a giant battery in my closet.

769
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:59,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has to be because there's a law that says because it's 9-1-1 because files is also telephone Yep, so they battery that shit up.

770
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:06,990
Speaker 0: But the cell phone providers like for example, all right It's just data and I've ever all the data we're sending around is just data.

771
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:10,710
Speaker 0: But then they said you know what we're gonna treat some data differently from other data.

772
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:12,077
Speaker 0: We're gonna let it be free.

773
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:19,410
Speaker 0: if you send voice data to people on our network We're gonna make you pay minutes if you send voice data to people outside of our network.

774
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,459
Speaker 0: Mmm, and we don't stand for that bullshit on the internet.

775
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,383
Speaker 0: So why do we accept?

776
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think you know, I go to a website.

777
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,714
Speaker 1: Well, this is a Time Warner website.

778
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:27,336
Speaker 1: So it's free.

779
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:29,803
Speaker 1: Oh you visited a website that was on.

780
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:33,959
Speaker 1: you know, someone was on Comcast with that Website, so we're gonna charge you money.

781
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:35,650
Speaker 1: They don't do that shit there.

782
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,518
Speaker 1: I would never get away with that in a million years.

783
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:40,430
Speaker 1: All right, but how did they get away with it on cell phone?

784
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:47,458
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of it is that because the internet is much more open and there's so much room to move around That a lot of interesting things were happening.

785
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:52,498
Speaker 1: So rapidly devolved so rapidly and it's like the you know, you think oh What's the difference with the cell phone carriers?

786
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:54,406
Speaker 1: Well, they have the last mile thing.

787
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,350
Speaker 1: They own all these towers.

788
00:43:55,731 --> 00:44:02,723
Speaker 1: Uh, the cable guys have just as much of a Napoli on the last mile as the cell phone guys do In fact, a lot of the times of the same exact guys.

789
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:03,750
Speaker 1: Verizon, right?

790
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,833
Speaker 0: The thing is we're luck where the only reason things work now is that we're lucky that the last mile providers have not decided to Be jerks yet.

791
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:12,730
Speaker 0: Yep, but some of them have and some of them want to yep.

792
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:29,530
Speaker 0: And I just I feel very strongly that we need a completely open completely dumb at least in terms of the idea of what is being transported over the networks like baseline infrastructure and ISPs that are last mile like, you know, I get my internet from Verizon.

793
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:33,715
Speaker 0: They should be subject to very strenuous Regulation to prevent them.

794
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:44,264
Speaker 1: the thing is if we if we open up the doors to allow them to be regulated Then you open up the doors to bad regulation of you know The government is gonna decide some regulation and then we're not going to be able to.

795
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:48,482
Speaker 1: there'll be some technological solution But we can't do it because the government regulation conflicts with it.

796
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,019
Speaker 1: and then how it's gonna be Terrible.

797
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,850
Speaker 1: see me the worst thing ever.

798
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:59,878
Speaker 0: well part of this is a situation of a lot of the people who are afraid of a collapse of net neutrality are all afraid of Different things even though not all those things are equally likely.

799
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:06,658
Speaker 0: and the industry people who might not want net neutrality or might want it Also all have very different motivations.

800
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:13,649
Speaker 0: some people don't want regulation so that they can be evil because they're not regulated and some people don't Want regulation because they're being evil and regulation would stop them.

801
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:18,544
Speaker 0: Yep, and I generally don't trust the FCC that much to be perfectly honest.

802
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:29,850
Speaker 1: We just we need some way to like Guaranteed freedom without opening up the door to any badness and it's interesting You know guaranteeing freedom because look at a whole a wholly separate debate.

803
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,910
Speaker 0: That is still very important and a lot of people conflate piracy with this even though it's not really true.

804
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:42,880
Speaker 0: but in the Napster days and when you know people started sharing media on a Massive scale the fight wasn't really.

805
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,770
Speaker 0: don't let them pirate or I'll be our business will disappear.

806
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:56,510
Speaker 0: The fight was don't let them have the ability to share information easily with each other Because eventually they'll start making content on their own and giving it to each other for free and destroy us.

807
00:45:56,951 --> 00:46:01,588
Speaker 0: The piracy wasn't what the industry is really really afraid of and a lot of like real networks.

808
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:08,370
Speaker 0: back in the day They were pretty much pushing for lockdown computers not to stop piracy like that was the the stated goal.

809
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:13,508
Speaker 0: But really it was more the idea that lockdown computers make it more difficult for you to be a publisher on your own.

810
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,449
Speaker 1: Apple Apple gives you some tools of production.

811
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:19,117
Speaker 0: We're seeing this now in a lot of industry.

812
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:19,579
Speaker 0: like the anime.

813
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,110
Speaker 0: industry is being crushed not by piracy anymore.

814
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,010
Speaker 0: If all the piracy disappeared, no one's gonna buy DVDs.

815
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:29,991
Speaker 0: They're crushed by the fact that there's so much totally legal free stuff out there that no one's willing to pay There's.

816
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:32,850
Speaker 1: so you never see us using like a real movie is the thing of the day.

817
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,122
Speaker 1: It's always some YouTube movie and that's what we entertain ourselves.

818
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:38,190
Speaker 1: You know, it's never a TV show, right?

819
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:50,521
Speaker 1: It's always something some guy made on the internet just like it tonight something some guy made on the internet Which you are listening to as opposed to listening to you know Howard Stern or some other radio thing you could be listening to.

820
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:58,034
Speaker 0: I personally don't pirate any media because I have enough free media to Keep me happy for most of the rest of my life already and what little I can't get free I buy.

821
00:46:58,355 --> 00:47:02,129
Speaker 0: but other than that everything else that I don't buy it's not like I would have bought it.

822
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:09,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, right nothing Nothing, no force in the world could make me buy it except I guess if YouTube disappeared I might have to start buying media again for a little while.

823
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:10,314
Speaker 1: I mean like.

824
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:17,099
Speaker 1: I pirate like almost nothing but anything that I download Legally or illegally for without paying money.

825
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:24,930
Speaker 1: if there wasn't a way to get it for free I just wouldn't get it and that would be that there I would not pay for any more than what I already pay for.

826
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,256
Speaker 1: I'm already buying the.

827
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:29,450
Speaker 1: I'm already spending the maximum amount of money that I would spend on entertainment media.

828
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:39,090
Speaker 0: Now the interesting thing is that a lot of people who are afraid of that nurture of anti I like their for net neutrality are afraid of like bandwidth caps and things like that and I think bandwidth caps are shit.

829
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:50,590
Speaker 0: but at the same time this whole unlimited data idea is basically Pointless and stupid and it's collapsing now that more and more people are savvy and actually using that data.

830
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:53,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think this it's sort of a weird issue.

831
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:54,570
Speaker 1: right because think about this, right?

832
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,387
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you we should have some sort of metering.

833
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:01,262
Speaker 1: right, you know If you use more bandwidth, you should pay more.

834
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:02,810
Speaker 1: right that's pretty obvious.

835
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:07,490
Speaker 1: But the problem is is that there is sort of infinite bandwidth.

836
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:11,790
Speaker 1: It's not a matter of how much bandwidth total use like oh I used a gigabyte.

837
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:16,130
Speaker 1: It's bandwidth that is available at any given nanosecond.

838
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:20,765
Speaker 0: How much electricity is available right now, what's the peak load?

839
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:24,098
Speaker 0: that's why you know They like you can have peak rates for electricity.

840
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:29,777
Speaker 0: you pay more for electricity on the hot fucking day at 4 o'clock Than you do at the cold part of the day.

841
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:33,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing is we just need electricity has reasonable rates.

842
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,670
Speaker 1: Right, my electric bills like about 50 bucks, you know, it's not and that's what they're conditioning going on.

843
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,430
Speaker 1: It's 40 bucks when there's no air conditioning.

844
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:40,998
Speaker 1: So it's it.

845
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:43,070
Speaker 1: that's a reasonable rate, you know.

846
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:52,759
Speaker 1: So if my bandwidth right the problem is is everyone who's every suggested tier or metering plan is Always an incredibly unreasonable rate.

847
00:48:52,819 --> 00:48:55,530
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah, we could charge you like a fucking dollar a gigabyte.

848
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,357
Speaker 1: It's like I know that's a way too much money.

849
00:48:57,537 --> 00:49:01,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was a reasonable rate then who would complain?

850
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,721
Speaker 1: Oh, it's gonna be ten cents a gigabyte.

851
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:09,802
Speaker 0: Oh and it's actually perfectly Okay, these current unlimited like this whole unlimited idea just brings out the fact.

852
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:14,365
Speaker 0: that's true in every realm of the world where people overestimate their own contributions.

853
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:20,250
Speaker 0: more importantly They underestimate what things really cost and they pay their 70 bucks a month or 50 bucks a month and get unlimited.

854
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:25,510
Speaker 0: But it's unlimited with a tiny asterisk that basically says it's not unlimited will cut you off at any time for any reason.

855
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:41,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would much rather, you know, the only problem I have with the unlimited is that it's false advertising, you know I would be much happier with a fair rate because you know What I could do is I could you know, I could manage my internetting to save monies, you know Which is which is a good thing.

856
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:48,068
Speaker 0: But here's why at least I think a lot of the people who are against net neutrality like the people who are lobbying Against it straight up don't want it.

857
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,495
Speaker 0: It's because they.

858
00:49:50,736 --> 00:49:57,697
Speaker 0: the world where everyone has high bandwidth is one the world where people pirate things on grander and grander Scales, but whatever.

859
00:49:57,918 --> 00:50:00,370
Speaker 1: Well, they want to do stuff like the world where YouTube exists.

860
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:01,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the world word.

861
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:08,503
Speaker 0: I can just watch video on the internet and it's a world where ESPN could get to the point where they could say You know what?

862
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,630
Speaker 0: Cable companies pay us a million dollars that we just won't give you our cable anymore because we don't care.

863
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,850
Speaker 0: We're just gonna publish it on ESPN comm and charge people five bucks a month to just watch it.

864
00:50:19,072 --> 00:50:24,553
Speaker 0: Imagine if someday, you know in the far future Imagine when ESPN gets to that point where they're just you know What it's a website.

865
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:29,530
Speaker 0: you pay a subscription fee and you have unlimited access to all the ESPN sports on your computer.

866
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:32,578
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, the problem is is they couldn't.

867
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:41,150
Speaker 1: you know all the sports that they show they have contracts with the people all Those you know, the the leagues inside the leagues got the leagues have to go for it and the whole or so.

868
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,662
Speaker 0: Oh, so far farther future major league baseball decides, you know what?

869
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:49,616
Speaker 0: Let's just cut out every middleman They already have.

870
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:51,062
Speaker 1: you can pay to get that.

871
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:55,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's starting already But they still like a charge way too much money for it.

872
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's cuz.

873
00:50:56,272 --> 00:50:56,774
Speaker 0: they don't get it.

874
00:50:56,934 --> 00:51:05,369
Speaker 0: and because it's still too soon for the average person to have their internet TV It's too complicated for the average person to plug a computer into their TV.

875
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,139
Speaker 0: But think about how afraid of all this the industry is.

876
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,570
Speaker 0: remember when they prevented Hulu from being able to be watched on boxy.

877
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:15,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe you know right now everyone wants like a la carte cable, right like cable company.

878
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:20,030
Speaker 1: I tell you I want these three channels and I should only pay three dollars because each channel is one dollar.

879
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:20,673
Speaker 0: What is that?

880
00:51:20,693 --> 00:51:21,256
Speaker 0: What would happen?

881
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:24,450
Speaker 1: What if the channel just said screw you cable company instead?

882
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:31,289
Speaker 1: We're gonna just go on the Internet's and our channel will only be on the Internet's and it'll be a dollar a month and then It'll basically be all a cart.

883
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,100
Speaker 1: But the cable company doesn't get any part of that dollar.

884
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,228
Speaker 1: think about only the channel against that dollar.

885
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:37,112
Speaker 0: this market This is.

886
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:40,649
Speaker 1: but you guys thought to pay the cable company for internet access because they're the ISP.

887
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:49,510
Speaker 0: But that's when the cable company says things like oh Well, alright, we'll launch our own competing service for blah and we won't let you have access to the other blah.

888
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,770
Speaker 0: You can't go to mlv.com directly Because you're stealing our bandwidth.

889
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:57,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, or what if mlb.com makes a deal with?

890
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,905
Speaker 0: Comcast is only Comcast.

891
00:51:58,926 --> 00:51:59,909
Speaker 0: people can get mlb.

892
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:02,506
Speaker 1: Well, that's what ESPN has right now, right?

893
00:52:02,546 --> 00:52:03,110
Speaker 0: It's bullshit.

894
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,370
Speaker 0: I have it free with Fios.

895
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:05,454
Speaker 0: But I'm got.

896
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:12,523
Speaker 0: I'm morally opposed to the principle that because my IP is X I'm allowed to watch this service, but no one else is.

897
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:13,689
Speaker 1: well because you know, right.

898
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:16,124
Speaker 1: so Verizon gave right.

899
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:16,790
Speaker 1: good luck, right?

900
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:22,730
Speaker 1: So let's say Verizon wants to have Comedy Central on Fios right cable TV.

901
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:27,767
Speaker 1: They give Comedy Central money and then Comedy Central appears on right whatever.

902
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,656
Speaker 1: and you know The HBO and stuff works the same way.

903
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:32,020
Speaker 1: only it costs so much money.

904
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,170
Speaker 1: They make you pay right, you know to get HBO on there.

905
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:43,190
Speaker 1: So imagine if right you got a website and now, you know some ISPs decide to pay that website.

906
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:47,658
Speaker 1: So you only get Google if AT&T decides to give Google money.

907
00:52:47,718 --> 00:52:48,239
Speaker 1: other what you know.

908
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:48,680
Speaker 1: good, you know.

909
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:57,173
Speaker 1: The net neutrality people were originally worried about was Comcast saying haha, we're gonna block Google unless Google gives us money.

910
00:52:57,213 --> 00:52:58,356
Speaker 1: Well think about this.

911
00:52:58,396 --> 00:53:02,772
Speaker 1: Google says, haha We're gonna block Comcast unless Comcast gives us money.

912
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,580
Speaker 1: No Comcast people can search on Google.

913
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:08,359
Speaker 1: So unless Comcast gives us money, that's a nuclear war.

914
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:11,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody's you know worried about that issue yet.

915
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,920
Speaker 1: But that could happen and that you know.

916
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,680
Speaker 1: It might not be part of the net neutrality as people have been discussing it because the cable companies were the first dicks.

917
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:20,888
Speaker 1: And the I think in the websites aren't.

918
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,800
Speaker 1: have not the dicks that came have not been the dicks yet.

919
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:26,354
Speaker 1: But ESPN 3 is the first website.

920
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:27,319
Speaker 1: dick, right?

921
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,979
Speaker 0: So it's well, I would argue that the first website dick came about about a day after.

922
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:36,020
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is that they're you know, alright, it's the same issue.

923
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,045
Speaker 1: Well think of it.

924
00:53:37,165 --> 00:53:40,060
Speaker 1: you make a website you have to let everyone in the world visit that website.

925
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:41,480
Speaker 1: That's what that's what's right.

926
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:47,160
Speaker 0: Well, you know all those scenarios are basically the like the worst case like oh shit crazy disasters scenarios.

927
00:53:47,661 --> 00:54:05,819
Speaker 0: But the real problem comes down to the idea of a conflict of interests and that if you give the people who control the last mile infrastructure Also the ability to negotiate content deals So they have a hand in the content cookie jar and a hand in the last mile infrastructure cookie jar.

928
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:09,994
Speaker 0: Even if they are they they decide to be good guys and they are good guys.

929
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:17,800
Speaker 0: The conflict of interest is Insurmountable and it is unconscionable that we should allow such a just a gross conflict of interest to exist.

930
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:22,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we don't let the company's Trying to leave a good example.

931
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:23,750
Speaker 0: that would make sense to all of you.

932
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,640
Speaker 0: All my examples are other technology things?

933
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:33,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, no I mean, I think the you know I think the best solution that we put your in your newspaper carriers the people who don't.

934
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:37,641
Speaker 0: Here's the analogy for the people born before 1940.

935
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:49,220
Speaker 0: If you let the companies that deliver the newspapers to the people's houses Also own a share of the newspapers thus having editorial control over the newspaper that the people receive.

936
00:54:49,962 --> 00:54:52,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, the newspaper delivery boy doesn't like this article on the front page.

937
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,839
Speaker 1: So he gets a scissor and he cuts it out and he delivers it.

938
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you want to get that article, well, you got to pay some money.

939
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,160
Speaker 1: Maybe you won't cut your newspaper.

940
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:03,631
Speaker 0: Yeah Never mind the fact that a lot of local ISPs have straight-up monopolies.

941
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:04,775
Speaker 1: or maybe like this.

942
00:55:04,856 --> 00:55:06,446
Speaker 1: or maybe the New York Times says You know what?

943
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:07,240
Speaker 1: We don't like Queens.

944
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:13,984
Speaker 1: We're gonna deliver this nice awesome full paper with a hundred pages to Manhattan and we're gonna deliver half as much Pages to Queens.

945
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,249
Speaker 1: Queens you for the same price.

946
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,320
Speaker 1: you get half as many pages because we don't like the delivery company over there.

947
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:23,790
Speaker 1: They're jerks they you know, and if they give us money or if you give us more money Then we'll send you this the Manhattan paper.

948
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:32,520
Speaker 0: So really in the end Data transport at the last mile level and at the high level ISP level I think should by law be data agnostic.

949
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:37,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean really that's the long short of it and the last mile providers should not.

950
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:39,260
Speaker 0: this is just my straight-up opinion.

951
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:44,539
Speaker 0: They should not be able by law to have content production.

952
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:50,219
Speaker 0: I guess they shouldn't be able to have a hand in the content production cookie jar and simultaneously be an ISP.

953
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,370
Speaker 0: They should have to be two separate companies.

954
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,190
Speaker 1: I think you just need to make an I as you know ISPs into a utility like electricity.

955
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:03,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know just the just the consumer ISPs, you know You don't need to regulate so much the middle parts, right?

956
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,280
Speaker 1: Because those you know with the peering agreements and all that stuff is really self-regulating at least for now.

957
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,064
Speaker 0: No to a degree.

958
00:56:09,184 --> 00:56:10,632
Speaker 0: every now and then they have a.

959
00:56:10,793 --> 00:56:12,200
Speaker 1: every now and then there's two jerks.

960
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:20,420
Speaker 1: But you know what those you know, the two jerks everything just routed around the jerks And it's not actually no for large portions of the world like Google stops working and things.

961
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,680
Speaker 1: Well, I mean this you know, it's stuff like Australia right where they only have one in the u.s.

962
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:34,133
Speaker 0: Like there was a situation a few months ago where half our customers, you know, but where I work They just like lost half their internet access because of one of these peering slap fights.

963
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:36,280
Speaker 0: really this happens more often than you'd think.

964
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:40,032
Speaker 0: It's not super obvious But you go to YouTube and it's down.

965
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:41,019
Speaker 0: you think I YouTube's down.

966
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:43,551
Speaker 0: That might have been a slap fight that you didn't know about.

967
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:44,938
Speaker 1: Oh, we gotta stop those slap fights.

968
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:49,190
Speaker 0: Yes alright, but like Part of the reason why there's so much fun.

969
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,780
Speaker 0: I was gonna say this before we got sidetracked.

970
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,447
Speaker 0: You're talking about the alicard cable, right?

971
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:55,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so think about all the hands in this cookie jar.

972
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,669
Speaker 0: So, why do we have the current like structure?

973
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,071
Speaker 0: the way we do?

974
00:56:58,131 --> 00:57:00,240
Speaker 0: you pay like 50 bucks a month to get you know?

975
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:08,340
Speaker 0: The whatever cable package and you can't get basic cable because it has a million channels But it doesn't have like Comedy Central the one channel you wanted or sippy.

976
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:11,430
Speaker 0: so alright you got to get the advanced package for 20 bucks more a month.

977
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:15,884
Speaker 0: that gives you like the three channels you wanted and There's like a thousand other channels.

978
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:20,899
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit about like the like BET or lifetime and you're paying for them.

979
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,984
Speaker 1: Right, it's like right now.

980
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:22,989
Speaker 1: Let's see your files cut.

981
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:25,020
Speaker 0: Well, are you really paying for them?

982
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:28,200
Speaker 1: Yeah indirect, you know the cable companies giving money to those channels.

983
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,448
Speaker 0: It's probably more complex than that.

984
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:33,840
Speaker 0: a lot of times those channels are paying the cable.

985
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,315
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's like if it's a QVC situation not even just QVC.

986
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:49,175
Speaker 0: a lot of those channels Only are watched or only exist in packages because they can sell based on number of subscribers to Advertisers and weird stuff like that and those channels.

987
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:55,180
Speaker 0: if you have to choose alicard I'd argue that 80% of the cable channels that exist would have less than a hundred subscribers.

988
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:56,788
Speaker 1: Well also think about this right?

989
00:57:56,829 --> 00:57:57,211
Speaker 1: there's the.

990
00:57:57,231 --> 00:57:58,980
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of TV production companies.

991
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,280
Speaker 1: They produce TV shows like crappy like traveling shows and shit like that right that almost nobody watches.

992
00:58:04,622 --> 00:58:07,460
Speaker 1: But they sell those shows to these channels, right?

993
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:10,234
Speaker 1: I remember when like my parents first got the HD TV, right?

994
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,383
Speaker 1: There was a channel.

995
00:58:12,464 --> 00:58:16,863
Speaker 1: that was the HD channel and all it was is like HD video of nature And that's all.

996
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:26,186
Speaker 1: it was like someone had just taken an HD camera out into the woods just to make content to have a channel to show off HD TVs and No one watched that.

997
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:28,860
Speaker 1: no one would pay even a penny for that channel, right?

998
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,160
Speaker 1: Maybe someone would pay it when HD TV first came out to like be a demo guy if it was the only HD channel.

999
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:40,647
Speaker 1: But no one else no one would you know continue to pay for it month after month unless they were just stupid rich and they weren't Paying attention to who knows what.

1000
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:42,720
Speaker 1: but it would make almost no money.

1001
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,480
Speaker 1: But whoever produced that video sold that video to that channel, right?

1002
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,232
Speaker 1: It wasn't the same.

1003
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:50,050
Speaker 1: for you know The company the production company and the channel are not the same.

1004
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:51,796
Speaker 1: and then they don't.

1005
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:56,640
Speaker 1: they don't have they don't worry They don't care about the production company that made the show doesn't give a shit if no one watches it.

1006
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:57,697
Speaker 1: They got their money.

1007
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:07,219
Speaker 1: So there's tons of TV production studios out there that make shows sell them and if the show does well They're happy because they can sell the show another season and that's good for them.

1008
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:11,391
Speaker 1: But if the show doesn't do well They just make another show and they'll try to sell that.

1009
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:13,701
Speaker 1: and they'll make another show and try to sell that until they get A hit.

1010
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:19,880
Speaker 1: and as long as they keep selling that first season or you know, the first show they're still doing all right.

1011
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,129
Speaker 1: They're not doing great, but they're doing.

1012
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:22,719
Speaker 1: they're in business because they're selling a show.

1013
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:25,617
Speaker 1: They only fail if they make a show and no channels buy it.

1014
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:32,013
Speaker 1: So if these channels go away No one's gonna buy these shows and those production companies are gonna go away.

1015
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:34,882
Speaker 1: and is you be huge huge You know.

1016
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:41,380
Speaker 1: disaster in the TV arena and we know that like the TV arena there was a writers strike recently, right?

1017
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:43,259
Speaker 1: So all these unions and shit.

1018
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,223
Speaker 1: Oh, it's gonna be.

1019
00:59:44,383 --> 00:59:49,560
Speaker 0: it's gonna be devastating and the channels to all those little small channels that no one watches would either disappear.

1020
00:59:49,721 --> 01:00:01,728
Speaker 0: they they have a vested interest in keeping non a la carte cable and preventing that neutrality so that they can then make deals to where you know, basically you pay for Comcast Internet and Lifetime is included.

1021
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:07,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know those production companies Their only option is gonna be either go out of business and get a go to get a real job.

1022
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:09,609
Speaker 1: No our job somewhere else.

1023
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:11,960
Speaker 1: then, you know, that's a real job making TV shows.

1024
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:18,326
Speaker 1: but it is if they or make TV shows and put them on YouTube and hope the fuck that people watch them and they're actually Good.

1025
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:23,769
Speaker 1: Yeah right, which Most of those shows no one's gonna watch.

1026
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:26,560
Speaker 0: and then don't forget the advertisers who are in this.

1027
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:32,660
Speaker 0: It's this whole like gigantic circle of people and they all have such vested interest in actually think it.

1028
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:49,700
Speaker 1: I think it actually might help out in the advertising department because the supply of advertising would go way down and all the people the ad buyers would have a lot less ads to buy and Thus if you actually had something that people were watching then you could actually get a lot more monies for it.

1029
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:56,120
Speaker 1: You know right now right now internet stuff can't get a lot of monies just because they're morons and they getting it way more.

1030
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:59,200
Speaker 1: Better eyeballs on the internet than they get on TV, but they keep buying that.

1031
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,640
Speaker 1: He's paying more for TV and radio than they pay for internet.

1032
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:08,576
Speaker 1: but if the TV disappeared then the things on the internet that actually get visits would suddenly get way valuable.

1033
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:10,979
Speaker 1: and all that crap on the You know the same.

1034
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:20,472
Speaker 1: You know stupid piece-of-shit show that moved from TV to the internet when the crap TV channel disappeared Wouldn't sell any ads because no one watches it and everyone would see that.

1035
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:21,234
Speaker 1: No one watches it.

1036
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:26,000
Speaker 1: and infomercials I don't even know they would be gone which would be a great awesomeness to the world.

1037
01:01:26,702 --> 01:01:28,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course think about the thing is right.

1038
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:31,660
Speaker 1: Look there's still ways to make it within infomercials.

1039
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,866
Speaker 1: Look at the blend guy, right?

1040
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:33,529
Speaker 1: Will it blend?

1041
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:34,675
Speaker 1: That's an infomercial.

1042
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:35,800
Speaker 1: He made it on the internet.

1043
01:01:35,922 --> 01:01:38,727
Speaker 0: That's guys, you know but look that's that that's part of the.

1044
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:50,216
Speaker 0: I think a lot of the people who are against net neutrality are Actually just straight up against the idea that people who create content can provide it to the consumers directly Over their precious tubes,

1045
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:51,965
Speaker 1: you know it comes down to the fact that they

1046
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:53,772
Speaker 0: want to cut of their electricity.

1047
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:59,400
Speaker 0: be like if the electric company wanted a cut of the Fact that I use their electricity to make money by doing a podcast.

1048
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:03,973
Speaker 1: It just goes back to what I always been saying the internet destroys all middlemen.

1049
01:02:03,993 --> 01:02:10,294
Speaker 1: if you're a middleman the internet destroys you because Now the consumer can get directly to the producer and no one needs to be in between.

1050
01:02:10,354 --> 01:02:16,680
Speaker 1: and right now in the time period we're In there are middlemen who are surviving for example Apple Amazon, right?

1051
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:21,220
Speaker 1: These are middlemen who are surviving but the reason they are surviving is not because they're middlemen.

1052
01:02:21,261 --> 01:02:28,840
Speaker 1: It is because they are providing Technology services to both the consumer and the producer because the consumer and the producer are not technologically competent.

1053
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:31,140
Speaker 0: This is what they do the job themselves.

1054
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:38,047
Speaker 0: This is also what middlemen used to do a long time ago when there weren't things like the internet where all right you want to Distribute a book or a movie.

1055
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:45,480
Speaker 1: I can handle the printing and the shipping parts that you could not do on your own because you Don't know about them, but nowadays we can do a lot of those things without those people.

1056
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:45,939
Speaker 0: Yeah

1057
01:02:46,121 --> 01:03:09,589
Speaker 1: so as soon as once producers are Technologically competent enough to not need an Apple to not need an Amazon and consumers are Technologically competent enough to not need an Apple or an Amazon or whoever Then all middlemen will be gone except for the utility providers like electricity water you know Transportation, you know and in convenience

1058
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:13,460
Speaker 0: providers, but only if they can be more convenient than the direct which is possible in some.

1059
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,749
Speaker 1: Well, I mean a convenience provider is a producer, right?

1060
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:24,760
Speaker 1: I mean if I order a comfy chair, that's a convenience provider Producer of products, you know, that's what like shipping aggregators or things like I mean UPS.

1061
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:25,906
Speaker 1: Is that you know shipping?

1062
01:03:26,006 --> 01:03:27,473
Speaker 1: isn't that a utility in my eyes?

1063
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:28,458
Speaker 1: I mean, right?

1064
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:29,863
Speaker 1: It's possible.

1065
01:03:30,366 --> 01:03:31,433
Speaker 1: I can say that a utility.

1066
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,540
Speaker 1: shipping and transportation.
