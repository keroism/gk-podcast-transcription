1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,247
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday June 22nd.

2
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:11,990
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,139
Speaker 1: I'm sky and this is geek night tonight in the year 2011 We talk about anime that we have not seen.

4
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:29,668
Speaker 1: opposite wise Let's do this Awkwardly constructed episode title.

5
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:35,273
Speaker 1: I think you could have come with a better title than I could have but I didn't come up with one And it already started saying the thing.

6
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:42,130
Speaker 0: so yeah Just go back and redo it later, and then this part will make no sense Which is I don't know if I want to do that or not.

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaker 1: I think it's a good meta joke either way anyway.

8
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:56,480
Speaker 1: So you know it's really upsetting a lot of things the fact that you know the Patriot Act got extended The wars in the world poverty obesity yeah sure anyway.

9
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,800
Speaker 0: So this New York Asian film festival is gonna be coming to New York again.

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,950
Speaker 0: Oh, and I think there's one thing that we really wanted as it does every year And they're gonna show something.

11
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:10,500
Speaker 0: that is you know last year There was some cool stuff that I wanted to see like there was was a crazy kaiju thing.

12
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,327
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that was playing it like midnight or something.

13
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:18,843
Speaker 0: It was like it was like kappa death kappa or something like that Something like.

14
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:23,700
Speaker 1: I don't wanted to see that but it was like the kind of thing we would usually go to see it like the 11 o'clock showing at Otacon.

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,933
Speaker 0: It was like a midnight showing and I think Scott Johnson people were over for some reason, but anyway Well, we didn't go see it, but I so this year.

16
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:37,373
Speaker 0: They're showing Basically there's a new anime version of Tezuka's Buddha, or is it live-action.

17
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,176
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,560
Speaker 0: I want to see that so bad.

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,514
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's animated either way.

20
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:54,620
Speaker 0: They're showing it Thursday night and Sunday night Matt lining up right with kinetic on which also lines right up with that my little pony convention.

21
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:58,532
Speaker 0: We could go see it Thursday night, and then leave for kinetic on mutley.

22
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:01,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could but we have responsibilities at the con.

23
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,988
Speaker 0: But it's at 630 so it's actually.

24
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,038
Speaker 0: it's not late Thursday night, so we could go watch it.

25
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:09,958
Speaker 1: 637 All right, so we get on the road at like 9. we get to the kind of like 11 all right all right.

26
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:11,345
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

27
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,658
Speaker 1: a lot of people check in on Thursday stuff to do?

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,951
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, that's the trouble of having responsibilities.

29
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,653
Speaker 0: That's all right.

30
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,255
Speaker 0: Well.

31
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:24,798
Speaker 0: It'll definitely be something We can see at some point in the future by hook or crook.

32
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,580
Speaker 0: But if you are you know I guess this normally would be met a moment.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,233
Speaker 0: But whatever, New York Asian film festival 2011 check it out.

34
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,678
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good stuff to see.

35
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,169
Speaker 0: yeah Kung-fu's etc.

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,280
Speaker 1: so I heard up Spider-Man's dead.

37
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,228
Speaker 0: Hey, Spider-Man's not real.

38
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,032
Speaker 0: so how can he be dead?

39
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 1: well in the comic universe?

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Speaker 1: Well, I thought parker who was Spider-Man Was killed by some but that's only ultimate Spider-Man not regular spider-Man.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
Speaker 1: I didn't realize until I read this article that there was a difference because the guy writing the article was like.

42
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,334
Speaker 1: I thought they were all in the same stupid universe.

43
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:04,720
Speaker 1: then this guy's like oh But in this universe if you die you're really dead and in the other universes you can come back.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,492
Speaker 1: So this is the real deal.

45
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,987
Speaker 0: Spider-Man dead What I don't know.

46
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:09,289
Speaker 0: who's right?

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,560
Speaker 0: basically it for people who don't know right?

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:23,540
Speaker 0: Marvel comics Recognized that there was a problem that people who had not been reading Spider-Man or x-men or whatever for a hundred years had a hard Time getting into these Spider-Man x-men and superhero comics.

49
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,672
Speaker 0: You know that have been going on since the 60s and the 70s.

50
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,715
Speaker 0: so they made some years ago Actually a very long time ago already.

51
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:32,825
Speaker 0: you know Many many years ago.

52
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:40,340
Speaker 0: They made ultimate Spider-Man ultimate x-men ultimate avengers I'll you know actually was called ultimates as opposed to ultimate avengers.

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,429
Speaker 0: They made a whole bunch of ultimate ultimate fantastic four right.

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,074
Speaker 0: and this is these comics.

55
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,960
Speaker 0: these ultimate comics were in their own universe.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,823
Speaker 0: So it's like they made a new universe that nothing to do at all with the old universe and all those comics had the word ultimate on the top.

57
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,355
Speaker 0: so you could just read those and not worry about anything else.

58
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,495
Speaker 0: and if you start at the beginning you'd be all good.

59
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:11,360
Speaker 0: and You know if you can still easily go and acquire all the trades of all those comics and read them from the beginning And it won't be too expensive or take you that long and you won't miss anything, and there's only a couple crossovers

60
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:16,089
Speaker 1: And they only cross over issues in spider-man.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,536
Speaker 0: yeah, they only cross over with themselves right.

62
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:19,720
Speaker 0: so it's not really that big a deal.

63
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,478
Speaker 0: It's all contained in like this little bubble.

64
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:26,500
Speaker 0: So it you know, but the problem was is that they kept that going for so long.

65
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:34,318
Speaker 0: It was actually kind of popular that It eventually itself became too long and too big and and too difficult for people to get into.

66
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:40,620
Speaker 1: so now I've decided that the big it's not comics It's everything nerds like worlds where they can Gandalf girth.

67
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:48,949
Speaker 1: And they like there to be continuity in things like if they read a Star Wars comic And it lines up good enough with the Star Wars movies.

68
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,631
Speaker 1: They love that shit.

69
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:51,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm no exception.

70
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:51,939
Speaker 1: I like things like that.

71
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,608
Speaker 1: Comics like this just take it too far.

72
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:58,185
Speaker 1: you got to leave a lot more gaps and not I don't know I feel like too much.

73
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:02,140
Speaker 1: continuity Hurts all but the hardest of the hardcore nerd.

74
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:08,685
Speaker 0: See the problem isn't necessarily the world building or You know such like that.

75
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,358
Speaker 0: the problem is the linearity and the serial ness of it.

76
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,520
Speaker 0: right for example I could create a world pick a fantasy world forgotten around.

77
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:17,445
Speaker 0: Perfect example.

78
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:21,196
Speaker 0: right I can tell you a story in forgotten realms about drizzet.

79
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:22,660
Speaker 0: He was very popular.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, we pretty much know everything did.

81
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,593
Speaker 1: I can tell you know who drizzed was?

82
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,319
Speaker 0: he was some guy with two swords, right?

83
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,592
Speaker 1: I What race was he?

84
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,828
Speaker 0: I'm gonna guess drow all right.

85
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,517
Speaker 1: Oh, you got that really oh shit.

86
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,893
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, was he a good guy or a bad guy?

87
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:41,419
Speaker 0: I'm gonna guess bad guy.

88
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,746
Speaker 0: It's complicated actually okay sure anyway I only know is that he's.

89
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,440
Speaker 1: you have no idea who artemis and troy is though not a clue.

90
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can also tell you with another story about el minster.

91
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,652
Speaker 0: All I know about him is he's like the most powerful wizard there was.

92
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,100
Speaker 1: ah you know what I learned from elements like Merlin equivalent.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Speaker 1: You know what I learned from el minster when he was a girl.

94
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:07,806
Speaker 1: I learned a lot about what that author thought girls felt like when they had sex, okay, and From that same author.

95
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,937
Speaker 1: I learned a lot about what turns elves on.

96
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,846
Speaker 0: right now These are both in the same universe.

97
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,755
Speaker 0: if you're a nerd you're gonna love these things right?

98
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:19,673
Speaker 0: if you're that kind of nerd But you don't have to read the drizz story to also read the el minster story.

99
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,240
Speaker 0: They don't go in order necessarily true, right?

100
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:22,922
Speaker 0: They're not like.

101
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 0: it's not like part one drizz part to a minster, but I think it's not a serial tale.

102
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:36,879
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of separate tales all in the same world part of that Very large world and they didn't write that many stories inside of it.

103
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 1: They then and the word the stories they did write were broad and spread out across all these different places though Some of them were very linear.

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:55,740
Speaker 0: There was like one series of like eight books But all went together and another set of books that also kind of anyway But the Forgotten Realms is more like a jigsaw puzzle and you can get each piece and sort of make out what's going on.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,474
Speaker 1: You know that I think jigsaw puzzles are better for the nerds in the long run.

106
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,700
Speaker 1: Of course the line of spider-man

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Speaker 0: Yes, you know what Marvel has is they basically have one long reel of film and they give it to you in pieces And you it only goes in one order and if you're missing a piece of the film, you can't play the movie.

108
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:17,680
Speaker 0: You know, I mean sure there are plenty of times where they don't do that, you know.

109
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,360
Speaker 0: It's sort of like they have a jigsaw puzzle and film together sort of right like I read.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,359
Speaker 0: You know a bunch of Marvel cosmic stuff like all the you know annihilations, but every time I'm making the jigsaw puzzle There's all these missing Wolverine pieces.

111
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,145
Speaker 0: Every piece has Wolverine on it.

112
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:33,991
Speaker 0: Wolverines on every single piece.

113
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,840
Speaker 0: It's either a claw or the horn on his hat thingy.

114
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,748
Speaker 0: You know something he's on every piece.

115
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:47,727
Speaker 1: team a will be Psylocke and Wolverine team be Cyclops and Wolverine team Just Wolverine, yeah, but so yeah, so they're.

116
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:54,303
Speaker 0: they're killing ultimate spider-man, which I think they're sort of killing off ultimate Everything.

117
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,497
Speaker 0: from what I can tell I think they're trying to end the ultimate stuff.

118
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,200
Speaker 0: I could be wrong.

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,867
Speaker 0: Well from what I read that's the door.

120
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:03,040
Speaker 1: All right, there's already going to be another ultimate spider-man.

121
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,874
Speaker 1: It's just not gonna be Peter Parker cuz he's dead.

122
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,614
Speaker 0: Okay, I Thought that there I guess they're not ending ultimate everything.

123
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,440
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell.

124
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,176
Speaker 1: I mean this is I have not read a Marvel comic since The end of the executioner's song and x-men.

125
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:21,330
Speaker 0: didn't you read Many for the show like x-men forever.

126
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,131
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I've read all those like individual bits here and there But I have not like continued to read anything.

127
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,533
Speaker 1: I don't know.

128
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,980
Speaker 1: I don't know the continuity.

129
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:34,275
Speaker 0: I you know, I bought you know, I stopped sort of when they you know, they that cosmic stuff I just talked about sort of ended.

130
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:38,614
Speaker 1: ish I started with the end of excuse your song going back and read that whole like arc.

131
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:41,708
Speaker 1: and then I read I kept reading from There for a little and I just kind of give up.

132
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,251
Speaker 0: Oh No, well, so yeah the killer.

134
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,600
Speaker 0: I wonder if they will actually bring him back or not.

135
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:54,317
Speaker 0: I will bet you because it's ultimate that they won't for quite a long time, but they will eventually.

136
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:56,386
Speaker 0: but it's like Captain America Who got brought back?

137
00:08:56,729 --> 00:09:05,626
Speaker 1: Oh in the very least I will bet you this I'll bet you $100 that within three years Peter Parker will reappear in something that isn't a flashback But it has to be in ultimate spider-man.

138
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,669
Speaker 1: Yeah ultimate spider-man.

139
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll probably go back in time and like talk to him about something.

140
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:10,949
Speaker 0: They do that.

141
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 0: That's another thing, right?

142
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,680
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of characters die and even though they're still dead They find some way to manage to put them in a story even when they're dead.

143
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,614
Speaker 1: Just go back in time and kidnap right before they die and bring him into the future.

144
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:24,636

Speaker 0: anyway, so We all know about a lot of virtual idols like Hatsune Miku and such right?

146
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,077
Speaker 0: That's that's sort of old news.

147
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:32,739
Speaker 1: It's not Ruben.

148
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:41,105

Speaker 0: We talked about them on the show before.

152
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,154
Speaker 0: song never got stuck in my head.

153
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,180
Speaker 0: You didn't listen to it enough.

154
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,366
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you should very pointedly.

155
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,028
Speaker 0: It's a good song.

156
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:53,539
Speaker 0: It's okay kind of anyway, it's a good song for sticking in heads.

157
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:58,733
Speaker 0: So, you know over in Japan Korea, I don't know about China.

158
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,720
Speaker 0: They have you know, these these girl idol groups.

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,051
Speaker 0: It's like a big team like morning moves.

160
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we can't just have Britney Spears.

161
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:11,007
Speaker 0: We got to have 20 Britney Spears in a in a group and Like something different.

162
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,331
Speaker 0: So no matter who you are.

163
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,776
Speaker 0: One of them will be your favorite one.

164
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,010
Speaker 1: That's the surly one That's the bubbly one.

165
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 1: That's the strange one.

166
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,247
Speaker 0: And instead of sexy one instead of having you know one person do a bunch of commercials.

167
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,159
Speaker 0: we can have them all doing all the commercials all the time because it's so.

168
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:37,399
Speaker 0: so AKB 48 is one of those groups very popular especially among the nerds and they recently released a commercial for For a sort of candy called ice no me sweet.

169
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:41,873
Speaker 0: and In this commercial was a new member of the group named.

170
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,419
Speaker 0: I me a Gucci.

171
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:49,297
Speaker 0: what they did not tell you until just now is that this I am.

172
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:51,824
Speaker 0: II Gucci is Not a real person.

173
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:57,100
Speaker 0: It looked like a real person in the commercial and sounded like a real person not like Hatsune Miku Which is obviously a digital person.

174
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,043
Speaker 1: Yeah well I read a number.

175
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,791
Speaker 1: I was poking around about this because I didn't.

176
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:04,630
Speaker 1: I wasn't aware until Scott pointed it out and It seems like a lot of nerds had suspicions.

177
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,393
Speaker 1: They're like, wait a minute.

178
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,180
Speaker 1: I can't find any info on this girl.

179
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:12,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they sort of put some fake info out there about her on you know, their website like, you know.

180
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,522
Speaker 0: oh she you know did a photo shoot and Right.

181
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,250
Speaker 0: They made like a fake biography to try to convince you.

182
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,373
Speaker 0: This is a real person.

183
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:20,456
Speaker 0: I get hiccups.

184
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:21,198
Speaker 1: Good job.

185
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:30,504
Speaker 0: And so, you know people were like But they it looked like a real person and it was in it and then they finally came out with it like nope It's not a real person.

186
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:34,980
Speaker 0: They took different visual aspects of many different members of the group.

187
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:45,620
Speaker 0: So they took like one girl's eyes and one girl's hair and one girl's you know Lips and one girl and they digitally pasted them all together to make a new person that did not really exist.

188
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:55,720
Speaker 0: I predict they had one of their sort of you know research students Which is like one of the you know B team like girl who works for them and is training to become a real member.

189
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,230
Speaker 0: But isn't they had her do the voice?

190
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:58,680
Speaker 1: That would be a good plot for an anime.

191
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:06,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so they made this fake person for this commercial Which is pretty cool two predictions from rim.

192
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaker 1: one, you know what our future is now.

193
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,627
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be the Terminator 2 apocalypse.

194
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,474
Speaker 1: It's Macross Plus, of course.

195
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, and two Currently, what do they do?

196
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,620
Speaker 1: They used to you know, we have the one idol like a Megumi or an I you me.

197
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:22,779
Speaker 1: But then you have the idol team, you know one idol for every kind of person.

198
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:30,840
Speaker 1: The real future now is going to be the virtual person where it detects who's watching and makes the perfect idol for that one person.

199
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,334
Speaker 1: Oh shit, so everyone sees their perfect idealized idol.

200
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 0: That is some forward fucking thinking right there.

201
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you get points for that one because that's gonna happen.

202
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,722
Speaker 0: That is so gonna happen like it knows what your tastes are and of all the idols it combines all of your favorite aspects of Each one.

203
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,087
Speaker 0: so you're watching TV.

204
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,592
Speaker 0: I see something different from what you see.

205
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna be seeing some Rainbow Dash.

206
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,639
Speaker 0: Okay But yeah, that's that's pretty fucked up right there.

207
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:04,978
Speaker 1: So I have one more little news because Emily pointed this out to me and she would have totally gone forward if it was more convenient.

208
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:15,660
Speaker 1: Makoto shinkai studio is recruiting a very specific type of intern Or the fall unpaid and all that you got to get to the studio yourself.

209
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,062
Speaker 0: I wonder what?

210
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:19,739
Speaker 0: the laws of an unpaid orange pad probably much more lax than they are here.

211
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,740
Speaker 0: The thing is they're not followed here at all.

212
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,520
Speaker 1: I imagine in Japan you're given some sort of medal for if you hire the most people and pay them the least.

213
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:35,403
Speaker 1: So specifically they're looking for young interns to do Makoto shinkai Background art.

214
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:38,554
Speaker 0: so but they would to do anything like his backgrounds.

215
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,460
Speaker 0: You would need to hire God of interns.

216
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:41,487
Speaker 1: I guess they're looking.

217
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:46,352
Speaker 0: or the quality is gonna go way down Or they're gonna whip them until they do.

218
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,100
Speaker 1: maybe they're trying to make more people.

219
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 1: They're just gonna put them in front of sad videos of puppies and just wait until they start crying and then make them draw.

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,576
Speaker 0: listen, if you really like clouds, this is a job for you.

221
00:13:56,596 --> 00:14:00,364
Speaker 1: or possibly Cherry blossoms.

222
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:01,812
Speaker 0: Yeah clouds though.

223
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:03,160
Speaker 1: Mostly cloud blossoms.

224
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,684
Speaker 0: It's be hard trains.

225
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,132
Speaker 0: It's gonna be real hard power lines for trains.

226
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,820
Speaker 1: Sure with clouds in the background always class.

227
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,109
Speaker 1: So things of the day, what do you got for me?

228
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:27,706
Speaker 0: So, I'm pretty sure I used this before but I Extensively searched and may have failed at finding when I used this before.

229
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:28,328
Speaker 0: so I'm using it.

230
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,515
Speaker 0: Fuck you I don't know if you've heard of this.

231
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:32,558
Speaker 0: It's called.

232
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,881
Speaker 0: you definitely heard of it.

233
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:35,405
Speaker 0: Mama Shiva.

234
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:41,804
Speaker 0: It is dogs That are also beans Basically, what is foreign you use that.

235
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,813
Speaker 0: I also would have That.

236
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:48,789
Speaker 1: maybe we had a party and you used it for our crew But you did not ever put it on the show.

237
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,737
Speaker 0: I don't know but the I was.

238
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:53,086
Speaker 0: I found out about it from our crew at a party.

239
00:14:53,407 --> 00:15:01,147
Speaker 0: So anyway Mama Shiva is these bean dogs and basically there's this YouTube TV episodes which are like incredibly short.

240
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:05,084
Speaker 0: There's books This cut there's all kinds of you know, this you can buy.

241
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:06,210
Speaker 0: you can buy plushies.

242
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:08,216
Speaker 0: It's a whole Empire sort of the same way.

243
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,784
Speaker 0: moyashi Mon was an empire of you know stuff.

244
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:17,150
Speaker 0: and basically the shtick is this Somebody's sitting around and maybe they're doing something and a mama shiba appears.

245
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,140
Speaker 0: It's a bean that looks like a dog and there's all different.

246
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,784
Speaker 0: There's one for every kind of bean and then It says some sort of weird fact that may or may not be true.

247
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,429
Speaker 0: That is just like what the fuck.

248
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,656
Speaker 0: and Then it goes mama Shiva and that's it.

249
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:36,550
Speaker 1: That is definitely a formula for success is a formula for success.

250
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:42,238
Speaker 0: the official mama shiba website says What exactly is mama shiba?

251
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,890
Speaker 0: they're not quite a bean nor a dog but rather a hybrid of both.

252
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,390
Speaker 0: They love to appear out of nowhere and offer random bits of trivia whether you asked for it or not.

253
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,510
Speaker 0: That is pretty much sums it up entirely.

254
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,114
Speaker 0: It's pretty funny.

255
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:53,718
Speaker 0: I like it.

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,050
Speaker 0: if I've used it before I don't give a shit.

257
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,344
Speaker 0: There's nothing no other good things of the day to use that aren't just college humor.

258
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:03,791
Speaker 0: So this is what you get Repeat for a long time like.

259
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:10,545
Speaker 1: I would just pick like some random funny video the kind of thing that when it's like 1130 and one of our parties is winding down.

260
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,550
Speaker 1: There's like three people left.

261
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:17,410
Speaker 1: We always end up in front of the TV watching random internet shit, usually going through the things of the day.

262
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:21,442
Speaker 1: But recently we've been using a lot of more newsy kind of things the day like.

263
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,188
Speaker 1: oh check out this interesting fact.

264

Speaker 1: No, it's the same joke.

275
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,482
Speaker 1: Just dragonite instead of Gatorade.

00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,990
Speaker 0: Well, I mean dragon eyes ten times more powerful than well.

277
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,766

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,902
Speaker 0: That's right.

341
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,670
Speaker 0: So so but that's all you.

342
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,876
Speaker 1: So a while ago some time ago.

343
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:26,249
Speaker 1: I was watching way more anime than Scott and now that was a long time ago.

344
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,835
Speaker 1: now We're a few years ago.

345
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:28,438
Speaker 1: Now.

346
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:31,430
Speaker 1: We're pretty much in the exact opposite situation.

347
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:37,299
Speaker 0: Well, actually not anymore because I sort of I watched a fuck ton of anime in the past few months and in the past one Month or so.

348
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,110
Speaker 0: I stopped watching.

349
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,059
Speaker 1: I think what happened to you is you were.

350
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,410
Speaker 1: you're like a spaceship that got caught in a gravity.

351
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,960
Speaker 1: Well of things like Hajime no Ippo where it pulls you in.

352
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,370
Speaker 1: you gotta watch the whole thing and then you catapult out of it.

353
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:50,409
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean I would if I could get a hold of it.

354
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:56,170
Speaker 0: I would watch Queen millennia But I can't seem to find all the episodes with subtitles so I can't get pulled into it.

355
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,150
Speaker 1: Yep, and I've been working on a lot of stuff where I've also been working on a lot of stuff.

356
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,630
Speaker 1: I'm doing stuff and I want to watch anime or something.

357
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:07,330
Speaker 1: But I want something I can watch kind of not with the full attention like not looking directly at the screen.

358
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,081
Speaker 0: Also a pony sort of ruined everything.

359
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,470
Speaker 1: Yeah ponies kind of got in the way.

360
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:15,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're gonna both talk about anime that we know the other person hasn't seen.

361
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,158
Speaker 0: also comics also some comics You know.

362
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,329
Speaker 0: it's pretty much like hey This is gonna be like a flurry of geek bites of things that I watched and rim didn't watch and vice versa.

363
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,886
Speaker 1: sir I'll start because we don't review a lot of recent anime lately, and I want to rectify that.

364
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:34,352
Speaker 1: so I've been watching three anime Simultaneously.

365
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:42,358
Speaker 1: oh shit because as you all know madhouse and Marvel teamed up to make Four anime based on Marvel properties.

366
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,943
Speaker 0: really I didn't.

367
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,430
Speaker 0: wow really I guess I did sort of know.

368
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:52,540
Speaker 0: It's like I knew it, but I sort of also forgot about it And it sort of felt like something that was in the future.

369
00:20:52,761 --> 00:21:01,233
Speaker 1: There's there's a madhouse Wolverine X-men separate from Wolverine Iron Man, and I think blade is the one that is now yet Or I haven't seen.

370
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,465
Speaker 1: I don't really care about because I don't really care about blade.

371
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:10,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so I've watched a few episodes of all of them and the animation is Fantastic.

372
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:10,794
Speaker 1: well,

373
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,230
Speaker 0: I imagine they put a ton of monies into it

374
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:25,495
Speaker 1: And it looks great like rent aro did the pilot for I think the x-men one and a lot of big people you know it's Like all the different teams at madhouse are on this and it's looking pretty great, so the Iron Man one I think has the most potential,

375
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,100
Speaker 0: but I hate Iron Man.

376
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what Iron Man is a gigantic douche.

377
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,390
Speaker 0: I know that's why I hate Iron Man, and it's great.

378
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:40,589
Speaker 1: No, no because in Japan he gets interviewed like in one of them I think the first episode and they're like so uh he's like how can I be more popular with the Japanese people?

379
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:45,788
Speaker 1: they don't seem To like me that much and the reporters like well, you could stop being such a douche.

380
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:50,604
Speaker 1: basically She's like you could be more humble, and he's like yeah, that's really outside of my abilities.

381
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:51,909
Speaker 1: you ask too much.

382
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:57,162
Speaker 1: I Feel like to not spoil anything.

383
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,630
Speaker 1: It's about a dude with a power suit.

384
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like Japan could not cock that up.

385
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:08,870
Speaker 1: Yeah It's pretty much their specialty and the plot seems to be kind of giant robo e Iron Man or Ava.

386
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:19,949
Speaker 1: Iron Man made a production model of the Iron Man suit and they got a bunch of pilots from Japan and other places to Be Iron Man so he can retire from being Iron Man and just be a guy again.

387
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:29,730
Speaker 1: Yeah And the suit goes crazy and kills all the pilots and he has to get in the prototype Iron Man suit and save the day Me and play gods.

388
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:31,095
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

389
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:32,460
Speaker 0: It's it's caveman.

390
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,022
Speaker 0: science fiction.

391
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:39,664
Speaker 1: x-men is pretty much just Imagine the the x-men cartoon we knew and loved only done by madhouse.

392
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,049
Speaker 1: Okay, it's great.

393
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,604
Speaker 1: All the characters look.

394
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:45,510
Speaker 1: they're very like.

395
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,399
Speaker 1: I don't know the 90s like the cut the style of x-men that we like and the Animation is great kind of thick line, but I like it.

396
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,166
Speaker 1: the fighting is super awesome.

397
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:53,950
Speaker 1: It's a good show.

398
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,516
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, that's something else.

399
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,704
Speaker 0: You know, I don't see too often is actual fighting.

400
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,070
Speaker 0: That's fun to watch.

401
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:05,775
Speaker 1: It's fun to watch fighting in the same way that a lot of old like a birdie the mighty had similar Like even in Hajime no Ippo.

402
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:15,270
Speaker 0: the fighting, you know is fun not because intense and very rarely is the animation of the fighting something That's other than like repeat of a special move.

403
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:21,090
Speaker 0: This to the North Star fighting is fun to watch only because only because the dude fucking explodes all over the place.

404
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not animated in a cowboy bebop.

405
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,787
Speaker 1: No, it is not the first fight.

406
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:29,789
Speaker 0: a cowboy bebop I think is like, you know, that's one of my favorite fights in anything ever as the first lesson.

407
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:40,778
Speaker 0: Dead wife kick in iron monk I know but I'm talking about animated fight choreography cowboy bebop episode one fight outside The cantina is pretty much number one.

408
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,385
Speaker 1: I think it's specifically the kick and the table like.

409
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,251
Speaker 1: that part right there got me Yep.

410
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:49,866
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, the Wolverine one is the only one that sucks.

411
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:50,890
Speaker 0: Oh, it actually sucks.

412
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,115
Speaker 0: So it's not like.

413
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,240
Speaker 0: oh shit is Wolverine.

414
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,610
Speaker 1: So in the regular x-men, it's oh shit is Wolverine.

415
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,370
Speaker 1: Wolverine is always hunched with his arms out and the blades he's like.

416
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:14,596
Speaker 1: And if they didn't tell you that the Wolverine anime is Wolverine and if the fan sub didn't keep using bub, even though I don't hear anyone actually saying bub You would not know it's Wolverine.

417
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:20,052
Speaker 1: It is unless you knew all the plot of Wolverine and you recognize the plot Mm-hmm.

418
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:26,890
Speaker 1: It's basically the shonen looking guy who happens to be invincible and have claws is in Japan fucking shit up.

419
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:32,350
Speaker 0: It's just really well, that's that's interesting cuz it's like Iron Man never really went to Japan as far as I know.

420
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,010
Speaker 0: So yeah, all the places are men don't go to Japan that often but Wolverine is all about Japan.

421
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:43,611
Speaker 1: He's a huge Japan part of the Wolverine in Japan plot, except he's all kind of be shown in Uh-huh.

422
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:44,955
Speaker 1: He's not nearly gruff enough.

423
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,689
Speaker 0: Alrighty, and the thing is when he was in Japan, that was the most gruff ist.

424
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,870
Speaker 0: I know that he was comics wise.

425
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:53,375
Speaker 0: So that's it.

426
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:53,877
Speaker 1: So I was.

427
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:57,574
Speaker 1: I basically I watched one episode of that and gave up on it But the regular x-men one.

428
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:02,513
Speaker 1: it's like they took all his gruff out of Wolverine and put it all into the x-men anime Mm-hmm.

429
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:03,517
Speaker 0: All right.

430
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,019
Speaker 0: Let's see what.

431
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:13,251
Speaker 0: I watched a ton of animes, but most of them were oh And also they're like one show that you went all the fuck way through and a lot of them are Like.

432
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:26,510
Speaker 0: I see I saw so many lazy Matsumoto's like space battleship Yamato all of Captain Harlock all of Galaxy Express all Galaxy Railways all Space Symphony may tell right many of these are shows that I've seen several episodes of but just didn't finish.

433
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:28,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Galaxy Express.

434
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,405
Speaker 1: I got like 40 in and then I just haven't.

Speaker 1: I got to watch more.

436
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:35,850
Speaker 0: Alright, so I think the one I want to talk about those I wanna talk about Galaxy Railways, right?

437
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,570
Speaker 0: Cuz that's that's newer and it's uh, you can just get like all the DVDs in a whole bunch.

438
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,468
Speaker 0: I think it might even be on Netflix or something, right?

439
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,930
Speaker 0: So the deal with Galaxy Railways is basically when you're watching Galaxy Express, right?

440
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,030
Speaker 0: Sometimes it'll be like the Galaxy Railways will have to enforce the law of the trains.

441
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:58,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the rules of the trains basically change episode to episode to serve the plot.

442
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,421
Speaker 0: But they're always jerks like the like.

443
00:26:01,622 --> 00:26:05,580
Speaker 0: you can't get out of train without a ticket except We'll make a special exception for main characters.

444
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:07,430
Speaker 1: you mess with our train will kill you all.

445
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:11,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you fuck with the train, we'll just blow your brains out and all these sorts of things.

446
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:15,230
Speaker 0: So Galaxy Railways is like two separate TV series, right?

447
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:23,785
Speaker 0: It's a season one and a season two and basically It follows the story of this kid whose dad works for the Galaxy Railways and his dad get.

448
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:28,118
Speaker 0: his dad is like the best pilot Ever the best, you know train captain.

449
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,362
Speaker 1: I was gonna say pilot.

450
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:34,933
Speaker 0: Yeah train captain engineer, whatever it is right, and basically his dad is He.

451
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,478
Speaker 0: his dad rides the train.

452
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,545
Speaker 0: that is like the defense train, right?

453
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:38,966
Speaker 0: It's not.

454
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:46,189
Speaker 0: it's not a passenger train It's the train that goes out when another trains in trouble to save it from whatever horrible secret of space Is attacking it this week?

455
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,210
Speaker 0: So his dad dies and this kid grows up and then tries to get the same job as his dad, right?

456
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,670
Speaker 0: So he goes to work for the train and of course it makes us.

457
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,616
Speaker 0: Oh, no, and his mom is all upset.

458
00:26:58,238 --> 00:27:13,010
Speaker 0: and the story follows this, you know, both seasons follow this kid who grows up obviously, you know working in the Galaxy Railways on the defense train and It's sort of like, you know the quality of it.

459
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,026
Speaker 0: You know some of the episodes are episodic Galaxy Express style, right?

460
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:24,090
Speaker 0: It's like this episode They have to go and there's some weird thing happening on this planet and they go and they rescue a train and this episodic stuff.

461
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:32,983
Speaker 0: But there's also a plot that sort of also, you know goes on not only development of the characters But also like ooh, there's a secret of the Galaxy Railways.

462
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 0: What is it?

463
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:34,809
Speaker 0: Someone's up to no good.

464
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:36,424
Speaker 0: Will you uncover this?

465
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:36,889
Speaker 0: no goodness?

466
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:48,778
Speaker 0: You know and it has to do with like oh the Galaxy Railways themselves the technology that makes them work is tearing a hole in space and Disrupting this other universe and that other universe.

467
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,630
Speaker 0: who wants to attack the Galaxy Railways and someone's covering it up?

468
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,168
Speaker 0: And there's something along those lines.

469
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:56,567
Speaker 1: How Matsumoto-ey is it?

470
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,336
Speaker 0: It's kind of Matsumoto-ey, right?

471
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,380
Speaker 0: It's like half right?

472
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,692
Speaker 0: It's like half Matsumoto half modern, you know I Enjoyed it.

473
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:10,489
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say it's like the greatest show ever of all time, but it's definitely like, you know, it's like a b-plus show.

474
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:22,750
Speaker 0: You know the second season like, you know sort of goes, you know in a like the first season has sort of an end But the second season builds up to a more real ish and that like puts a nail in everything.

475
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,279
Speaker 0: But the second season has like different characters.

476
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,627
Speaker 0: they bring in, you know, and all that kind of stuff that you know Usually happens in the second season.

477
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:36,895
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's like if you're really attached to this stuff in the first season you feel a little bit detached in the second season because these characters you care less about.

478
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,147
Speaker 0: there's also an OAV that goes between the two seasons.

479
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:56,956
Speaker 0: that Basically is a crossover between Galaxy Express and Galaxy Railways where Maytel and Tetsuro You know, they meet up with the Galaxy Railways guys and some weird dimension planet for that, you know against the bad guy It's an OAV.

480
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:57,740
Speaker 0: That's what they do.

481
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,409
Speaker 1: That is what they do, you know.

482
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:07,130
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you know, it's like if you're already a Galaxy train fan, then Galaxy Railways will probably work out for you.

483
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:12,469
Speaker 0: If you're not you might be a little bit lost, but you should be able to understand it.

484
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:21,396
Speaker 0: but I think the reason that you'll be lost is because a lot of the enjoyment I got show from the show honestly is because I was like I already knew what the Galaxy Railways was.

485
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:25,390
Speaker 0: and in the other shows the Galaxy Railways like they never show you anyone's face.

486
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:36,138
Speaker 1: It's like this mysterious and incredibly powerful overseer of the train would be kind of like if you what if they made an Ava spin-off that was about like all the Background character.

487
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:37,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, an Ava spin-off that was about Sele.

488
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:42,026
Speaker 0: It was just like Sele guys hanging out like what's up and you could totally see them and they were yeah, right?

489
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:42,749
Speaker 0: That's her.

490
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,850
Speaker 0: so it's like you know.

491
00:29:45,910 --> 00:30:00,744
Speaker 0: so the fact that I had this mystique of the Galaxy Railways and the show builds on that is what sort of gives it a Lot of its feeling and if you don't have that care for the Galaxy Railways as an organization Some of that feeling may be lost but the show Still hold up.

492
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:06,445
Speaker 0: I feel like You don't need to have any pre knowledge to understand what's going on of the Galaxy Express.

493
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:07,468
Speaker 1: 3 9 that I've seen.

494
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:12,403
Speaker 1: the Galaxy Railways is basically the in the Chinese kung-fu movie.

495
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,090
Speaker 1: The guy in the white suit is not doing anything.

496
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he does something a couple every now and then he comes in and does something.

497
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,413
Speaker 1: then he goes away and you want to Know where he went.

498
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:21,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is guy in white suit kicking ass every episode.

499
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:26,130
Speaker 0: Of course, of course, you know, there's another level of guys in white suits, you know to keep the show interesting.

500
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:32,056
Speaker 1: So it wasn't that long ago actually that I watched, you know, remember birdie the mighty the old anime That was actually pretty fun.

501
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:32,719
Speaker 0: I never watched.

502
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

503
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, so birdie the mighty was remade.

504
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,258
Speaker 1: I think I did a geek bite on this a while ago.

505
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,203
Speaker 1: birdie the mighty decode.

506
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:53,070
Speaker 1: and then they made a sequel to that which I haven't watched yet and it has the all the same things that I like about the x-men anime birdie the mighty actually had because it's like Superhero sci-fi well choreographed fights good music good animation fun to watch.

507
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,364
Speaker 1: I don't really want to say much more about it other than that.

508
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:59,069
Speaker 1: if you're an anime fan Not you know, like an actual like I enjoy anime.

509
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:06,670
Speaker 1: Birdie the mighty decode is one of those kinds of anime that reminds you how much you like even the dumb sci-fi anime.

510
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,294
Speaker 1: You know, I've been.

511
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,995
Speaker 1: there's something to the dumb sci-fi anime I've been trying to.

512
00:31:10,177 --> 00:31:13,018
Speaker 0: you know, because I've been an anime drought I've been looking for one to go next.

513
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,950
Speaker 1: you really should watch birdie the mighty decode.

514
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,886
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll do birdie the mighty then birdie decode and then birdie decode do.

515
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:19,810
Speaker 0: I'll do the whole thing.

516
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:20,915
Speaker 0: Ah, I've been.

517
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:21,899
Speaker 0: I've been good at that lately.

518
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,450
Speaker 1: The thing is the original birdie the mighty is a pretty good show.

519
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,050
Speaker 1: I didn't finish it, but I'd seen a whole bunch of it because Gerald recommended it.

520
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,710
Speaker 0: I've seen zero but I haven't heard anyone say anything bad.

521
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,178
Speaker 1: Anime had always told me to watch it.

522
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've only heard good things about all birdie the mighties But I've never seen any.

523
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:38,725
Speaker 0: so maybe I'll maybe I'll get on that.

524
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,530
Speaker 1: It's just one of those.

525
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,044
Speaker 1: It's it's got the kind of over-the-top Anime kind of plot kind of stereotypical.

526
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:46,130
Speaker 1: you can kind of see where it's going.

527
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,110
Speaker 1: But at the same time the plot is interesting.

528
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:56,469
Speaker 1: It's kind of a giant robo II plot, but bring it scale it back like a hundredfold And her power suit has high heels.

529
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,575
Speaker 0: Maybe now I don't want it.

530
00:31:58,615 --> 00:31:58,776
Speaker 0: Now.

531
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,363
Speaker 0: You're making it not appealing now.

532
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,830
Speaker 1: See you'll think that but then you watch it.

533
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,382
Speaker 1: You're like wow, really high heels.

534
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:11,011
Speaker 1: Hey, okay It's definitely like it's kind of playing with the tropes of old anime but doing it in a fun way Mm-hmm.

535
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,416
Speaker 0: All right, another show.

536
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,282
Speaker 0: I watched completely all of that.

537
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:21,106
Speaker 0: I know I think there's some OAVs and movies I haven't seen but I watched the entire Votoms TV series all three parts.

538
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:24,230
Speaker 1: I've seen 11 episodes of photons, right?

539
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,244
Speaker 0: So basically the deal with photons is this right.

540
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:29,896
Speaker 0: you got this guy Who is on.

541
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:37,803
Speaker 0: he's in some military where they use, you know powered armors that are sort of like battle mechs But smaller kind of gun to me, but you know the shit gun lower non Gundam.

542
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, the slow lumbering type, right?

543
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:49,290
Speaker 0: and he's on some secret mission and During the secret mission he encounters some weird secret of space like this Magical girl of some kind and he doesn't know what the fuck's going on.

544
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:54,566
Speaker 0: And then he you know sort of escapes this secret mission and he loses memory.

545
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:59,230
Speaker 0: and he like all you know He basically he doesn't have any memory before that mission and he's sort of like what the fuck.

546
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:02,624
Speaker 0: So the show's you know, and it's the story of what.

547
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:03,690
Speaker 0: what's up with this guy.

548
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,770
Speaker 0: He has no memory really but he's an awesome pilot of mech suits.

549
00:33:08,472 --> 00:33:13,047
Speaker 0: So part one is like he's trapped in this city, you know where there's all this bad guys going on.

550
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:21,077
Speaker 0: in part two He's on another planet in a jungle scenario and in part three He's on a completely different planet.

551
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,405
Speaker 0: Well, he's first he's in space then he's on a different planet.

552
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:38,390
Speaker 0: So part one You know obviously starts off with that secret mission and then it's sort of you know Builds and it's a big sort of gets in this groove of being a pretty typical mech show like be quality You know, it's alright, you know, we got a mech show going on here some interesting stuff

553
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:46,350
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the kind of thing like while people in our crew put it on while we were in Wildwood on the shore And just like, you know put six episodes on in a row while we're dicking around playing games.

554
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,850
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a Gundam but a little bit less, you know good, right?

555
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, also a little less gun to me and a little more military.

556
00:33:53,402 --> 00:34:00,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's a little more like this from what I saw It's a little closer to some of the stuff that goes on like Venus Wars in terms of the way people fight.

557
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:09,833
Speaker 0: Definitely the style of it is definitely more that you know early 90s, you know tank police kind of aesthetic Tank police again.

558
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,967
Speaker 0: Anyway, so part two in the jungle actually starts off.

559
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:26,989
Speaker 0: We were kind of like But then it sort of builds towards something and you're like, oh, okay They're bringing it back into the plot because the beginning of that second arc with the jungle I was sort of being like what should I stop watching because I'm not too interested now

560
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,409
Speaker 1: It seems like it's definitely a show worth watching and I will finish it someday.

561
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,250
Speaker 0: But then the third part, right?

562
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,952
Speaker 0: This is you know, it's like, you know people talk about shows like Gao Gai Ga and how they start off crap and then get Good later.

563
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:45,150
Speaker 0: So right and I'm always like it's not worth sitting through crap for to get to the good part, right?

564
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,670
Speaker 0: But photons is like you sit through the slightly above average part to get to the above average part.

565
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,496
Speaker 0: It doesn't get amazing.

566
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,803
Speaker 0: It gets pretty great.

567
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,530
Speaker 0: Good great good, right?

568
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:03,530
Speaker 0: So it's basically BB BBB and you get to part three and it's like a - right a - that's some pretty heady praise.

569
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,861
Speaker 0: It's pretty good, you know, but it's not like the best.

570
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:22,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah the So that third part basically is where it busts out, you know The anime sci-fi stuff we're like, there's the terrible secret of space What it is love old sci-fi stuff where the terrible secret is revealed and then there's like ten more episodes.

571
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:23,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly.

572
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:29,166
Speaker 0: that's the thing right because in a lot of shows There'll be a terrible secret of space that might be revealed at the very very end.

573
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,815
Speaker 0: eska flown a yep Right the very very end.

574
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:39,278
Speaker 0: they reveal it and we're done or they'll sort of half reveal it and they won't Completely answer everything and then they're done vote Tom's.

575
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:46,190
Speaker 0: they answer 99 or a hundred percent of the terrible secret of space Well before the final final final episode.

576
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:57,210
Speaker 0: So they actually you know It's like you learn a lot of terrible secrets of space and they build on it over quite a few episodes Towards the end of that third arc and there's sort of also sub secrets of space.

577
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,502
Speaker 0: So it's like square bosses upon square bosses and each one is a good one.

578
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,370
Speaker 0: So that third arc is is pretty good.

579
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,779
Speaker 0: I liked it and you're pumping me up.

580
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,430
Speaker 1: I think I'll have to move this up in the queue.

581
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:13,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you haven't watched the vote Tom's and you like sci-fi Animes go for it.

582
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,410
Speaker 0: and then you know, it is a mecha show.

583
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:25,590
Speaker 0: There are robot fights, but actually there's like a lot less robot fighting than say, you know a Gundam or whatever It's and when there is it seems like I said more like a venus wars fight.

584
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:33,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is in the early lucky a little there are some things that are you know presented as like tournaments But not really.

585
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:47,279
Speaker 0: it's pretty much like, you know, hey you you know, we're it's part of the plot like hey We're gonna use you You know to fight for money in in the games because you have these mad robot skills and then he sort of tries to escape From them is not like it's not like they ever

586
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,150
Speaker 1: actually why would you try to escape for one must fall 2097?

587
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like a tournament ever actually happens or anything like that.

588
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,430
Speaker 0: Right, all the robot fighting is actually battles that make that have a reason in the context of the plot.

589
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:09,470
Speaker 0: It's never like one battle per episode because you have to like that and because and the robots actually are sort of all you know More I mean there are sort of superpowers, right?

590
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:16,438
Speaker 0: And sci-fi things that make them, you know, some people just awesome Coordinators new types.

591
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much exactly that.

592
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 0: but Even though eat despite that the robots are pretty slow and lumbering and the weapon attacks are pretty real, you know more.

593
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,305
Speaker 0: I Guess not realistic but more like battle tech and less like less firing the lone greens.

594
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:32,529
Speaker 0: Yeah less of that.

595
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:42,410
Speaker 1: So speaking of B plus a minus anime and terrible secrets of space I watched all of scrap princess instead of going to a class at our IT and I then failed.

596
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:45,999
Speaker 0: I never watched the scrap print Watch four episodes at an anime club meeting.

597
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,610
Speaker 1: that princess is a solid B plus.

598
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,718
Speaker 0: I think it's largely forgotten by people.

599
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,127
Speaker 1: I know scrap princess the plot of scrap princess.

600
00:37:53,408 --> 00:37:57,343
Speaker 1: on the surface It is a fantasy world, you know, there's wizards and it's not remember.

601
00:37:57,383 --> 00:37:59,110
Speaker 0: There's not too many fantasy anime out there.

602
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should add this to that animation C panel on hey fantasy anime.

603
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:07,210
Speaker 1: There aren't that many Yeah, but it's a fantasy world on the surface, but really it's sci-fi.

604
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,710
Speaker 1: It's one of those worlds where everyone is magic and wizards and swords and whatnot.

605
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,338
Speaker 1: But yet the terrible secret of space.

606
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:24,512
Speaker 1: it's kind of obvious from a meta level that the magic is actually very advanced science but people have forgotten and There's space plot that people don't see coming Uh-huh.

607
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:30,227
Speaker 1: I'm trying to avoid spoiling but also spoiling just enough to get people to consider watching the show that yes.

608
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:35,150
Speaker 1: This is a space Sci-fi terrible secret show that pretends to be fantasy.

609
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,690
Speaker 0: So it's like it was a sci-fi world.

610
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:41,290
Speaker 0: But then some sort of apocalypse happened that turned it into a fantasy.

611
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,459
Speaker 1: It picks up in kind of in media res.

612
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:53,890
Speaker 1: the story is that the scrapped princess is a girl Who for various reasons is destined as far as the establishment of this world says the protectors of the world the rulers?

613
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:54,612
Speaker 1: Everyone.

614
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,702
Speaker 1: she will destroy the world.

615
00:38:56,944 --> 00:39:00,209
Speaker 0: So when she turns a certain age Why don't you just kill her before then?

616
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,860
Speaker 1: The world is like, alright, we figured this out.

617
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,664
Speaker 1: We're going to murder her.

618
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:04,790
Speaker 0: Well, how do they know this?

619
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,236
Speaker 0: Where's the legend come from?

620
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,662
Speaker 1: So this is that's part of the plot.

621
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,490
Speaker 1: You don't know right away where this comes from.

622
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,594
Speaker 1: It's just everybody knows it.

623
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:11,879
Speaker 1: That's like the legend of forever.

624
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:12,883
Speaker 0: So how do they know?

625
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:13,184
Speaker 0: it's her?

626
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,710
Speaker 1: Uh, well, that's the plot.

627
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,135
Speaker 1: they know.

628
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:21,664
Speaker 1: okay, and some people Smuggle her away and try to protect her because they think this is all bullshit.

629
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:23,090
Speaker 0: Oh, oh they did.

630
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:24,632
Speaker 0: They really just care about her They don't.

631
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,206
Speaker 0: I thought that they were just people who you know wanted the world.

632
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:27,769
Speaker 1: one of them.

633
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:33,347
Speaker 1: So one of them cares about her but basically says if it turns out that this is true I love you, but I will kill you.

634
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:34,734
Speaker 0: See I thought it.

635
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,307
Speaker 1: see but that's like the other person just cares about her and thinks this is bullshit.

636
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:39,150
Speaker 1: It's it's complicated.

637
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's kind of weird though.

638
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:49,769
Speaker 0: It's like they they saving her because they care about her as if it's like the real reason to save her because you want the World to end not because well, maybe there are people who want that too.

639
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,432
Speaker 1: It's a kind of.

640
00:39:50,453 --> 00:40:00,347
Speaker 1: there's a lot of characters in this show and it kind of it starts out slightly Episodic like a lot of shows like that do and then it actually the sci-fi plot builds and builds and builds.

641
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,170
Speaker 1: the characters are great.

642
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,574
Speaker 1: There's a couple of really big turnabouts.

643
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,342
Speaker 1: It's BB plus BB plus all the way through.

644
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:10,578
Speaker 1: it would have been an a-minus show Except you know how I said.

645
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,990
Speaker 1: I like a show where the terrible secret is revealed and then you've got like ten more episodes.

646
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:16,610
Speaker 1: So the last episode, right?

647
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,930
Speaker 1: The I catch happens halfway through the episode, you know, Jack and shit.

648
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:31,975
Speaker 1: Okay, the second half of the last episode Reveals the entire terrible secret from space resolves it all and has the epilogue Mm-hmm.

649
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:39,870
Speaker 1: I don't know if they ran out of money I don't know what but this show could have been a-minus if they had done that like even an episode earlier.

650
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, so does it like.

651
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,850
Speaker 0: does the pacing get really fast at the end?

652
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,570
Speaker 1: Like oh the pacing is the same rate all the way through and then after the I cash.

653
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,603
Speaker 1: And yeah, like it's it's crazy.

654
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:52,984
Speaker 1: I can't.

655
00:40:53,044 --> 00:41:00,190
Speaker 1: I can't think of any show short of What's that show that ended early.

656
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,993
Speaker 1: They ran out of money as they said fuck it A lot of them.

657
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,904
Speaker 1: Well, I'll look it up later and put it in the show notes.

658
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:08,325
Speaker 1: cuz I can't.

659
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:09,530
Speaker 1: the title just escapes me.

660
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,729
Speaker 0: Okay, there's a lot of shows that did that.

661
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:17,770
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway that that's my only complaint with the show and that brings it down to the B plus instead of the a-minus.

662
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,384
Speaker 1: But it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a pretty good anime to watch.

663
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:22,368
Speaker 1: pretty good.

664
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:25,993
Speaker 0: Not great All right Let's see here.

665
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:26,334
Speaker 0: You know what?

666
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:29,446
Speaker 0: I watch what you are 100% of the galaxy.

667
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:30,410
Speaker 1: frow line, Yuna.

668
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,255
Speaker 0: I only watched a part of that.

669
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,703
Speaker 0: Anyway, I should finish it though.

670
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:35,485
Speaker 0: It's not that long.

671
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,328
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not.

672
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,070
Speaker 1: I've got it right there.

673
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:44,741
Speaker 0: I watched all the Pat LeBourde the OAV TV series second TV series second OAV movie movie movie.

674
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,784
Speaker 0: I've watched all of.

675
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,970
Speaker 1: I've only seen movie see.

676
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,376
Speaker 0: But here's something that happened, right?

677
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:51,747
Speaker 0: So I knew Pat LeBourde was a cool thing at RIT.

678
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,670
Speaker 0: I tried to watch a bunch of it.

679
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,261
Speaker 0: I watched two movies on VHS and I watched.

680
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:58,210
Speaker 0: the VHS is from the anime club.

681
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,670
Speaker 0: But the VHS from the anime club were sort of screwy.

682
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:04,245
Speaker 0: See people don't know this but the laser discs of Pat LeBourde.

683
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:09,625
Speaker 0: if you bought them The first episode on the laser disc would be an episode from OAV.

684
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:11,574
Speaker 0: I think one or two I don't remember.

685
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,150
Speaker 0: but then the rest of the laser disc would be TV episodes.

686
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:19,950
Speaker 0: So it was sort of like OAV and TV episodes were mixed on the laser discs and the VHS is restraint from the laser discs.

687
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:26,196
Speaker 0: So they were also mixed up also and I sort of didn't know I didn't have that kind of information in the year 2000.

688
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:29,802
Speaker 0: Kind of watching you're like man Encyclopedia was not so fully flesh.

689
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:31,450
Speaker 1: the animation jumps all over the place.

690
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,644
Speaker 0: Well, it was like why the opener changed and the plot wasn't.

691
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:44,188
Speaker 1: you know, I was I you know But I wasn't paying close Like I remember watching this fan sub of like project a co and it had just all this random shit.

692
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:51,710
Speaker 1: after project a co ended Just like 45 minutes of like music videos and stuff Yep, but anyway.

693
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:59,190
Speaker 0: So I went back You know recently and I rewatched all the Pat LeBourde and I understood which parts are which and I'm the right order and everything.

694
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,468
Speaker 0: So here's here's how it breaks down.

695
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,305
Speaker 0: Everybody in the entire universe should watch Pat LeBourde OAV number one.

696
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:06,650
Speaker 0: that is made by Mamoru Oshii.

697
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:08,759
Speaker 0: It is the first Pat LeBourde there is.

698
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:11,350
Speaker 0: it is a hundred percent awesome and it's only a few episodes.

699
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,650
Speaker 0: It's made of tons of win, right and that introduces you to everything.

700
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:24,710
Speaker 0: Everyone in the entire goddamn universe should watch Pat LeBourde movies one and two also made by Mamoru Oshii Also made of tons of win all over the place, right movies are good.

701
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,698
Speaker 0: That's some of the best anime movies ever.

702
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,710
Speaker 0: and the thing is you can watch the movies without having seen that first OAV.

703
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:35,058
Speaker 0: But I recommend watching the OAV first anyway Because you'll get more familiar with the characters.

704
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,670
Speaker 0: and really characters are what drives Pat LeBourde right more.

705
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,929
Speaker 0: So, you know it has robots, but it's basically the robots in the show.

706
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:47,445
Speaker 0: They're just basically police cars, you know, it's like kind of like Gasaraki.

707
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:48,790
Speaker 1: the robots are just tanks.

708
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just happen to be drawn as robots, right?

709
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,652
Speaker 0: The show would work.

710
00:43:55,013 --> 00:43:56,437
Speaker 0: It's basically a police show.

711
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:01,070
Speaker 0: It might as well be Odoro Daisousasen only they happen to have police robots.

712
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,778
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I could watch that movie again.

713
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:05,590
Speaker 0: In fact, it's incredibly like Odoro Daisousasen.

714
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:07,156
Speaker 0: I put it in the exact same genre.

715
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:09,565
Speaker 1: We've done a show on Odoro Daisousasen, right?

716
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:10,930
Speaker 0: I think we did a long time ago.

717
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:14,224
Speaker 1: I feel like we should watch it again and do it a show on it.

718
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:15,710
Speaker 1: I know I'll get it.

719
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,379
Speaker 0: I'll get both of them.

720
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:18,243
Speaker 0: Rainbow Bridge also.

721
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:23,550
Speaker 0: Rainbow Bridge wasn't as good though But it was still the part of the beginning that opening scene with the boat with the paintball.

722
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually the whole thing was great except for the very end, which is kind of just a yeah.

723
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:31,889
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know Rainbow Bridge wasn't as good as part as the original but it was still.

724
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:48,050
Speaker 1: I mean For all you listeners who probably don't know what we're talking about Odoro Daisousasen is a TV series and some movies in Japan about cops Like if you like like you're under arrest like a character driven cop drama mostly humorous also kind of serious.

725
00:44:48,110 --> 00:45:07,657
Speaker 1: But the first movie we watched at RIT and we liked it so much that when I was president of the RIT anime club one of the few one of the big like privileges you get is that on the last day of your tenure the Final like meeting of the year of the season of everything you show whatever the fuck you want And I showed the live-action.

726
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:11,610
Speaker 1: Odoro Daisousasen Bayside Shakedown, baby, and I gave all these hints.

727
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,963
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, the opening theme is also in Dance Dance Revolution, which is true.

728
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:16,385
Speaker 0: Yep.

729
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,875
Speaker 1: None of you have seen it Which is true.

730
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,829
Speaker 1: It's about cops, which is true.

731
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,982
Speaker 1: The show got a standing ovation from the crowd at the end.

732
00:45:26,403 --> 00:45:28,369
Speaker 1: It is one of the best goddamn movies.

733
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:32,940
Speaker 0: Huh this according well not not best in like citizen.

734
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,877
Speaker 0: according to Wikipedia Bayside Shakedown 3 came out in summer 2010 But I'm checking that right now.

735
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:38,883
Speaker 1: What's wrong with us?

736
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:40,250
Speaker 1: You know, what's wrong with us?

737
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,021
Speaker 1: We don't have a video bar to tell us when stuff like that comes out.

738
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:44,467
Speaker 0: I'm doing some searching right now.

739
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,502
Speaker 0: But anyway Bayside Shakedown 3.

740
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:50,517
Speaker 0: Yeah Got hot as a 5.7 and IMDb is it?

741
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:54,589
Speaker 0: It might be awful.

742
00:45:54,891 --> 00:46:02,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the trouble is Bayside Shakedown is the kind of movie that is besto if you're the kind of person who likes Movies like Attack the Gas Station.

743
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,902
Speaker 0: So back to Pat LeVoir.

744
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:04,725
Speaker 1: Back to Pat LeVoir.

745
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,250
Speaker 0: Which is the same genre, right?

746
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:09,668
Speaker 0: So, you know you got movie 1 movie 2 OAV 1 awesome.

747
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,577
Speaker 0: Then you got TV series 1.

748
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:17,590
Speaker 0: TV series 1 is not actually directed by Mamoru Oshii, but a lot of it.

749
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:25,870
Speaker 0: I think he's written some of it directly or indirectly and you can sort of tell Some of the episodes that he had a major influence on and the ones that he didn't, right?

750
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:32,590
Speaker 0: Like there's an episode that has no robots in it and is all about waiting for the Chinese food order to show up.

751
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,538
Speaker 1: There was a Seinfeld about that too.

752
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,519
Speaker 0: And that episode is so clearly Mamoru Oshii's doing, right?

753
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,410
Speaker 0: There's like no robots in it whatsoever and he's like one of the best freaking episodes.

754
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:48,330
Speaker 0: But anyway, it actually has a contiguous plot that you know goes.

755
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:58,070
Speaker 0: Oh, you know tells a story but some of the episodes are more episodic than others And it's a little bit more light-hearted and less serious sci-fi anime than the movies in the first OAV.

756
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:03,052
Speaker 1: Well kind of like look at the differences between like Ghost in the Shell the anime versus the manga versus the movies Exactly.

757
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:07,508
Speaker 0: So this is more like the standalone complex to the Ghost in the Shell movie.

758
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, right But it's still.

759
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:11,410
Speaker 0: I really like it a whole lot.

760
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:20,610
Speaker 0: You know, you might not like it as much as the first OAV in the movies But it's still good and it gives you more of those characters and they're in character and it totally works.

761
00:47:20,992 --> 00:47:26,030
Speaker 0: So it's like you're all- Palobor is all about being attached to the characters And if you're attached to them, you're gonna want to watch TV series.

762
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:31,890
Speaker 0: The second OAV comes after the first TV series before the second TV series, right?

763
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:40,983
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly and it sort of ties, you know, it's sort of basically Continuation of TV series into.

764
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:46,445
Speaker 0: you know The second yeah, it's like the in-between part.

765
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:53,561
Speaker 0: It's just like a plot connector Right, so I got a fairly egregious one.

766
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:54,464
Speaker 1: You do need to see it.

767
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,755
Speaker 1: And then the second time you see gone Yeah, you got more Palobor.

768
00:47:57,935 --> 00:48:03,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the second TV series is sort of like, all right, you know we're just gonna keep going.

769
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:05,321
Speaker 0: and The quality- Just like you?

770
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:10,729
Speaker 0: Yeah You know the quality goes down.

771
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,081
Speaker 0: You know a little bit but you know, it's still good.

772
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:19,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of those like A to A minis I'm trying to remember like maybe there isn't a second TV series.

773
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:21,592
Speaker 1: Oh Careful now.

774
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:22,495
Speaker 0: This is the problem.

775
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:24,422
Speaker 0: According to Anime News Network, there isn't.

776
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:29,123
Speaker 0: I'm just remembering things fucked up like Anyway, all right old man Scott.

777
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:29,910
Speaker 0: Yeah old man me.

778
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,590
Speaker 0: But anyway, you should watch all the Palobors.

779
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:38,702
Speaker 1: So a show that you Scott should watch so we can do a show on it because I think it's actually a great goddamn show Is the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

780
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:40,070
Speaker 0: I'll have to watch that at some point.

781
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:43,249
Speaker 1: It's really good and it's not about what you think it's about.

782
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:44,535
Speaker 1: What do you think it's about?

783
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,543
Speaker 1: because you've you've obviously heard about it.

784
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,250
Speaker 1: people have said things about based.

785
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:50,481
Speaker 0: I've absorbed a lot of information.

786
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:52,330
Speaker 0: I've watched a few episodes, right?

787
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,985
Speaker 0: So from what I can tell the few episodes I watched was like, okay, they're in school.

788
00:48:57,406 --> 00:48:58,370
Speaker 0: There's a girl named Haruhi.

789
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,376
Speaker 0: She's totally weird.

790
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,489
Speaker 0: She drags in these other weird people.

791
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:05,462
Speaker 0: Clearly each of the people has something weird about them, right?

792
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:07,950
Speaker 0: That is some something sci-fi ish, right?

793
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:14,830
Speaker 0: And from what I can tell it's you know It looks to be high school silliness with a weird girl at first glance.

794
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:22,034
Speaker 0: But really based on all the things people say and all the things that I've just sort of absorbed pulls Scott is Scott.

795
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,079
Speaker 1: it pulls a big o2.

796
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's some sort of end of the world.

797
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,697
Speaker 0: Haruhi is Aliens and who knows well?

798
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,650
Speaker 1: here I will summarize it yet simultaneously not actually spoil anything.

799
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,289
Speaker 1: I think most of our listeners have probably already seen Haruhi and there's more Haruhi that was made later, but whatever.

800
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:47,930
Speaker 1: Basically it's about a girl who's obsessed with finding Anything crazy like magic or aliens or ESP or you know any just finding something like that like our friend Scott Johnson.

801
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,323
Speaker 1: If you find one then odds are some other ones out there too.

802
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:53,210
Speaker 1: Like if you find one vampire shit is on.

803
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:53,852
Speaker 0: That's right.

804
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:57,587
Speaker 1: So she's obsessed with this and she never finds anything.

805
00:49:57,607 --> 00:49:58,330
Speaker 1: cuz you know cuz whatever.

806
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:07,849
Speaker 1: It just so happens that everyone around her is one of those things Except for this one guy who's friends with her and he sees all this crazy stuff and she doesn't see it.

807
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:11,329
Speaker 1: Like she can't find it, but he's always like running afoul of it.

808
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:15,930
Speaker 1: There's a lot more to it than that, but that's kind of the the first layer gist of this.

809
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,607
Speaker 0: That's why she's melancholy because she can't find any of these awesome things bored with existence.

810
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:21,410
Speaker 1: She's bored with life.

811
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,514
Speaker 1: She's bored with everything.

812
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:24,721
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and it's just.

813
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:25,705
Speaker 1: it's a good show really.

814
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:26,527
Speaker 1: It's solidly done.

815
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:30,422
Speaker 1: The animation is great The story is great that the the moral of it is pretty good.

816
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:33,474
Speaker 1: It's it's I call it an anime Mm-hmm.

817
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,747
Speaker 0: All right, so I figured out why I was fucked up in the head with Pat LaVoir.

818
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:41,142
Speaker 0: because you're old No, because OAV - basically might as well be TV - right.

819
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:43,691
Speaker 0: so I was remembering them sort of like two separate things Really?

820
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:44,172
Speaker 0: They're the same.

821
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:49,786
Speaker 0: so you watch right so it's the TV right and then the OAV - comes after it.

822
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,915
Speaker 0: the OAV one Comes first.

823
00:50:52,995 --> 00:51:08,930
Speaker 0: So it's OAV one then TV then TV - then movie movie movie if you want to go chronologically Right, but the movie standalone the third movie actually Doesn't really have the characters in it has like these other characters who aside characters gonna be see destiny.

824
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has like, you know, it's basically focuses on these two detectives.

825
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,139
Speaker 0: It's still an okay anime sci-fi movie, but it's not.

826
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,912
Speaker 0: it's not like super awesome Pat LaVoir, but it's in the Pat LaVoir universe All right.

827
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:24,330
Speaker 1: All right, you know the even more egregious than Hari the fact you haven't actually seen Irresponsible Captain Tyler.

828
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,755
Speaker 0: I watched a ton of it though.

829
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:27,682
Speaker 0: Yes, but 11 episodes.

830
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:29,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you didn't even get to.

831
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:29,710
Speaker 1: it's one of those shows.

832
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:32,173
Speaker 1: It's like big O where you know What's part of the movie.

833
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:33,397
Speaker 1: the first half is great.

834
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:36,528
Speaker 1: And then the second half is like oh, oh, oh, I see.

835
00:51:36,548 --> 00:51:40,849
Speaker 0: Oh, oh I'm sure I'll watch it at some point, but it's I don't have a DVD box.

836
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,015
Speaker 1: it I've got it.

837
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:45,090
Speaker 1: if I didn't lend it to anyone I'll lend it to you, but I think I lent it to someone.

838
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,164
Speaker 0: Oh, well, then I can't be borrowing again.

839
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:47,728
Speaker 1: I will find it.

840
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:48,633
Speaker 1: It's.

841
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:55,942
Speaker 1: it's on my like triple-a top list Like I put it at the top with cowboy bebop and Ava.

842
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:56,724
Speaker 0: No you do.

843
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:58,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what else does.

844
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:00,038
Speaker 1: Oh, I think you might.

845
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,795
Speaker 1: then once you see it all it has It's definitely possible.

846
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:11,650
Speaker 1: It has a scene at the end where somebody salutes somebody and it is off the hook Rainbow Dash.

847
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:16,843
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm gonna talk about a manga that I read now.

848
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:18,370
Speaker 0: it's called seven billion needles.

849
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:22,110
Speaker 0: It was put out by vertical in the US and it's actually only four little volumes.

850
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:29,605
Speaker 0: so you can totally get the whole thing real easy like all right, and Basically the story in seven billion needles is this is girl who's mad bored with everything.

851
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:31,855
Speaker 0: All right, she's in school She doesn't have friends.

852
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:32,681
Speaker 0: She doesn't talk to anyone.

853
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,050
Speaker 0: She sits there with the headphones on all day.

854
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:44,315
Speaker 0: she's like I fuck this shit, right and then she's on the beach for some reason and something comes crashing out of space terrible secret and Actually possesses her.

855
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:47,550
Speaker 0: but it doesn't possess her like you're possessed by the demon.

856
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:53,590
Speaker 0: It's sort of like aha now, I'm living in your body alongside you right some sort of space spirit.

857
00:52:53,710 --> 00:53:00,230
Speaker 0: I'm sort of symbiote right something and it talks to her in her brain, right and It also has incredible powers.

858
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:05,990
Speaker 0: But this thing has morals so it won't just control her without her permission or use her body without her permission.

859
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,038
Speaker 1: Right, how birdie the mighty is a lot of that.

860
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:11,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, cuz it pretty much is about the guy who transforms into right.

861
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, because she punches him to death by accident in any way.

862
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:22,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, so So this thing possesses her and basically tells her look there's some horrible evil thing is basically the opposite of me.

863
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:29,492
Speaker 0: It's an horrible evil thing that possesses and doesn't have morals and wants to like eat your whole world and I chase it here from Outer space.

864
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,181
Speaker 0: so we have to find it and you know do what I say.

865
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:37,841
Speaker 0: and over the course of four volumes It actually, you know, you think of four volumes.

866
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:42,665
Speaker 0: this the story is gonna be find it Get beat by it then come back beat at the end.

867
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:53,476
Speaker 0: But actually Pretty early it's like they encounter it and some crazy shit happens and a big change happens and it swings another direction Really quickly, huh?

868
00:53:54,077 --> 00:54:01,208
Speaker 0: And it's like whoa, that's really surprising and I didn't actually read the fourth volume yet I'm gonna reread from one two, three, four and one go just so I can get the whole picture.

869
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:06,885
Speaker 0: So I could imagine another big swing near the end being very likely.

870
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:26,310
Speaker 0: so, you know If if you like, you know sci-fi animes or mangas at least, you know And you like things that are short and cheap, but also a highbrow Right without a lot of dragging out of fights or anything like that You should definitely pick up all four volumes of seven billion needles at your earliest opportunity.

871
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,500
Speaker 1: Alright, we should probably wind this down.

872
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,506
Speaker 1: I guess I just got one more.

873
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:30,230
Speaker 1: I don't you have any more.

874
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:31,118
Speaker 0: I could do a quick one.

875
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:37,950
Speaker 1: if I'll do a quick one, too I'll skip on all these things that I got listed here, but this is kind of an old one.

876
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:40,790
Speaker 1: But have you actually read any of the earthsakes are a manga?

877
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:42,919
Speaker 0: No, I didn't know there was a manga.

878
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:44,509
Speaker 0: I thought it was incredibly long anime and that was it.

879
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,578
Speaker 1: It's also incredibly long manga.

880
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:48,988
Speaker 0: I did not know that because it's done by miss.

881
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,980
Speaker 1: Let's write incredibly long manga that don't go anywhere.

882
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,767
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess that's true.

883
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:59,766
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so the earthsakes are a manga is up your alley to a degree that is startling you realize.

884
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:02,398
Speaker 0: I'm sure I know it is But it's like I got to get.

885
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,330
Speaker 0: all of earthsakes are is very difficult.

886
00:55:04,663 --> 00:55:09,278
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean everyone I know Read the old volumes that were put out in America.

887
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,510
Speaker 1: that were bound very poorly and fell apart immediately like so fast.

888
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:18,818
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous, but it's like you like Hakaba, Kitaro, I do.

889
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,142
Speaker 1: it's a lot like that.

890
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,590
Speaker 1: It's very like inside baseball.

891
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:27,190
Speaker 0: I would have gotten I would get the entire TV series and all the movies from anime ego.

892
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,330
Speaker 0: But they sort of stopped some of this printing some of them and the DDS are always so expensive.

893
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:37,310
Speaker 0: The thing is they would have just made a slim case with the whole thing Guaranteed in one shot with one empty spot.

894
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,230
Speaker 1: Remember there was that box set of all the movies except two, but that's all the movies.

895
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:50,526
Speaker 0: I want the whole TV series in a slim case of some kind right and all those movies except for number two You know in a box for like a hundred bucks.

896
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:51,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do it.

897
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,606
Speaker 1: So I guess my thing here is all the roomie go Takahashi stuff because I don't think you've.

898
00:55:54,707 --> 00:55:57,590
Speaker 1: actually I mean Did you how much Ranma have you actually seen or read?

899
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,238
Speaker 0: Maybe five to ten episodes.

900
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:02,749
Speaker 1: I've seen like at least half of Ranma.

901
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,729
Speaker 1: How about mezani koku?

902
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:08,699
Speaker 0: One or two episodes and maybe half a manga volume.

903
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:10,624
Speaker 1: I read the whole manga cow style.

904
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:11,547
Speaker 0: I know you did.

905
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,542
Speaker 1: Yeah But I love that that stuff is great.

906
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:17,630
Speaker 1: And I think ursa dessert is my favorite of it.

907
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,481
Speaker 1: But you know what Ranma is some funny shit And I feel like people don't give it enough credit for being so.

908
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:28,804
Speaker 1: I feel like new fans never go to watch Ranma, but I feel like new fans would love Ranma if they just watched it.

909
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,389
Speaker 1: I don't think they realize it's a goonie.

910
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:30,590
Speaker 1: calm.

911
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:38,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's almost like it was a gateway drug of you know, some some bygone era and That it was sort of all used up.

912
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,030
Speaker 0: and now people are you know using Naruto or whatever?

913
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:50,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz in the old days like I would take friends in high school and they'd never even heard of anime I'd be like watch this I'd show them like one episode of Ranma and they're like wait so this is a show about a guy who turns into a girl and that guy

914
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:51,729
Speaker 0: and I really get wet and

915
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:55,425
Speaker 1: And they love it and they turn into anime fans.

916
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:58,557
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe we should try out some Ranma on.

917
00:56:58,577 --> 00:56:59,802
Speaker 0: some people see if it still works.

918
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:02,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might it might it might rabbit.

943
00:57:56,522 --> 00:58:03,580
