1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,616
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday January night.

2
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:12,699
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,988
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,783
Speaker 1: We review bone.

5
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:34,090
Speaker 0: Let's do this So this weekend if all goes according to plan and I have not put much planning into this yet.

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,159
Speaker 0: But but someone else has someone else names.

7
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:38,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have made the mistake of relying on others.

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,279
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is sake we do not often.

9
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,370
Speaker 0: my really just didn't expect this day to come.

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,462
Speaker 1: But you see a lesson you should have learned.

11
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:49,935
Speaker 0: I have not skied in About a decade.

12
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:51,340
Speaker 1: I don't know if skied is a word.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,110
Speaker 1: I think you're supposed to say guns have gone skiing.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,896
Speaker 0: Well, no, I have not undertaken the.

15
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:59,970
Speaker 0: I've not gone skiing nor have I skied the verb ski.

16
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,428
Speaker 0: I have in fact not skied since I lived in Michigan.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,674
Speaker 1: Have a water skiing.

18
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:09,787
Speaker 0: water skiing is not the same thing, but I'm saying it's still skiing.

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,289
Speaker 0: Yes.

20
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:10,630
Speaker 0: You know what?

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,894
Speaker 0: I have not water skied either.

22
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:12,897
Speaker 1: Well, I ski do?

23
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,883
Speaker 0: I have not done that either.

24
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:15,906
Speaker 1: have a ski ball.

25
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,310
Speaker 0: I've played ski ball.

26
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,438
Speaker 1: Oh you skied.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,290
Speaker 0: no because I would have ski balled.

28
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,578
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think those are all skiing.

29
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,770
Speaker 0: you need to be more specific as I have not skied in so long.

30
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:37,364
Speaker 0: but the other Scott when I said you know I'm Larry of suddenly going skiing again because I haven't skied in a been over a decade and He says as skis like riding a bike.

31
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:41,341
Speaker 0: He'll be fine Yeah, and I said, you know what you're right.

32
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,829
Speaker 0: and then I went and bought the stuff I needed to go skiing.

33
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:50,090
Speaker 0: and Then the funny thing is I went to buy the ski jacket and the guys like yeah, there's gonna be no snow in, Pennsylvania.

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,874
Speaker 0: What are you thinking?

35
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:57,079
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm assured wherever we're going There's snow and we're gonna go skiing.

36
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,670
Speaker 0: and if I don't come back on Monday, you can assume that I'm in the hospital.

37
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:12,419
Speaker 1: Well, you know For having you know Even if you haven't gone skiing in a long time if there's gonna be just like shitty shitty crap snow Right and you go to some crap ass ski places.

38
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,945
Speaker 1: That's not so bad cuz it'll be cheaper.

39
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:23,569
Speaker 1: It'll be less crowded and You can get back into skiing and then save your money and your precious weekends for a high quality ski.

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,310
Speaker 1: Well the one sometime later after your skills have improved.

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,495
Speaker 0: Well, we had an alternate plan.

42
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,909
Speaker 0: if the skiing socks we can just sit in the lounge and drink all day.

43
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:32,058
Speaker 1: That's it.

44
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:38,150
Speaker 0: you can do that too, yeah But I think the one thing that might help me out is that I you know, I lived in Michigan.

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,933
Speaker 0: I skied on.

46
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:43,630
Speaker 0: almost all the skiing ever did was in Michigan and we don't get powder so much in Michigan.

47
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,180
Speaker 0: Not that the stuff you want to ski on.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,509
Speaker 0: we basically get ice.

49
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:58,369
Speaker 0: So hopefully the fact that I've skied on nothing but the shittiest of snow my entire life Well, my entire skiing life will allow me to not die this weekend when I'm skiing on ice.

50
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,656
Speaker 1: See my 60-degree weather.

51
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have the guaranteed not die plan.

52
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,488
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's called Scott's patented.

53
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,150
Speaker 0: I'm a wuss.

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,640
Speaker 1: It's called don't go skiing and instead do something else.

55
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:18,190
Speaker 1: like what skiing is sitting in front of the computer skiing Nice and safe when I comfortable Nice and warm - and I skied on a semi-regular basis.

56
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,421
Speaker 0: It was pretty much the best thing in the world.

57
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,049
Speaker 0: skiing is a fantastic sport.

58
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:23,818
Speaker 1: It's an okay sport.

59
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,470
Speaker 0: downhill skiing cross-country skiing is not as fun.

60
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:31,170
Speaker 1: It's not a bad sport, but at the same time it is far too dangerous for my taste.

61
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,048
Speaker 0: It's not dangerous unless you suck or don't learn how to do it right or are really weak.

62
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,513
Speaker 0: if you're really weak It's dangerous.

63
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:43,290
Speaker 1: more people have gotten hurt or killed skiing than racecar driving.

64
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,729
Speaker 0: So yeah But you got to look at the demographic.

65
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:58,954
Speaker 0: More people get hurt on the the black diamond who probably shouldn't be on the black diamond or falling off the ski lift because they Feel I'm not I have evidence of this, but I'm pretty sure like I've seen more Professional skiing people.

66
00:03:58,974 --> 00:03:59,500
Speaker 1: I don't know.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,980
Speaker 1: I guess it maybe it's kind of close have more professional skiing people gotten hurt or professional racecar driving people gotten hurt.

68
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:13,859
Speaker 0: You know, it's hard to say but I can say definitely that people a lot Recreationally get hurt a lot partly because a lot of them are really really stupid.

69
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,524
Speaker 0: I God, all right.

70
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:21,925
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's anime day and this this news kind of came out of nowhere Talking about any anime today.

71
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,469
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about anime.

72
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,943
Speaker 0: All right, so a new type USA is a fairly venerable Publication in the u.s.

73
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,436
Speaker 0: It's I mean it began what when we went to Otacon the first or second time.

74
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:38,589
Speaker 1: second thing was 2002 I think late to the February.

75
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,432
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

76
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually a relatively new anime publication.

77
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,087
Speaker 0: The thing is it is but I don't know maybe five years That's not that long.

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's but it's no proto culture.

79
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:57,069
Speaker 0: But it was based on new type in Japan and I remember before new type USA was Released in the US in English.

80
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,680
Speaker 0: I was fascinated by new type.

81
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:05,159
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Cuz I mean I didn't even you know the idea that there would be actually a magazine just about anime.

82
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,325
Speaker 1: something So obscure was.

83
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:15,028
Speaker 0: it was insane, you know, so no there were other magazines I was talking about more the point that if you don't understand Japanese and you open a new type I was gonna talk about that too.

84
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,137
Speaker 0: So it looks like it's the most fantastic thing ever.

85
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:21,856
Speaker 0: It's beautiful Just pictures and beautiful like yeah shots of every show into anime club.

86
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,580
Speaker 1: and they had new type magazines There's like what the hell is this and it's this huge magazine.

87
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:34,960
Speaker 1: Every page is printed with amazing quality with these amazing images of all these anime I've never seen or heard of and all this information about anime that I can't read.

88
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:41,328
Speaker 1: But I imagined that if I could read it it was giving me all this information I couldn't get anywhere else and it was amazing and I wanted to know.

89
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,905
Speaker 0: so new type was released in America in English as new type USA and it had.

90
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:52,180
Speaker 1: it had some articles by US people some articles that we just translated from the Japanese new type.

91
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:56,054
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I subscribed to it right away and I got the first one and it was great.

92
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,925
Speaker 0: and then I got okay I thought it was great.

93
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:08,140
Speaker 0: And then right about right before I got my first mailed one in the mail I I was reading it again and I realized that I hadn't actually read any words.

94
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:12,560
Speaker 0: I just flipped through it the same way I flipped through the Japanese one and I had this revelation of wait a minute.

95
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,119
Speaker 0: I can read all those words Oh, man.

96
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 0: And I proceeded to discover that there was not a single word worth reading in new type USA.

97
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:41,000
Speaker 1: Well, the issues that I read which were like a handful of the earlier issues of new type USA some of the little tiny blurb kind of things in the back contains somewhat obscure kinds of information and Articles that you really wouldn't find anywhere else and that was somewhat interesting.

98
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,919
Speaker 0: But like those big shots of like a page with all the characters from an anime and then I'm like and four pages about this Anime that's coming out that text wasn't saying it.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,161
Speaker 0: Yes the

100
00:06:49,302 --> 00:07:03,077
Speaker 1: vast majority of it was completely useless and as soon as I you know Thanks to things like anime news network where I can find out about about all the upcoming shows New type USA really didn't have much of a use because I already knew most of the stuff that it was telling me.

101
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,920
Speaker 0: I unsubscribed Before the first issue.

102
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,580
Speaker 0: Unsubscribe Just didn't pay was gonna tell that story.

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,475
Speaker 0: I unsubscribed before the first one came because before the first one came the bill came.

104
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:21,900
Speaker 0: since being a college student I had checked bill me later and I decided well, I'm just now paying for new type.

105
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,024
Speaker 0: That's the end of this.

106
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:29,920
Speaker 0: and I stopped getting new type and I. there have been fewer more worthless publications.

107
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:31,905
Speaker 0: The new type USA.

108
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:37,160
Speaker 1: no, you know as you as bad as new type USA was as somewhat useless as it is.

109
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,151
Speaker 1: It is far from being the most useless magazine.

110
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:40,572
Speaker 0: I don't know.

111
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,580
Speaker 0: soldier of fortune is wonderful.

112
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:46,800
Speaker 0: I mean, how else would I know how I can be a badass in like Zimbabwe?

113
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,011
Speaker 1: It's an okay magazine, but there are many worse magazines trust.

114
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,660
Speaker 0: Don't forget car and driver or a golf digest.

115
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,530
Speaker 1: Plenty of work anybody.

116
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:05,519
Speaker 0: this way new type USA Was was like the biggest for me scam ever because what like it's like it looked so great and then it turns out that those Words didn't say anything.

117
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,396
Speaker 1: Anyway, you're gonna tell the news about new type USA is fucking done.

118
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,300
Speaker 0: That's what the news is.

119
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:17,320
Speaker 0: It's done as of February now according to anime news network They're not sure if it's February or March because the details are scant.

120
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:23,700
Speaker 1: well Because what happens is every magazine in the United States is stupid and they ship like the March issue in February.

121
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,029
Speaker 1: And the you know, it's like.

122
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:33,299
Speaker 1: I never understood why the fuck they do that I'm printing the lead time for printing the lead time for distribution, but just change the month that's written on it.

123
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,102
Speaker 1: It's not hard.

124
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:39,719
Speaker 1: If you know, it's gonna ship in March right March on it, you know, which one is shipping in which month?

125
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,373
Speaker 0: Because the news in it is all from the previous month.

126
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,980
Speaker 0: That's to how publications work.

127
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,742
Speaker 1: So you just it.

128
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:52,024
Speaker 1: so instead of you know, pretending to act like you're actually having providing something useful and up-to-date You're just not even.

129
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,750
Speaker 1: you're just completely saying a fuck it.

130
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,593
Speaker 1: We know we're shit.

131
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,280
Speaker 1: We're super delayed news.

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,786
Speaker 1: That's a month late and completely useless.

133
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,572
Speaker 1: Let's just write the old month on there.

134
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,580
Speaker 0: I don't think that's a legitimate criticism.

135
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:11,320
Speaker 0: I think just a cranky weirdo Magazine that the month of the magazine comes up to new newsstands as opposed to when the stuff in the magazine is from.

136
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:15,131
Speaker 1: Actually, I think what most magazines write like the month after like.

137
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,636
Speaker 1: I think the March ships in February.

138
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,780
Speaker 1: I don't know it's it's stupid.

139
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:18,748
Speaker 0: It's stupid.

140
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker 0: I don't think it's stupid at all.

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,903
Speaker 1: I think it's stupid.

142
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,436
Speaker 1: So in February you want the March magazine to show up.

143
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,825
Speaker 0: I don't care I don't care what month it says.

144
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:27,989
Speaker 0: I read the magazine.

145
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,176
Speaker 1: I don't read any magazines cuz they're stupid.

146
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:33,025
Speaker 0: I don't care you're you hate everything.

147
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:43,960
Speaker 0: so but uh new type USA was worth hating and now it's gone and Theoretically, they're planning to replace it with something but they didn't say what see that that actually that's very telling.

148
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:50,160
Speaker 1: If ADV is getting rid of new type USA, right, but they plan on coming out with another magazine.

149
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:59,640
Speaker 1: Right that tells me that they actually Figured like, you know, their calculation is that they were making money off of it or they would make money off of it.

150
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,280
Speaker 1: But they were probably paying some license fee, you know for the new type name.

151
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,694
Speaker 1: And they are probably paying to get like a lot of new type content and images and stuff.

152
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:23,025
Speaker 1: and I think they're probably bargaining That if They get the same number of subscribers to their new magazine And they don't have to pay all those fees for the content and the licensing from new type Japan or whatever Getting any content from there.

153
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:25,952
Speaker 0: Anyway, they were they did not content.

154
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:26,975
Speaker 0: They were getting pictures.

155
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,439
Speaker 1: They were getting content.

156
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,600
Speaker 0: now I I would barely classify anything in new type is content.

157
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:41,373
Speaker 1: Well, you know, that's the question is that there was a lot of things in new type USA that were translated articles from new type Japan Articles in Japan either.

158
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,977
Speaker 0: what I don't get is why would anyone in Japan read new type?

159
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:45,760
Speaker 1: I don't know they're otaku.

160
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,301
Speaker 1: What do you want?

161
00:10:46,803 --> 00:11:00,592
Speaker 0: but the really interesting thing and this is pointed out here on anime news network But no one knows what new type circulation was because like every stupid Industry thing in all of anime in the u.s.

162
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,480
Speaker 0: No one publishes any information.

163
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,603
Speaker 0: They keep everything secret.

164
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:15,420
Speaker 0: So people guess that new type had between 50,000 and 75,000 Subscribers, but no one knows and no anime magazine publishes Jack, so we can't really say anything beyond that.

165
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:30,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really just don't understand these people keeping it a secret like oh people were know we're doing shidley or they'll know we're doing well, and it's like What do you care that if you're if you're doing shidley people knowing you're doing shidley isn't gonna hurt you.

166
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,354
Speaker 1: You're gonna do shidley no matter what.

167
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:35,229
Speaker 1: and if you're doing well You should brag about how well you're doing.

168
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,294
Speaker 1: is that you might do better.

169
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:38,162
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

170
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:38,744
Speaker 0: huh new type.

171
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a picture of me in you and that's about all I can say about you.

172
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,958
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

173
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:47,188
Speaker 1: So I know I was gonna do.

174
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,300
Speaker 1: I probably had a good news, but I didn't want to look for it.

175
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,585
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna do a geek back.

176
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,894
Speaker 1: I've decided not geek bite big bite.

177
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,300
Speaker 0: Why do you keep saying geek bag?

178
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,962
Speaker 1: I don't know.

179
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,107
Speaker 1: It's a better word.

180
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:56,789
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think you came up with geek bite.

182
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,747
Speaker 1: I came up with both of them.

183
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,937
Speaker 0: Well, you should have should have chosen better.

184
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:15,400
Speaker 1: Yes anyway I've decided that there usually aren't a lot of good news is on Wednesday and we usually just read anime news network because it's the Only website with anime news and there's a new type USA is going away.

185
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good news, but there's only once and occasionally there's a you know an underwear pervert news from like newsarama.

186
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,358
Speaker 1: But that's it.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,466
Speaker 1: So I'm doing more geek bites on Wednesdays because I read a lot of comics and things that you know Doesn't read.

188
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:27,889
Speaker 1: so I got.

189
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,079
Speaker 1: I got to get him out to you, right?

190
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:34,472
Speaker 1: So in my box of comics this month came this comic called wanton soup.

191
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:35,454
Speaker 1: You like wanton soup.

192
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,297
Speaker 0: I do.

193
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:39,849
Speaker 1: All right by James stoke away.

194
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,338
Speaker 1: I probably said his name wrong.

195
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:54,300
Speaker 1: st Okay, oh e it's an oni press which is the same people who publish Scott Pilgrim and the same format is Scott Pilgrim You know, it's a. it's a you know, little manga size digest deal, but it's printed left to right because it's you know American.

196
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:54,966
Speaker 1: It's not a manga.

197
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,500
Speaker 1: It's just a comic book like Scott Pilgrim.

198
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,260
Speaker 1: The artistic style it's pretty good arts.

199
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,653
Speaker 1: there's some you know, it's got manga style paneling and such.

200
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:12,440
Speaker 1: but the art style is sort of gorillas ish and like punk kids styling and It's not the greatest comic in the world.

201
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,140
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie, but it's just sort of fun and sort of happy.

202
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:30,699
Speaker 1: basically, the story is this guy named Johnny boyo, yeah great name and He's got a friend deacon vans and deacon vans loves the ladies and Johnny boyo loves cooking and they're truckers in space

203
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,372
Speaker 0: uh-huh,

204
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:49,087
Speaker 1: and basically, it turns into Johnny boyo goes back to his cooking school that he dropped out of to become a space trucker and It's all sort of like initial D but with cooking and but it's not you know that and alone I mean that's been done before.

205
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:53,758
Speaker 1: there's plenty of cooking animes and things, you know Ironwalk whatever and such like that, right?

206
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:08,057
Speaker 1: But because this is in space all of the things they cook are like completely made-up alien dishes and people are using like alien he like has to cook against aliens who have like, you know, two bodies and extra arms and legs and the.

207
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:16,999
Speaker 1: the tasting judge is a giant tongue and It's not really, you know amazing or anything, but it's just fun and I enjoyed it.

208
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:21,568
Speaker 1: so if you think you'd like that, this is a Cheap.

209
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,869
Speaker 1: it's 12 bucks From only press.

210
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,179
Speaker 1: it's probably in stores near you.

211
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:27,916
Speaker 1: wonton soup.

212
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:52,634
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day now, uh, this was announced at CES and normally I talk about this on a Monday But I have to talk about this on a Wednesday because it does not bode Well for people who do not want to see certain things that anime conventions There has always been.

213
00:14:52,734 --> 00:15:04,630
Speaker 0: kind of one of the holy grails of cell phones for people who are nuts about cell phones is What if my cell phone were also a projector and I just project video onto a surface?

214
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:12,990
Speaker 1: It's not something that's always been a holy grail But there have been many companies developing such technology and demonstrating it sort of like people have been making and demonstrating.

215
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:27,524
Speaker 1: You know flexible papers and things like that, you know It's one of those technologies that people are always showing off at trade shows and you know showing development versions of it and Stuff like that, but no one ever actually makes it happen for real.

216
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,190
Speaker 1: I'm real consumer products.

217
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:31,639
Speaker 1: It's just something always you see auditing on and gadget.

218
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,309
Speaker 1: you see pictures on the internet, but it never comes to life.

219
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:44,970
Speaker 0: now the situation here is that it exists and it pretty much works and Very rich people and people who really really care are gonna start having these things in the relatively near future.

220
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:52,150
Speaker 0: Now what is going to happen gonna give you a little look into the future is going to be the same thing that happened when?

221
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,782
Speaker 0: Laser pens came into existence.

222
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,189
Speaker 1: We're talking like two three years from now.

223
00:15:56,611 --> 00:16:02,128
Speaker 0: I mean basically laser pens existed, but they were really really expensive and they were kind of useless.

224
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:09,679
Speaker 0: so fancy-pants professors and people who had way too much money and way too little sense own laser pens and They use them to impress people.

225
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,330
Speaker 0: when they gave you know presentations.

226
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,078
Speaker 1: They used them for science experiment.

227
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:17,967
Speaker 0: very few people because if you were doing a science experiment You probably just had a laser we used.

228
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:24,010
Speaker 1: well No, we used them in like middle school to do like, you know tests of like refraction and stuff like that.

229
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,813
Speaker 0: Wow in middle school.

230
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,581
Speaker 0: We just had like argon lasers.

231
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:28,550
Speaker 1: Ah, we had laser pens.

232
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:41,540
Speaker 0: But anyway laser pens eventually got under $100 and once they were less than $100 and you could buy them in Radio Shack for like 70 80 bucks Every kid in the goddamn world had a laser pen.

233
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,228
Speaker 0: you would walk down the street and there'd be red dots everywhere.

234
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,506
Speaker 0: to be red Dots in people's living rooms because the kid across the street is shooting it from the roof.

235
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,210
Speaker 0: go to a movie theater There'd be 50 red dots on the face.

236
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:55,703
Speaker 0: It just it went nuts and if I like about a month or two eventually died down.

237
00:16:55,743 --> 00:17:00,126
Speaker 1: the novelty ended but also the police Threats sort of made it die down.

238
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:06,869
Speaker 0: also I think the only reason it really ended was that people explored all of the things you could do with a laser pen not much.

239
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,027
Speaker 0: And that was the end of it.

240
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:16,329
Speaker 0: now Imagine if instead of projecting a little red dot you could project full motion 24 frame-per-second yaoi.

241
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,444
Speaker 1: Great, of course, you know if it's the lights are bright.

242
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:21,810
Speaker 1: It's probably not gonna be too visible.

243
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:35,650
Speaker 0: Oh, no But you're gonna be in a showing room and you're gonna be trying to watch a kuji bk Unbalanced and then suddenly there's gonna be penises all over all the walls Not to mention it won't work from too far away from the wall.

244
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,309
Speaker 1: So someone ought to be sitting right near the wall to make it work and to make it.

245
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,631
Speaker 1: You know

246
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:52,725
Speaker 0: the thing is I'm interested to see exactly what happens with all this because you know There's always that guy or that girl at the anime con who's sitting there in the hallway and a lot of times you'll see them Multiple days in the same spot and they'll have like their laptop and on their laptop.

247
00:17:52,745 --> 00:18:08,048
Speaker 0: They've got all the anime music videos They downloaded from somewhere or they've got like DDR and they just sit there playing DDR with their fingers not even on a pad or Watching these music videos or watching these fan subs Attempting to gather crowds and eventually they will.

248
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,521
Speaker 0: I love these little pockets of people kind of surrounding these attention whores.

249
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:14,130
Speaker 1: try and I there's that one guy who does it.

250
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,197
Speaker 1: I think it katsu khan and a kinetic on.

251
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:22,062
Speaker 1: he just sets up his little computer and he plays stuff and people sit around Watching it and he's like gets all into it.

252
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,229
Speaker 1: He's a very strange man.

253
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:28,286
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a lot more of that once these things start getting more commonplace.

254
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,932
Speaker 0: So be Warned.

255
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,950
Speaker 1: yeah in two or three years anime conventions gonna get scary.

256
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:41,389
Speaker 1: You know that it's gonna be real scary when like the iPhone has a projector and you just aim the iPhone at the wall And then the video you bought on iTunes shows up.

257
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,393
Speaker 0: I mean at least luckily for now, we're not gonna have to worry too much because the people who buy these are gonna be You know attention.

258
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,062
Speaker 0: Oh my god, check out my thing.

259
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:55,169
Speaker 0: the same people have iPhones now But at the same time they'll be relatively rare and I'm not too worried, but give it a couple years and yeah.

260
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,243
Speaker 1: But yeah this year you should.

261
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:04,088
Speaker 1: this year You will see at least one phone become available somewhere in the world that has a projector in it to consumers.

262
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,853
Speaker 1: scary All right.

263
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,159
Speaker 1: That was your thing of the day not a news.

264
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

265
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,249
Speaker 1: Okay, so check this out.

266
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,141
Speaker 1: Apparently this is this is as reported by Kotaku.

267
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:16,190
Speaker 1: So whatever but they got it from a Japanese site, which is linked.

268
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,728
Speaker 0: Oh, so some guy on the internet in Japan pictures just pictures.

269
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:37,688
Speaker 1: basically, they they have word that criminals are Hunting Japanese otaku, right because there have been like cases in Japan of like, you know otaku getting stabbed and otaku getting mugged and Otaku are being targeted by criminals, right?

270
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:47,130
Speaker 1: Apparently police in Shinjuku have been stopping people who look like otaku and subjecting them to like spot checks.

271
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,080
Speaker 1: So they'll be like the anyone who looks like an otaku.

272
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,679
Speaker 1: the police see them they stop them and then they search them for you Illegal stuffs, right?

273
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,965
Speaker 1: I guess you can do that in Japan.

274
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,930
Speaker 1: I wouldn't fly in the u.s.

275
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,780
Speaker 0: But wait a minute, but I thought the otaku were the victims.

276
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:07,750
Speaker 1: So that's why it makes no sense, but apparently a Supposed police list describes what types of individuals?

277
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,779
Speaker 1: Cops should check right?

278
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,130
Speaker 1: So here's the list of criteria.

279
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,482
Speaker 1: The police in Japan are looking forward to see who they should check you ready.

280
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:18,338
Speaker 0: aside from the fact that this is creepy police state Action, this ought to be hilarious.

281
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,699
Speaker 1: people wearing camouflage trousers or jackets People with chains or keys hanging off the trousers.

282
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, people who look weak.

00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:33,054
Speaker 1: Yeah people wearing a bandana people wearing leather leather so Basically, that's like.

284
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:38,309
Speaker 1: apparently that's a lot of otaku in Japan apparently meet those descriptions.

285
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:41,398
Speaker 0: Wow Should we give the list of what an American otaku is?

286
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,470
Speaker 0: kind of chubby kind of flabby kind of pale.

288
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway a million shots keys hanging from their keychain.

289
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,010
Speaker 0: Yeah and a bus pass.

290
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:55,270
Speaker 1: so To see if those rumors right were true, right?

291
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,462
Speaker 1: This guy went to Shinjuku and he Drake.

292
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,350
Speaker 1: he followed all of those rules.

293
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,210
Speaker 1: He where he wore camouflage pants and Chad chains with keys and he had a bandana and like a leather jacket.

294
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:16,616
Speaker 1: Well, yeah the whole thing right to see if he got stopped and he did get stopped Right, but he put a note in his back He was wearing a backpack to that.

295
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:21,797
Speaker 1: the police would obviously want to search right and in that backpack He was only one thing.

296
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:25,070
Speaker 1: It was a note that said bummer failure.

297
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,197
Speaker 1: So, yeah check this out.

298
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:35,841
Speaker 1: is either a picture of him holding up the note and there's a picture of him with the police on The note and it's it's pretty funny.

299
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:40,889
Speaker 0: So if this is legitimate then the Japan - - cuz that's not cool.

300
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:45,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I still don't it makes no sense that if otaku were being targets of crime.

301
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,250
Speaker 0: Why would they target otaku?

302
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

303
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,130
Speaker 1: it could be something that's lost in translation.

304
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,130
Speaker 0: Maybe they think that otaku or I don't know doing bad things and then the criminal elements are targeting them because of that.

305
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,669
Speaker 0: Maybe they think people are dressing up like otaku to do these things.

306
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:06,144
Speaker 1: I have no idea but that's that's what it says here and I have to.

307
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,810
Speaker 1: I can't read the Japanese site.

308
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,993
Speaker 1: Someone else can try to read it.

309
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:09,876
Speaker 1: See what it really says.

310
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,360
Speaker 1: But yeah great.

311
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,354
Speaker 0: So anyway tonight we're gonna talk about yet again a Comic book.

00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,464
Speaker 1: Oh snap rims reading the comics.

Speaker 1: Yeah So what comic are we gonna talk about?

316
00:22:23,537 --> 00:22:25,144
Speaker 0: Oh, you want me to introduce it?

317
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:26,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could introduce it.

318
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,706
Speaker 0: Well this thing it's something that I think most people are aware exists.

319
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:34,162
Speaker 0: I mean even when I was a kid I remember seeing this you're like, oh, it's that thing.

320
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,806
Speaker 0: I know about that.

321
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:35,509
Speaker 1: you were a kid.

322
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:41,620
Speaker 0: Well when I was when I was a kid, I mean before college Uh-huh, and I think oh it's that thing.

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,350
Speaker 0: everyone like you'd see it in places and you'd hear about it.

324
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:50,702
Speaker 0: a lot of people who were into comics talked about it, but Never read it and I didn't know a lot of people who had read it.

325
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,329
Speaker 0: So I didn't really know much about it.

326
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when I saw this around, you know Like basically I saw images of it I could recognize it and I didn't know what it was called and later I did know what it was called.

327
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,762
Speaker 1: But I sort of I sort of like associated it with like, you know Johnny the homicidal maniac and and all those sort.

328
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:13,070
Speaker 1: I thought it was one of those kind of comics You know for like, you know the punk goth kids.

329
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,750
Speaker 1: It was that I thought it was one of their kind of things and I didn't really know about it.

330
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:21,988
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people in general Recognize if they see it, they recognize it.

331
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:22,170
Speaker 1: they go.

332
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,430
Speaker 1: I've seen that somewhere But you don't really know what it is or maybe you know what it's called except for people who've read it.

333
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,816
Speaker 0: I don't know.

334
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:32,456
Speaker 0: my mice was different in that, you know I'd always go to comic shops because I was.

335
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:37,833
Speaker 0: I kind of wanted to get into comic books and I always see it there and I read.

336
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:44,270
Speaker 0: I think like one of the issues I didn't know it was this giant continuous story and I just didn't I don't know.

337
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:51,449
Speaker 1: Yep, so we're talking about today is bone by Jeff Smith and only Jeff Smith and no one else.

338
00:23:52,031 --> 00:24:00,294
Speaker 0: Bone is the story of three bones from Bonville who leave Bonville and go on an epic journey and eventually Return to Bonville.

339
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:06,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should go and search on the internet and you'll see what these bone Characters look like and you'll go.

340
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,415
Speaker 1: Oh that's what you guys talking about.

341
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:21,908
Speaker 1: in case you don't know already cuz I'm sure if you're a geek you've seen this before somewhere and If you'd haven't realized this they're called bones because well They look like bones and they're from Bonville and their names are smiley bone phony bone and phone bone.

342
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:26,361
Speaker 0: Yep Now I finally read it and bone is really this kind of.

343
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:32,710
Speaker 0: it's not what I expected based on even what I'd read before And just on you know what you expect from those kind of characters.

344
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, you look at the cover of this comic and or any you have to you.

345
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:40,994
Speaker 1: really you cannot guess even what genre This thing is.

346
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:42,784
Speaker 1: but when you actually read it you go.

347
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,436
Speaker 1: Oh And it you it's a job.

348
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,364
Speaker 1: It's not like a surprise or anything.

349
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,910
Speaker 1: It's not like something new and original.

350
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,010
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's a. it's a type of story that has been told before.

351
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,838
Speaker 1: It's just not what you would expect from looking at it.

352
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:55,159
Speaker 0: it.

353
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,477
Speaker 0: to sum it up bone is basically just a straight-up Fantasy.

354
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:04,899
Speaker 1: it's an all-ages Epic adventure fantasy story, that's what it is.

355
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:16,570
Speaker 0: It just so happens that the three main characters are Extremely stylized and really don't fit in with the entire rest of the comic at all.

356
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,883
Speaker 0: Yep, but other than that, it's just a straight-up fantasy comic and that's the end of it.

357
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,955
Speaker 1: Well, it's a very long Straight up.

358
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,799
Speaker 0: It is very long.

359
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,126
Speaker 0: It was over 50 issues.

360
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:28,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, this thing it was a lot.

361
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:38,630
Speaker 1: it there was basically this came out a lot of issues like 50 something issues and it came Out over the course of a long number of years and there was no regular schedule wasn't like monthly.

362
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,037
Speaker 1: It was an issue came out.

363
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,324
Speaker 1: They waited a bunch.

364
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:42,450
Speaker 1: another issue came out.

365
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,143
Speaker 1: Can you imagine of trying to read this when it was coming out in issues?

366
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,510
Speaker 1: It would have been so painful.

367
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:48,497
Speaker 1: You know you would have been over 10 years.

368
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:52,150
Speaker 1: you'd be getting an issue and having no clue when the next issue was coming.

369
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:59,670
Speaker 1: Right, but now you can get all of bone in one volume one tremendous vine, which is what I have.

370
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,330
Speaker 1: Which is what we read which is the bone one volume edition and it's this gigantic fat paperback book.

371
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,719
Speaker 1: It's actually relatively cheap for what you get.

372
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,270
Speaker 1: It's black and white and it's every issue.

373
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:16,308
Speaker 0: I'd highly recommend if you want to read bone and you'll probably want to read bone because it's pretty enjoyable That you get that.

374
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:22,483
Speaker 1: Yeah Because you don't want 50 or so little issue that are gonna be hard to get now if you're wealthy.

375
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:28,910
Speaker 1: if you are wealthy you can get each Individual chapter of bone right and it's either separate volumes.

376
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,549
Speaker 1: I don't think all the volumes are out yet.

377
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:36,370
Speaker 1: You can get it in color because they're releasing these color volumes chapter by chapter, and they haven't done all the chapters.

378
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,173
Speaker 1: Maybe they have.

379
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:43,161
Speaker 1: you can buy color chapters instead of the one big black and white volume if you really want color And you're willing to pay for it.

380
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:43,646
Speaker 1: They have it.

381
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,156
Speaker 1: so What else are we gonna say about bone?

382
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,783
Speaker 0: well the story is actually.

383
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:49,546
Speaker 0: there's some.

384
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,890
Speaker 0: there's a lot of interesting I guess things to talk about related to bone.

385
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,370
Speaker 0: I kind of want to avoid talking about the plot in any great death because it goes so far from where it begins.

386
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:58,855
Speaker 1: Well, we could.

387
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:05,590
Speaker 1: we could talk about the beginning of the plot though The premise is you have this place called Boneville and there's these bones living there, right?

388
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,094
Speaker 0: But you don't even start with that.

389
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:10,344
Speaker 0: you start with three bones who have been run out of Boneville.

390
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:14,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, because one of them Epically failed to run for mayor.

391
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,830
Speaker 1: I was about to say that they were run out of Boneville.

392
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,137
Speaker 1: So these three bones got run out of town.

393
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:27,830
Speaker 1: So they're basically exiled and they're in this middle of nowhere and Eventually, they end up somewhere else where the story takes place.

394
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:36,322
Speaker 0: Yeah it's kind of like they get lost and they wander around and they end up in this kind of Normal fantasy world where everyone looks like a normal fantasy character.

395
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:38,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, three of them look like comic book characters.

396
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:44,653
Speaker 1: It's almost like an escaflowne a kind of transported to a fantasy world story except they're not Transported.

397
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:56,156
Speaker 0: they just walk to one and that they didn't know was there and then the snows fall and they can't get back and then They get separated and caught up in this kind of crazy Escalating story that it gets.

398
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 0: it gets very epic toward the end.

399
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:01,010
Speaker 1: I think the two things I like most about bone, right?

400
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,173
Speaker 1: well, first of all, the art is Cart.

401
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:04,815
Speaker 1: it's like the.

402
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:13,685
Speaker 1: I can't really imagine art that takes fantasy But also like cartoonish art and combines it in such a way in which they can.

403
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:19,444
Speaker 1: you know at times the art will be like Whoa, and at other times it could be funny and it it totally works.

404
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,247
Speaker 1: I don't know.

405
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,130
Speaker 1: It's just myth.

406
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:29,589
Speaker 0: I think that my favorite thing is that the boat like you'll get really into it and whenever something like one of the bones gets Punched or something or it's something frightening or horrible happens.

407
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:39,426
Speaker 0: They'll often make this face where their eyes go buggy with a dot in the middle and their mouth kind of goes open and it's Such a cartoony thing, but I cracked up out loud every time I saw it.

408
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:40,349
Speaker 0: It just fits so well.

409
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:43,824
Speaker 1: Also, one thing I like is that there are dragons in this story.

410
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:45,210
Speaker 1: Oh awesome drag.

411
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,457
Speaker 0: I think I have to point out that the way dragons are portrayed in bone is Exactly how I like dragons to be part.

412
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:51,939
Speaker 1: I think that's.

413
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,130
Speaker 1: everyone says that is pretty much that it's a fantasy story.

414
00:28:55,471 --> 00:29:00,110
Speaker 1: There's dragons there's magic there's wizards and warlocks and whatnot, right?

415
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:10,260
Speaker 0: But the one dragon that you see the dragon that is involved in the story the most of all the other drag is the most Even-keeled thing you will ever see in anywhere the best character.

416
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,506
Speaker 1: Oh god, of course that that's you know.

417
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:19,410
Speaker 1: saying he's the best character is That's like say man, you know, you watch something like full metal alchemist or something.

418
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,565
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of characters and some you like a lot and some not so much.

419
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:23,570
Speaker 1: in bone.

420
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:32,090
Speaker 1: Every character is super awesome Just some slightly more awesome than others and I think that's the biggest strength of bone is that every character is like your favorite.

421
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:33,623
Speaker 1: You can't except for the dragon.

422
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:34,389
Speaker 1: who's the most favorite?

423
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,356
Speaker 0: The dragon pretty much wins out.

424
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:42,277
Speaker 0: I just the look on his face and that look pretty much Never like it changes so many things.

425
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,801
Speaker 1: he says I did.

426
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,590
Speaker 1: Ah, but even the bad guys are awesome in this thing.

427
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,490
Speaker 0: I think my favorite bad guys, however are these stupid stupid fat rat creatures?

428
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:52,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, those those are also.

429
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,802
Speaker 1: those are right up there.

430
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:57,177
Speaker 1: But uh rock job John rock job.

431
00:29:57,318 --> 00:29:57,840
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

432
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,708
Speaker 1: It's also an amazing job.

433
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,377
Speaker 0: Yeah And part of it's just the way they're drawn.

434
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,885
Speaker 0: I mean rock jaw rock jaw in particular.

435
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,590
Speaker 0: Just he's a cat, right?

436
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:17,683
Speaker 0: He's this giant mountain cat and he's drawn and portrayed so I guess as accurately cat-like as a being like that would be if it existed in the real world.

437
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:22,500
Speaker 0: just in terms of his facial expressions in the Way he reacts to things is just beautiful.

438
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:22,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

439
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,030
Speaker 1: No wonder it took this guy so long to make this thing.

440
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it took him that long, at least he did a good job.

441
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, talk about characters staying on model.

442
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:36,246
Speaker 1: Good God Yeah, I mean it's one dude making this whole thing and that's not common in you know, u.s.

443
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:37,610
Speaker 1: Comics or anything like that.

444
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,033
Speaker 1: That's you know.

445
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,030
Speaker 1: in manga that's more common, but they have assistance.

446
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,967
Speaker 1: This guy did the whole thing on his own Tezuka style in.

447
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:53,989
Speaker 0: now The main characters are phone bone and phone civil P bone aka phony bone and they look the same except that Phony bone wears a shirt with a star on it and phone bones pretty much naked

448
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:54,732
Speaker 1: yep,

449
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:59,824
Speaker 0: and uh phone bones a pretty nice guy and phone civil is a complete jackass.

450
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:04,215
Speaker 1: and smiley bone is sort of like the Smiley bones an idiot savant.

451
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:10,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like the comic relief, you know tall kinda, you know funny guy who's like on this.

452
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:13,129
Speaker 1: that's sort of like a Marx Brothers set up in a way.

453
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:16,646
Speaker 1: and Smiley bones sort of like, you know, he hangs with.

454
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:20,623
Speaker 1: you know Phony bone, you know and sort of does the bad stuff with him.

455
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:23,317
Speaker 0: and you know, he's totally moral He doesn't care at all.

456
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,470
Speaker 0: He does a bad thing good thing whatever just does things.

457
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:30,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just you know, he just he's just chillin hanging out doing what people want going along with the show seeing what happens.

458
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:39,877
Speaker 0: Now, of course, I can't forget cuz I love his name and I love every time I see him King Doc King that King Doc is this.

459
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,689
Speaker 0: the smiley is dude, but it's not a good kind of smiley.

460
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:48,531
Speaker 1: It's so great how that the way they draw the smiles on King Doc and his henchmen, you know It's.

461
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:57,345
Speaker 1: it's like a big toothy smile that is simultaneously like happy evil Hungry and scary and dangerous and all at the same time.

462
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:58,630
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty terrific.

463
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:08,070
Speaker 0: Now the one I guess the only criticism I have about bone and I guess I can get this out right away Is that I read the whole thing in one effective go over the course of about a week.

464
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:10,069
Speaker 1: I read it in a go in like a couple days.

465
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:27,910
Speaker 0: Well, I only read it on the train and I usually sleep in the morning so I read it on the way home, but The only thing I can say bad about bones that reading it in one go or one go ish at about the two-thirds point It starts to get a little bit cliche and you start to lose like you start to lose the drive.

466
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:31,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely you know, it is all terrific.

467
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:34,606
Speaker 1: But this it definitely feels to me right.

468
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:46,788
Speaker 1: then when I read it There's a point at which Like the first part of the plot is like coming to a head like the first Climax in the story like big climax, right and there's a huge reveal and I really felt that.

469
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:47,570
Speaker 1: I don't know.

470
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,459
Speaker 1: I'd have to ask Jeff Smith to see if this is true.

471
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:58,134
Speaker 1: But the impression I get I don't know how many times I'm gonna say that is that that first reveal was like planned from the beginning Right, and that was the plan.

472
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:04,470
Speaker 1: and then after that he sorta didn't have that planned out as well as he had points up.

473
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:11,642
Speaker 1: So it's like part a. we had a super plan written for it and it's executed beautifully And after that the plan is not so perfect.

474
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,630
Speaker 0: Well, I know there was at least a secondary plan.

475
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,831
Speaker 0: I've read in multiple places that he drew the last page of bone very early on Uh-huh.

476
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:25,674
Speaker 0: However, the last page is kind of predictable even from the beginning and it's it's kind of a standard ending that oh, okay That's what happens.

477
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:25,976
Speaker 1: Yeah.

478
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:33,850
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's an all it's a story for everybody It's all ages so you can't expect like some horrible terrible ending or anything like that.

479
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:45,179
Speaker 0: However, the the big reveal Scott is talking about I mean pretty much my favorite things in order are this reveal the dragon Rokja and then pretty much everything else.

480
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:51,041
Speaker 0: but the big reveal the the epic mo I mean there's basically you kind of wondering where this is going.

481
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:59,572
Speaker 0: and there's a lot of mysteries as to why all these dread the dragon and all these people care about these bones who had nothing to do with this world and what's Going on.

482
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:03,549
Speaker 0: and why does the hooded one await he who bears the star and?

483
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:09,409
Speaker 0: basically one thing leads to another and There's that that epic reveal happens where?

484
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,710
Speaker 0: Something comes over the horizon and something is revealed in epic glory.

485
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:24,103
Speaker 0: And I remember when I read that page I flipped to that page and it blindsided me and in retrospect I could have seen it in common, but yeah retrospect.

486
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:25,409
Speaker 0: No one sees this coming, right?

487
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,216
Speaker 1: I think that's the best thing.

488
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,681
Speaker 1: plot-wise about Bowen is how.

489
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:29,485
Speaker 0: that's the best thing.

490
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:41,152
Speaker 1: like any comic book ever He puts little bits into the story right that are sort of Off-handed or like he'll have like a like a chapter or a part of a chapter right like a file like a multiple page sequence.

491
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,659
Speaker 1: that's telling a joke because it's you know it's comedic.

492
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:55,860
Speaker 1: early on a lot of I think a lot of the best big adventure Stories start out sort of comedic and happy to let you introduce you to the characters and and grow to like them While just planting a seed of the big plot which is revealed later.

493
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:58,430
Speaker 1: that bone does that as well as anything has ever done.

494
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,590
Speaker 0: it Yeah, definitely ramps up these serious and ramps down the humor, but doesn't eliminate the humor.

495
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,818
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't eliminate the humor at all.

496
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,693
Speaker 1: there are many other things that do that though But this reveal.

497
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:15,478
Speaker 0: when I saw it I stared at it for about a second and I dropped the stupid book I was laughing out loud so hard it was.

498
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,290
Speaker 0: that was that that that alone makes bone worth reading.

499
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:23,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my even if you don't like bone get to that point You'll know it when it happens.

500
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,370
Speaker 1: that is that is the biggest reveal.

501
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:35,529
Speaker 1: But there are many other things in the book where they drop a small hint in like a joke or they bring something up Like in like a page or a panel, but they they make you notice it you won't forget it.

502
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:42,097
Speaker 1: Well, you'll forget it, but when they remind you of it ten chapters later You'll remember that you saw it and it.

503
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:43,483
Speaker 1: I love it.

504
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:47,597
Speaker 1: when that happens when they give you something You put it in the trunk right.

505
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,208
Speaker 1: I mean normally you get the sort of scooby-doo effect the what's it?

506
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:51,850
Speaker 1: What's his name?

507
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,573
Speaker 0: Chekhov's gun.

508
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:54,677
Speaker 1: Chekhov's gun, right?

509
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:57,750
Speaker 1: It's someone is trying to foreshadow something.

510
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:08,970
Speaker 1: It stands out like a sore thumb, you know, it means something later You've got your eye on it And then eventually when it reappears like it's going to you say I saw that coming a mile away.

511
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,813
Speaker 1: It was Chekhov's gun.

512
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:13,870
Speaker 1: It was scooby-doo, you know that that door in the background, you know was drawn.

513
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:17,650
Speaker 1: I'm obviously drawn in the cell and on the background so I knew it was gonna be animated.

514
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,623
Speaker 1: So I knew a zombie was gonna come out of it.

515
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:31,590
Speaker 1: You're not fooling anybody Right, but he basically does Chekhov's gun and you forget about the gun Which is so hard to do from a writing and art perspective and he pulls it off multiple times.

516
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:33,035
Speaker 1: Let's do it 100% of the time.

517
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:41,910
Speaker 1: there were eventually and I think that's part of why the sort of towards the end It gets a little bit cliche because he the Chekhov's gunning is not so accurate.

518
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:49,857
Speaker 0: Yeah pretty much a lot of the events that take place at the end kind of come out of nowhere and actually Later on in the story It seems like there's like you.

519
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:53,082
Speaker 0: when an issue ends and the next one begins or a volume ends The next one begins.

520
00:36:53,123 --> 00:37:04,060
Speaker 0: in the book There's often a bit of a disconnect or the the the the action really gets interrupted and things kind of don't always Line up a hundred percent right around the transitions.

521
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,074
Speaker 0: Yep, but seriously that reveal I Cannot express to you.

522
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:21,036
Speaker 0: I people were looking at me at the train because I dropped the book was on the on the ground Gigantic book and I'm just laughing Uncontrollably, it was epic And the whole thing is epic.

523
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:25,130
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you know, there aren't too many epic adventure fantasy stories out there.

524
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:28,514
Speaker 1: This is one of the best ones top 10 probably It's also get.

525
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:32,810
Speaker 0: the end is kind of melancholy as I guess all epic things tend to be.

526
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,428
Speaker 0: I mean look at the end of Lord of the Rings how?

527
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,280
Speaker 0: Melancholy to use the word again it is.

528
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,229
Speaker 0: I mean it's over and just and everyone's Can't quite deal with what's happened to them.

529
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:49,109
Speaker 1: We went on a big adventure and you know everything happened and now it was gonna happen.

530
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:55,790
Speaker 0: now Now it's over and a lot of moving life and a lot of stories and at like the climax happens.

531
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,990
Speaker 0: And then our and happily ever after and bone does the thing that I loved so much.

532
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,970
Speaker 0: Escaflowne did this the Lord of the Rings did this where you did it?

533
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:19,750
Speaker 0: It's over and then you get what comes after and what comes after is always very Interesting and often kind of sad and kind of not necessarily anti-climactic but like the feeling you have when a journey's over and You have to continue living your life.

534
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,940
Speaker 0: You no longer have this goal in front of you that you've.

535
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,170
Speaker 0: this goal has been everything you've cared about It's.

536
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:27,102
Speaker 0: you know Frodo's got the ring and the ring is all that matters in the world.

537
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,347
Speaker 0: and now he's done it.

538
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:28,990
Speaker 0: the Rings gone.

539
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:29,748
Speaker 0: now what?

540
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,844
Speaker 1: Go to the Grey Havens and chill.

541
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:34,730
Speaker 0: Well, that's one answer.

542
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,016
Speaker 0: Sam wise was cool.

543
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:41,469
Speaker 0: He's like, alright, I'm gonna go back to Hobbiton and be a hobbit.

544
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:46,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then it was kind of like sitting around More an old Hobbiton.

545
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:46,195
Speaker 1: Yep.

546
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,180
Speaker 1: Yep.

547
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:51,815
Speaker 0: Yep There's another interest.

548
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,850
Speaker 1: or like riding the big rollercoaster and riding a little rollercoaster.

549
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,150
Speaker 1: You know, I mean having a family like you did in Hobbiton is a little rollercoaster.

550
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,730
Speaker 1: But you go to Mordor and then you go back and you have to deal with more dog.

551
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,077
Speaker 1: You have to deal with your punk kids.

552
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:06,630
Speaker 1: you're like whatever my kids I can keep them in line.

553
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:20,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a you know, no, it's like doing cocaine and then doing less cocaine One that I don't know what that was like one thing One thing that I found really interesting and I I don't really want to.

554
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:27,227
Speaker 0: I guess it's not much of a spoiler in saying that This does not terribly come up but I was kind of surprised it didn't.

555
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:33,698
Speaker 0: but All throughout the first half of bone and even all the way through the end and they keep this checkoffs gun Keeps being showed you.

556
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,969
Speaker 0: they keep showing you this gun.

557
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,730
Speaker 0: But and even after some some things happen, they still show you the gun.

558
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,730
Speaker 0: It's like well the guns are even fired and I don't think there's any more bullets in it.

559
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,755
Speaker 0: Why do they keep showing it to me?

560
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:51,292
Speaker 0: But it is obvious that Bonville is basically the modern world Bonville.

561
00:39:51,432 --> 00:40:06,179
Speaker 0: they keep referencing things in Bonville offhandedly and it's obvious that Bonville is a progressive modern Democratic society that has probably electricity and nuclear power plants and just a normal civilized world.

562
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:28,206
Speaker 0: and they put this fact in your face all the time with little asides even near the end where this one like in the very end like when these climaxes are happening and something comes up with food and this mystic suggests to smileybone that he tried this this stinky cheese and Fonsible makes a remark to the effect of you people with your like unprocessed food.

563
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,210
Speaker 0: What are you trying to kill us?

564
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,887
Speaker 0: Don't people know how to cook around here?

565
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,290
Speaker 0: And all these references and that fucking doesn't really come up at all in all of bone?

566
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:38,757
Speaker 0: No, not really except in one time.

567
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,983
Speaker 0: one time it comes up barely.

568
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess grind it that one time.

569
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,329
Speaker 1: All right, is there anything else we got to say?

570
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:48,053
Speaker 0: I don't know.

571
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,448
Speaker 0: There's a lot of the things I could say would kind of ruin.

572
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:52,151
Speaker 0: bone There's.

573
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:52,874
Speaker 1: I know it's it's.

574
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:55,004
Speaker 1: I don't want to root cuz it's it's not.

575
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:55,787
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of.

576
00:40:55,807 --> 00:41:04,287
Speaker 1: I mean There's some messages in bone and some themes and whatnot, but for the most part it's a straight-up in-your-face open book adventure tale.

577
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:10,675
Speaker 1: so Anything you can say about it other than why it's good or that you should read it or you know What parts.

578
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,450
Speaker 1: what about it is what we like?

579
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,470
Speaker 1: We just be giving away the plot which is all that is there even though the plot is an amazing plot.

580
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,255
Speaker 1: That's epic.

581
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,569
Speaker 1: You can't really say anything about about spoiling it.

582
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:22,753
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

583
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,379
Speaker 0: All right, this is Wikipedia.

584
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:29,354
Speaker 0: So uh all grains of salt in place According to Wikipedia.

585
00:41:29,595 --> 00:41:36,148
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read here in the 1990s an attempt to produce a film of bone through Nickelodeon Films was unsuccessful.

586
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:37,629
Speaker 0: according to Smith.

587
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:46,969
Speaker 0: Nickelodeon saw the story strictly as children's entertainment and insisted that bone characters be voiced by child actors and that the film had to include pop songs by Britney Spears and in sync.

588
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:55,917
Speaker 0: Smith's argument was that no one would even briefly consider putting pop songs in film adaptations the Lord of the Rings and Therefore they will not be placed in bone either.

589
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,526
Speaker 1: and so it was.

590
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:07,650
Speaker 0: I can say one thing though I think bone would translate Brilliantly to a film or a series of films or it would have to be something long.

591
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,149
Speaker 0: You could do it Lord of the Rings style or you could do it.

592
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:15,246
Speaker 0: You know, maybe in Japan where they the anime say they just animate a show for 13 or 26 episodes.

593
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:17,461
Speaker 0: We're great in that kind.

594
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:18,510
Speaker 1: Oh, it would work terrifically.

595
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:29,770
Speaker 1: there's also I think there's some adventure games of bone and I gotta say if you like like the kind of stories you get from Like LucasArts adventure games your bone is the same kind of story is now you will like that action.

596
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,584
Speaker 1: There's also a bone adventure game made by someone that you might be able to get.

597
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:34,668
Speaker 1: it's I don't know.

598
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:39,165
Speaker 1: Oh last year There's a Mac version of it came out.

599
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:39,690
Speaker 0: no great.

600
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:47,014
Speaker 1: so yeah, you can you might be able to get the adventure game if you search around the net and See what else do we got?

601
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:51,870
Speaker 0: but seriously, I think bone would be great as a film partly because there's no sort of inner monologue.

602
00:42:51,950 --> 00:43:01,649
Speaker 0: It's done very cinematically and everything, you know, it's because characters say it or you see it Yep, and you could basically take the comic book and use that to do the storyboards and then just make bone.

603
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:05,790
Speaker 0: That why it kind of bothers me that no one's done something like this because I think it would go.

604
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,019
Speaker 0: Well, yes in the 1990s and it was Nickelodeon.

605
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:23,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other thing I had to say about Jeff Smith the guy who made it he He went to work on Shazam and the Monster Society of Shazam Shazam and the Monster Society of Evil.

606
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:26,647
Speaker 1: So I'm waiting for that to be in a trade paperback and then I'll buy it.

607
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:35,150
Speaker 1: He's starting a new thing right called razzle r a s L and I think the first issue comes out in a month or two.

608
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:45,910
Speaker 1: I pre-ordered it obviously But I'll probably wait a few years for there to be one giant book of the whole thing before I actually you know Buy it, but yeah, he's starting a new comic.

609
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:54,290
Speaker 1: So if you wanna if you like bone, you should buy Jeff Smith's new comic and the other comics He's made cuz he really hasn't made too many comics.

610
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,390
Speaker 1: I mean he worked on bone for how many years, you know, and he didn't work on much else.

611
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,864
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe he did some covers and you know things like that.

612
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:08,181
Speaker 0: But yeah All right, I think we'll leave it at that because seriously Bone is a hundred percent worth reading.

613
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,229
Speaker 0: I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy bone.

614
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:11,874
Speaker 1: I guess it is not a human.

615
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:15,424
Speaker 0: if you don't like reading then you probably won't like bone.

616
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:17,349
Speaker 0: that that's that's about all I can say.

617
