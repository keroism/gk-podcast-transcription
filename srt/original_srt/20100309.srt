1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,097
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Tuesday, March 9th.

2
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:11,699
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:14,227
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,270
Speaker 0: paranoia.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,043
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,755
Speaker 0: I feel like we should have said something.

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,780
Speaker 1: no, I feel like we should have said something.

8
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:33,887
Speaker 0: Are you impinging upon me?

9
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:35,593
Speaker 0: Are you are you a communist?

10
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:37,259
Speaker 0: No, I got nothing.

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:47,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel I always feel really awkward quoting like paranoia in any way Like if I ever ask anyone are you a happy communist on one hand or just be like why?

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,774
Speaker 0: well No, even if they know paranoia on one hand.

13
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,223
Speaker 0: It's social currency It's the whole.

14
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:53,917
Speaker 0: I am saying something from a media.

15
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:57,799
Speaker 0: that is cool Hoping that you will respond in kind thus proving that we can be friends.

16
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,634
Speaker 0: But at the same time if someone says to you the cake is a lie.

17
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,196
Speaker 0: What do you do?

18
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:03,000
Speaker 1: smack them up?

19
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,316
Speaker 0: So that's why I can't ever ask anyone if they're a happy communist.

20
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:07,819
Speaker 1: That's right.

21
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:13,336
Speaker 0: But at the same time I I know everyone's played portal, I don't know everyone's played paranoia.

22
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,680
Speaker 1: almost no one's played paranoia.

23
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, most it's weird.

24
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:17,011
Speaker 1: It's like this.

25
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,261
Speaker 1: it's one of those things That's like.

26
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:24,520
Speaker 1: it's popular enough that people know it, but it's not so popular like portal that everyone knows.

27
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,234
Speaker 1: I think a lot you can use it as an awesome detector.

28
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,777
Speaker 1: You can just be like Hey, it You know.

29
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:35,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, have you troubleshooted anything down in sector 3 lately?

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,894
Speaker 1: Right and if they respond appropriately then it's like aha I know this is a smart cool person, but it's the same thing.

31
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:44,737
Speaker 0: the cake is a lie.

32
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:45,440
Speaker 0: people are doing.

33
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,379
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's save it for the actual main big business the main topic.

34
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 0: All right, so I guess we have to talk about this because everyone else is gonna talk about it.

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,553
Speaker 0: And it's it's hilarious in manifold ways.

36
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:05,070
Speaker 0: so in case you weren't paying attention Ubisoft Decided to go all the way with DRM.

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,780
Speaker 0: They were like you know what we're going to just have the DRM.

38
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:10,859
Speaker 0: That is exactly as evil as everyone ever said DRM could be.

39
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,171
Speaker 0: You've got to have your internet connection all the time.

40
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,232
Speaker 0: if it drops for a second your game Just crashes and done well again doesn't crash.

41
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:20,289
Speaker 1: basically just doesn't let you play The internet.

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,187
Speaker 1: it will check every time you run the game You know with the DRM servers and constantly while you're playing the game And it stops your game.

43
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:34,074
Speaker 0: it interrupts the game if you lose the internet mm-hmm Or if you know anything goes wrong anywhere between your computer and their DRM servers.

44
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:39,013
Speaker 1: obviously people who don't have internet connections Can't play people with like you know even if they want to play.

45
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,640
Speaker 1: single-player isn't just multiplayer.

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,524
Speaker 1: This is a single player.

47
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,331
Speaker 1: even if they have like a dial-up modem.

48
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,580
Speaker 1: They probably are not gonna be able to play.

49
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:49,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, what about poor people like me who tend to put steam in offline mode and plan laptops up?

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, can't plan an airplane unless the airplane is one of those cool airplanes with Wi-Fi can't play if the Wi-Fi is congested.

51
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,659
Speaker 1: So basically why would you buy this game?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,939
Speaker 1: You know for you know the PC.

53
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,184
Speaker 1: You wouldn't.

54
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,528
Speaker 1: you'd be a moron if you did.

55
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:15,640
Speaker 0: and the thing is I mean a lot of people have made the I guess The best counter-argument you can make that every gamer who's serious about gaming one They're not gonna play this game on a laptop and to everyone just has broadband.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,216
Speaker 0: It's no big deal except for you know the military people overseas who are some of the biggest gamers.

57
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:25,229
Speaker 1: There are yeah You know they don't always have a reliable internet connection.

58
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:28,340
Speaker 1: most lot of people do not always have reliable internet connection.

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,305
Speaker 1: We are not in the ghost in the shell world.

60
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:38,600
Speaker 1: you cannot write code that just assumes that there is a perfect and awesome You know connection to the internet at all times.

61
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:45,905
Speaker 0: I can't even write code that assumes that another demon on my server will get messages I sent to it exactly you know.

62
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,088
Speaker 1: so you know.

63
00:03:47,148 --> 00:04:02,680
Speaker 1: until that day comes when networks are like incredibly reliable and super fast and awesome probably after we're dead then You can write this code and have this DRM But until then no and even in that such a world that DRM probably still would not work.

64
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:07,320
Speaker 0: So what's interesting though is that they were there was a lot of talk, and there's even a slash shot article.

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,658
Speaker 0: I think it said the DRM scheme that will work and people were talking about how.

66
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:20,992
Speaker 0: yes It's going to eventually be cracked But it'll take a long time for it to be cracked and in the meantime The people who care about the game are gonna be forced to buy it.

67
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,926
Speaker 0: the company will make its money and DRM will serve its purpose.

68
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:24,972
Speaker 0: It's the nuclear option.

69
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:25,756
Speaker 0: It's the final.

70
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaker 0: This is it.

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,128
Speaker 0: It's happening and everything will be fine at.

72
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,179
Speaker 0: it was cracked right away.

73
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:42,103
Speaker 1: It was cracked like the next day as predicted right, and I know they denied that it was cracked though They said it wasn't and that the people who think they cracked it will get a nasty surprise Or something.

74
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,049
Speaker 1: and then in addition to that.

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,119
Speaker 1: right there DRM server went down if people couldn't play the game.

76
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,085
Speaker 0: well Let's get back to that.

77
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,740
Speaker 0: so one they said you know that something ominously bad will happen.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,543
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll do what?

79
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,852
Speaker 0: was that one game where it just kept you on the boat.

80
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,936
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there was a Okay, so here's two stories right.

81
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,819
Speaker 1: number one There's a Dragon Quest game.

82
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:15,040
Speaker 1: And if you got a cracked version for the DS because DS piracy is huge with the r4 cartridges Then basically you couldn't get past the first screen like it would work But the first screen in the game you wouldn't be able to get past the boat you just be on this boat forever.

83
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:20,412
Speaker 1: It would say talk to all the people on the boat to continue and even if you talk to all the people on the boat Twice you wouldn't be able to continue.

84
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,681
Speaker 0: I forget what game It was.

85
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:30,080
Speaker 0: there was a PC game that did something similar where if the CD was copied And it didn't like catch this extra data on it the game would play perfectly normally.

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Speaker 0: But it would ramp up the difficulty bit by bit and eventually about halfway through the game make it impossible Yep, and then corrupt your save file.

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,027
Speaker 1: So the other there's another story.

88
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:47,475
Speaker 1: I could I could find the link if I can remember and basically some guy who worked on Like a Spyro PlayStation game or something like that I forget what it was.

89
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:48,360
Speaker 0: I remember those games.

90
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:53,556
Speaker 1: He they they apparently made this crazy DRM that they were so proud of.

91
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,160
Speaker 1: and this DRM You know what it did was basically the game would appear to be cracked.

92
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,469
Speaker 1: but and so the crackers?

93
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:02,959
Speaker 1: they cracked it and they put it out there and they just said oh it works.

94
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:10,120
Speaker 1: and Then people who actually played the cracked version like the dialogue would be like you are playing a pirated version of the game.

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,007
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna let you continue blah blah blah or.

96
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:17,224
Speaker 1: some people also do clever things like you'll get a never-ending level with infinite bad Guys, I think it's an iPhone game.

97
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:18,407
Speaker 1: if you pirate it does that.

98
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,980
Speaker 1: and the thing is you know these are you know from their?

99
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,424
Speaker 1: You know perspective.

100
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:29,863
Speaker 1: these are some pretty clever DRMs because you think about it people doing the cracks Right.

101
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,752
Speaker 1: those people are not interested in actually in playing the games.

102
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,940
Speaker 1: most of the time cracking is their game.

103
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:40,286
Speaker 1: You know it's like they want you to make a difficult crack for them So they can figure out how to break it.

104
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:45,686
Speaker 1: so the more difficult your crack the more you're basically spending development time Creating this free game.

105
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:53,180
Speaker 1: the free game is called break my DRM and the only people playing are these crackers And they're not actually gonna play Spyro or Assassin's Creed or your iPhone game.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,355
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit, and then there's other people they're playing the game of.

107
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,440
Speaker 1: I have no money.

108
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,140
Speaker 1: I want to play all these games.

109
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,267
Speaker 1: I will get them for free from these crackers.

110
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:10,054
Speaker 1: all right and those people the ones who get upset when the crack doesn't Actually work the one thing that I'm really want someone to see.

111
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:26,987
Speaker 1: if anyone has freaking balls, right Show me the sales figures of DRM versus non DRM because I am entirely convinced right that Having this DRM no matter how good or bad it is and how strong or weak it is Doesn't help your sales at all.

112
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:30,500
Speaker 1: if I live let's say this DRM that I said you know they had.

113
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:38,255
Speaker 0: Well, you're getting back into the old argument of the vast majority of people who pirate things Only pirate because they place zero value on this entertainment.

114
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,058
Speaker 1: exactly they have.

115
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,707
Speaker 0: they have taught They're willing to spend their time to play the game.

116
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,640
Speaker 0: They're not willing to spend any other resource on most games.

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,745
Speaker 1: Yep, or the second if they could not pirate the game They would not play the game.

118
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:54,100
Speaker 0: the secondary list of people are people like me who actually do pirate.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,346
Speaker 0: I don't bother pirating games.

120
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:55,769
Speaker 0: I have money.

121
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,800
Speaker 0: time is more valuable to me than money.

122
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:02,680
Speaker 0: So I won't bother with these cracks or anything, but I don't buy games when they come out anywhere.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,848
Speaker 0: I've been burned too many times by a get like a new Zelda game Just not being as good as it should have been.

124
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,095
Speaker 0: or you know what about Bioshock?

125
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,640
Speaker 0: Bioshock wasn't worth buying when I bought it.

126
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,789
Speaker 0: I should have bought it last week for five bucks.

127
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,114
Speaker 1: It's really five bucks now.

128
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,279
Speaker 0: I don't know how much it is.

129
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,603
Speaker 0: man All the.

130
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:27,140
Speaker 0: any game that isn't a multiplayer game or some sort of Important game like portal where you have to play it or you give me that jackass saying the cake is a lie here later.

131
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:28,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, you.

132
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,061
Speaker 1: or a multiplayer game You know like NS2 you got to play it when it comes out because that's when the the you got to strike while the iron Is hot.

133
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:36,732
Speaker 0: well that is the separate problem of we learned.

134
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:45,420
Speaker 0: we learned very well from tribes too Because had we not bought tribes to immediately when it came out We would have had fewer hours of total tribes to playing in our lives.

135
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,709
Speaker 0: Yeah And I don't know if I could have stomach that later.

136
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:53,419
Speaker 0: now imagine if we'd gotten tribes to Like at the end of that whole era played it for like a week, and then it was dead.

137
00:08:53,904 --> 00:09:02,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be like finding You know you're some like peasant in the medieval times, and you find these ancient Roman ruins and all you can see is how awesome They were.

138
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,189
Speaker 1: Right you know, but I want to see.

139
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,774
Speaker 1: see nobody has ever done this.

140
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,802
Speaker 1: publish me your sales figures Right.

141
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:17,716
Speaker 1: put out that you know a game without DRM, and then put out a game with DRM.

142
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:18,238
Speaker 1: That's similar games.

143
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,024
Speaker 0: Similar games are.

144
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,649
Speaker 0: sorry I release an example.

145
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,160
Speaker 1: right Assassin's Creed 1 for the PC Assassin's Creed 2 for the PC.

146
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:32,260
Speaker 1: They could you know they could have done one with no DRM and one with DRM And you would assume they would have similar sales figures.

147
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:36,936
Speaker 1: You know give me give me portal 1 versus portal 2 1 DRM 1 no DRM.

148
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,740
Speaker 1: I have a. show me the difference in sales.

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,613
Speaker 0: It's hard though because the I mean portal 1 and sales versus portal 2.

150
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:45,680
Speaker 0: I mean I think it's gonna be completely different sales.

151
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:52,161
Speaker 0: I align Portal 2 is gonna have pretty much immediate everyone buying it right away because of the success of portal 1.

152
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:57,169
Speaker 0: Portal 1 had a spike in the beginning in the long tail of people Finding out the cake is a lie and then caring about it.

153
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:01,920
Speaker 1: the point is until someone shows some evidence of the contrary I will remain entirely unconvinced.

154
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,241
Speaker 1: I do not.

155
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:10,050
Speaker 1: I think you know putting DRM is a complete waste of time because even if it works Even if the crackers can't crack it it doesn't help your sales.

156
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,763
Speaker 1: well the people who are pirating would never have bought it in any Situation.

157
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:17,580
Speaker 0: there are many myriad arguments against DRM, and you've made one of them.

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,220
Speaker 0: I think the root issue is still that the vast majority of people now have no money not money.

159
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,251
Speaker 1: The people pirating are punk kids with no money.

160
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,537
Speaker 0: That's not that if they had money.

161
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,340
Speaker 0: They wouldn't buy the game.

162
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,042
Speaker 0: They wouldn't care.

163
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,548
Speaker 0: they only play the game because they don't care.

164
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,451
Speaker 0: they it's there.

165
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:32,133
Speaker 0: I'm bored.

166
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:33,799
Speaker 0: Let's see what's on YouTube.

167
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,165
Speaker 0: all right I've seen too many people get in the nuts.

168
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,349
Speaker 0: Let's go to crunchyroll.

169
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,417
Speaker 0: I'll watch all these shows because they're free yep.

170
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:49,159
Speaker 0: But the main argument against DRM all those other arguments aside and all the others didn't even make is That it only hurts the people who actually did pay you money.

171
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:53,712
Speaker 0: Yep, and Ubisoft proved this epically when just all this press.

172
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:54,634
Speaker 0: you know their DRM.

173
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:55,437
Speaker 0: It's uncrackable.

174
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,620
Speaker 0: it got cracked right away.

175
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,346
Speaker 0: Their servers went down.

176
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 0: the only people who actually could play the game were the people who pirated it.

177
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,946
Speaker 1: So I think this is why people are.

178
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,196
Speaker 1: you know steam and Netflix are the two people with DRM.

179
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,460
Speaker 1: they get away with it because?

180
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:09,464
Speaker 1: It works.

181
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:10,588
Speaker 1: It actually does work.

182
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,254
Speaker 1: You know steam doesn't really go down.

183
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,880
Speaker 1: You know the offline play.

184
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,404
Speaker 1: You know they keep fixing it.

185
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,149
Speaker 1: It works mostly perfectly.

186
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:25,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the Netflix has you know DRM, but it works and Nobody complains about it because it just works.

187
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:38,295
Speaker 1: and of course you know if this Ubisoft Assassin's Creed DRM had worked then Nobody would have laughed at it, but because it was cracked and because the server went down everyone goes aha You're right you fail.

188
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:43,475
Speaker 0: Well even you know cracked or not doesn't matter because that's not going to affect the bottom line.

189
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:48,258
Speaker 0: if the game like this never gets Cracked then all the people who would pirate it just won't ever play it.

190
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,379
Speaker 0: yep Or at most they'll buy it in the discount bin a couple of years from now.

191
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:56,957
Speaker 1: Yep But you know you think if you know what if they would have made the game $5 discount bin price.

192
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,443
Speaker 1: to begin with Sales.

193
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:01,317
Speaker 1: the sales would have been more than 10 times as much.

194
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:01,920
Speaker 1: What are they charging?

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,955
Speaker 1: I think 60 for the game, so they would have been more than 12 times as much.

196
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:16,450
Speaker 1: right they would have made More money and all those people who went on to you know wait for the crack or whatever would have said I was five bucks Whatever and just bought it because it would be easier that way.

197
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:22,519
Speaker 0: see now if we go back to the root issue of just people Don't value these entertainment options enough to pay money for them.

198
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:27,640
Speaker 0: What about the the people like us who don't pirate but buy everything in the discount bin?

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,964
Speaker 0: That I think hurts the industry just as much as piracy, but yet That's perfectly legal.

200
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaker 1: and well the argument you can make against that the argument comic book people make this argument all the time.

201
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,370
Speaker 1: They say oh you got to buy the issues.

202
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,620
Speaker 1: You can't be buying the trades.

203
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Speaker 1: You're hurting the you know artists, and I'm like if they don't make the trade then oh, but they have to to make the money.

204
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,538
Speaker 1: I'm like gee Make up your mind.

205
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:57,280
Speaker 1: Either they need to do it to make the money yet, but they'd be making more money if you you know bought the issues.

206
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,477
Speaker 1: It's not a charity.

207
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,339
Speaker 1: Go listen to that episode of geek nights.

208
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,188
Speaker 0: Wow that was a long time ago.

209
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we were fighting with anime world order.

210
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,763
Speaker 1: It's not a charity.

211
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,488
Speaker 1: right consumer is number one.

212
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,935
Speaker 1: businesses that recognize consumers number ten.

213
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,303
Speaker 1: right those are the businesses That'll be king.

214
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:16,654
Speaker 1: businesses that say our business is number one and consumer is number ten.

215
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,200
Speaker 1: those businesses fuck them.

216
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:20,908
Speaker 1: We should steal from them because they're basically just assholes.

217
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,500
Speaker 0: now see I guess it's tricky that all this argue and this happens forever.

218
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,199
Speaker 0: Everyone rabbles out piracy and DRM on the internet and punk kids always rabble like DRM blah blah blah.

219
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,443
Speaker 0: It's evil I'm gonna pirate.

220
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:36,840
Speaker 0: I'll show them and they conflate some moral cause with their piracy which is pretty BS.

221
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,550
Speaker 0: But at the same time yeah, what's wrong with you know?

222
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:53,651
Speaker 0: I think people have been looking down on Civil disobedience lately and I think we need to most of the people I see who pirate stuff and conflate any sort of moral stand Don't actually have any moral stand as far as I can tell.

223
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,612
Speaker 0: all they really have to say is I don't want to pay for this game.

224
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,720
Speaker 1: The other thing I think is that when someone we've been going on about this too long.

225
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:18,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the root issue is just that even if there is perfect DRM Until we also lose our right to first sale the discount bin is more of a threat to gaming or at least the current gaming industry than piracy ever was Because the discount bin people still buy games.

226
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,144
Speaker 1: They're actually.

227
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,720
Speaker 1: I'll talk about it on the next show once I get the info.

228
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,060
Speaker 1: But there actually was a Linux game DRM developed recently that allowed you to resell the game with some clever technology.

229
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,199
Speaker 0: That is a good idea alright, so anyway.

230
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:35,112
Speaker 1: So in the other news steam related right.

231
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,400
Speaker 1: everyone probably knows this by now, but better Yeah, but steam is coming to the Mac.

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,094
Speaker 1: I should have realized this when they switched from IE to webkit.

233
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:49,275
Speaker 1: you know in the in the steam beta That's one of those situations where the nerds of the world said it's like oh, I should have seen.

234
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,360
Speaker 1: that was kind of obvious.

235
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,165
Speaker 1: What's wrong with me?

236
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,600
Speaker 1: anyway, so you know the thing is okay?

237
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,365
Speaker 1: So how is this gonna work right?

238
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,849
Speaker 1: what games exactly?

239
00:14:56,869 --> 00:15:00,600
Speaker 1: because most games on steam are not are obviously not gonna be ported right?

240
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,888
Speaker 1: So which games and such and such?

241
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,159
Speaker 1: so basically here's here's the rundown right?

242
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:16,844
Speaker 1: Valve is porting the source engine right, so I don't think that includes For example Half-Life 1 or NS Source source.

243
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:20,762
Speaker 1: yes, it includes like Counter-Strike source, but I don't think you can play original I don't.

244
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,031
Speaker 1: it doesn't seem like they're doing the original Half-Life.

245
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:23,634
Speaker 0: and here's the thing.

246
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,080
Speaker 1: no only doing the source engine.

247
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,760
Speaker 0: No one on a Mac gives one shit about Counter-Strike 1 6, but they can't play NS 1.

248
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,544
Speaker 1: They'll only be able to play.

249
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,248
Speaker 1: you know.

250
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,394
Speaker 1: and will they be able to play NS 2?

251
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,740
Speaker 0: probably not either yeah But that's a separate issue.

252
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, so other interesting pieces of information.

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,860
Speaker 1: right if you already have these games purchased on Steam And you get a Mac you can just download them.

254
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,984
Speaker 1: You don't to pay for the game again You know.

255
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:53,253
Speaker 1: so if I have a Mac laptop and a Windows desktop I can and I have Half-Life 2 I can just download Half-Life 2 on my.

256
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,822
Speaker 1: you know Mac You know Sony.

257
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,569
Speaker 0: you can learn a thing or two from this.

258
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:06,321
Speaker 0: I Still think the best way For game publishers to make a whole bunch of money is to have don't give away No Don't do?

259
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,024
Speaker 0: it seemed it don't.

260
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:10,519
Speaker 0: do the good thing and give every version of the game to someone who bought it.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,155
Speaker 0: But say all right you bought Street Fighter on the PC for five bucks.

262
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,359
Speaker 0: You can have it on your Xbox, too.

263
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:20,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other question is you know what about the graphics hardware?

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,093
Speaker 1: You know because people play games on computers with.

265
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:29,980
Speaker 1: you know high-end video cards And you know the Macs don't really have poopy video cards, but they don't have great video cards either.

266
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,936
Speaker 1: They've got like you know g-forces and whatever, but they're not high-end.

267
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:34,940
Speaker 1: They're not way powerful.

268
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:44,828
Speaker 1: They can almost definitely do like Half-Life 2 But could they do like Left 4 Dead 2 you know which needs a little more power to do like the level with the rain And the storm and all that?

269
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,383
Speaker 0: also what kinds of drivers I mean they're?

270
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:51,880
Speaker 0: they're not gonna have the same kind of Nvidia driver that I have I guess an Nvidia chip.

271
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you know they're basically they're extending.

272
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,818
Speaker 1: the source engine is support OpenGL And you know I guess they're gonna have to.

273
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,847
Speaker 1: The thing is at least they don't have to.

274
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,879
Speaker 1: it's gonna be pretty easy because they won't have to scale it to.

275
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:10,448
Speaker 1: you know Support different levels of graphics as much because it's pretty much only so many Macs And you know you know what they all have.

276
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:12,079
Speaker 1: so you be like oh, this is a MacBook Pro.

277
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,566
Speaker 1: These are the settings you know.

278
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,839
Speaker 0: in fact they could probably do something like you know how steam detects your settings.

279
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,589
Speaker 0: They do those periodic hardware surveys.

280
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,239
Speaker 1: They're gonna do the hardware survey on the Mac.

281
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna be really interesting But what the cool thing will be if I were them?

282
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:33,772
Speaker 0: what I would do is have it figure out exactly which Mac It is and then have some people who spend the time to figure out the optimum Graphics settings for each game for each kind of Mac.

283
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:34,635
Speaker 1: mm-hmm.

284
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,040
Speaker 0: just to give Mac.

285
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,440
Speaker 0: You know you gotta give Mac people the Mac experience.

286
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:44,645
Speaker 0: It's got to just work there with no fiddling and be perfect immediately or at least as good as that Particular Mac can do.

287
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:53,179
Speaker 1: our Mac mini over there is not gonna be playing any half-life - yeah Still the thing that I worry about though is like you know the Mac still doesn't have.

288
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:57,818
Speaker 1: you know It's not gonna help them out with a lot of other things like you can't really use a joystick on the Mac.

289
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:00,206
Speaker 0: that well Well, you can but here's the problem.

290
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:05,443
Speaker 0: hardly barely if you pay for third-party software that does it well You know, but there's.

291
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,533
Speaker 1: you know they might build something in.

292
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:12,312
Speaker 1: it's like to add joystick support But the Mac OS itself doesn't have joystick support in it.

293
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:12,834
Speaker 1: You know.

294
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:19,938
Speaker 1: so they had to add that Themselves because I know for example Team Fortress 2 you can play with an Xbox 360 controller on Windows.

295
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:23,203
Speaker 1: if that's your thing I don't know why you would do that For that game.

296
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:24,447
Speaker 0: you're not missing that much.

297
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,132
Speaker 0: Yeah games the mouse anyway.

298
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:32,112
Speaker 1: The second thing is like in win in When you're using Windows you have like a you know PC keyboard.

299
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,040
Speaker 1: trying to game with a Mac keyboard.

300
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,970
Speaker 1: You know it's not gonna work out too.

301
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,622
Speaker 1: Well like most Macs are laptops You know.

302
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:43,578
Speaker 1: and if even if you have a desktop Mac if you have a Mac Mouse God help you right right?

303
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,673
Speaker 1: So you know if you're gonna game on a Mac you're.

304
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:53,540
Speaker 1: even if these games work You're still gonna need like a PC Mouse and keyboard to get the right experience.

305
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:57,479
Speaker 1: Maybe you could use a PC Mouse with the Mac keyboard the chiclets.

306
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,732
Speaker 1: well It would still kind of suck, but it would be.

307
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:00,759
Speaker 0: I at least have a fish.

308
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,040
Speaker 0: I remember when Emily very pointedly got a Microsoft Mouse, and she was like it has three buttons.

309
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:10,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think a lot of Mac users use real mice.

310
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:17,998
Speaker 1: now You know Pete there are people who are fans of the Mighty Mouse and there were people who are fans of the new Magic Mouse And it's sort of a love it or hate it thing.

311
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:25,156
Speaker 1: But the Magic Mouse even if you're one of those people who loves it You know which I think is maybe like five percent of people maybe even less than that.

312
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:29,320
Speaker 1: all right You can't really game with gestures.

313
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:31,967
Speaker 1: You know that is not precision enough.

314
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:32,268
Speaker 1: Well.

315
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,640
Speaker 1: You know you do gesture, and you're like you change three weapons.

316
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,004
Speaker 1: It's like I know how.

317
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,248
Speaker 1: you know how you need to have clicks.

318
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,980
Speaker 1: you can scroll exactly one to change your weapon exactly one.

319
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,516
Speaker 0: Here's another problem something that is far more subtle that I don't think anyone has taken into account.

320
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:55,439
Speaker 0: on Windows Everything's great when I play an FPS, but remember when I bought the Mac mini And I tried the mouse sensitivity was the worst max.

321
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:57,091
Speaker 0: It works fine.

322
00:19:57,132 --> 00:20:08,098
Speaker 0: if you're a desktop browser And you're not used to like ultra high precision like very kind of granular it like Fiddly mouse controls, which I like I have my mouse way way up.

323
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,388
Speaker 0: Yes I have that fancy mouse.

324
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,563
Speaker 0: now if I put it to the max It's literally.

325
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,340
Speaker 0: I move it a millimeter and the mouse is all the way across the screen mm-hmm.

326
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,905
Speaker 0: So I had to actually turn it down.

327
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,537
Speaker 0: you cannot play an FPS with the way max handle mice by default.

328
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,191
Speaker 1: well actually at work I have a Mac right which I'm not a fan of but that's what I got.

329
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,696
Speaker 0: so how's the mouse sensitivity?

330
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:30,000
Speaker 1: it's terrible But I have this Logitech g6 gaming mouse.

331
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:39,950
Speaker 1: It's just a wired you know gaming mouse And it has buttons to move the sensitivity up and down has three different sensitivity settings And it's in the hardware of the mouse that it changes this.

332
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:46,960
Speaker 1: so if I up the sensitivity in this gaming mouse To like the second or third level it actually becomes pretty good right.

333
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,927
Speaker 1: So if you get like you know say your mouse there right to work with the Mac I don't think it does.

334
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:54,520
Speaker 0: I think it'll work as a mouse.

335
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,303
Speaker 0: I don't know.

336
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:55,805
Speaker 0: I gotta try.

337
00:20:55,825 --> 00:21:02,869
Speaker 1: you can get the hardware of the mouse to jack up the sensitivity as Opposed to letting the Mac OS handle it.

338
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,720
Speaker 1: then you can probably get a passable mouse sensitivity experience.

339
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,751
Speaker 1: But you still you need to get in gaming mouse.

340
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:09,777
Speaker 1: You know I can play.

341
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:17,820
Speaker 1: you know It's not the greatest, but I can use like a Dell two button with a scroll wheel USB mouse right with a red optical normalness.

342
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,709
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest But I can play an FPS with that just fine.

343
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:31,620
Speaker 0: hey having grown up with the era of Optical mice that you could not use for gaming or before that real mice Yeah, remember like picking up the mouse and like tapping the tapping down together.

344
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:35,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to use that wheel like as part of my gaming.

345
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,598
Speaker 0: I had to take that wheel into account.

346
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,540
Speaker 1: yep I had a gaming mouse.

347
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,011
Speaker 1: I think I still have it a logic USB gaming mouse that had.

348
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:48,770
Speaker 1: it was just three buttons didn't before scroll wheels were around Right and it had a ball, but it was a bigger ball than usual.

349
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,397
Speaker 1: It was like an extra-large ball for gaming.

350
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:55,493
Speaker 0: so I See you've got the biggest balls of them all.

351
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,419
Speaker 1: I had the biggest ball.

352
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,974
Speaker 0: I had a friend who used a trackball for FPS.

353
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,540
Speaker 1: is that's still a good call?

354
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:07,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, this gigantic trackball It was the kind that'll cut your finger off if you get it going too fast and catch it down at the edge.

355
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's still a good move if you can if you're used to it especially for rampart.

356
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:22,300
Speaker 0: What he always wanted and he talked about this almost every day You know back when we're really into FPS is he wanted a mouse that had a trackball in it That was ultra like ultra low sensitivity.

357
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:28,949
Speaker 0: So he basically used the mouse for his normal FPS and but then when he was sniping He just put his finger on that trackball there.

358
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,093
Speaker 1: Why don't we make that?

359
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:30,555
Speaker 1: we could make.

360
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:38,843
Speaker 1: it would just be a mouse with a thumb Trackball and a middle finger scroll wheel right and then two buttons for index and ring finger Right.

361
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:43,297
Speaker 1: and basically what you would do is the the mouse itself be a laser mouse.

362
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:50,840
Speaker 1: that would work normally But the thumb scroll the trackball would also always be on and would be ultra low sensitivity.

363
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:58,379
Speaker 1: So you could you could do a sweeping movement towards the enemy, but then precisionally aim exactly at his head with the thumb.

364
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,673
Speaker 0: Of course I can do something similar.

365
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,680
Speaker 0: now that I got that fancy mouse I can click the button that goes between ultra high and ultra low.

366
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:13,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I can do with the mouse that I have at work And that's actually becoming very popular these days is the gaming mouse that allows you to change sensitivity.

367
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:19,060
Speaker 1: So, you know you go you just you're sniping and you change you drop the sensitivity and then you're running.

368
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,490
Speaker 1: So you crank it way up.

369
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:28,573
Speaker 0: what I haven't done yet But I used to I'll admit I used to do this back in the like action quake days I would actually change my vertical sensitivity as opposed my horizontal.

370
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:36,274
Speaker 0: Whoa, so I'd basically pseudo lock my mouse at head level and then just sweep left and right.

371
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:40,003
Speaker 0: basically, yes, and it worked Horrifyingly well.

372
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:41,468
Speaker 1: that works incredibly.

373
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:46,210
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is if you duck you've got a. you know You've got to have two different lock position.

374
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,800
Speaker 0: No, what you do is you set up the law.

375
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,140
Speaker 1: I guess there's no ducking and quake.

376
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,293
Speaker 1: But if you're playing counter-strike you would need to position the way the mouse works.

377
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,940
Speaker 0: is you pick you make all these profiles.

378
00:23:54,403 --> 00:24:05,380
Speaker 0: So what I could do is have a profile for counter-strike Let's say where if I hit a certain button or I hold it down or whatever it basically Cuts down my vertical sensitivity to almost nothing.

379
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,059
Speaker 0: So I go up to head level while I'm shooting at someone and as soon as I'm at a head level I hit this and it locks on head level.

380
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,174
Speaker 0: Now at what point does this become cheating?

381
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,641
Speaker 0: yeah, I Don't know.

382
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:19,606
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm just.

383
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,596
Speaker 0: I'm not actually aim botting.

384
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:24,169
Speaker 0: if I do that I'm just changing the way.

385
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,291
Speaker 1: I personally have to aim horizontally Yes, and you can still move the mouse vertically.

386
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,395
Speaker 1: It just take a lot of work.

387
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:31,580
Speaker 0: I could set it to zero.

388
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,520
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing is that you know in a game like say counter-strike you we try to do that with the para The recoil would move you out of position and be very different.

389
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,016
Speaker 1: You know if you had the low sensitivity you couldn't get back down true true for sniping.

390
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:43,980
Speaker 1: It would be very effective.

391
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:55,508
Speaker 0: The other thing you can do is it actually lets me specify, you know All mines do sorts of corrections Like if you're trying to draw in a straight line most mice will kind of guide you into a straight line if they think it's Obvious you're doing a straight line.

392
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:56,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the.

393
00:24:56,152 --> 00:25:07,073
Speaker 1: actually there was a good Article I read that showed how the different Touchscreens and the different phones correct for when you're sliding around And it showed how pretty much the iPhone does.

394
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,139
Speaker 1: does it better than everyone else?

395
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,064
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

396
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,551
Speaker 0: This is totally just ripped off from College Humor.

397
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,396
Speaker 0: I try to avoid that but I had to.

398
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,911
Speaker 0: I Like the song.

399
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:27,970
Speaker 0: I'm on a boat Not like ironically like he.

400
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,817
Speaker 0: he I mean I just straight-up like it.

401
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:30,700
Speaker 0: I think it's a great song.

402
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:31,520
Speaker 1: It's an okay song.

403
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,820
Speaker 0: I like it a little bit independent of all the humor and all the side stuff and the meta and the meme and everything.

404
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,424
Speaker 0: I like the song and I feel like the people behind the song where I don't know if we've talked about them But they they've gotten.

405
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:47,958
Speaker 0: they've improved their comedic songwriting abilities with every iteration of songs.

406
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:50,851
Speaker 0: They have done Mmm, I look forward to future songs by them.

407
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:56,436
Speaker 0: Hmm and a while ago, you know We did the I'm on a boat and we did that cool cover that a bunch of Navy guys did like.

408
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,264
Speaker 0: they basically filmed their Own music video to it.

409
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:00,272
Speaker 0: I now have to present to you.

410
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,300
Speaker 0: I'm on a boat the death metal cover.

411
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:03,502
Speaker 1: You know what?

412
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:12,012
Speaker 1: I saw today, you know, amv hell not anime hell that you know, which is what you do at a convention Hell something that you show at a convention, right?

413
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:14,440
Speaker 1: So amv hell did like this these video.

414
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,879
Speaker 1: That's like a bunch of little me and these hells tiny ones all grouped up in a one YouTube video.

415
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:27,060
Speaker 1: And the final video of this collection was Pokemon, I'm on a boat using you know, the boat that's in the first Pokemon.

416
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:27,964
Speaker 0: That's okay.

417
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:28,868
Speaker 1: It was pretty funny.

418
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:34,334
Speaker 1: I don't think it's anywhere near mindless self-indulgence But it was still you know, a little Pokemon.

419
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,059
Speaker 1: I'm on a boat was fun.

420
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:36,949
Speaker 1: Okay, it's my thing today.

421
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:37,170
Speaker 1: Yep.

422
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,180
Speaker 1: There's this guy named Jake Adelstein.

423
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,458
Speaker 1: I didn't know about him until today, but apparently he's you know more famous than us.

424
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:43,760
Speaker 1: at least.

425
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:47,734
Speaker 1: He is an American Jew from the Midwest, right?

426
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:52,771
Speaker 1: Obviously with the name like Adelstein Obviously from the Midwest right and you know what his job was.

427
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,301
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

428
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:56,366
Speaker 1: his job was.

429
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:59,580
Speaker 1: he was the crime reporter for a newspaper in Japan.

430
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,749
Speaker 1: That and he lived in Japan and he was a crime reporter All right, and basically he became just.

431
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,977
Speaker 1: his life became a life of Yakuza.

432
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:11,799
Speaker 0: Oh This guy I think he was on the Daily Show.

433
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,684
Speaker 1: I think he was.

434
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,332
Speaker 1: people were saying something about that in the comments.

435
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,880
Speaker 0: I think I saw him on the Daily Show.

436
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I want to see him on the Daily Show.

437
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:22,683
Speaker 0: now that I know that I'll find the episode cuz if it I remember Seeing an interview.

438
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:29,228
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was on the Daily Show where he was talking about how he like he covered up all this Stuff he uncovered for a while because he didn't want to die.

439
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, he apparently carries around a titanium umbrella.

440
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:37,819
Speaker 1: I Should carry instead of a new umbrella instead of a baseball bat because you know, it's just like whatever.

441
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:40,759
Speaker 1: But if you try to fuck with him, he'll just bash you over the head.

442
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,259
Speaker 1: And he apparently had to break a dude's knee once with a golf club.

443
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:45,745
Speaker 0: Uh-huh some Yakuza men.

444
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:48,294
Speaker 0: if the Yakuza can't take this guy out.

445
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,040
Speaker 0: I mean, what if they sunk?

446
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,966
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's.

447
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:57,340
Speaker 1: he basically is in a situation You know, he played it cuz he was so smart and in with it, you know, and apparently Yakuza always keep their word.

448
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:03,580
Speaker 0: Well, he did this whole expose and how the Yakuza would come to America to get possibly black market livers.

449
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:11,952
Speaker 1: Well, no, there's one guy in particular who was like the biggest Yakuza who came to get a liver Candle in the Daily Show thing he implied.

450
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:17,110
Speaker 0: I recall that that was common Because Yakuza lose the livers real fast.

451
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,589
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but anyway, so, you know There's a really good interview with him on Boeing Boeing here.

452
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,500
Speaker 1: that says a lot of interesting things and apparently he's got a couple books.

453
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,231
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go buy his books because they need a book.

454
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:30,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, they say I like Yakuza.

455
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,384
Speaker 1: At least I you know, I don't.

456
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,699
Speaker 1: actually I don't actually like Yakuza.

457
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,156
Speaker 1: in that I think they are, you know, I want to be one.

458
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,280
Speaker 1: well I want to be involved with them.

459
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,805
Speaker 1: But in that, you know, it is it be mystique of Yakuza is cool because I've sort of you know I had my fill of.

460
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,240
Speaker 1: you know, Italian mafia so now and Russian mafia.

461
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:49,865

00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:51,176
Speaker 1: well, I need to get some eyes.

463
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:51,720
Speaker 1: mafia.

Speaker 0: You want to be a Yakuza or a British naval captain?

465
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:01,220
Speaker 0: But only if they are like we see them in sanctuary in Horatio exactly and not if they're like the real world exactly.

466
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,819
Speaker 0: I don't want to actually have been to the West Indies.

467
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:07,718
Speaker 1: I do want to have been to the West Indies on a cruise.

475
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:43,425

476
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,689

484
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:59,120
Speaker 0: cuz you know, I'm sure it's in the library.

485
00:29:59,345 --> 00:29:59,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure.

486
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,007
Speaker 0: Maybe just call it the club.

487
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:05,075
Speaker 1: Okay edgy something like that.

488
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:10,376
Speaker 1: Anyway news number two packs East not packs West yet.

489
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,389
Speaker 1: So there's actually you know, there's.

490
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:14,673
Speaker 1: the panels are doing.

491
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:18,745
Speaker 1: it packs East all three and Asterisk one of them.

492
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,796
Speaker 0: Yep beyond Dungeons & Dragons beyond candy land beyond your mom.

493
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,280
Speaker 1: No, not beyond your mom.

494
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:33,331
Speaker 0: losing should be fun and we are hopefully helping in the second half of Action Castle action castle.

495
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,097
Speaker 1: There's our panels.

496
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:36,567
Speaker 1: Okay The schedule is out.

497
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,760
Speaker 1: You can go find out when and where our panels will be.

498
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,520
Speaker 1: I think they're all in the wyvern theater.

499
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:44,976
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that the running person running the wyvern theater is an awesome person.

500
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:45,779
Speaker 0: it may in fact be.

501
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,045
Speaker 0: well We don't want to.

502
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,635
Speaker 1: I just have a feeling about this.

503
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:49,258
Speaker 1: It's a hunch.

504
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,813
Speaker 1: There are some additional news about this convention.

505
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,219
Speaker 1: Yes late-breaking news.

506
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,267
Speaker 1: Now we were worried because when you for every packs in all of history every West Coast packs when you applied to packs You would check off a box.

507
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:03,568
Speaker 1: Yes.

508
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,673
Speaker 1: I want to be in a mega knot.

509
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:05,979
Speaker 1: No, I do not right.

510
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:11,940
Speaker 1: and Then they would select the Omega knots they would contact them and they'd say hey, do you want to be an Omega knot?

511
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,401
Speaker 1: Yes, no.

512
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:13,063
Speaker 1: Hey do right.

513
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:20,178
Speaker 1: and then at the convention they had finally selected 16 Omega knots and they would go And compete in the Omega thon.

514
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 1: There was no such questionnaire for the PAX East.

515
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:31,440
Speaker 0: So we're just like is there even gonna be you know Megathon at PAX East and you know We're doing a lot of stuff like planning for packs the panels and everything.

516
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:36,113
Speaker 0: But I never thought to actually ask the the people who would have known.

517
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,018
Speaker 0: Hey, what's the deal with the Omega thon?

518
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:46,239
Speaker 1: So There is gonna be an Omega thon at PAX East and when I first read what they were gonna do I was like that what are they doing the morons?

519
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,829
Speaker 1: Because what they said they were gonna do is okay.

520
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:51,379
Speaker 1: when you get to PAX in your bag is gonna be a card.

521
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,557
Speaker 1: you fill It out and you drop it in a thing at the keynote if you want to be in the Omega thon.

522
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:58,265
Speaker 1: I'm like, whoa What are they doing?

523
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:00,093
Speaker 1: signing up online is so much better.

524
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,198
Speaker 1: Why did they make it worse?

525
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:01,660
Speaker 1: What is wrong?

526
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,506
Speaker 1: All right, it's better than that.

527
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,795
Speaker 1: Here is here is the genius of this move, right?

528
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:07,040
Speaker 1: You think that's a stupid move.

529
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,939
Speaker 1: Why would you do things the old paper way when the technology way as far as superior number one?

530
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,032
Speaker 1: The effort of emailing people saying do you want to be Omega knot?

531
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:14,273
Speaker 1: Yes.

532
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:14,916
Speaker 1: No, right?

533
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 1: No good.

534
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:19,920
Speaker 1: This way if someone fills out the card, they're at the convention.

535
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,749
Speaker 1: They just said they want to do it.

536
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:24,080
Speaker 1: right then and there you don't have to do this.

537
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,468
Speaker 1: You know work of filtering the people out.

538
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,660
Speaker 0: This also gives them they can do the come on down.

539
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, because what they'll do is after the keynote they'll sift through the cards and pull out the names and it'd be like Scott Ruben your You know.

540
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:51,040
Speaker 1: And then you go up to the front and you line up on the stage and then they'll say these the Omega knots whoo Even more awesome did not think this is possible.

541
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:58,800
Speaker 1: But you know This is PAX the convention of magic where everything is always more awesome than you suspected it would ever be and more than awesome Than you could possibly imagine.

542
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,786
Speaker 1: This Omega thon at PAX East is going to be an all team game Omega thon teams of two.

543
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,013
Speaker 1: you do not get to choose your teammate.

544
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,040
Speaker 1: It is random pulled out of the Hat.

545
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:16,120
Speaker 1: So the greatest gamer in the world be paired up with someone who just wanted to do it for fun or who knows what?

546
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,829
Speaker 0: I look forward to versus team co-op style.

547
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:31,267
Speaker 1: every game is gonna be a two-player game such as double dash, you know such as Geometry Wars 2 Such as some unnamed rhythm game.

548
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:35,520
Speaker 1: those are rounds one through three rounds four and of course five are unknown.

549
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,400
Speaker 1: I'm trying to speculate of course about the final round and what it will entail.

550
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 1: Obviously, it will be some sort of co-op game of at least teams of two.

551
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,993
Speaker 1: It could be an FPS because any deathmatch FPS will work.

552
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:48,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

553
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:49,880
Speaker 0: I feel like that'd be a cop-out.

554
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,230
Speaker 0: They got it.

555
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:57,020
Speaker 1: It could be a sports game like double dribble or you know One of those sports games where you only really need two people per side.

556
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:58,065
Speaker 1: But I don't.

557
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:04,220
Speaker 0: they don't seem big on sports games, you know at packs I I think old school is the way they would go.

558
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:07,820
Speaker 1: It could be like pong program because there are pongs that are two verse two.

559
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,300
Speaker 1: But then again, it could just be straight-up table tennis like physical table tennis.

560
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:20,579
Speaker 1: I would hope that it'd be Mario tennis, which really makes you realize man It could be Mario Party also and it's like it makes you realize not be Mario Party.

561
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:31,179
Speaker 1: The closing ceremonies cannot be nine hours long But it's so crazy that just about every game you think of that could handle like two versus two.

562
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,722
Speaker 1: is Mario?

563
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:41,857
Speaker 0: it's like Mario tennis Mario Party, you know Mario Kart double dash really really old-school games Like there's a lot of Atari games that have team play two versus two.

564
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:44,507
Speaker 0: Yeah Or you can shoehorn it in.

565
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they could.

566
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:51,717
Speaker 1: you know, you could always do like, you know You know Mario and Luigi, you know, just Mario Brothers.

567
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,364
Speaker 1: and then you know Two people are.

568
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,860
Speaker 1: you know play, you know, they have two separate games high score.

569
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:57,499
Speaker 1: You could always jury-rig it like that.

570
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,920
Speaker 0: But I remember the last time we were in a Mario Brothers tournament that was for high score.

571
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,675
Speaker 1: It could also be an RTS, you know, you can do Starcraft 2v2.

572
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,640
Speaker 0: Do you remember that?

573
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,767
Speaker 1: It could be Starcraft 2 2v2.

574
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:14,340
Speaker 0: Scott's trying so hard to get his points and I just asked the moderator Hey, what happens if I kill Scott and he's like, well, I guess he can't get any more points.

575
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:16,194
Speaker 0: I pushed him into a fireball in one first place.

576
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:20,795
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so that you know, that's I'm really curious as to what it's gonna be.

577
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:21,960
Speaker 1: Hopefully it'll be something awesome.

578
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:28,555
Speaker 1: And I know I know a Boston anime boss is the week after PAX East.

579
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,300
Speaker 0: we're doing a ton of panels there.

580
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:41,520
Speaker 0: In fact, we're doing Basically brand new panels for many of you because shit think about it All the panels were doing an anime Boston kinetic on panels or either working out account panels.

581
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,515
Speaker 0: But more importantly they were awesome new panels that all the other anime cons.

582
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:46,439
Speaker 0: for whatever reason we're like.

583
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,159
Speaker 0: no We don't want your new good stuff.

584
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:49,628
Speaker 0: We want you to run the same shitty.

585
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,840
Speaker 0: how to run an anime club panel again.

586
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,185
Speaker 1: Are we running that same shitty?

587
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:54,410
Speaker 1: how to run an anime club panel again?

588
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,438
Speaker 0: Yes, but we've never run it at anime Boston.

589
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,723
Speaker 1: Oh All right.

590
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:00,071
Speaker 1: What else are we doing at anime Boston?

591
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,800
Speaker 0: Ah, we're doing bite-sized anime.

592
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,542
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

593
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:07,058
Speaker 0: We're doing anime you should see and we're doing anime openers from around the world.

594
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:10,909
Speaker 0: Oh snap Let me tell you I got some gold.

595
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:11,812
Speaker 1: Some gold Jerry.

596
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,218
Speaker 0: I've completely reworked that stupid panel.

597
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:18,519
Speaker 0: Good God All right, and we're probably gonna do some other stuff.

598
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,231
Speaker 0: That's all TBA.

599
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,380
Speaker 0: I don't have the schedule in front of me.

600
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,548
Speaker 1: Okay And the final bit of meta is that we are doing some you streams if you are not watching them already because barely anyone is Which I can't blame you.

601
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:30,980
Speaker 1: basically we're practicing.

602
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:37,844
Speaker 0: We're pretty much just going to start you streaming and recording in some fashion every normal episode of geek nights Just to put it up there.

603
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:42,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're also you know, we're doing some live streaming things outside of geek nights.

604
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,560
Speaker 1: We're basically realized that you know, we knew for a long time video was the future, but we were so lazy about it.

605
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,695
Speaker 1: But now I'm just like well, you know what?

606
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:51,894
Speaker 1: Fuck it We just have to just turn on a webcam at the very least.

607
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:54,671
Speaker 1: We got to do something We got to learn something about this.

608
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:55,819
Speaker 1: Let's just do it.

609
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,679
Speaker 1: So now we finally we're just gonna turn webcams on all the time.

610
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:05,017
Speaker 1: I'm even looking into you know, this trying to bring up some you streaming from packs and such.

611
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:05,860
Speaker 1: we're gonna work that out.

612
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,199
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see.

613
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:11,772
Speaker 0: Okay, yep, so stay tuned for more on that front.

614
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,855
Speaker 1: so does the computer notice?

615
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,439
Speaker 1: stay tuned for more on that front.

616
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:19,994
Speaker 0: paranoia Interestingly enough, you know when paranoia was first released?

617
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:31,239
Speaker 0: the 80s 1984 yeah But I think that's a very poignant number for paranoia, I wonder if that was intentional to some degree I hope so.

618
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,639
Speaker 0: You know would be even better if that wasn't true and someone had edited Wikipedia to make it true.

619
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:41,620
Speaker 1: That would be pretty awesome If someone had you know edited Wikipedia to put in a joke like that.

620
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:44,543
Speaker 1: But no, I think it actually was released in 1984.

621
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:47,980
Speaker 0: So basically the deal like as far as I can tell with paranoia.

622
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:58,618
Speaker 0: almost every gamer in the world who's at least a Convention gamer or an old-school gamer or a role-playing gamer anyone outside of I just play Pokemon or I just play D&D.

623
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,378
Speaker 1: You know if you've been to any gaming con pretty much any tabletop role-playing gamer who is beyond the who?

624
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:15,346
Speaker 1: Has reached the point at which they realize D&D is not the only tabletop role-playing game has at least heard of Paranoia and knows at least a little about.

625
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:19,700
Speaker 0: but my suspicion and I see this a lot most gamers don't know anything about it.

626
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:38,807
Speaker 0: Almost everyone I run into they know about paranoia they know the gist of it and they have some crazy anecdote from either a time they saw some people playing it at a Convention or they ran into a game of it somewhere or they encountered it in some oblique way But they themselves had never played it.

627
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, very few people have actually played it relatively speaking.

628
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:49,472
Speaker 1: Of course I mean what the first packs who went up during the Q&A and we made this paranoia joke and taiko got it But nobody else got it.

629
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:50,580
Speaker 1: really they had no clue.

630
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:57,660
Speaker 0: Of course They didn't answer our question because it was telling that the pecs attendee badges were all red and then our panelist badges were blue.

631
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:00,600
Speaker 1: And yeah, and they all access badges were violet.

632
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,800
Speaker 0: There's no way someone in that chain of thought was not thinking paranoid.

633
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:09,360
Speaker 1: Someone was picking the colors based on some sort of paranoia based logic or just Roy G Biv.

634
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:14,220
Speaker 1: So I guess a short explanation of a paranoia is in order because I assume most people have no idea what's going on.

635
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,652
Speaker 1: So it's a tabletop RPG, right?

636
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,980
Speaker 1: But it takes place in sort of like a dystopian sci-fi future where there was a nuclear war.

637
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,507
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a nuclear war.

638
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:28,268
Speaker 1: who knows and everyone lives and like, you know These cities controlled by the computer.

639
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,080
Speaker 1: It's a lot like Phoenix future the second volume of Tezuka's Phoenix.

640
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:34,713
Speaker 0: Or take say Logan's run Logan's run very similar.

641
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:48,132
Speaker 1: mash it up with brave new world yeah, so there's a computer that controls everything and basically you can't piss off the computer or else you'll just die and All the people living there are arranged by color, right?

642
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,637
Speaker 1: So red is the lowest color.

643
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:52,430
Speaker 0: That's the troubleshooter That's not the lowest here now.

644
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:53,838
Speaker 1: Oh, you're right this zoom out.

645
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:58,900
Speaker 0: The story is that they set up a computer and the computer was to control this kind of vault.

646
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:12,897
Speaker 0: You know if you played Fallout about shelter because it's cold war there's gonna be a nuclear war or something someday maybe and One thing leads to another and the computer decides that the best way to protect everyone is to nuke everything out there and never let Anyone go outside again?

647
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:29,160
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, so people everyone in the world as far as you know lives in the paranoia world this kind of underground vault that's controlled by the computer and Everyone is desperately afraid of the communists that are clearly trying to undermine the computer and kill everybody.

648
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:32,562
Speaker 0: Yep, everyone is also secretly a communist Mm-hmm.

649
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:36,993
Speaker 0: Everyone is afraid of the mutants who are trying to kill everyone and make everyone mutants.

650
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,540
Speaker 0: Everyone is also secretly a mutant.

651
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:42,080
Speaker 0: That is the world of paranoia.

652
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:43,280
Speaker 0: Everyone is paranoid.

653
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:49,360
Speaker 0: Every asshole is trying to kill you for some reason or other and you're just watching your back and trying not to die.

654
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:54,440
Speaker 1: Now this game has actually been released multiple different times and each version was crook slightly.

655
00:40:54,601 --> 00:41:01,804
Speaker 1: So, you know those some versions were really serious and dystopian and like whoa some were really silly You know and humorous.

656
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:07,300
Speaker 1: and the newer versions paranoia XP and actually think there's one newer version that that's crook slightly.

657
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,047
Speaker 0: So here there is in 1984 first edition.

658
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:20,107
Speaker 0: Yeah 1987 second edition 1995 fifth edition Mmm 2004 XP and then 2009 ready to feel old the 25th anniversary edition.

659
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:26,987
Speaker 0: That really that really hits home.

660
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:27,408
Speaker 1: Yeah.

661
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,837
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's about the same age as we are.

662
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:31,322
Speaker 1: we were born in 82 It was born in 84.

663
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,868
Speaker 1: So we're slight.

664
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,212
Speaker 1: We're two years older than paranoia.

665
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:34,975
Speaker 1: So I'm older than 25.

666
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:35,818
Speaker 1: So there you go.

667
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:44,220
Speaker 1: But yeah, so paranoia the newest versions like XP has actually three different play modes zap normal and hardcore.

668
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:48,008
Speaker 1: I don't think that's what the actual names are But I know the first the run version names have.

669
00:41:48,088 --> 00:42:09,200
Speaker 1: basically you can play it in silly mode or a serious mode Which actually is really interesting because it gives the game a lot of depth and it also gives you sort of like this entry point Into the larger world, you know It's like you can play some silly games of paranoia to get into it and learn the basic rules And then once you're comfortable you can start playing a serious game and it's like whoa, what the fuck dude.

670
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:18,960
Speaker 0: Now I think the best way to get into paranoia because a lot of people want to play paranoia But gotta play at a convention You've got to play it at a convention.

671
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:26,060
Speaker 0: But you have to basically find someone who's running a game of paranoia who is good at it and play in their game.

672
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,415
Speaker 0: And it is the less, you know about paranoia the better the better.

673
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:32,929
Speaker 1: indeed paranoia It's anyone who knows too much about.

674
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,460
Speaker 1: it's one of those things where if you know enough about it Then you won't make like stupid newbie mistakes.

675
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:42,138
Speaker 1: But stupid people making stupid newbie mistakes is where all the humor and awesome shit comes from.

676
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,440
Speaker 0: of course Advanced players take it one step further and do the burning wheel.

677
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,610
Speaker 0: You know metagaming of I am going to do the.

678
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:54,732
Speaker 0: the stupid thing that my character would think would smart would be smart But I know according to the rules is going to kill him.

679
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,720
Speaker 1: Well, it goes even to a higher level, right?

680
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,247
Speaker 1: For example, let's say you're playing with six newbies, right?

681
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,009
Speaker 1: You're the GM.

682
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,273
Speaker 1: You're gonna ask someone.

683
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:02,858
Speaker 1: Are you a happy communist, right?

684
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:10,106
Speaker 1: Oh And they're gonna fall for it maybe and then the computer will zap them and they'll chug down a can of soda and then come back to life.

685
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,499
Speaker 1: if You're playing with an experienced player an experienced player wouldn't fall for that trick.

686
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:19,553
Speaker 1: But in addition an experienced player would try to trick the other players, right?

687
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:25,470
Speaker 1: And if you have all experienced players Oh, it's a friggin cutthroat motherfucker at that point.

688
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:28,700
Speaker 0: I mean most games of paranoia are one-offs.

689
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:37,504
Speaker 0: Oftentimes, they'll be pseudo larp style where you'll play around a table But a lot of times you'll have props on the table all these sorts of you know Objects to interact with.

690
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:45,899
Speaker 0: you'll stand up you'll run around you might jump up and sing the bouncy bubbly beverage song You don't know the lyrics to but damn if the computer isn't gonna kill you if you don't sing it.

691
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:54,271
Speaker 1: Yep, and that you're speaking of, you know, the bubbly beverage is already a mentioned soda, but there's a. there's a a Thing in paranoia called the six pack.

692
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,819
Speaker 1: you get six lives and then you're.

693
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,091
Speaker 1: you know Your body is just regenerated and such.

694
00:43:58,212 --> 00:43:59,800
Speaker 0: basically you get six clones of yourself.

695
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:07,146
Speaker 0: so every time you know, your clone is popped out and it's you and if you die, they pop out another you and Everyone gets six.

696
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:32,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, and after the sixth one, you're actually dead And so what people often do is you'll have a six-pack of beverage any beverage of your choice wink wink on the table usually something that will make you pee and Every time you die you open one up and you start drinking and when you finish that beverage Then you begin playing again and you are now that is represents your you know Coming back to life and being removed from the cryo chamber, whatever the hell it's in.

697
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:45,000
Speaker 1: right now The thing is drinking all these beverages you're gonna have to pee and when you're away from the table Your character is not away from the table and very likely when you come back from being you will be drinking another beverage immediately.

698
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:56,146
Speaker 0: It's a game where it's one of the first games I ever played where I started to understand that the meta like Metagaming can make a game better.

699
00:44:56,286 --> 00:45:01,363
Speaker 0: It was the game where I realized that losing is more fun than winning Mmm-hmm.

700
00:45:01,644 --> 00:45:03,773
Speaker 0: It's also a game where you're pretty much guaranteed to lose.

701
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:05,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much event.

702
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,059
Speaker 1: You know, if you play a serious game, you're gonna die a lot less frequently and you're gonna.

703
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:17,347
Speaker 1: you know You're gonna make it a lot farther, but you're gonna die, you know, maybe once per session, you know Maybe once every other session or so.

704
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:25,400
Speaker 1: if you place not so seriously, you're gonna die Lose all six lives within the one session at the convention pretty much guaranteed.

705
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:31,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean basically the way most missions will go or one-offs at a convention are you're a bunch of mugs.

706
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:40,580
Speaker 1: You know red color maybe a higher color doesn't really matter and you're given some task And you the computer says do this and if you don't do that, the computer is just gonna kill you.

707
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,076
Speaker 0: So you better do it, but it's something serious like go figure out what's wrong with the the sewage thing over here find out why this guy disappeared or something like that.

708
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:58,600
Speaker 0: and Every character will probably have some completely ulterior mode if they want to accomplish and Oftentimes one of the players will be given by that, you know, there's a lot of secret information and note passing.

709
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,378
Speaker 0: So the game master might pass you a note.

710
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:15,454
Speaker 0: You know when the plate game starts up and you just open it and it just says something like You know for a fact that there is a cortex bomb in your skull and in so-and-so skull Great, or you are in fact a communist having read.

711
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:16,740
Speaker 0: This has made you a communist.

712
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,999
Speaker 0: Now smart players will give that note to someone else.

713
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:31,960
Speaker 0: a lot of times Players will like write a note like I totally want to do blah blah blah and blah blah blah and just pull up the note And just hand it to the game master.

714
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:41,560
Speaker 0: a lot of experienced players will write gibberish on a note or Nothing of note on a note or saying I'm running a note to make so-and-so paranoid and hand it to the game master.

715
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,720
Speaker 1: Mmm very very clever.

716
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:49,242
Speaker 1: Also a good idea is to hand a note to the game master that says I would like to talk to you privately over to The side.

717
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:51,453
Speaker 1: go over to the side and say I just wanted to talk.

718
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:56,310
Speaker 1: you do privately over to the side You know because that makes me even more paranoid than the fake note.

719
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:58,858
Speaker 1: or you can go over and tell them right.

720
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:03,426
Speaker 1: for example I could bring the game master over and I could say hey listen I'm gonna pass a note to so-and-so.

721
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:07,100
Speaker 1: that makes them a communist so that they something something something.

722
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,676
Speaker 1: So I need you to take advantage of that something something and you hand a note to that person.

723
00:47:10,717 --> 00:47:11,460
Speaker 1: that does nothing different.

724
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,860
Speaker 1: So you can punk the game master - that's always a good time.

725
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,543
Speaker 0: That's the whole.

726
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:17,372
Speaker 0: that's basically the whole point of the game.

727
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:24,497
Speaker 0: that and the game master Usually why his job is to make you have a good time and if possible to kill all of you.

728
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:25,039
Speaker 0: mm-hmm.

729
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,640
Speaker 0: He wants you all to die and have a total party because you have six lives.

730
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,187
Speaker 1: It's like undead.

731
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:31,910
Speaker 1: whatever come back.

732
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:32,473
Speaker 1: You know.

733
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:37,699
Speaker 1: It's not like ah dead in D&D You're gonna kill someone like guard that can or a marty duck.

734
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,368
Speaker 1: You know you got six lives.

735
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:51,040
Speaker 1: so as long as you don't lose all six And if you do lose all six as long as you're not the first person who's all six You can just be like god damn it And you just sit off to the side laughing at what everyone else is doing because the game is probably already almost over by then.

736
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:57,980
Speaker 1: Because even if you suck ass six lives is still plenty of game time to get your funds worth out of it.

737
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:03,690
Speaker 1: You know out of the single session Anything else to say about the paradigm?

738
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:04,132
Speaker 0: I don't know.

739
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,620
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into game details.

740
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:10,398
Speaker 0: I would say none of you should read anything, but kind of the intro book.

741
00:48:10,538 --> 00:48:11,060
Speaker 1: Oh, this is true.

742
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,450
Speaker 1: There is there's a thing in paranoid.

743
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,706
Speaker 1: depending on what color you are Determines what colors you can interact with.

744
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,000
Speaker 1: for example if there's a blue gun like the gun is physically blue, and I am red.

745
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:21,625
Speaker 1: That's above me.

746
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:22,791
Speaker 1: I can't touch that.

747
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:24,620
Speaker 1: if I can well you can.

748
00:48:25,162 --> 00:48:32,514
Speaker 1: But if you do and the computer sees you you're probably gonna die and if someone else sees you they're probably gonna rat you out To the computer or kill you or you know.

749
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,322
Speaker 1: so It's.

750
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:39,000
Speaker 1: you know you're not supposed to in you know involve yourself with things that are a higher color than you are.

751
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,084
Speaker 1: You know it's like you're.

752
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:42,031
Speaker 1: you're limited to what color you're at.

753
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:45,443
Speaker 1: if you're playing a serious game and not the silly game You're probably never.

754
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:49,959
Speaker 1: you're probably going to avoid interacting with anything above you because dying is more serious in a serious game.

755
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:57,960
Speaker 1: so What in the rule book if you buy paranoia XP for example the front part of the book is you know red red red red?

756
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,261
Speaker 1: Red.

757
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:09,589
Speaker 1: and then about halfway through the book the color changes to ultraviolet Which is you know so that only the GM can look back there and if a player looks you know takes the book and flips To one of those back pages.

758
00:49:09,952 --> 00:49:10,658
Speaker 1: dumb dumb dumb.

759
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:26,354
Speaker 1: They actually print a separate book the little red book ha ha ha right that has only the red parts in it For the game so that you can hand that out to people who if you're actually serious about you know the color rules And all and you could you do all sorts of fun stuff with that.

760
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:29,538
Speaker 1: like someone picks up a pencil That's yellow you like oh, man.

761
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,402
Speaker 1: Or you know you could be like hey red guy the computer tells you to go over to get your orders from the you know Computer.

762
00:49:36,422 --> 00:49:39,172
Speaker 1: it's it's printing out of the printer in sector 7.

763
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:42,384
Speaker 1: Oh my god Luke Did that you go to this.

764
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:46,097
Speaker 1: you go to sector 7 and there's a printer and it's printing out some you know.

765
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,986
Speaker 1: and there's a you Know security camera.

766
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:54,399
Speaker 1: looking at the printer and the instructions are coming out And you see that your name is written on the instructions on this purple piece of paper.

767
00:49:55,221 --> 00:50:00,279
Speaker 1: It's just like oh fuck I can't take the orders out of this printer and like half the orders is still in the printer.

768
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,026
Speaker 0: well That's the the propness.

769
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:03,453
Speaker 0: I mean when Luke handed me.

770
00:50:03,473 --> 00:50:04,980
Speaker 0: You know he basically held up his hands.

771
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:10,220
Speaker 0: We played paranoia at RIT around the table, and he kind of spit out the orders to each person like here are your orders?

772
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:19,580
Speaker 0: And then one of us we go up and like I I go to grab it and he holds on to it And he starts pulling it back in like I only got half of them.

773
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,076
Speaker 0: Paranoia is a game where you'll be at a convention and you'll see like some other do you know?

774
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:42,797
Speaker 0: there's all like the tables where People are playing different games like D&D game going on over there Maybe some inspectors over there and in the corner the people playing paranoia look like a normal game Except periodically they will cause a great ruckus in the room and everyone will look over and say what are they doing

775
00:50:42,978 --> 00:50:43,660
Speaker 1: playing paranoia?

776
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,150
Speaker 1: The most ruckus ERPG available.

777
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,399
Speaker 0: it is possibly the most ruckus ERPG.

778
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:54,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy who made paranoia at least one of the guys is a major guys is Greg Kostikin.

779
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of very famous.

780
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:56,786
Speaker 1: He tried.

781
00:50:56,986 --> 00:51:00,918
Speaker 1: You know he's actually doing a lot of big stuff now even he has a great blog.

782
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:11,160
Speaker 1: play this Thing I think I've talked about in the show way back and basically you go to this blog And it'll tell you about all sorts of interesting games all the time mostly indie games.

783
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,246
Speaker 1: He's big with the indie games, and he actually he started this like indie game thing But he sort of it failed.

784
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:22,180
Speaker 1: I think it was like man if red manifesto or something like that.

785
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:40,300
Speaker 1: I forget the exact name of the company, but It didn't work out You know because he couldn't compete with say steam and such and such and the indie games got a prominent spot in other online Game selling services, so you know his indie thing only didn't really need to stick around, but you know he's that kind of guy.

786
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:44,053
Speaker 1: he's pretty awesome and You know you should check out anything.

787
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,985
Speaker 1: if you see his name on it you know it's probably high quality.

788
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:47,988
Speaker 1: gaming is involved.

789
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:54,149
Speaker 0: plus paranoia definitely comes out of an older tradition of role-playing games.

790
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:57,702
Speaker 1: his day is definitely Steve Jackson sort of era of Gaming.

791
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,220
Speaker 1: not that he's not gaming now, but you know it's his his original era.

792
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:04,499
Speaker 1: It's a sort of gaming the illuminati versus the munchkin era.

793
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:09,920
Speaker 0: Paranoia is relatively mainstream compared to many more indie role-playing games.

794
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,800
Speaker 0: I mean most people most gamers we talked to don't even know there are any role-playing games.

795
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:15,369
Speaker 1: Alright, it's D&D.

796
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:17,079
Speaker 1: Maybe they know a white wolf exists.

797
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:22,098
Speaker 0: You know that's it, but paranoia just it's over with all the indie games like.

798
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:22,620
Speaker 0: it's unique.

799
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,180
Speaker 0: It does something cool and different.

800
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:30,280
Speaker 0: It's such a great game to play and you should all go to some convention somewhere and play paranoia.

801
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:39,180
