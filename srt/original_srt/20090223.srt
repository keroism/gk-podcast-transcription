1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,986
Speaker 0: It's Monday, February 23rd.

2
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:12,749
Speaker 0: I'm rims.

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,975
Speaker 0: God and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,740
Speaker 0: It's a tech news roundup.

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,905
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:38,629
Speaker 0: Well despite saying we do it all winter and not doing it scojo, and I finally went out skiing again Mm-hmm, and it was pretty awesome plus.

7
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,659
Speaker 0: We brought Emily along and you know it's always interesting.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,020
Speaker 0: You got to figure out what to do when you've got like two I'm not gonna say expert skiers just risk-taking skiers cuz we're pretty terrible and then a beginner.

9
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:52,329
Speaker 1: So basically yeah, that's that's always a rough.

10
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:12,939
Speaker 1: I mean in any social situation where there is something that prevents people from staying together like let's say you go to amusement park and someone's not tall enough to ride the rollercoaster or maybe you go to the amusement park and someone doesn't have a bathing suit or You're going to play a board game, and it only can handle five people and as you got seven people But you're gonna play it anyway.

11
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what do you do when you're in a social situation?

12
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:24,920
Speaker 1: the reason that you know you're together You want to stay together, but for some reason you can't all stay together right this moment, and you need to split up.

13
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:32,202
Speaker 1: It's like should you just let Emily fend for herself on the bunny hill or you should hang out with her thus sacrificing your own Enjoyment.

14
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,187
Speaker 1: you know it's like you could.

15
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,780
Speaker 1: obviously you could spend part-time one part-time the other.

16
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:43,432
Speaker 0: See the thing is with skiing one is that if you're a first-time skier because she'd never skied before in her life, so Like it wasn't like.

17
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:46,678
Speaker 0: I even thought like hey Maybe I'll like teach her how to ski and maybe mean Scott.

18
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,937
Speaker 0: together We're like teacher all the tricks, but was there a ski teaching person that then?

19
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:55,780
Speaker 0: oh yes There was okay, but we look at each other, and we're like we kind of ski crappily and dangerously.

20
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,430
Speaker 0: We would probably not be the best instructor.

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,079
Speaker 0: so Emily went and took lessons for the morning.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,139
Speaker 1: well We think there's a cost extra to take lessons.

23
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:09,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can pay for group lessons You can pay a lot more for private lessons really so you can't.

24
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:13,189
Speaker 1: so if I just go and buy you know To buy a lift ticket to get less

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:30,338
Speaker 0: actually well the most places like this place They had a plan where if you if you want to buy a lesson for like 70 bucks They give you a lift ticket that only lets you on to the lower mountain Which is fine because the upper mountain is stuff you can't do if you've never skied before like you'll just die up there And it includes a rental and a lesson and like everything you need.

26
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,871
Speaker 1: no So it's basically have you never skied before?

27
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,640
Speaker 1: give us this amount of money, and we'll hook you up.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll take care of everything for you And we'll teach you the basics.

29
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:40,399
Speaker 0: and beginner ski lessons are like here's how to put your skis.

30
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:41,543
Speaker 1: Stand up.

31
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:42,527
Speaker 1: Don't fall down.

32
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:43,290
Speaker 0: Well.

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,333
Speaker 0: It depends on where you go.

34
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,320
Speaker 0: when I was a kid ski lessons consistent.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,019
Speaker 0: I don't put the skis on backwards stop falling down.

36
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,708
Speaker 1: Think about people like getting swimming lessons right.

37
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,115
Speaker 1: kick move your arms.

38
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,659
Speaker 1: Don't put your head in the water.

39
00:02:59,759 --> 00:02:59,960
Speaker 1: kick.

40
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:06,846
Speaker 0: It's like that does not helping yep, but Emily had quite actually a pretty good aptitude for it So she pretty much blew by.

41
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,093
Speaker 1: that's something else.

42
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,480
Speaker 1: I noticed right when I was a kid.

43
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:22,724
Speaker 1: I remember taking lessons in various things right and people always give you instruction But for some reason like I didn't take the instruction like there's just something in my I don't know what it was But it's like I didn't like.

44
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:31,920
Speaker 0: honestly like really think about what I was being told and actually you know what I'm reading the judging Eye, and they talk a lot about that and actually try to do it.

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,591
Speaker 1: But now like if I'm doing something and someone's instructing me.

46
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:42,219
Speaker 1: I actually pay attention to all the words they say Think about them and try to you know execute on it.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 1: So while you know obviously break how brains work right when you're a kid you learn things a lot more easily.

48
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:54,720
Speaker 1: The thing is I can still like I'm sort of amazed at how well I can learn things now because I think that I have.

49
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,637
Speaker 1: I think that I have a much harder time learning than I used to but I really don't.

50
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,168
Speaker 0: well I mean, I learned here.

51
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,338
Speaker 1: I got it in like a few days.

52
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,360
Speaker 0: It depends on the wheel and all those sorts of things, but there's also just the natural aptitude.

53
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,560
Speaker 1: I think that's well there is natural aptitude.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:16,639
Speaker 0: No a big part of that is you can always tell like martial arts are a good example because a lot of the people in a martial arts that's a good example of something I didn't listen To when I was getting instructed as a kid.

55
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:25,180
Speaker 1: You know how many times the karate guy told me to take my because I was I was making a fist wrong had to put The thumb on the outside and so the inside if you put your thumb on the inside you're gonna break your thumb.

56
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,135
Speaker 1: But I was never never actually punched anyone.

57
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:27,840
Speaker 1: so it didn't happen.

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,643
Speaker 1: But they kept you.

59
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:33,880
Speaker 1: every time I put the thumb inside the fist because I was a kid I had to punch people in class.

60
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I had to punch things things and people.

61
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:38,779
Speaker 1: I never made it that far.

62
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:58,800
Speaker 0: But with martial arts you'll see a lot of people will take like a martial art martial arts class And they listen to the instructor and they try to do it But they don't like get it on a fundamental level like there's this body awareness at least for physical Instruction where like an instructor can only take you so far they can explain all the technique and they can give examples and show you.

63
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:10,515
Speaker 0: but Unless you have the body aptitude to kind of feel what's going on in your body and intuit What you should be doing and have just proper balance that instruction is really never gonna get you anywhere.

64
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:14,500
Speaker 1: the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plane

65
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:26,740
Speaker 0: But she did all right And it actually it worked out pretty well because Kojer and I went up and like hurt ourselves a bunch And then we came down we got lunch And it turns out there's one lift that goes up to like the biggest bunny hill and then at the top

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,705
Speaker 1: - more than one bunny hill there's like

67
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,391
Speaker 0: six bunny hills.

68
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,980
Speaker 0: whoa and Emily been doing all the like really easy one.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,200
Speaker 0: So we took her over to the big one of the bigger lift.

70
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,780
Speaker 0: And then at the top of that there's another lift that goes up to like the good mountain.

71
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:41,580
Speaker 0: So we could ride the lift up.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,576
Speaker 0: I mean That's the main reason to ski with people is so When you're sitting there for ten minutes on the lift with nothing to do you kind of just hang out enjoy.

73
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:48,926
Speaker 1: the lift takes ten minutes.

74
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:52,490
Speaker 0: uh Yeah, it goes a ways mm-hmm.

75
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,276
Speaker 1: How long does it take to get down?

76
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:55,400
Speaker 0: uh depends?

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,319
Speaker 0: Between 30 seconds and six or seven minutes depending on what kind of slope it is.

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,807
Speaker 1: I just try to you know is it so?

79
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:03,893
Speaker 1: is it like the roller coaster?

80
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:08,126
Speaker 1: you wait in line for an hour And then the ride is like two minutes And then you're like the thing is.

81
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,637
Speaker 0: I mean the lift is fun because usually you're there with friends.

82
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:11,440
Speaker 0: You're hanging out.

83
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,061
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure the live can be fun It's not.

84
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,303
Speaker 1: you know?

85
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,737
Speaker 1: I mean people pay to ride the sky car at the amusement park.

86
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:18,012
Speaker 1: right well That's I can use me musing park as the exam.

87
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:23,655
Speaker 0: as we've always pointed out You can pay to ride what is effectively a ski lift to nowhere at most amusement parks.

88
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,160
Speaker 1: the thing is the ski lift.

89
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:26,647
Speaker 1: You can't ride it back down.

90
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:27,049
Speaker 1: Can you?

91
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,040
Speaker 1: no no so you have to get off?

92
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,290
Speaker 0: And then which is what you want to do.

93
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,520
Speaker 0: I mean if you didn't get off That's like standing in line at the roller coaster so that you can then go.

94
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:41,260
Speaker 1: What would happen to you if you just sat and didn't jump off at the top?

95
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,700
Speaker 0: There's a thing that stops the whole thing and then it stops it interstating there.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,559
Speaker 0: And they say get off and if you don't they kind of just drag you off.

97
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:51,576
Speaker 1: So it there's no possible way that it could dump you down the mountain.

98
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,966
Speaker 1: nope What if it that?

99
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,620
Speaker 1: what if that thing that stops it broke?

100
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,980
Speaker 0: There's also a guy sitting there with a button and if he hits the button it stops, and then they take you off.

101
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:02,019
Speaker 0: You don't want to ride it down you want to ski down.

102
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,068
Speaker 1: I'm just saying like what would have you know?

103
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:16,600
Speaker 0: of course the funniest part was at the top of the real mountain There's only one Blue square down like that's kind of like the easy way down like if you fucked up You can at least go down that way even if you're not a great skier.

104
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:24,759
Speaker 0: But when you get to the top there's a sign that showed that trail and it said closed And a lot of people would get up there and go what?

105
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:26,959
Speaker 1: Then how would they get down?

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,208
Speaker 0: Well the top part of it was closed.

107
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,442
Speaker 0: if you went down a little bit further you could get right on that trail and you Were fine.

108
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,295
Speaker 0: no, but all the noobs like didn't realize it and all day.

109
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,400
Speaker 0: I was watching people get up there.

110
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,902
Speaker 1: What was there?

111
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:40,799
Speaker 1: a ski person telling them no that maybe should have had a person.

112
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:41,605
Speaker 0: well There's a map.

113
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:43,056
Speaker 0: it just people don't look at the map.

114
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:43,559
Speaker 0: What can I say?

115
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:46,240
Speaker 1: I mean you know I get a map isn't real?

116
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,758
Speaker 1: I mean if you're skiing a map could just fly out of your whatever.

117
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:52,440
Speaker 0: well Like you get to the top, and there's a gigantic map on a billboard.

118
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,667
Speaker 0: Okay, don't carry a man.

119
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:55,593
Speaker 1: That's how I say.

120
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 1: it carries a map.

121
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,416
Speaker 1: That's like when you they give you like you're taking your map of the amusement park to the water park.

122
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,125
Speaker 1: now Well there it goes.

123
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,095
Speaker 0: the water park was always the big conundrum.

124
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:11,187
Speaker 0: not really not the water park But the rides that get you wet.

125
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,797
Speaker 0: yeah in an amusement park should you go to the lockers?

126
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:14,680
Speaker 1: should you not go to the?

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,147
Speaker 0: Lock you know not even that.

128
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:17,795
Speaker 0: the fundamental question of all right.

129
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,840
Speaker 0: I'm riding roller coasters.

130
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,287
Speaker 0: We're all wearing normal clothes.

131
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:26,760
Speaker 0: someone says hey, let's go on Thunder Mountain Whatever splash and everyone's like yeah, you imagine yourself on it.

132
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,239
Speaker 0: You're like that's really fun.

133
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:32,761
Speaker 0: And then we get wet and then you imagine yourself for the rest of the day Wet.

134
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:39,078
Speaker 1: the key is to go wicked early all right when nobody else is going on the water ride.

135
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,000
Speaker 1: so early in the morning.

136
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:45,093
Speaker 1: Go get a locker immediately get your bathing suit and everything bathing suit.

137
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that means you're carrying that shit around.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,653
Speaker 1: no No, you got the locker, but you carried it in.

139
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:50,678
Speaker 1: you carry it in.

140
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,950
Speaker 0: yeah Plus you can't do that early at any good amusement park.

141
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,800
Speaker 0: if you get in you've got to make a beeline for one of the rollercoasters.

142
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:01,151
Speaker 1: Water park like crazy not the water park.

143
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,830
Speaker 0: the water ride water park is a whole separate park I don't know.

144
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:06,320
Speaker 1: at the amusement parks.

145
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:08,952
Speaker 1: I went to the water park and amusement park at the same thing either.

146
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:09,835
Speaker 1: just sort of they're not?

147
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:11,403
Speaker 1: you know the ticket gets you Into everything.

148
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,040
Speaker 0: there's no separate tickets even if it's not separate tickets.

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,258
Speaker 0: They're always like separate places like you go to the amusement park And then you leave it you go to a separate area where there are lockers.

150
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,828
Speaker 1: I mean I guess it's six flags.

151
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:32,680
Speaker 1: Well what was called Riverside and is now Six Flags, New England You know the water park is just like I guess it's a separate area, but there's nothing in between it, but a fence.

152
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,820
Speaker 1: It's just basically at the end of the path.

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,025
Speaker 1: It's like you have this big path.

154
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:39,900
Speaker 1: a one end of it is oh basically this stuff all along the path.

155
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,513
Speaker 1: So I guess it's just that one end of it.

156
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:42,420
Speaker 1: all the rides are water.

157
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:47,206
Speaker 0: I guess I'm too used to like Kings Island or see your point where like the water park There is as big as most water parks.

158
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:48,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly.

159
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,776
Speaker 0: I just every time I ride by splash down I just feel really sad about.

160
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:53,260
Speaker 1: it's real sad.

161
00:09:54,481 --> 00:10:01,115
Speaker 1: It's the things we got to go to Texas to go to that Schlitter bond Which is all water 100% we have to.

162
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:05,217
Speaker 0: because I'm I'm missing Things that forced me to get wet while I'm going down a tube.

163
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,715
Speaker 1: man You know what are actually a really good water ride is at.

164
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:12,512
Speaker 1: I think it's in Islands of Adventure in Universal Studios.

165
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:13,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a Popeye ride.

166
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,360
Speaker 1: It's one of those big circular raft goes all-around ride.

167
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:21,380
Speaker 0: The best thing about those is that there's always like the one seat that just doesn't get wet.

168
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,264
Speaker 1: Well, no, no.

169
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:25,260
Speaker 1: No, this isn't one of those ones that goes like down, right?

170
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,577
Speaker 1: This goes in a circle around and it's like and it's sort of a lazy river.

171
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:31,400
Speaker 1: It's sort of deceptive.

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

173
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:38,049
Speaker 1: It's a lazy river, but basically They're dropping water on you from a.

174
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,676
Speaker 0: that's exactly what I'm talking about.

175
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:40,640
Speaker 0: It's like Russian roulette.

176
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,897
Speaker 1: No, everyone gets stupid wet.

177
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,969
Speaker 1: No, no There's no dry seat.

178
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,580
Speaker 0: the way that is supposed to work.

179
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,320
Speaker 0: The best way to do that ride is you sit in a big circle and you're strapped in and it goes down.

180
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,340
Speaker 0: It's like whitewater rapids and there's waterfalls and like things dumping water all over the place and you come up to them.

181
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,114
Speaker 0: And it's the Russian roulette because every time one seat doesn't get it now.

182
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:03,560
Speaker 1: Literally I went on this thing.

183
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:10,196
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's one part where they drop you off a waterfall that's maybe like 10 feet tall, you know pretty high and then you

184
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:10,739
Speaker 0: go under

185
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:16,740
Speaker 1: a waterfall that literally gets everyone completely wet and then there's like pop I will dump a bucket of water on you and shit

186
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,021
Speaker 0: and See.

187
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:25,080
Speaker 0: as a kid the thing I'd always do me and my dad is we'd always ride this over and over again with our idiot Friends or just with strangers, but we'd figured out because of the way the bumps were.

188
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,059
Speaker 0: There's like this big rotunda where you got on the rafts and they strapped you in.

189
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:30,484
Speaker 0: You could see.

190
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:36,833
Speaker 0: there was a spot where the way if one seat was lined up with like this one bumper that seat Never got wet.

191
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:41,076
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So we'd always get on there and they make bets with people and then they'd all get wet and we'd laugh.

192
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,764
Speaker 0: and that was that Was my childhood.

193
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,303
Speaker 1: I guess I guess it's possible but I guess you know I like.

194
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:50,060
Speaker 0: I like always having that element of chance element of danger.

195
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:51,907
Speaker 1: You know what a really great thing to do is.

196
00:11:51,988 --> 00:12:04,817
Speaker 1: there are places that actually have literal lazy river rides Which is you get in a tube that's enough for one person and it literally just has a tiny current and you go around In a big circle, and there's no water splashing.

197
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,360
Speaker 1: There's no nothing.

198
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,512
Speaker 1: Everyone's just laying in in little circular tubes going.

199
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:09,917
Speaker 0: Ah, you know, it's either point.

200
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:10,700
Speaker 0: they have to.

201
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:11,986
Speaker 1: yeah, and you know what.

202
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:17,995
Speaker 1: you go on those lazy rivers and it's like Go in with all your clothes on and your shoes and see how long you can stay dry.

203
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:20,482
Speaker 1: No, that's Cuz.

204
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:23,759
Speaker 1: I mean you think it'd be easy right, but you got to hold your legs like up in the air.

205
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:26,900
Speaker 1: Otherwise your shoes go in the water unless you get a really big tube.

206
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:34,582
Speaker 0: I used to love those things but then when I was a kid finally we went to Tennessee and I went to bid like actual tubing and It was basically.

207
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:41,505
Speaker 0: these hillbillies took us in a busted up school bus up like me and my dad my brother and like six other Strangers.

208
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,476
Speaker 0: they drove us up the mountain for like 45 minutes.

209
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:51,853
Speaker 0: They stopped and like this wilderness road and they pointed and they said rivers that way Yeah, and four hours later.

210
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,040
Speaker 0: We made it back to civilization.

211
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:57,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing is like a lazy river kind of thing.

212
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,899
Speaker 1: I wouldn't if I was going to amusement park, I wouldn't waste my time on that.

213
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:09,727
Speaker 1: But if I had like a mansion I would totally have a lazy river installed like maybe I would have a lazy moat and he would like if I wanted to just Like relax and go.

214
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,540
Speaker 1: ah, I would totally go in the lazy river.

215
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,769
Speaker 0: I think that's one of the signs of becoming an adult.

216
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:20,334
Speaker 0: when you go to the amusement park and you know when you're a kid It's like you're gonna ride all the roller coasters as many as possible as fast as possible.

217
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:21,378
Speaker 0: Mom can't keep up.

218
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,020
Speaker 0: Leave her behind.

219
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:32,397
Speaker 0: But when you get older you'll walk like you walk through the frontier town as a kid and you see like The cabaret show or like the stuff they do and all the like side attractions that aren't rides.

220
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,864
Speaker 0: You're like screw that That's just a trick.

221
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:34,790
Speaker 0: I get around the roller coaster.

222
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,480
Speaker 1: The thing is those things are pretty cool.

223
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,206
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

224
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:43,511
Speaker 0: when you get older you start to look at those things You look at like the cabana or the relax Oh part and you're like, huh?

225
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,676
Speaker 0: Nice relaxing resort town stuff.

226
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:50,633
Speaker 1: Yeah I was stupid when I was a kid not liking that actually.

227
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,276
Speaker 1: Yeah.

228
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:54,934
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, so do you want to you want to try this thing?

229
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,220
Speaker 0: enough beating around the bush?

230
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me all right.

231
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,399
Speaker 1: Let me explain this thing, right?

232
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:01,760
Speaker 1: So basically we're gonna do a tech news roundup today.

233
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,920
Speaker 1: So I'm like, hey if we're gonna do a tech news roundup for the show because there's a whole fuck ton of tech news, right?

234
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,149
Speaker 1: Why should we do news up front?

235
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,834
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of redundant, right?

236
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,157
Speaker 1: It's just more news.

237
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:30,592
Speaker 1: So Geek nights was in part Inspired by this television show on ESPN called PTI or part of the interruption where these two guys sort of you know argue or not argue about Sports topics in a rapid-fire manner.

238
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,500
Speaker 1: and you know, it's a very popular show.

239
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,012
Speaker 1: It's like the only thing on ESPN worth watching.

240
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,480
Speaker 1: cuz Sports Center ain't what it used to be.

241
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,824
Speaker 0: All right, old gray man.

242
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:38,727
Speaker 1: No gray man.

243
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,020
Speaker 1: So they on this show they play various like games, right?

244
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,360
Speaker 1: We're like, they'll do like an odds game where they'll be like, what are the odds of this?

245
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,979
Speaker 1: You know or they'll be like, you know over under someone hitting 10 home runs this year, you know.

246
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,680
Speaker 1: And they have to say, you know, whether they think it's over under and argue about it.

247
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,299
Speaker 1: So it it's sort of you know Gives a nice little structure for to a show or a segment of a show.

248
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:05,919
Speaker 1: We had two guys and we happen to have a show with two guys, which is why I was partially inspired by that.

249
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:12,520
Speaker 0: So, of course we didn't go with the original title of geek nights, which was pillow talk with Raymond Scott.

250
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:21,233
Speaker 1: No, but if we would have started the show pre 2005 that would have been the name, you know, you think we're joking.

251
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,709
Speaker 1: we would have started the show in 2002. it would have been pillow talk with Raymond Scott.

252
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:25,232
Speaker 1: the scary thing.

253
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:28,906
Speaker 0: you all think we're joking but Be glad we started the show.

254
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:37,837
Speaker 1: I mean I made that first podcast in what Oh three or four I'm like, we basically were doing geek nights for like one or two of our friends since 2002, right?

255
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:43,120
Speaker 1: So, um one of the bits they do on this sports show is called role-play.

256
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,368
Speaker 1: Oh, it's perfect for us role-playing gamers, right?

257
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:50,670
Speaker 1: Basically what they do is they'll go like hey, you know You are such-and-such basket.

258
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,639
Speaker 1: You are to Kimbe Motombo, you know.

259
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,020
Speaker 1: You know, you just had this and this, you know.

260
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,880
Speaker 1: And then they explain like what the news bit is about to Kimbe Motombo and then it's like, you know.

261
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,940
Speaker 1: Then the other person has to pretend that they're to Kimbe Motombo and you know sort of doing just like saying Motombo.

262
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:10,196
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, the Kimbe Motombo is amazing.

263
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:10,880
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.

264
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:17,649
Speaker 1: So, you know an example of this would be like, you know Let's pretend it was like last year, right?

265
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,580
Speaker 1: I'd be like, hey rim, you know, you're Bill Gates.

266
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:23,673
Speaker 1: You were just in a really stupid commercial with Seinfeld.

267
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:24,255
Speaker 1: You know, what do you?

268
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,580
Speaker 1: what do you have to say for years?

269
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,165
Speaker 1: Can you explain that commercial to us?

270
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:31,180
Speaker 1: and then ram has to pretend he's Bill Gates and explain the commercial.

271
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:40,900
Speaker 1: So and then you know, so I figured hey Let's let's try this and see if we have you know, the thing is I think those sports guys to be honest I think they prepare in advance.

272
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:50,318
Speaker 0: I I didn't realize until like five minutes ago as I was going I was going through my email and shit while we're doing The show and I realized that Scott actually sent me something that I didn't look at.

273
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:53,538
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, well you had to repair somewhat cuz you have to come up with.

274
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:59,840
Speaker 1: you know Who the people are and what the news stories are and such but we did not prepare our role plays in any fashion.

275
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:05,513
Speaker 1: so this could be Hilariously bad or we could actually do a good job.

276
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:12,971
Speaker 1: and I think you know if we like if people like this segment we can keep trying it and We're gonna have to build skills at it.

277
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,925
Speaker 1: This isn't just a naturally easy Segment where we just say stuff.

278
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:20,060
Speaker 1: it requires thought and we might have long pauses.

279
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,126
Speaker 1: We might have to edit out before we.

280
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:23,830
Speaker 0: I'm not editing shit.

281
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:24,814
Speaker 0: Don't even look at me.

282
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,780
Speaker 1: All right, let's you want to try it?

283
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,362
Speaker 0: I don't know.

284
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:28,185
Speaker 0: I think I can try it.

307
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,852
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna let that go through.

308
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:41,000
Speaker 0: so I didn't have any accent.

309
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:46,143
Speaker 1: I think we're supposed to say a little bit more than that, but whatever Harry era.

310
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,690
Speaker 0: so Scott you're one of the TV executives.

311
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,239

319
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:15,975

Speaker 1: you know they were stealing the TV on a computer.

327
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:41,260
Speaker 1: so I figure hey We can get some advertising dollars over there, and so I'll try to break through the tubes here.

328
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,460
Speaker 0: But you do realize that nerds hook up their computers to their televisions.

Speaker 1: all right all right, so rim you are Steve Ballmer developers.

332
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:13,971

333
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:15,940

Speaker 0: I want this favor to be repaid to me.

338

Speaker 0: And yet you are somehow thinking that you do not have to repay this favor to me That somehow you can.

339
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:33,720
Speaker 0: you can get away without repaying this favor that I have given to you.

346
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,586
Speaker 0: We're Microsoft.

Speaker 0: you can.

349
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:51,935
Speaker 0: it's pretty obvious.

350
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:52,920
Speaker 0: Why we made this mistake.

351
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,273
Speaker 0: What do you think we use quicken?

352
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:06,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know when's the last time you use Microsoft money or what I Keep pittering out here.

353
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:09,505
Speaker 1: It's all right.

354
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:20,330
Speaker 0: All right, Barack Obama Your I can't do an Obama voice Don't even ask is trying to dismiss the case to find Bush's missing super incriminating evil world dictatorship emails.

355
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,543
Speaker 0: The NSA director called you out on it.

356
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:24,709
Speaker 0: What do you have to say to that?

357
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:37,303
Speaker 1: Well first of all you know my administration is very large and while I am all for more Transparency in government as I have said many times You know I can't pay paying attention to all these things at once.

358
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,890
Speaker 1: or I got to fix the stupid economy.

359
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,495
Speaker 1: I got to fix all this.

360
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:41,358
Speaker 1: you know foreign.

361
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,127
Speaker 1: You know shit going down all over the world.

362
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:48,504
Speaker 1: all right Bush's emails like the bottom my list, and you know what all right.

363
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:55,687
Speaker 1: after that blackberry fight I realized that it is most likely this government was just so incompetent when it comes technology.

364
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:58,516
Speaker 1: there was no Nefarious email deleting.

365
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,703
Speaker 1: none of these people even know what email is.

366
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:08,770
Speaker 1: it was obviously in confidence and Wasting time and money on an investigation is only going to reveal in confidence and make us all look bad.

367
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:20,570
Speaker 1: So it's better if we just don't pay attention to that and concentrate on fixing the real problems We have now, but you do realize that this just proves the link between Ron Paul and the gold conspiracy.

368
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,259
Speaker 0: You do realize that you know.

369
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:37,191
Speaker 1: you know people think there's a lot of conspiracies in government But I can tell you this when I got into the president's office here I went and I asked all the security peoples and I went and I looked at all the top-secret documents to see if there are Aliens.

370
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:38,977
Speaker 1: I went to see if there were.

371
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:41,565
Speaker 1: you know all the all those things that people worry about.

372
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:51,250
Speaker 1: you know just to make sure And I can tell you So you have absolutely absolutely nothing to worry about.

373
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,839
Speaker 1: You Can trust me like almost everyone voted for me.

374
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:06,759

Speaker 1: Is that what you really think?

381
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:29,184
Speaker 0: I don't think this is going to have any effect.

382
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:31,150
Speaker 0: Have you seen the prosecution?

383
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,197
Speaker 0: I don't think they even know what computers are.

384
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,443
Speaker 0: they're coming in.

00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,870

398
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,198
Speaker 0: Editor of the website for hasbro.com.

399
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:12,863
Speaker 1: all right few days ago on watsy.

400
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:13,906
Speaker 0: You know you do.

401
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:19,883
Speaker 0: a few days ago I was looking at your word of the day as I want to do and An interesting word appeared.

402
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:22,480
Speaker 0: You know what that word was Your mom.

403
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:25,150
Speaker 0: the word was dildo.

404
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:35,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, um you know people go to see the Scrabble word of the day And you know we program that just to select a random word from the Scrabble dictionary.

405
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:41,449
Speaker 1: So of course you know there are words that are in the Scrabble dictionary that are you know?

406
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:48,061
Speaker 1: Not entirely appropriate for an all-ages board game advertising website.

407
00:24:48,888 --> 00:25:00,985
Speaker 1: and So it was just sort of you know bad luck that dildo happened to be the word of the day and once we noticed it we fixed it and changed it to a Tripoli, but you know between you and me.

408
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:10,117
Speaker 1: I actually Quintupled the probability that dildo would appear And it was just to get a reaction.

409
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:10,658
Speaker 1: and you know what.

410
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,530

Speaker 1: you were smart.

438
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,670
Speaker 1: it was someone else who would have been laid off.

439
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:34,270
Speaker 0: I feel like the company is a better place without me.

440
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:40,812
Speaker 0: I mean I left all those logs logic bombs behind too, but doesn't look like they're gonna go off since uh you know Bankruptcy.

441
00:26:40,953 --> 00:26:52,915
Speaker 0: and so I mean you know for a logic bomb to go off there would have to be some logic or at least a computer Which I took all the air on chairs at least though Okay And I don't know.

442
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:53,741
Speaker 0: I think that went well.

443
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:55,837
Speaker 1: that was that was all right We could have.

444
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:57,230
Speaker 1: it could have been worse it could have been better.

445
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:03,050
Speaker 0: I think I could have been more verbose But unlike you you had the benefit of at least knowing what the role players were going to be ahead of time.

446
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:06,107
Speaker 1: And I is true I did email them to you early in the morning.

447
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:14,549
Speaker 0: you did But I did not check my email until I went into Google documents Unrelatedly to look up an anime panel to get the description to copy paste into something else.

448
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:19,630
Speaker 0: That was like Scott shared a document with me, and it says roleplay, and I'm like what?

449
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:21,452
Speaker 1: Why?

450
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:25,686
Speaker 1: we talked about this yesterday, yes, and I completely forgot you're awesome.

451
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:46,956
Speaker 1: Oh If you leave your comments about this segment into forums if you're not into forums get into forum But before you get in the forums get into things of the day.

452
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:47,337
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

453
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,240
Speaker 1: What's my thing of the day again?

454
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

455
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:50,188
Speaker 1: What's yours okay?

456
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,539
Speaker 0: I I just thought these were really cool.

457
00:27:53,081 --> 00:28:02,360
Speaker 0: Apparently if you own a play-doh fun factory you can make Really awesome pixel cookies with almost no effort.

458
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,580
Speaker 1: So you think is there ways to make pixel cookies without a play-doh fun factory, but they're not as efficient as this or as cool?

459
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:12,500
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you can use it to push the dough make a square tube and then chop it up.

460
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:22,140
Speaker 0: Well you make long square tubes like a whole bunch of them of different colors And then you lay them all out on top of each other till you make the pixel cookie And then you slice up the thing you've made into like 50 cookies.

461
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the way you make checkerboard cookies is you?

462
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:32,974
Speaker 1: basically if you want to make checkerboard cookies you make four square big squares A big white square a big chocolate skirt big white square a big chocolate square right.

463
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,101
Speaker 1: then you stack them up on top of each Other.

464
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:37,007
Speaker 1: so now it's white chocolate white chocolate.

465
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:37,288
Speaker 1: right.

466
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:45,580
Speaker 1: then you slice like one centimeter things Right and then you flip them on their side and lay them on top of each other.

467
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,539
Speaker 1: But since it's white black white black you flip half of them over.

468
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:55,794
Speaker 1: That way you get the checkerboard going on and then you slice them again And then this is much better only requires one slice, and you've got it.

469
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,689
Speaker 1: this one requires Culinary skills.

470
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,755
Speaker 0: yes, this one does not.

471
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:05,012
Speaker 0: this one requires I'd recommend getting a dough out before you.

472
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:15,451
Speaker 1: I recommend buying a new Play-doh fun factory and then washing it because one that has Scott play-doh is non-toxic Yes, and it's kind of salty and it tastes really bad.

473
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:17,176
Speaker 1: that bad it tastes terrible.

474
00:29:17,537 --> 00:29:19,563
Speaker 1: I've eaten play-doh Shitty.

475
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:25,797
Speaker 1: it is real bad Actually, you know it tastes kind of okay, though is if you make your own play-doh with borax.

476
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:26,440
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

477
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:32,599
Speaker 0: Ah borax, I wouldn't eat that though, but All right, so do you remember your thing of the day?

478
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,124
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so the economy is bad and people around the world are trying to understand Why the economy is bad.

479
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:45,019
Speaker 1: you know and I mean no matter how many podcasts you listen to or videos you watch or?

480
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:50,915
Speaker 1: Articles you read or even economics classes you take or economics degrees you get.

481
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:57,340
Speaker 1: you're never gonna really Really understand a hundred percent right, but you can understand enough.

482
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:03,498
Speaker 1: And you know I've just people everywhere trying to become more educated on this, and it's generally a very good thing.

483
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:22,197
Speaker 1: and I Unlike many others have also tried to get more educated into the economics topics And I have listened to many podcasts and read many articles and watched many videos and learned about things like you know What's it called the debt obligation things or the things go into the top bucket, and then the second bucket whatever.

484
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:26,253
Speaker 1: yeah, I've learned about credit credit default swaps.

485
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,407
Speaker 1: or someone buys insurance Like that.

486
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:35,536
Speaker 1: a company is gonna go under But then someone ensures that with another credit default swap and this big chain means the insurance doesn't work.

487
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:38,244
Speaker 1: and all these all these other Factors that you know.

488
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:45,634
Speaker 1: subprime mortgages basically lending you know giving a mortgage to someone who can't possibly pay it back But you give them a low rate to start out with.

489
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:51,222
Speaker 1: they can afford But then their payment jumps way up they can't afford it, and then they lose the house You know.

490
00:30:51,884 --> 00:31:07,940
Speaker 1: but people gave sold the houses to them anyway approved the mortgages anyway because the the brokers got these commissions So they didn't give a shit and all this sort of stuff, and you know I've learned all these separate things But sort of putting them all together is not really the easiest thing.

491
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,327
Speaker 1: I mean you can sort of figure out how they all fit and why things got fucked up because of it But not a hundred percent.

492
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:19,294
Speaker 1: and there's this video The crisis of credit and basically it's crisis of credit.

493
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:39,115
Speaker 1: calm and in this video There is a excellent graphic design right to begin with but B it takes all these things that I have learned about separately from various places on the internet and books and shows and things and Puts them all together into one Picture in a very very easy to understand way.

494
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:52,914
Speaker 1: if you understand You know things like interest and mortgages to begin with right and Shows you how they all related to each other and how you know one thing affected the next And it gives you really is I think the best thing I've seen.

495
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,284
Speaker 1: yet that gives you the big Big picture.

496
00:31:55,865 --> 00:32:00,480
Speaker 1: and if you want to learn about the economies, this is or at least the bad economies.

497
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:02,027
Speaker 1: So Scott is it something to watch?

498
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,900
Speaker 0: is the economy still fuck the fuck up shit.

499
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:13,991
Speaker 0: So It's Monday and we a lot of people have been suggesting topics though I do have to point out that most of the Monday suggestions.

500
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:19,258
Speaker 0: We've gotten boiled down to a Five-minute Google search will answer it quicker than we will.

501
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:25,200
Speaker 1: yeah If you want us to do a topic on something then first ask Google.

502
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,539
Speaker 1: And if Google has all the information then don't ask us to do a show on it.

503
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:37,995
Speaker 0: But we didn't have anything great to talk about or anything interesting or anything that didn't require a lot of research and it's a pretty interesting time in the tech world.

504
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:42,513
Speaker 0: so uh What I'm trying to say is that it's another tech news around.

505
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:48,018
Speaker 1: we already said that but I said it again No snap all right, so which which tech news do you want to start off with?

506
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,280
Speaker 0: all right?

507
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:57,694
Speaker 0: I'll start off here because remember way back there were all these problems with Google Street View and Various like crazy homeowners trying to sue Google for taking pictures of their house.

508
00:32:57,795 --> 00:33:04,614
Speaker 0: Oh that lawsuit finish out The one filed in April last year the big one was pretty much overturned.

509
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:13,863
Speaker 0: It was dismissed outright, and it's done because apparently the family Quote the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under any counts Mm-hmm.

510
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:30,420
Speaker 0: so hopefully this is going to lead to a rapid end to all this BS because frankly I Don't think there's any argument against the fact that if you can see something from public property without specialized equipment You have the legal right to take a picture of it and share that picture with anyone in the world.

511
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:33,179
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I don't know what else I can say about that.

512
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,989
Speaker 0: No one's given me a good reputation, and it looks like the courts agree.

513
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of news lately about Photographs in public and it's starting to come back in our direction.

514
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:56,840
Speaker 1: I mean there was an article in the New York Times recently about some guy who was taking pictures in the subway and actually it Specifically says in New York State law you are permitted to take photographs in.

515
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,309
Speaker 1: You know transportation play.

516
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,025
Speaker 1: I forget the exact legal wording of it But basically it says it is.

517
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:06,536
Speaker 1: the law says specifically it is legal to take pictures in the subway state.

518
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:12,458
Speaker 0: actually the interestingly You know as long as illegal to be so fat on a subway that you take up two seats.

519
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,040
Speaker 1: really Yeah, well the other thing the exceptions to the rule is you can't use a tripod you can't have lights, right?

520
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,722
Speaker 1: You can't.

521
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,128
Speaker 1: you need a permit for those things.

522
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:22,212
Speaker 0: the thing is those make sense.

523
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:30,576
Speaker 1: if I'm on the sixth train and some dude whips Out a full tripod and a spotlight I mean in New York City you can't even whip out a tripod like on the sidewalk without a permit.

524
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:41,420
Speaker 1: because again if I'm trying To walk to lunch and some dude whips out a tripod and a spotlight yep, so The thing is this New York Times article was talking about a guy who like you know the cops came up to him.

525
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:45,760
Speaker 1: He had the law in his bag, so he's obviously one of those prepared guys, right?

526
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:50,600
Speaker 0: For a long time carried around a copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

527
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,280
Speaker 1: I think the thing is now you don't have to copy or carry on a copy of this law.

528
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,275
Speaker 1: You can just carry around this New York Times article.

529
00:34:56,356 --> 00:34:59,346
Speaker 1: Yeah And the cops came up to him.

530
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,536
Speaker 1: like you can't take pictures in the subway 9/11 9/11 blah blah blah.

531
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,148
Speaker 1: He's like yes, you can.

532
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:03,654
Speaker 1: here's the law.

533
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:09,440
Speaker 1: right here I can take pictures in the subway station and then of course they arrested him and took him to the police station.

534
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:23,052
Speaker 1: And it looks like he's probably gonna get away with the charge of taking a picture in a subway station Which isn't even a charge, but of course they're gonna charge him with like you know being you know Uncooperative and all that other sort of bullshit.

535
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:27,976
Speaker 0: because in situations like this I'm of the mind that one the police officers need to be censured in some way.

536
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:39,397
Speaker 0: yep I mean granted there's no way for any one human to know the fullness of American law But at the same time you've got to hold law enforcement officers and judges to a higher standard than this.

537
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:47,232
Speaker 1: and also You know I mean if police You know I mean even a police officer can't be required to know the entire law.

538
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:52,765
Speaker 1: right, but it should always side on Like doubt it shouldn't you know?

539
00:35:52,825 --> 00:36:06,380
Speaker 1: so if a cop like if he's not sure if something's against the law or not The default answer should always be no it's legal if it's not obvious You know well, I think one way to fix this you know talking about surveillance.

540
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:12,280
Speaker 0: I'm like I'm so for this and the more I think about it the more read articles about it the more informed.

541
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:23,263
Speaker 0: Every uniform law enforcement officer in the United States should have a camera mounted on their uniform That is active with audio and video for every second that they're on duty Period.

542
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,891
Speaker 1: the thing is something could get in the way.

543
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,185
Speaker 0: You know how it is doesn't matter still It's something.

544
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:31,387
Speaker 1: see I think you know would help a lot Actually a whole lot right if there was.

545
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:34,056
Speaker 1: this is actually a somewhat more feasible idea right?

546
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,360
Speaker 1: doesn't have you know problems?

547
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:42,439
Speaker 1: If there was just a clear how in like the NHL right if the ref gives a bad call they call Toronto.

548
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,880
Speaker 0: So why don't police have a thing or they can go back?

549
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:54,798
Speaker 1: There should be a thing that anyone can call absolutely anyone And it should be a different one in each state where you can call and find out what the law is.

550
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,914
Speaker 1: Well the thing is police come up and are gonna arrest you.

551
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:58,859
Speaker 1: you could just be like hold up.

552
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:02,236
Speaker 1: Let me call this number and you call the number and you would call like some.

553
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:05,869
Speaker 1: you know state Department and you would say is it illegal?

554
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,380
Speaker 1: is there anything illegal about taking photographs in a police station?

555
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,309
Speaker 0: Here's the problem with this one the way the law is written.

556
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,519
Speaker 0: It might take days or weeks to figure out the answer.

557
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, two There already is something like that.

558
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,004
Speaker 0: It's called a lawyer.

559
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:31,339
Speaker 0: and three the reason that's a problem is that you can't actually Really get your rights in this country anymore Unless you have the money to pay for someone who understands the law enough to prove that you didn't break it.

560
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:33,126
Speaker 1: I just think there should be.

561
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:38,615
Speaker 1: that's why there needs to be some sort of state thing Not not something you to pay for something free No.

562
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:55,338
Speaker 0: but what I'm saying is I don't think it's possible the way the law is now because basically it would cost the state so much money To have so many lawyers on hand to be able to figure out the law in all these weird Pooped on public property, but it was a Wednesday and I had a stink

563
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:55,700
Speaker 1: eye.

564
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is for the vast majority of cases though.

565
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:00,881
Speaker 1: It'll be very easy to give the answer you.

566
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:09,347
Speaker 1: just all you need is you don't need so much someone to look up the answers as you just need an Authoritative person to give the answer.

567
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,540
Speaker 1: because if it's you arguing against a police officer, you can't win even if you're right.

568
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:17,614
Speaker 0: See this is why I'm an advocate because this is the one thing we can do as citizens.

569
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:37,080
Speaker 0: and when I get a new car I'm thinking about rigging something up just because I can but like what I'm driving I'll use an example like that because it's easier to put forth and it's less incendiary than talking about police even though Partly due to the nature of the way I lead my life I've had very few pleasant encounters with the police and many unpleasant encounters to say the least.

570
00:38:37,541 --> 00:39:01,499
Speaker 0: but if I have a car a new car, I am much more afraid of interactions with the police and with other drivers than I am of any problem that I'm going to cause on my own and I would love nothing more than to have a Inside and outside the car that also gets the last hour.

571
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:03,914
Speaker 0: So if anything goes wrong, I get pulled over there.

572
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:04,840
Speaker 0: I'm in an accident.

573
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:29,740
Speaker 0: There is objective proof as to exactly what happened how fast I was going whether or not I was speeding if I broke or not What what the crazy indignant lady was yelling at me after he dink she dinged my door and then attacked me Just because for someone like me the majority of the Altercations I'm involved in with fellow citizens are ones where in I was the wronged party or the neutral party.

574
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,620
Speaker 0: But yet in our legal system, it's word against word and eyewitness testimony is useless.

575
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:42,660
Speaker 0: So I don't have any confidence that if I'm ever in trouble that I that the law would end up being served properly for me.

576
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:43,228
Speaker 0: Hmm.

577
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:48,578
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I just want to reiterate a point that we have to make often because people have a hard time understanding.

578
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:56,000
Speaker 1: it is that When people are against a surveillance society only because it's a who watches the watchman situation, right?

579
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,440
Speaker 1: It's the government watching all the citizens and no one's watching the government.

580
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,860
Speaker 1: Surveillance is okay if you're surveilling yourself, right?

581
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:17,296
Speaker 1: This or if the surveillance is done by the government as long as anyone can watch the cameras Not just the police but anyone has access to all the camera feed Even if they can't watch them all the time and like here's the.

582
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:20,693
Speaker 0: here's a good example Let's say it like Chicago's trying to have cameras on every street in the city.

583
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:21,136
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

584
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:21,779
Speaker 0: That's their plan.

585
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:27,160
Speaker 0: now What if it was set where you can't just watch them all the time because that does really enable stalkers and fucked up people?

586
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:37,847
Speaker 0: Yeah but if you had a System where you can petition the government and say I would like to see footage from this area from this time because X You know, I was in a car

587
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:49,982
Speaker 1: accident even need to say because X you should just request, you know I want this foot, you know this camera or any cameras in this location between these, you know minutes You know five o'clock 25

588
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:56,560
Speaker 0: I would even be okay with having to provide some reason even if like just this minimal minimal barrier to entry.

589
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:05,700
Speaker 1: Yep and you know what police should have to go through the exact same pro and lawyers and everyone everyone should have to go through the Exact same process to get the footage and it should be available to everyone.

590
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,608
Speaker 0: Well, I guess my idea is that there should be a barrier to entry that you say why you want it and all that You know.

591
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:15,840
Speaker 0: a small fee five bucks ten bucks Well, just anything just to weed out the crazies and the riffraff.

592
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,299
Speaker 0: but more importantly the idea is that the footage is available to anyone who needs it to vindicate themselves.

593
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,151
Speaker 0: and Since that's not going to happen anytime to anytime soon.

594
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:33,657
Speaker 0: I'm more and more an advocate of people Making their own personal surveillance to protect themselves from the people around them.

595
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:35,905
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, that's the thing.

596
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:36,487
Speaker 1: Is that right?

597
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:40,440
Speaker 1: It's surveillance society isn't because surveillance and cameras are bad.

598
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:47,420
Speaker 1: You know as long as they're only in public places or you know They're there they could be in private places if they're owned by the owner, right?

599
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,743
Speaker 1: It's that the only people controlling them are the government and thus they can only be used to incriminate and not to Decriminate.

600
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:58,620
Speaker 0: plus when I was a kid someone was going like vandalizing cars in the neighborhood.

601
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:04,694
Speaker 0: We put up a night-vision camera outside Caught the kid and we gave the footage over the police and as far as I know they got him.

602
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:06,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think perfectly Okay.

603
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:06,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:07,398
Speaker 1: All right.

605
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,433
Speaker 1: So, um, you know, there was that whole business with the Vista capable.

606
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:13,034
Speaker 1: Do you remember this?

607
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:14,980
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the false advertising.

608
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,568
Speaker 1: Well, let me let me explain the whole story here.

609
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:17,889
Speaker 1: Right?

610
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:23,639
Speaker 1: So the as I've read so this is what I've read Microsoft was coming out with Vista, right?

611
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,070
Speaker 1: But of course Vista was gonna have higher system requirements than XP.

612
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:28,575
Speaker 1: XP came out in 2001.

613
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:29,418
Speaker 1: Vista came out in what?

614
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:29,860
Speaker 1: Oh seven.

615
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:35,520
Speaker 1: Wow, if that makes me feel really six years later system requirements are gonna be higher, right?

616
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:43,080
Speaker 1: So people who had old computers running XP computers from Oh 102, you know, were they gonna be able to run Vista?

617
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:44,004
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

618
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,140
Speaker 1: so they had to buy new computers.

619
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:49,249
Speaker 1: So Microsoft said let's make this easy for people.

620
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,080
Speaker 1: people don't understand the megahertz and the jiggle watts and the megabits and whatnot.

621
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:59,800
Speaker 1: So let's just put stickers on the computers that are capable of running Vista and we'll have them say Vista capable.

622
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,520
Speaker 1: That way if you want to buy a computer, you know before this is like this wasn't after Vista came out.

623
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,469
Speaker 1: This is before Vista came out, right?

624
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,659
Speaker 1: So this is like this is coming soon.

625
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:15,860
Speaker 1: Do you want to buy a computer that right now that you know will be able to run Vista when Vista does come out?

626
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,628
Speaker 1: Buy one with a Vista capable speed sticker on it.

627
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:19,792
Speaker 1: You know, it's a good idea.

628
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:20,395
Speaker 1: It makes it easy.

629
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:35,795
Speaker 1: The thing is Intel had these chips chipsets, you know for graphics and such that they had a whole bunch of it I forget exactly which one it was and They had a lot of them and they wanted to get rid of them and they were cheap.

630
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:40,420
Speaker 1: and you know They really aren't that bad, but they weren't Vista capable.

631
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:45,340
Speaker 1: You run Vista on one of these things and it's not gonna be good at all.

632
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,840
Speaker 1: You can run like Vista home basic and it'll be kind of shitty, right?

633
00:43:50,663 --> 00:44:07,035
Speaker 1: So there was some deal between Intel and Microsoft and the Vista capable stickers Went on all these computers that had this Intel chipset in it that Intel was trying to sell a whole bunch of because they had too many and Thus the whole bunch were sold because these are cheap slow things that were Vista capable.

634
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:11,160
Speaker 1: So people were buying them and It turns out they weren't actually Vista capable.

635
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,065
Speaker 1: They were barely Vista capable.

636
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:20,249
Speaker 1: if that and thus someone started a lawsuit against Microsoft and saying hey You shouldn't have put those stickers on there.

637
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:22,118
Speaker 1: That was bullshit and bloody bloody blah.

638
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:29,086
Speaker 1: Well That lawsuit has lost its class-action status Which means it's not.

639
00:44:29,106 --> 00:44:32,940
Speaker 1: you know, a class-action lawsuit is one of those things where everyone gets in on it, right?

640
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,820
Speaker 1: So like for example, let's say there was a class-action lawsuit about the peanut butter, right?

641
00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:41,439
Speaker 1: Everyone who ate the peanut butter would be able to just fill out a form.

642
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:44,428
Speaker 1: So it's like a million people suing the peanut butter.

643
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:44,849
Speaker 1: come now.

644
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:57,100
Speaker 0: granted that we're I don't want to debate the merits of class-action lawsuits Because How lawyers make all the money and the people make shit Yeah, and how they're primarily punitive as opposed to restorative exactly.

645
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:59,839
Speaker 1: But I just wanted to make sure people knew what they were.

646
00:45:00,403 --> 00:45:15,254
Speaker 1: So this lawsuit is no longer class-action Which means if it was class-action, which it was until recently anyone who bought a Vista capable computer Probably with the Intel chip in it would have been able to sign up and get some money.

647
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:24,109
Speaker 1: if they won like five bucks Yeah, I mean I got 20 bucks once for some Elliott Spitzer lawsuits Against the record companies for price-fixing.

648
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:27,060
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't get it is because I hadn't bought any records.

649
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,018
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't either but I just signed up twice and got two checks.

650
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,253
Speaker 1: Hey, I mean actually I think I did buy a CD.

651
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:40,795
Speaker 0: well backing down suddenly Oh, not so much the Renegade now I did buy a CD.

652
00:45:40,815 --> 00:45:41,619
Speaker 1: It was that long ago.

653
00:45:42,582 --> 00:45:44,509
Speaker 0: I was never the head of the Gestapo.

654
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:47,060
Speaker 1: The thing is the checks were more than the cost of the CD.

655
00:45:47,504 --> 00:45:57,920
Speaker 1: yeah, so This lawsuit is no longer class-action Which means if the I guess whoever it is that's trying to do it wins, they're just gonna win enough for like one person.

656
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,260
Speaker 1: So that's enough for what one computer.

657
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,891
Speaker 1: Basically, it's over.

658
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:02,780
Speaker 1: It's not gonna happen.

659
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:14,420
Speaker 1: So even though I think if that information is correct that Intel and Microsoft sort of made this deal or whatever If that is true, I actually think that the soup probably should have gone forward.

660
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,080
Speaker 1: But apparently the judge thinks otherwise.

661
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:18,550
Speaker 1: What you gonna do?

662
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:19,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

663
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:22,026
Speaker 0: The thing is I don't feel like it was.

664
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:26,780
Speaker 0: it wasn't false advertising to me because they're perfectly capable of running Vista.

665
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:31,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean a lot of things are capable of running Vista.

666
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but but that's the problem.

667
00:46:34,263 --> 00:46:45,380
Speaker 0: it's a problem we're having now not just in computers, but in food to where a Product can make perfectly legal perfectly valid 100% accurate statements on its label.

668
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:58,760
Speaker 0: But yet because of the ignorance of the general populace and I'm not even a blame and because of tricky language But not even because of a blameful ignorance But just because of a lack of understanding as to what things mean like what a calorie really is or what?

669
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:08,900
Speaker 0: You know X percent of a daily dosage of something really means People will not be able to interpret this factual information and thus make false conclusions.

670
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,380
Speaker 0: Now sometimes advertisers use this on purpose to get people to make these false conclusions Well at the same time being able to show in court that they in fact said nothing wrong.

671
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:18,658
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what to do about it.

672
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:25,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's a tough situation because any sort of legislation you try to regulate that at all That was pretty good.

673
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:27,272
Speaker 0: He's a tough situation.

674
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:37,940
Speaker 1: No any legislation I kept going and if you try to do that, you're gonna start getting near like the free speech, you know It's like you're trying to do some FTC to stop false advertising.

675
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,460
Speaker 1: But then you get too close to the First Amendment so you get back off.

676
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,433
Speaker 0: But of course commercial speech has never been protected the way regular.

677
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:44,177
Speaker 1: Well, it's so.

678
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:44,940
Speaker 1: it's kind of weird.

679
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,846
Speaker 1: I mean, that's obvious.

680
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:46,570
Speaker 1: I'm not disagreeing.

681
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,140
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what the courts have said.

682
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:51,675
Speaker 0: You know, I feel like commercial speech should be more restricted just as well.

683
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,780
Speaker 0: other speech should be less.

684
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,104
Speaker 1: I would I would like that.

685
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:57,052
Speaker 1: Yes, but I think you know constitutionally speaking right?

686
00:47:57,173 --> 00:48:02,393
Speaker 1: It's the Constitution is sort of contradictory when taken with the First Amendment right.

687
00:48:02,453 --> 00:48:08,133
Speaker 1: the Constitution says a Congress has the unlimited power to regulate commerce period.

688
00:48:08,393 --> 00:48:10,901
Speaker 1: right commerce government can regulate it like crazy Right.

689
00:48:11,162 --> 00:48:15,480
Speaker 0: that all that is one of the biggest sources of both good and bad in our cover, right?

690
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,710
Speaker 1: But I mean it's in the enumerated powers of Congress.

691
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:27,150
Speaker 1: Congress can regulate commerce done Right and courts over and over and over throughout history have said yes The Congress can regulate commerce any fuck way it wants.

692
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,154
Speaker 1: All right end of story.

693
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:33,350
Speaker 1: at the same time It says Congress shall not impinge upon freedom of the press.

694
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,814
Speaker 1: Well press is commerce, right?

695
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:46,807
Speaker 1: So if the press Speaks there is speech there, but they can regulate commerce and as a side effect of regulating the commerce They're infringing upon the speech and you see how it.

696
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:48,552
Speaker 1: it says they can they can't.

697
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:55,293
Speaker 1: at the same time and courts have you know Obviously said commercial speech can be regulated and non-commercial speech can't be.

698
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:57,600
Speaker 1: and that's what they decided and I think that's right.

699
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,087
Speaker 1: But it's you know, if you look at it purely constitutionally speaking There's an argument to be made.

700
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:13,053
Speaker 1: if you didn't already have these precedents of course to you know lean on All right, moving on moving on I do want.

701
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:18,619
Speaker 0: I want to point that I don't want to spend a lot of time on this But Citrix Zen server virtualization is now free.

702
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:27,578
Speaker 1: The platform is free but Zen but like XEN or a special different section But Zen is is free.

703
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:30,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the virtualization platform is free.

704
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:35,107
Speaker 1: Uh-huh What's what's new that wasn't free before?

705
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:40,080
Speaker 0: Well, basically this is the stuff that we wouldn't use but enterprise people would use.

706
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:41,502
Speaker 0: It's good.

707
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:41,864
Speaker 0: Basically.

708
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:42,406
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

709
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:45,477
Speaker 0: I brought this up for one reason Citrix has a lot of good technology.

710
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:50,710
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna deny Simultaneously VMware has not been keeping up at all.

711
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,820
Speaker 1: No, well VMware does something a little different than what Citrix does.

712
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,287
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is it different.

713
00:49:55,347 --> 00:49:58,260
Speaker 0: it's different in that it's just worse in a lot of ways.

714
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,449
Speaker 1: I mean, well, yeah, but it has.

715
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,780
Speaker 1: it also has different uses.

716
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:02,769
Speaker 0: Well, no, I see I thought that.

717
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:10,157
Speaker 1: but more Citrix is more of like, you know They concentrate a lot on the remote access and the remote application servers where they.

718
00:50:10,378 --> 00:50:27,759
Speaker 0: there's obviously Virtualization technology to make that happen, but VMware concentrates more on the actual full machine Virtualization stuff and but that's but that's the part that's dying that's gonna in within five or ten years Full machine virtualization is gonna be this legacy thing that no one does.

719
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:31,813
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's an absolute waste and basically I feel I do think it.

720
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:38,560
Speaker 1: I think it will still be useful in Me, I think that the VMware like servers like the ESX servers.

721
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:48,699
Speaker 1: I think those are in trouble from things like Zen, but I think that VMware workstation and but where I've been using are still gonna have a place.

722
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,809
Speaker 0: thing Is they're not that widely used outside of geeky circles.

723
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,236
Speaker 1: Well, they're used by developers.

724
00:50:54,297 --> 00:51:00,660
Speaker 1: They're used by Software testers, they're used by people with Macs who want to run some Windows pro.

725
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:01,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's what I was.

726
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:07,441
Speaker 0: what I was basically going to say is that on the desktop VMware is okay But for anything server big ironed It's just.

727
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:16,300
Speaker 0: it doesn't seem to hold up because the idea of fully virtualizing an operating system For anything other than like a simple desktop task is ludicrous at this point.

728
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,900
Speaker 0: I mean para virtualization is the way to go in both Windows and Linux.

729
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:24,440
Speaker 0: Well Linux is already there like far and away and even Windows is going in that direction in a big way.

730
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:37,477
Speaker 0: Well Microsoft bought a whole bunch of virtualization stuff and we're waiting for them to bust out more and more with that because I remember going through I Talked to a lot of engineers at the end, you know with VMware a long time ago.

731
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:49,238
Speaker 0: Not that long ago Like a year ago and just they could not answer most of the concerns that I had about performance and they just They could not do the things that I wanted to be able to do.

732
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:53,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got to do some more research about Zen because I was pretty sure Zen was an open-source thing.

733
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,966
Speaker 1: So I'm really wondering what the?

734
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:57,720
Speaker 0: well, it's always this base like what the Citrix thing is.

735
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:03,900
Speaker 0: Basically, we use Red Hat virtualization And you know, we'll have to do a separate show with the hypervisor.

736
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:08,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we if I explain this in any actual detail show it'll take the whole.

737
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,240
Speaker 1: I mean we did a show on virtualization.

738
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,411
Speaker 1: You want to do another show on para virtualization?

739
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:12,753
Speaker 0: You know what?

740
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:18,040
Speaker 1: Let's do a show on Zen All right off to research it and play with it in like a month as I know stuff about it.

741
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,944
Speaker 1: But not that not enough.

742
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:19,989
Speaker 0: I use it a lot of work.

743
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,340
Speaker 0: So alright, but anyway, this is neat.

744
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,711
Speaker 0: So if you're an IT guy, here's my advice.

745
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,440
Speaker 0: Here's why I brought this try it out cuz it's free.

746
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,079
Speaker 0: Why not if you're an IT guy?

747
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,720
Speaker 0: Try all this stuff out and learn it and put it on your resume because this stuff is going to get you a job.

748
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:43,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember this is stuff that saves companies a lot of money because it means they can have their fewer computers do more stuff Which is a big.

749
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:49,600
Speaker 1: that's something you can actually, you know sell to a boss Who's not a tech boss and get them to go smile?

750
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:51,032
Speaker 1: That's why it's good.

751
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:56,440
Speaker 1: Yep You know, they're not gonna smile when you come up with like your crazy encryption schemes that make life miserable.

752
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:03,920
Speaker 1: But they'll smile when you say hey we can like double the number of computers We have without paying any money and without buying any computers.

753
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:09,420
Speaker 0: I just I really wonder if VMware is gonna step up to the plate with something similarly good and then long.

754
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,312
Speaker 1: You know VMware is on the sort of short to medium list of companies.

755
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:15,660
Speaker 1: I can see going in this bad economy.

756
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, because part of it too is that.

757
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:22,318
Speaker 1: the other thing is that they might actually do a little bit better though because

758
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:22,959
Speaker 0: there are

759
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:35,220
Speaker 1: Companies that don't know that VMware isn't as good as other solutions are easily Lured into buying it because it will save the money and if they don't have any uses that VMware can't handle it'll it'll work out.

760
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,940
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know some with 10 web servers who instead gets one big server and uses an ESX.

761
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:41,760
Speaker 1: It'll work just fine.

762
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:48,419
Speaker 0: But if you're doing web servers unless you're using IIS you'd better use user mode Linux or para virtualization, you know.

763
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,380
Speaker 1: You know, we're talking about people who are not smart enough to do that.

764
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,133
Speaker 0: But I guess the problem is even VMware to use it in a full enterprise environment.

765
00:53:56,695 --> 00:54:06,620
Speaker 0: It's in many cases It'll still be cheaper to just keep your stupid legacy hardware around With the people who know how to support it rather than getting new people who can support the enterprise VMware or Zen or anything

766
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:07,520
Speaker 1: Mmm,

767
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:14,168
Speaker 0: especially now in the bad economy where people are more likely to turn off a server rather than spend the money to move it To a better platform.

768
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:14,248
Speaker 0: Yep.

769
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:29,880
Speaker 1: Yep I think the one area that VMware and Citrix actually sort of directly compete big-time is sort of the remote thing where You know that they do it in a different way, you know Citrix does like a real remote application.

770
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,892
Speaker 0: So it says to like ways of a lot of.

771
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,700
Speaker 1: basically they invented all that stuff, right?

772
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:50,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but VMware has that one thing where you know I can set up a computer in the office put like 10 virtual machines on it And then some remote user can VPN to the office and use one of those virtual machines as if it was a remote desktop.

773
00:54:51,665 --> 00:55:03,940
Speaker 1: You know that way you can have people working remotely But they're still on your company network and secured and you know only using you know The machine you want them to use and thus you're not getting their cruddy laptop or whatever all over your work.

774
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,361
Speaker 0: That what?

775
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:07,875
Speaker 0: at the same time you can do that with like Windows terminal server type stuff.

776
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:16,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's cheaper and easier yeah, but the VMware, you know having the The virtual server going on there, you know, it's a little.

777
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:16,913
Speaker 1: it's a little different.

778
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:18,920
Speaker 0: I guess it's just from a technological perspective.

779
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,673
Speaker 0: I feel that full virtualization is a tech.

780
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:23,315
Speaker 0: It's a dead end.

781
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:24,540
Speaker 0: It's an evolutionary dead end.

782
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:26,511
Speaker 0: It is going to end for many uses.

783
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:32,575
Speaker 0: Yes in eventually It's not going to be used for anything but the support of legacy hardware like our software.

784
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,322
Speaker 0: that requires legacy hardware Like.

785
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:42,870
Speaker 0: that's the end run because eventually Windows is going to be paravirtualizable Just like Linux is and that wrecks it like that.

786
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,375
Speaker 0: that that that's yep.

787
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:44,756
Speaker 0: That's it.

788
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:56,639
Speaker 1: All right, so The CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings, maybe we should have role-played him He says that by 2010, so that's less than a year away, right?

789
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:08,280
Speaker 1: They are going to offer a streaming only Subscription plan and I will switch to that the day they offer you gonna have to mail the disk back.

790
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:09,323
Speaker 0: You know what?

791
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,940
Speaker 0: I have had volume 2 of Kazanoyo Jimbo for three months.

792
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:22,810
Speaker 0: Wow because basically it's funny how I subscribe to a three-disc program which before we did geek nights We watched all those motherfucking discs.

793
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,834
Speaker 1: Oh, you're holding it right there.

794
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,520
Speaker 0: I'm holding the disc we have.

795
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,523
Speaker 0: It's the only disc we have.

796
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:31,700
Speaker 0: All right, but then remember when Netflix got rid of profiles and there was that internet uproar.

797
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:34,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, well when they got rid of it, I was one of those people.

798
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:38,505
Speaker 0: I called them like that day and said look Why'd you get rid of profiles?

799
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:41,502
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, and I'm like fine drop me down to one disc Cuz.

800
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:43,560
Speaker 0: more than one disc is stupid if I can't have profiles.

801
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:48,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you only have one profile Really can only manage one disc at a time.

802
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:51,020
Speaker 1: You needed a profile per disc if it's ever it to make sense, right?

803
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,620
Speaker 0: Yep, so then they did that and my Netflix was a lot cheaper.

804
00:56:54,861 --> 00:57:01,040
Speaker 1: I wish that they would have left it where you just get one profile, but actually let one profile have multiple cues.

805
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:03,651
Speaker 0: Well, that was different way, but they didn't do.

806
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:04,495
Speaker 1: they've never done.

807
00:57:04,515 --> 00:57:05,600
Speaker 1: That's the obvious thing.

808
00:57:06,103 --> 00:57:08,700
Speaker 1: If someone has three discs, right?

809
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,607
Speaker 1: I guess separate profiles make sense.

810
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:11,851
Speaker 1: if you had they should let.

811
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:14,220
Speaker 1: they need separate profiles and separate cues, right?

812
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:21,580
Speaker 0: Because if you have a family I don't want I mean, I don't want it to recommend nothing but snatch boondock Saints reservoir dogs.

813
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,320
Speaker 1: It's like if you got a four-person family.

814
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:30,983
Speaker 1: You need four profiles because it's four different people four different tastes four different sets of recommendations and four discs for four people in The family.

815
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:38,400
Speaker 1: but if you're one person who watches a lot of DVDs You need one profile with two cues for the two discs.

816
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:47,403
Speaker 1: so that way you can have one cue full of TV shows and one with movies something like that and they just they still haven't Done that and so yeah Screw them.

817
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:59,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but as soon as I switch down to one disc and then they were like, hey We're bringing profiles back because you all drop down to one is here's the thing though with the Netflix streaming, right?

818
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,800
Speaker 1: How much will this streaming plan cost right compared to the one display?

819
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,260
Speaker 1: No, you don't need to compare it to the one disc plan anymore.

820
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:13,057
Speaker 1: Right, if it is a streaming video service, you know an on-demand streaming video service.

821
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,114
Speaker 1: now You have to compare it with basic cable, right?

822
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,500
Speaker 1: Because that's basically what it is, right?

823
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,234
Speaker 1: It's basic cable Scott with just one on-demand channel.

824
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:21,938
Speaker 1: That's really big.

825
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:25,031
Speaker 0: Basic cable costs a whole ton.

826
00:58:25,453 --> 00:58:26,859
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing though, right?

827
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:33,396
Speaker 0: How much do you pay for the Netflix now, I don't like Eleven twelve maybe fourteen dollars a month.

828
00:58:33,437 --> 00:58:33,920
Speaker 0: I think all right.

829
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,711
Speaker 1: So if it's less than that basic cable can't compete right.

830
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:39,983
Speaker 0: even in basic cable doesn't have any of the stuff I want to watch on it.

831
00:58:40,043 --> 00:58:40,665
Speaker 0: Well, that's true.

832
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,331
Speaker 0: Also, it's not on demand.

833
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,840
Speaker 1: Well, there's on demand and in cable not basic.

834
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:45,747
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

835
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,099
Speaker 1: it depends on what you know.

836
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:54,666
Speaker 0: No, plus even then I do a lot of houses that have on-demand cable and usually you have like there's things that are available At any one time.

837
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,780
Speaker 0: you can't just watch anything that they've ever shown.

838
00:58:57,302 --> 00:58:58,940
Speaker 1: So here think about this though, right?

839
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,032
Speaker 1: This is gonna compete directly with Hulu cable.

840
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,980
Speaker 0: Well, yes, it's gonna destroy cable.

841
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:12,000
Speaker 1: Well cable might be forced to drop its prices and such and such and the thing is you can start to see some stuff happening.

842
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:12,699
Speaker 0: Well, what's good?

843
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:18,942
Speaker 0: I think the shift we're gonna see is that the only thing cable can offer that can't be offered by these streaming things also

844
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:20,355
Speaker 1: satellite and such and such

845
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:28,833
Speaker 0: are live sports and game shows because no one's gonna watch Archives of old game shows unless they're really old and awesome.

846
00:59:29,495 --> 00:59:31,020
Speaker 1: Well people watch a game show Network.

847
00:59:31,804 --> 00:59:33,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, really old and awesome, right?

848
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:42,467
Speaker 1: I Would if they offered it I would pay $10 a month for Something that was just all sports.

849
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:46,077
Speaker 1: Just give me every sport in the world live every single one cricket.

850
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:51,700
Speaker 1: Yep Even then I'd really all the ice hockey even the minor league ice hockey.

851
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,404
Speaker 1: Give me all of it.

852
00:59:52,564 --> 00:59:55,580
Speaker 0: If it was just like give you ten bucks a month on my computer or something.

853
00:59:55,962 --> 01:00:02,539
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be on the tee, you know, if it's on a computer I can get it on a TV even though the old fogies seem to think otherwise, right?

854
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,904
Speaker 1: I'll write an ex BMC plug-in for it and it'll be all set You know but I just that's.

855
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:11,315
Speaker 1: that's the only thing that I missed at all from television.

856
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:20,507
Speaker 1: is live sports cuz Non-live sports really really really plus, you know F1 might one day be used to watch f1.

857
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:23,554
Speaker 1: time-shifted f1 might be an HD one day.

858
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:25,017
Speaker 1: It should be epic.

859
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:36,384
Speaker 1: I Hear that they have HD cameras at the f1 now But they're not actually giving you the HD signal because f1 is really popular in the rest of the world and no one really out There has HD.

860
01:00:36,405 --> 01:00:48,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know, but it pretty much comes down to the fact that Like between Hulu and Netflix like I don't buy DVDs anymore Like I don't really buy.

861
01:00:48,343 --> 01:00:56,823
Speaker 0: or the only people who get any money for me for entertainment are The people at Netflix and they get a piddly amount and I pay them the minimum They will let me pay.

862
01:00:56,843 --> 01:00:57,024
Speaker 0: the

863
01:00:57,044 --> 01:01:01,700
Speaker 1: only people who get money for me for entertainment is Amazon and publishers

864
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:03,102
Speaker 0: Yep,

865
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:05,840
Speaker 1: and I guess the the comic book service

866
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:11,037
Speaker 0: Alright, so I don't really want to talk about Wisconsin the sales tax stuff that keeps coming out, but

867
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:11,900
Speaker 1: it's not tech news

868
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:14,279
Speaker 0: It is because it's internet sales tax.

869
01:01:16,002 --> 01:01:16,887
Speaker 0: My opinion there is.

870
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,620
Speaker 0: thus I'm gonna boil it down and it'll be a little incendiary.

871
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:31,953
Speaker 0: the world is at a point in my opinion where the fact that every state is doing its own income tax and Is ludicrous I feel because so much commerce is interstate.

872
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:34,200
Speaker 0: I feel like sales tax.

873
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:38,677
Speaker 0: I think I said income tax once in there, but sales tax should be national and standard.

874
01:01:38,697 --> 01:01:39,419
Speaker 0: that should be the end of it.

875
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,580
Speaker 1: Yes, well, I don't agree with that entire.

876
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:42,982
Speaker 0: I do.

877
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:48,408
Speaker 0: I say this one because use taxes are this are like this Like insanity.

878
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,760
Speaker 1: here is here's what I say, right?

879
01:01:51,423 --> 01:02:11,348
Speaker 1: If you are buying something from say the grocery store Right the state you get the sales tax because it's an in-state commerce, right if I buy something Online that is from a company in New York because I'm I am also in New York then I Pay the New York sales tax as

880
01:02:11,649 --> 01:02:11,970
Speaker 0: yeah,

881
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:17,020
Speaker 1: but if I buy something from Amazon Amazon I think is a company in California.

882
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:26,080
Speaker 1: Thus it is interstate commerce and no state tax should apply and only federal tax should apply and there is no federal sales.

883
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:38,160
Speaker 1: even that purchase would be exempt from all taxes unless the federal government passed a Sales tax which would apply only to interstate transaction.

884
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,951
Speaker 0: But Scott the thing is without that last part.

885
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:43,100
Speaker 0: That's the way it is now and that clearly doesn't work either.

886
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:55,990
Speaker 0: Well, I agree You have to link like you have to link what the tax does with the location and everything And I think the most elegant solution really other than just abolishing it or standardizing It would be that because think about sales tax.

887
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:59,604
Speaker 0: if you're a state you can fiddle with your taxes Especially if you're a little.

888
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:10,699
Speaker 0: states surrounded by other states have no sales tax to pull Commerce out of other states into your state, Delaware And that's kind of unfair in some ways because of the way the structures all work.

889
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:19,322
Speaker 0: Imagine if if you bought something from another state you paid that state sales tax to that state on that purchase Mm-hmm.

890
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:29,679
Speaker 0: This means the states that states can lower their sales tax to try to draw businesses to their states For the purposes of them selling to other states.

891
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:33,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean but states do all sorts of weird things with sales tax.

892
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:41,481
Speaker 1: They kind of need to do like they have like, you know sales tax free days and sales tax free areas or low sales tax Bothers me.

893
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:47,780
Speaker 0: is all that like the taxes are so complicated like there are taxes in Dutchess County on like clothing and crap.

894
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:54,789
Speaker 0: Yeah And I hate having to figure that out and I looked at what I would have to do to actually figure out my use tax Legitimately and it's ludicrous.

895
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:55,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

896
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:57,420
Speaker 1: So you just picked the normal one, right?

897
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:01,494
Speaker 0: I pay the the don't sue me surcharge exactly.

898
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:03,200
Speaker 1: They don't audit me charge, right?

899
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,114
Speaker 1: No, but I I do think at the federal government we need money, right?

900
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:08,540
Speaker 1: We got to cut back this deficit.

901
01:04:08,863 --> 01:04:12,848
Speaker 1: There's obviously more and more Purchases being made interstate.

902
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:16,140
Speaker 1: Nope, not just from websites, but also from catalogs and things.

903
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:23,394
Speaker 0: The other problem is like there's so much unnecessary Restriction on interstate commerce like the fact that I can't just buy booze online.

904
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:25,280
Speaker 0: I have a chip to my house exactly, right?

905
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:31,032
Speaker 1: It's legal to buy booze in every state So why can't I buy some from California where the vineyards are?

906
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:33,320
Speaker 1: not that I would drink it but you know now the why not?

907
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:42,180
Speaker 0: The nominal reason is because a kid might get a credit card and buy it which is true because when I was a kid Like, you know, I actually I just got my free annual credit report cuz I'm working on a mortgage.

908
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:45,079
Speaker 1: But people are buying prescription drugs online, but you know what I saw.

909
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many emails for Viagra do you get?

910
01:04:47,168 --> 01:04:50,060
Speaker 1: you know, you actually you will get Viagra if you go to those.

911
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:53,438
Speaker 0: Well, it depends because apparently in Taiwan there's been a lot of deadly fake.

912
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:55,919
Speaker 1: You'll get pills in the mail.

913
01:04:57,062 --> 01:05:00,039
Speaker 1: But but anyway, what's in those pills is up to you.

914
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:02,456
Speaker 0: But the thing is on my credit report.

915
01:05:02,556 --> 01:05:04,727
Speaker 0: at the bottom There's a big flashing warning.

916
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:07,440
Speaker 0: that said warning check for fraud.

917
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:17,232
Speaker 0: The earliest line of credit is from before this person turned 18 because I had a credit card when I was a punk teenager Mmm, so my line of credit goes back to like 1996.

918
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:22,314
Speaker 0: Yep But as a result I could get a credit card and buy booze online.

919
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:23,238
Speaker 0: and that's the nominal reason.

920
01:05:23,258 --> 01:05:26,459
Speaker 0: you don't let kids Get booze online because you can't check ID.

921
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:38,580
Speaker 0: but the real reason is alcohol makes a lot of tax money and There are a lot of people with a very vested interest in preventing people from buying the cheap booze from other states.

922
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,678
Speaker 1: Here's here's the argument right for the booze online.

923
01:05:41,698 --> 01:05:41,980
Speaker 1: You ready?

924
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,120
Speaker 1: Let's say a kid does buy some booze online.

925
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:52,920
Speaker 1: Okay package shows up when the kids not home unless the kid is under 21 and lives alone.

926
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:56,289
Speaker 1: Right, um Really?

927
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:57,016
Speaker 1: All right.

928
01:05:57,983 --> 01:06:00,232
Speaker 1: So the package is gonna show up mom's gonna open it.

929
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:02,020
Speaker 1: Why is there a package of booze here?

930
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,916
Speaker 0: Well, see that's why the kids got to be clever.

931
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:06,957
Speaker 0: All right, so You got to think like Bart Simpson.

932
01:06:07,118 --> 01:06:13,860
Speaker 1: All right Let's say the kid gets the package hides the booze in his room drinks it when no one's looking right?

933
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,797
Speaker 1: He's got it gets away with it totally gets away with it, right?

934
01:06:16,817 --> 01:06:22,500
Speaker 1: Yep How is that any different from kids steals booze from parents wine cabinet?

935
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:24,320
Speaker 1: It's not different at all.

936
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,424
Speaker 1: You're not protecting.

937
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:29,780
Speaker 1: you're not making it any more or less dangerous for kids allowing them to buy booze online.

938
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,460
Speaker 0: Well, because the real reason is taxation.

939
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,825
Speaker 0: I mean the way boot like.

940
01:06:32,886 --> 01:06:38,609
Speaker 0: it's ludicrous that I can't buy booze in the grocery store in this stupid state That I have to go to like a separate blue.

941
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:41,019
Speaker 1: You can buy beer and cooking wine.

942
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,290
Speaker 0: Yes I can buy crappy beer by Vodak in the grocery store.

943
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,353
Speaker 0: Yes, which is crap.

944
01:06:45,454 --> 01:06:47,460
Speaker 0: I've missed buying Vodak in the grocery store.

945
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,145
Speaker 0: Right, of course it.

946
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:52,820
Speaker 0: I mean it doesn't help that I've pretty much been able to buy booze.

947
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,847
Speaker 0: No questions asked since I was 17.

948
01:06:54,847 --> 01:07:01,980
Speaker 1: I must agree though that actually preventing Vodak from the grocery store Does sort of help the economy and that there are liquor stores.

949
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:06,451
Speaker 1: I mean if it was in the grocery store There'd be no liquor stores and the economy would go down quite a bit.

950
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:07,214
Speaker 0: see but there.

951
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:08,800
Speaker 0: but there would be liquor stores.

952
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:12,300
Speaker 0: But the liquor stores would be the higher-class liquor stores or the lowest class.

953
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:17,273
Speaker 1: What actually what you ends up happening if you look at something like Stu Leonard's?

954
01:07:17,453 --> 01:07:24,920
Speaker 1: right Stu Leonard's is a grocery store With a liquor store, so it would be like if the vis count was attached to the shop, right?

955
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,546
Speaker 1: But it was still shop.

956
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:30,120
Speaker 0: We went to a Dominic's that was like that when we were in Chicago for anime central.

957
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:31,505
Speaker 1: That's what ends up happening.

958
01:07:31,586 --> 01:07:33,212
Speaker 0: So you're not in New York.

959
01:07:33,393 --> 01:07:35,240
Speaker 0: often most places don't do that and it sucks.

960
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,540
Speaker 0: I have to go to these completely different places to buy my boot.

961
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,916
Speaker 1: I mean, you know you wouldn't mind if that was the situation because it'd be just.

962
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:41,680
Speaker 1: it would be what you want.

963
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:49,044
Speaker 1: But it hurts the economy because that's one fewer business, you know, it's one less, you know, it's the gross Makes more money.

964
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:50,047
Speaker 0: by that logic.

965
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:55,645
Speaker 0: We should make laws like you can't sell cigarettes and No, no, I'm not.

966
01:07:55,745 --> 01:07:56,628
Speaker 0: I'm not a name store.

967
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:57,793
Speaker 1: I'm not agreeing with it.

968
01:07:57,853 --> 01:07:58,757
Speaker 1: I'm just pointing out.

969
01:07:58,817 --> 01:08:05,174
Speaker 0: that's why Fairly preventing the bubblegum store proprietors from having their livelihood.

970
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:07,000
Speaker 0: you sir are fucking the economy.

971
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:08,591
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that's what it is.

972
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:09,558
Speaker 1: I'm not saying I.

973
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:12,928
Speaker 0: The reason for it is very simple.

974
01:08:13,008 --> 01:08:16,551
Speaker 0: a lot of people have a vested interest in keeping it the way it is because they make Money off of it.

975
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:18,603
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

976
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,129
Speaker 1: Let's see what we got.

977
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,438
Speaker 0: You do a couple more two more two more.

978
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:24,363
Speaker 1: All right Let me see what I got here.

979
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:26,450
Speaker 0: Talk about the PDF exploit.

980
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:30,080
Speaker 0: What kind of PDF exploit read a PDF get exploited?

981
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:31,464
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

982
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:33,616
Speaker 1: So there's a basically a bug in acrobat reader.

983
01:08:33,657 --> 01:08:34,180
Speaker 1: Is that what it is?

984
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,372
Speaker 0: You don't realize that there have been tons of bugs like that.

985
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:39,743
Speaker 0: acrobat reader is like Adobe.

986
01:08:39,863 --> 01:08:41,068
Speaker 0: acrobat is in the position.

987
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:46,907
Speaker 0: It is for a lot of reasons, but it's not a Solution to the problem that it solves.

988
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:49,716
Speaker 0: It's just the only thing that works well enough for everyone.

989
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:50,660
Speaker 0: I hate Adobe?

990
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,506
Speaker 0: I don't know.

991
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:53,219
Speaker 0: I hate Adobe acrobat and PDFs.

992
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,091
Speaker 1: Well, I like you know, the Sun about PDFs like.

993
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:59,640
Speaker 1: they have their use, you know, I like yes They do.

994
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,223
Speaker 1: is there many?

995
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:02,028
Speaker 1: they're often used improperly.

996
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,055
Speaker 1: They're often implemented poorly.

997
01:09:04,075 --> 01:09:04,737
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

998
01:09:04,756 --> 01:09:05,800
Speaker 0: The code is bad.

999
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,028
Speaker 0: PDFs are a lot larger than they need to be.

1000
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:11,380
Speaker 0: the software to make them is difficult to use or expensive.

1001
01:09:11,782 --> 01:09:13,331
Speaker 0: They're huge ram hogs.

1002
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,859
Speaker 0: Usually there's nothing more problems with that.

1003
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:17,888
Speaker 1: Format has nothing to do with that.

1004
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,817
Speaker 0: Well, it partly does no.

1005
01:09:19,897 --> 01:09:20,460
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

1006
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:27,216
Speaker 1: There are plenty of PDF viewers that are that could realize PDF right is really is just based on postscript, right?

1007
01:09:27,678 --> 01:09:33,600
Speaker 1: So They're like open source postscript, you know interpreters that are like wicked fast and wicked light.

1008
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:38,700
Speaker 0: Yes, but every open source PDF reader I've used has always choked on some document at some point.

1009
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,560
Speaker 1: Well, that's only because people make weird PDFs with acrobat reader that do weird shit.

1010
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,680
Speaker 0: They're not supposed to be doing like the fact that you go to say the burning wheel website.

1011
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,854
Speaker 0: There's all these, you know type your stuff into the character sheet, but it's restricted to where.

1012
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:53,160
Speaker 0: you can't then save that.

1013
01:09:55,003 --> 01:09:58,640
Speaker 0: The fact that just in general I've had a lot of trouble with PDFs over the years.

1014
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,927
Speaker 0: I use them extensively because it's the only way I can give someone a document and know what it'll look like when they Look at it.

1015
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,648
Speaker 0: Mmm Anyway, yeah, there's an exploit.

1016
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:08,914
Speaker 1: So basically it.

1017
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:09,658
Speaker 1: so it works.

1018
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,060
Speaker 1: where?

1019
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,530
Speaker 1: You download a PDF that is as an exploit in it.

1020
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:15,678
Speaker 1: You open it up in acrobat reader and then it owns you.

1021
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:17,064
Speaker 0: Yep Yep.

1022
01:10:17,726 --> 01:10:21,140
Speaker 1: All right, so don't don't download any shady whatnot?

1023
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:30,180
Speaker 0: I guess the real issue here is that I feel like every operating system should have built in by default the right-click open in sandbox.

1024
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:41,040
Speaker 1: Well, actually, you know you can get sandbox II for Windows which I used, you know to watch some Illegally streamed not no written consent football game.

1025
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:41,882
Speaker 0: Oh, did you now?

1026
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:49,644
Speaker 1: and it worked perfectly at my computer is still perfectly clean and all that Chinese spyware was contained in the sandbox Which was deleted.

1027
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:52,116
Speaker 1: so sandbox II is a good tool.

1028
01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:53,020
Speaker 1: if you get it.

1029
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,379
Speaker 1: I just you need to be smart to know how to use it.

1030
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:01,060
Speaker 1: It's not it's not gonna be something that uh, you know an average person can figure out, you know

1031
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:09,879
Speaker 0: It's pretty much that a lot of problems like this where like in an oculus file that if you had the reader is the is The problem not the operating system or anything but the reader.

1032
01:11:10,503 --> 01:11:17,280
Speaker 0: I feel like operating systems should in general and when I say operating systems I'm looking squarely at Microsoft and very few other people.

1033
01:11:17,862 --> 01:11:24,839
Speaker 0: Microsoft should kind of by default err on the side of preventing applications from doing things that seem bad.

1034
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:32,340
Speaker 0: I mean, actually I do really like the fact that Vista will do that, you know darken the screen.

1035
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,205
Speaker 0: Hey, this thing wants admin.

1036
01:11:34,445 --> 01:11:36,230
Speaker 0: Do you want it to do whatever it's trying to do?

1037
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,628
Speaker 1: Hmm Alright, so I guess.

1038
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:42,455
Speaker 1: so the final news we'll talk about this right.

1039
01:11:42,475 --> 01:11:43,740
Speaker 1: so Firefox, right?

1040
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:47,316
Speaker 1: I've been using Firefox since it was called Phoenix.

1041
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,160
Speaker 1: How long you been using it?

1042
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,750
Speaker 0: I used it at the beginning of the firebird era.

1043
01:11:51,032 --> 01:11:52,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you didn't listen to me.

1044
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,064
Speaker 0: Well, I had it.

1045
01:11:54,205 --> 01:11:56,232
Speaker 1: you're always intentionally late adopting.

1046
01:11:56,252 --> 01:12:04,400
Speaker 0: I had it in Phoenix, you know Phoenix I used it a little bit, but I didn't surf the web that much from my even after you're using firebird.

1047
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,734
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to get to use the stupid tabs?

1048
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:07,800
Speaker 0: I use the tabs immediately.

1049
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,833
Speaker 1: No, you know that you'd use the tabs.

1050
01:12:09,853 --> 01:12:10,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, try to.

1051
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:13,347
Speaker 0: okay I use the tabs from day one.

1052
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:14,231
Speaker 0: That's why I switch.

1053
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,260
Speaker 1: No, I was always yelling at you for the tabs.

1054
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:16,942
Speaker 1: You never did it.

1055
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:23,544
Speaker 1: Okay, people don't remember this regular old Mozilla had the tabs before Firefox.

1056
01:12:23,705 --> 01:12:24,088
Speaker 1: it was just.

1057
01:12:24,108 --> 01:12:26,585
Speaker 1: they were slow and poopy but you know I was using them.

1058
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:26,847
Speaker 1: then.

1059
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:38,860
Speaker 0: the main reason I didn't use Firefox but they were implemented poorly was that most of my web surfing was done on the other side of campus on the school computers That only had IE I was carried out the thumb drive.

1060
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:40,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't.

1061
01:12:40,588 --> 01:12:41,273
Speaker 1: I didn't have a thumb drive.

1062
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,280
Speaker 0: I didn't have a thumb drive either.

1063
01:12:45,322 --> 01:12:46,525
Speaker 1: But anyway, I was always.

1064
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:48,632
Speaker 1: I've been using Firefox basically forever right?

1065
01:12:48,652 --> 01:12:50,137
Speaker 1: that was version like 0.5 I think right.

1066
01:12:51,524 --> 01:12:54,623
Speaker 1: So now we're on Firefox 3 0.

1067
01:12:54,623 --> 01:13:02,180
Speaker 1: I've been using a lot of Firefox and every time a version came out I was like, ah, how could this possibly get any better than this?

1068
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,564
Speaker 1: they they would just come out.

1069
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,651
Speaker 1: every version had some amazing new features.

1070
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:10,432
Speaker 1: that blew me the fuck away and I was like What the fuck are they gonna do in the next version?

1071
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,960
Speaker 1: that's gonna blow me away, right?

1072
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:19,119
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know just about now The only things that would really impress me would be like if they made it a little bit more Google Chrome.

1073
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:22,170
Speaker 1: ish You know, it was a little bit lighter a little bit faster.

1074
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:28,938
Speaker 1: separate processes on the tabs, you know, that would be nice You know, but really what are they gonna do in the next Firefox to blow you away?

1075
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:33,960
Speaker 1: Well Right now or very recently was the Southern California Linux Expo.

1076
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:37,538
Speaker 1: I wish we had one of these maybe New York Linux Expo anybody.

1077
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:47,293
Speaker 1: Come on I would like that very much and they demonstrated some features of Firefox 3.1 And of course their blow you away features.

1078
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:48,840
Speaker 0: All right, I'll bite like what?

1079
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:49,922
Speaker 1: All right.

1080
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:52,433
Speaker 1: So first they can have a native JSON parser.

1081
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:53,779
Speaker 1: I don't know if you know what that means.

1082
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:57,409
Speaker 0: It's something that will be able to parse JSON without a plug-in.

1083
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:01,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's a JSON is JavaScript object notation?

1084
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:09,432
Speaker 1: right, and it's it's a way of sort of Serializing data in a human readable way.

1085
01:14:09,452 --> 01:14:11,340
Speaker 1: That is that can be used by JavaScript.

1086
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:22,655
Speaker 1: so a common way thing you would do with this is let's say I have a web application with a database behind it and Someone else writes a website and the JavaScript on the website goes and queries.

1087
01:14:22,695 --> 01:14:27,020
Speaker 1: my JSON web service gets some JSON text the JavaScript.

1088
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:29,609
Speaker 1: It's JavaScript object notation.

1089
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,620
Speaker 1: So that becomes a JavaScript object immediately.

1090
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:38,860
Speaker 1: It just boop there it is And then the JavaScript program can easily use all the data in that to you know.

1091
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,580
Speaker 1: Update the page and it's sort of Ajax II web 2.0 thing, right?

1092
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:46,678
Speaker 1: And Jason is just really easy for doing it because JavaScript just gets it.

1093
01:14:47,343 --> 01:14:48,880
Speaker 1: with a native JSON parser.

1094
01:14:48,900 --> 01:15:01,500
Speaker 1: that's basically just gonna be about 10 million times better and faster and you'll notice a significant enhancement in any sort of Jason using website and you won't know why but it'll be there.

1095
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:04,606
Speaker 1: Something else they're adding right?

1096
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:08,559
Speaker 1: is the HTML 5 video element, right?

1097
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:12,679
Speaker 1: I mean Even with HTML like X HTML and shit, right?

1098
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:21,405
Speaker 1: Updating when you're doing HTML and you want to put like a flash video in a site or Anything like that, right?

1099
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:27,040
Speaker 1: You always have to use like, you know object embed all these really old shitty tags that suck ass.

1100
01:15:27,963 --> 01:15:31,515
Speaker 1: Well now they're gonna have the HTML 5 video element.

1101
01:15:31,535 --> 01:15:34,659
Speaker 1: You're gonna do it video slash video.

1102
01:15:35,962 --> 01:15:36,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, isn't that great?

1103
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:39,299
Speaker 0: That's that's a sigh of relief right there.

1104
01:15:39,821 --> 01:15:42,289
Speaker 1: So, you know people aren't gonna have to like be doing.

1105
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:45,599
Speaker 1: you know weird things to translate stuff from.

1106
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:49,709
Speaker 1: you know the thing is Only people with Firefox 3 is gonna work.

1107
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:59,580
Speaker 1: if someone's coming to your website with like ie7 or 8 They're not gonna see the video To say like, you know, Firefox right now has support for the canvas element, right?

1108
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,179
Speaker 1: And there are certain places you can go to see demonstrations of the canvas element and what it can do.

1109
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:09,788
Speaker 1: I mean, I've played Wolfenstein in the canvas element and Just the other browsers don't support it.

1110
01:16:09,868 --> 01:16:17,610
Speaker 1: so no one can really build canvas using sites because No one will see them except Firefox users.

1111
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:20,260
Speaker 1: Everyone else will just get like a square that looks fucked up.

1112
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:25,377
Speaker 0: Maybe someday we'll have a unified HTML that everyone follows the same way.

1113
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:43,291
Speaker 1: Yep supposedly, I mean there's some talk here also about including like some Different like video codecs and something some odd stuff, you know to like add some more multimedia stuff without plugins and Some other kind of shit like that.

1114
01:16:43,754 --> 01:16:46,185
Speaker 1: It could get pretty interesting But the only thing is right.

1115
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:50,520
Speaker 1: Firefox keeps adding these features and they are pretty amazing and awesome and I like them.

1116
01:16:50,680 --> 01:17:02,407
Speaker 1: But you know people even though Firefox has been lightening up a little bit and they got a newer faster like JavaScript stuff going on There I keep adding it on.

1117
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:12,003
Speaker 1: and originally the point of Phoenix the point of Firefox was that Mozilla Right was piling it on and not only were they piling it on in the browser But they were piling it on.

1118
01:17:12,223 --> 01:17:18,260
Speaker 1: they had email composer and news groups all in one application and it was getting big and slow.

1119
01:17:18,785 --> 01:17:20,360
Speaker 1: So they're like god, this is too big and slow.

1120
01:17:20,623 --> 01:17:24,610
Speaker 1: Let's do the browser only Right browser only and we'll make it light.

1121
01:17:24,911 --> 01:17:27,400
Speaker 1: and if they want to add features the features can be in extensions.

1122
01:17:27,621 --> 01:17:28,525
Speaker 1: That way it'll be light.

1123
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,960
Speaker 1: and then they said oh, but wait, these are features that everyone's using.

1124
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,440
Speaker 1: Let's move them back into the browser back into the right and now Firefox is big again.

1125
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,449
Speaker 1: I feel like we need a Firefox.

1126
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:39,659
Speaker 0: finally we have a loss of vision here.

1127
01:17:39,941 --> 01:17:41,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had their eyes on the prize.

1128
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:41,958
Speaker 0: They had a vision.

1129
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:43,666
Speaker 0: I followed away from the vision.

1130
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:45,855
Speaker 1: I do sort of think we need a Firefox.

1131
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:57,680
Speaker 1: Firefox that sort of Takes all the features of Firefox the big ones Anyway, right splits them off into extensions brings Firefox down to its previous light and fastness.

1132
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,031
Speaker 1: Maybe you know more like Chrome, right.

1133
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:06,880
Speaker 1: and then you know Maybe comes with like those default extensions that everyone wants sort of already installed.

1134
01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:12,422
Speaker 1: But then you can like, you know disable them, you know something like that just so that you know We got it.

1135
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:16,360
Speaker 1: We got to bring it back to what the the original vision was and we're getting away from it.

1136
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:26,520
Speaker 1: We're getting a big bloated browser and I think that's why there's room for you know IE 8 and and Chrome to move in is because Firefox is giving them room.

1137
01:18:27,022 --> 01:18:31,058
Speaker 1: but hopefully, you know the next browser will give them a little less room.

1138
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:47,811
Speaker 1: and Also, maybe if people start making websites that use, you know, HTML 5 video tag Canvas element and some of these other, you know modern features and start demanding Hey, you know like back in the day that used to say hey You want to see the shit on my website get flash?

1139
01:18:48,092 --> 01:18:49,560
Speaker 1: Hey, you want to see the shit on my website?

1140
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,528
Speaker 1: You know, you better be using Netscape.

1141
01:18:51,568 --> 01:18:53,760
Speaker 1: Maybe we need a little bit of that, you know.

1142
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,788
Speaker 1: Hey, you want to see what's on this website?

1143
01:18:56,169 --> 01:18:58,317
Speaker 1: Holy Firefox 3.1 is modern enough.

1144
01:18:58,638 --> 01:18:59,020
Speaker 0: Go get it.

1145
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:10,377
Speaker 0: Well, it's interesting because in Norway they're having this big campaign now to point out to people using old IE 6 to stop it and Not use it anymore and upgrade to IE 7 or you know the new Firefox.

1146
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:23,760
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I think you know, maybe there might be a way to like, you know You could configure your web server to detect user agent and if the user agent is IE You know six or under forward them to get Firefox.

1147
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:26,880
Speaker 0: That's how the internet was for a long time and it kind of sucked.

1148
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:34,440
Speaker 0: I know remember back in the day when you know I have to such like I only go away Netscape losers and the other people were like, but you know what for the win?

1149
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:39,116
Speaker 0: You know what crash IE with a file con con exploit, you know, what remember file con con?

1150
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:50,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it worked But now it was kind of 50/50 And the only reason people stopped using Netscape is because it got unusable, yeah Plus I would file con con people all the time.

1151
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:52,825
Speaker 1: All right.
