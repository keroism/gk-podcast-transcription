1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,292
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday September 5th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,059
Speaker 0: We complain about that old classic hero quest.

3
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,697
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:24,056
Speaker 0: Well, we're back from a wonderful labor day weekend where we pretty much just labored over board games.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,045
Speaker 1: Ah Sweet laboring.

6
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,520
Speaker 0: I got to say labor day used to mean a lot more to me when I had school the next day.

7
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:34,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean I did a lot of.

8
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:41,020
Speaker 1: actually if I figure Mathematically I did more work on Labor Day than on today.

9
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 0: Though the thing is I mean Emily is back now, which is wonderful But she was talking about how like she was getting ready for classes because she started school today.

10
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:57,529
Speaker 1: Yeah I drove I drive by this high school on the way to work and There haven't been cars at it for months.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,899
Speaker 1: and today there were cars at it.

12
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Emily was telling me about.

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,423
Speaker 0: you know I took this class.

14
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,031
Speaker 0: in this class you shown him her schedule and I was.

15
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:14,340
Speaker 0: it's weird to think that I would ever even Dream of thinking something like this, but I was a little jealous cuz I kind of miss starting new classes.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:27,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you remember You know the kind of feelings you got on the first day of school and around the country perhaps the world There are kids like that having those kind of feelings all this week and last week and next week.

17
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,965
Speaker 1: and well for us It's normal days.

18
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:30,647
Speaker 0: Yep.

19
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,255
Speaker 0: My Tuesday was no different than my previous Tuesday.

20
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:34,980
Speaker 0: I got up and I drove to Yonkers.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:45,329
Speaker 1: I think part of why you know, I'm not a hundred percent satisfied with my current job is like, you know previously in life I'd have constant changes and things like okay.

22
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,271
Speaker 1: I'm at school.

23
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,355
Speaker 1: I'm at summer camp.

24
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,418
Speaker 1: I'm at school now.

25
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:49,060
Speaker 1: I'm somewhere else.

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,875
Speaker 1: I'd keep changing changing up every you know twice a year even just in college.

27
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:54,999
Speaker 0: different classes every 11 weeks.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:04,522
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all over the place different classes breaks, you know going on trips to places, you know going on family vacations friend vacations You know.

29
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:18,163
Speaker 1: now it's like sure I go to conventions here and there but I always return to the same thing and my Baseline is static and I need a baseline that goes all over the place to keep myself interested in life.

30
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:25,212
Speaker 0: problem is baselines that go all over the place either aren't conducive to the lifestyle we live or Don't make enough money for us to live.

31
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:26,860
Speaker 1: I know it really sucks.

32
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:35,559
Speaker 1: I need to find a way to make money and also have a moving baseline Because really a moving baseline is is the kind of life I like.

33
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:52,645
Speaker 0: Yeah Just I actually got a little jealous when she was explaining her classes to me like what she was taking because I remember I always Hated by classes at RIT because well I'd like signing up for classes and I like the first week of class because the first week nothing bad happens Nothing was assigned.

34
00:02:52,906 --> 00:03:06,782
Speaker 0: You just meet your teachers and basically get to leave class early and hang out a bit Yeah, and then you know All the slacking off but I pretty much spend the rest of the quarter Hating my classes doing anything I can to get out of them early show up to them late Yeah, and

35
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,820
Speaker 1: the description of what you're gonna learn and the anticipation of what you're gonna learn is great.

36
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,920
Speaker 1: Then actually learning it is not so great except for like the few classes that are actually interesting.

37
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:19,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like is there's nothing I like more than learning.

38
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,950
Speaker 1: but learning, you know The stuff they teach me in most of the classes is not stuff.

39
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,758
Speaker 1: I enjoy learning or want to learn.

40
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:35,377
Speaker 0: Scott I think I can name something that you possibly enjoy more than learning the one Form of learning I Enjoy learning.

41
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,029
Speaker 0: See learning is a mad as a euphemism here.

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,380
Speaker 0: Yeah for for autoerotic stimulation.

43
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,808
Speaker 1: Hey, I enjoy things more than that.

44
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:50,458
Speaker 1: Also speaking which I don't you're assuming that that doesn't involve learning New things.

45
00:03:51,381 --> 00:04:01,778
Speaker 0: Whoever it was who posted in the forums a little while ago about some kind of story that involves some kind of monkey biting some child's um sexual member?

46
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:09,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, I believe it was already posted as advice but you need to call Penn Jillette right now because I guarantee he'll put you on The radio.

47
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need to do that quick.

48
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:23,360
Speaker 0: And then when you're on the radio and you're telling the story You need to relate in the story that the only reason you called is because your friends over at geek nights told you to All right, I'm not gonna be so shameless.

49
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,395
Speaker 1: I'm not going to actually say you should do that because I have.

50
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:33,973
Speaker 1: I want to you know Keep my shame or not have not have shame but cover.

51
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,558
Speaker 1: I really really want you to do that.

52
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,160
Speaker 1: That'd be awesome.

53
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:45,597
Speaker 0: I mean the only thing it wouldn't be as useful But it'd be funnier if you just said all as many internet catchphrases as you possibly could.

54
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,580
Speaker 0: oh really while you're on.

55
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, really every time pen says ha ha like oh really like yeah, really?

56
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:56,460
Speaker 1: Oh my god See the thing is I don't know if I could do that without just laughing hysterically.

57
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:05,117
Speaker 0: Talking Penn would be like something something something and I'd be like, yeah And then he'd probably ask why you're laughing and then you try to explain it.

58
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,328
Speaker 0: Alright, we'll do something.

59
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,123
Speaker 0: if you just call Penn Gillette and tell him about it on the show That'll be good enough.

60
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:18,053
Speaker 0: If the word geek nights comes up in your conversation.

61
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:28,070
Speaker 0: You'll get a t-shirt when we make t-shirts yeah, and if if you do if you say geek nights and You get in at least like five catchphrases.

62
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,093
Speaker 0: I'll kiss you on the mouth.

63
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:29,615
Speaker 0: You also got.

Speaker 1: try to say front row crew calm Yeah.

65
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:39,962
Speaker 1: if you don't say WWW though not because I don't think you should say it because I think you should but because Penn Gillette will yell at you and That'll kind of ruin it.

66
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:44,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, you could say it and the moment he says anything you say nope.

67
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:48,918
Speaker 0: Shut up Penn WWW yeah, and that would be funny.

68
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:54,397
Speaker 1: And then they'll find out that the guy who's are he gets WW is the guy that he's promoting.

69
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,631
Speaker 1: and yeah It'll be this guy Michael Godot.

70
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,864
Speaker 0: be like wait a minute Ram.

00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,457
Speaker 1: Oh What's up with that?

73
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:09,744
Speaker 0: That would be.

00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:14,288
Speaker 0: or if you just said baba mooey baba mooey Rimming Scott's penis, you know what if he does?

75
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,995
Speaker 1: if it's not if I don't hear it on the next monkey Tuesday or the one after That I'm going to call it in and pretend.

76
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:20,700
Speaker 1: It's my story.

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,569
Speaker 1: You know what make up a good story about a monkey biting a penis.

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,977
Speaker 0: I will too and we'll both call in.

79
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:34,394
Speaker 0: Yeah so fair anyway Because we don't have awesome new classes to take or school is starting or anything.

80
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:39,207
Speaker 0: Today is just another day and All we did today was play or games.

81
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,390
Speaker 0: Well one board game.

82
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, which uh, hey to brag would.

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 0: no I don't absolutely love to freakin brag, but I'm on a goddamn roll when it comes to board games that involve bidding.

84
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:51,487
Speaker 0: I've won like every game we played.

85
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:52,471
Speaker 0: I bitch.

86
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,036
Speaker 1: He doesn't really involve that much bidding.

87
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,300
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

88
00:06:55,942 --> 00:07:04,022
Speaker 0: Every game it's always been me Scott and Alex because now that Alex lives with us we can play board games constantly Every game.

89
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,389
Speaker 0: it's me and Alex and pretty much neck-and-neck.

90
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,234
Speaker 0: and then Scott is way behind.

91
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,799
Speaker 1: I wasn't way behind yesterday.

92
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:10,782
Speaker 1: Yes you were.

93
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,605
Speaker 1: No I wasn't.

94
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:12,609
Speaker 0: Oh no you weren't.

95
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,656
Speaker 1: I wasn't way behind the last time.

96
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,243
Speaker 1: this two times ago We played Vinci.

97
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:19,620
Speaker 0: Well you were way behind in raw at the very end when I got all those extra points.

98
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,746
Speaker 1: No Because Alex is so far more behind.

99
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:27,081
Speaker 1: like you had like 60 I had like 40 something and Alex had like 15.

100
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Vinci you're not doing so well.

101
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,797
Speaker 1: The latest Vinci I was to suck.

102
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,462
Speaker 1: next time I will not to suck.

103
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:35,329
Speaker 0: You were more than half a board away.

104
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,396
Speaker 1: I was slightly less than half a board away.

105
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,951
Speaker 1: I Just didn't add my points from the final turn.

106
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:47,420
Speaker 1: wouldn't have been so many It wouldn't have been but it would have been less than half a board away.

107
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:57,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in general it's weird because like I always win the games but Alex Oh, I mean he loses by like one point or like two points every time.

108
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:07,660
Speaker 0: Yep, we're trying to figure out is because we're kind of converging on like being as good at the game as we can be or If it's just randomness because we are playing one?

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,820
Speaker 1: He was actually good and one of you takes all my points and the question is how many points did you take away from me?

110
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,760
Speaker 0: You realize in most three-player games, but you're involved in I usually think all right, how can I manipulate Scott?

111
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,698
Speaker 0: Because you try and I do.

112
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:30,440
Speaker 0: The only reason it works because you try so hard to not be manipulated by anyone That you tend to end up being manipulated by everyone.

113
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:35,456
Speaker 0: It's no good because everyone will always say things knowing you'll do the exact opposite and that just becomes.

114
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,589
Speaker 1: I just don't take what anyone Says into account and making my decision.

115
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:43,332
Speaker 1: I just go by what I think is the Worst move at least in this game.

116
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,415
Speaker 1: I did good two times ago.

117
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,938
Speaker 0: You did well, I didn't know you didn't.

118
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,120
Speaker 1: I did good deeds.

119
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,345
Speaker 0: No, you didn't hit it.

120
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,315
Speaker 0: You did nothing but conquer barbarians.

121
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,279
Speaker 1: That's a good deed.

122
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:57,774
Speaker 0: The barbarians a bad guy, but the barbarians in that game are nothing but peaceful.

123
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,800
Speaker 1: No, no, they're very not peaceful.

124
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,284
Speaker 0: They sit there.

125
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,070
Speaker 0: They got one guy.

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,914
Speaker 0: No There were eight people.

127
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,873
Speaker 0: Thank God All right.

128
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:07,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, we got some news.

129
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:12,996
Speaker 1: So there is a game a very somewhat old game called mech commander.

130
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,340
Speaker 1: now we like them battle techs.

131
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,391
Speaker 0: We used to play battle tech as often as we could at our IT which wasn't often.

132
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:26,720
Speaker 1: No, but battle tech is awesome and The closest you can get to battle tech on the computer is well, there's a thing called.

Speaker 1: It's called like something mech.

135
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:36,200
Speaker 1: I forget I forget the name of it But it's like an open-source thing with a poor interface that lets you play battle tech on the computer.

136
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:37,880
Speaker 1: Not the greatest thing in the world.

137
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:57,536
Speaker 1: but there is mech commander which is a game made by Microsoft who owns the video game rights to battle tech because they bought the faster corporation and They made mech commander, which is essentially turn-based battle tech strategy kind of for the computer and It is now free.

Speaker 1: Just there it is.

Speaker 1: It's amazing.

142
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:16,060
Speaker 0: Now these sorts of like playing these cut, you know robot fighting games tend to be very Realistic in the sense that that's how war kind of goes because it's mostly just kind of random.

143
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing battle tech is sort of a sci-fi.

144
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:27,525
Speaker 1: What if we there, you know, we really did develop, you know, bipedal walking war machines What would they be like?

145
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:33,483
Speaker 1: and this is it's a lot more realistic than say Gundam or Evangelion.

146
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:48,620
Speaker 1: now Evangelion is perfectly real is not even close If the Christians are right, maybe yeah, this is likely the Jews Yeah, but it also has you know a crazy sci-fi outer space super futuristic universe with clans and things and whatnot.

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,370
Speaker 1: But that is only the story and it doesn't involve in the game.

148
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,474
Speaker 0: It's no gassaraki.

149
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,659
Speaker 1: No, not really.

150
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:58,340
Speaker 1: but Battle take a school mech commanders cool and it's free.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,899
Speaker 1: Hey grottus free not libra free.

152
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:06,779
Speaker 0: All right This isn't video game related news.

153
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:11,519
Speaker 0: But and I'm not getting this I'm this is now going to be subject to Jack Thompson syndrome.

154
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,703
Speaker 0: in That I can't.

155
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:23,919
Speaker 0: I won't talk about this again unless something crazy happens But I have to talk about this one because this is pretty much the final Straw that was nailed into the coffin that that broke the camel's back.

156
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,592
Speaker 0: You know, the d-bold voting machines are totally broken and easily hacked.

157
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:29,735
Speaker 0: everyone knows that.

158
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,140
Speaker 0: it's been reported widely.

159
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,851
Speaker 0: There are videos everywhere showing how absolutely trivial it is.

160
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,115
Speaker 1: They had a monkey do it.

161
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:36,657
Speaker 0: Yes.

162
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 0: That is not a joke.

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,588
Speaker 0: They trained a monkey to manipulate the results of a d-bold voting machine Just now.

164
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:56,180
Speaker 0: well a little while ago someone did a little photo blog and they got a hold of some d-bold equipment and There's this little seal thing that's supposed to show that no one was able to physically tamper with the memory card that holds the results.

165
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,373
Speaker 0: And they were able now keep in mind.

166
00:11:58,393 --> 00:11:59,280
Speaker 0: This isn't anyone special.

167
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,733
Speaker 0: This isn't an engineer or anything with no training or skill or really anything whatsoever.

168
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,000
Speaker 0: What about tools like a screwdriver?

169
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:18,588
Speaker 0: They were able to trivially remove the seal do whatever they wanted to the memory card Put the memory card back and replace the seal as though it had never been removed Thus completely defeating the purpose of the seal.

170
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:24,084
Speaker 0: it could be done one-handed in less than five minutes Awesome.

171
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:27,079
Speaker 0: Now I'm wondering because a lot of places use these machines.

172
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,499
Speaker 0: There's elections coming up and there's a lot of geeks who are pissed off about politics.

173
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,369
Speaker 0: now I am NOT advocating that anyone do anything.

174
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 0: far be it for me to tell you to do something horribly illegal.

175
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:40,040
Speaker 0: But wouldn't it be funny?

176
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,447
Speaker 1: I mean you're behind a curtain in with voting.

177
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:51,907
Speaker 0: wouldn't it be funny if a whole bunch of geeks all over the place just screwed with the results of every election they could and Some crazy third parties won?

178
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:54,877
Speaker 1: not bad crazy third parties only good crazy.

179
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:55,560
Speaker 0: There's the problem.

180
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:56,339
Speaker 0: It's the internet.

181
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:03,100
Speaker 0: So one activist would make like I don't know the Green Party win and then the next four guys would all make Chuck Norris win.

182
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:04,191
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

183
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:07,767
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah That'll be the right in but that's it.

184
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,720
Speaker 1: If everyone in the whole town wrote in Chuck Norris for mayor.

185
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,239
Speaker 1: Oh my god, that would be the best thing ever.

186
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,096
Speaker 0: Either that or I just make 10 million.

187
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,407
Speaker 0: by make it I mean, here's the thing.

188
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,858
Speaker 0: if I were to do something like this Which I'm not and I'm not advocating that anyone do this because it is horribly illegal.

189
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,880
Speaker 0: Yep I would make it so it showed I don't know a billion votes for like Ford Prefects.

190
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,900
Speaker 0: That would be awesome because you don't want to actually manipulate the election.

191
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,520
Speaker 0: You just want to show people that yeah, that machine was broken and it got hacked.

192
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:43,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they if you do it to every voting machine in there.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,067
Speaker 1: so let's say your vote your local voting place has five d-ball voting machine.

194
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:50,535
Speaker 0: in this hypothetical world five nerds.

195
00:13:50,836 --> 00:14:02,896
Speaker 1: one goes in each booth and you hack each and every one of them and then You know that place will have to redo their election and they'll not use those machines the next time.

196
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,518
Speaker 1: and if they redo the election Go in and hack it again.

197
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just it bothers me.

198
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:09,289
Speaker 0: they don't change.

199
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,380
Speaker 0: it doesn't bother me so much that these voting machines are so bad.

200
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:23,740
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that it's widely known among geeks and technologists that the voting machines are completely broken and hackable But the rest of the country has no idea and the news doesn't report on this at all.

201
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:24,603
Speaker 1: Well, we don't.

202
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,371
Speaker 1: I don't know what the news reports because I don't watch.

203
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,175
Speaker 0: no one knows.

204
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:28,380
Speaker 0: No one knows.

205
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,209
Speaker 0: I defy you to find someone who doesn't read.

206
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,440
Speaker 1: I think that this is finally time.

207
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:35,460
Speaker 1: We should just take advantage of it and the geek should take over the country.

208
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:37,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

209
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,351
Speaker 0: They probably just shoot us with their guns.

210
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,550
Speaker 1: I mean we've all but if we vote We've all played a lot of counter-strike.

211
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:45,179
Speaker 0: don't think that's gonna help so much.

212
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,918
Speaker 1: But if we voted into power then one of us would be in charge of the armies and then we'd win.

213
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,052
Speaker 0: Somehow I see the hypothetical plan that we're not in any way advocating failing exactly.

214
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:57,734
Speaker 0: Yes.

215
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:09,260
Speaker 1: Once again, I'm not advocating that you in any way tamper with lecture results but go to You know the website that shows how to do it and watch it and carefully, you know.

216
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,559
Speaker 0: What really bothers me is that it's so easy to make an electronic voting machine that works.

217
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:20,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, you and I in a few days could make a complete voting machine.

218
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,297
Speaker 0: That was absolutely untamperable.

219
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably Let me the hard part would be machining it.

220
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:29,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the software part is nothing.

221
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,240
Speaker 1: the software part is trivial.

222
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:43,633
Speaker 1: It has some memory enough to store two really big numbers, you know, well a bunch of really big numbers for all the candidates and It increments them whenever someone pushes a button Yeah and then digital signatures to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.

223
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:53,660
Speaker 0: yeah and then you print out what someone voted for and it appears under glass and Then when they make their vote that piece of paper also gets stored in the machine.

224
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:56,431
Speaker 0: So no matter what there's a perfect physical record.

225
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:56,993
Speaker 1: Yep.

226
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,339
Speaker 1: Just a big metal bucket.

227
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:04,616
Speaker 0: Oh Deebold if you're listening, uh, I'll work for half whatever you paid your lowest paid engineer.

228
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:05,980
Speaker 0: Yeah on your voting machines.

229
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:13,100
Speaker 1: Yeah I would work for Deebold to design the voting machines that they paid me enough and They admitted that there are other voting machines are crap and took them back.

230
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:16,199
Speaker 0: You don't even have to admit it publicly just admit it to me and I'll be happy.

231
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all I want.

232
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,478
Speaker 0: I don't care if you lied everyone else, but don't lie to me.

233
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:26,697
Speaker 1: and Also, let us know if you break the elections before that way, you know, yeah, I'm curious.

234
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:27,480
Speaker 1: you can blow the whistle.

235
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,860
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't care cuz John Kerry probably wouldn't have been the best president either.

236
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,312
Speaker 1: They both suck, but it's not the point.

237
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not the point at all.

238
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:40,736
Speaker 0: And for everyone who's been kind of asking what our political affiliations were if you can't figure that out.

239
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:50,776
Speaker 0: I know Anyway things of the day.

240
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:57,849
Speaker 0: All right now the Mississippi State drum corps Did a pretty cool little?

242
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:05,030
Speaker 0: Video game related show recently that made it to a Kotaku and there's a terrible barely watchable video of it.

243
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:08,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, at first I thought they're real cool and it is really cool.

244
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,310
Speaker 1: But the video does not do the justice.

245
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,750
Speaker 1: In fact, it doesn't injustice.

246
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:21,730
Speaker 0: well, basically the guy who filmed it is on the wrong side of the stadium and He's got a crappy camera with a crappy microphone and he's kind of far away.

247
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,530
Speaker 0: Yeah However, you can kind of tell what's going on And once you realize what's going on you realize that had you been there it would have been pretty badass.

248
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,947
Speaker 0: And Mississippi their marching band their core is very large as in 300 plus.

249
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:46,370
Speaker 0: That is a lot of people marching and it's they can make very complex very detailed marching forms.

250
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,273
Speaker 0: It's really cool to see.

251
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,442
Speaker 1: I mean the buttons on there any as controller move.

252
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had a cord on it.

253
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,799
Speaker 0: They actually made a cord out of.

254
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:59,919
Speaker 0: I'm not going to use the term we used for them when I was in high school But the flag car people Mm-hmm the flaggies.

255
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,427
Speaker 0: No, no, no eggs.

256
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:04,066
Speaker 0: now Okay, it's far worse than that.

257
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:13,950
Speaker 1: Anyway So I found this cool game like it's funny that yeah It's funny that both of my I news and my thing of the day today are free games.

258
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:16,215
Speaker 1: But so what's free now?

259
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,660
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a game.

260
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,749
Speaker 1: That was all that was not free and is now free.

261
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:24,829
Speaker 1: But it's actually a game that is free and might become not free.

262
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:38,828
Speaker 1: but There's a game some guy made called zombie city tactics and you can download the zombie city tactics For free from this guy's website.

263
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:39,030
Speaker 1: now.

264
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:46,660
Speaker 1: Zombie city tactics is like this incredibly simple Turn-based strategy game for the PC on Windows.

265
00:18:47,142 --> 00:19:17,410
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll run into wine just fine because it's just so simple and all you do is they start you in a scenario in which there are zombies and they're your guys and you basically you know you take your turn is a square grid and you move your guys and You can move them one space north south east west or diagonal or you can make them stand still and then the zombies move one Space and then you move one space now if a zombie moves on to your guy you die.

266
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,810
Speaker 1: If you move on to a zombie it dies.

267
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:23,810
Speaker 1: So the idea is you want to move your guys on to the zombies?

268
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:27,790
Speaker 1: But you want to end your turn not being adjacent to zombies.

269
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:35,509
Speaker 1: Now it gets a little interesting because you have some guys who can kill Zombies from one space away without moving on to them.

270
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:41,490
Speaker 1: You have guys that can move two spaces and there's a zombie generator making a constant stream of zombies.

271
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:47,390
Speaker 1: So I actually haven't figured out the pattern to beating the very first level yet.

272
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,056
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm an idiot or what.

273
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:54,776
Speaker 0: I think you should apply your much vaulted skills at Vinci Yeah to solving this problem.

274
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I only tried it three times.

275
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:04,547
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure with a little more effort I would have figured it out, but it's pretty hard until you figure out what to do.

276
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,210
Speaker 0: See now Scott It's really interesting and simple.

277
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:10,581
Speaker 0: I haven't played this game and I'll bet many of our listeners haven't played this game.

278
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:14,637
Speaker 0: if even one of them solves it Right away.

279
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,990
Speaker 1: I don't think you will do it on the first try.

280
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,675
Speaker 1: However, I have one piece of advice.

281
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:19,879
Speaker 1: read the.

282
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,065
Speaker 1: read me because I didn't realize you could buy more units and stuff like that right away.

283
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,806
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but it's a cool fun free game.

284
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:29,509
Speaker 1: You should try it out.

285
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:30,954
Speaker 0: You have learned.

286
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:34,490
Speaker 0: well, my friends now is come the time of your first trial.

287
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:44,118
Speaker 0: You must first enter the catacombs which contain foul mugs - you must seek out and destroy there Foul gargoyle who hides in these catacombs.

288
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,850
Speaker 0: This quest is not easy and you must work together in order to survive.

289
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,480
Speaker 0: This is your first step on the roads to becoming true heroes.

290
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,666
Speaker 0: trade carefully my friends.

291
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,150
Speaker 1: Hey, what if I don't go?

292
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,509
Speaker 0: Well, then that just kind of fucks the whole game in the veritable ass now, doesn't it?

293
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,654
Speaker 1: I think it does.

294
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,349
Speaker 1: I don't see too much motivation for the characters here.

295
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,153
Speaker 1: I know.

296
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:08,470
Speaker 1: of course you should go into this catacomb and fight a gargoyle who never bothered them.

297
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,167
Speaker 1: It doesn't even know who they are for no reason.

298
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,066
Speaker 0: now Here's the important part that Alex did not read to us when we played the first time.

299
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:18,790
Speaker 0: Okay, Zargon You may tell everyone that there are no traps or secret doors in this quest.

300
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,922
Speaker 1: Oh, how did they know if that that means someone was down there already?

301
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that there's no secret doors or traps.

302
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:28,289
Speaker 0: I got to say the best part of this game is the flavor text.

303
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:36,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, wait, if we knew that that means someone's been down there Which means why do we have to go and fight if someone can already go down there survive and come back?

304
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:37,944
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

305
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:39,555
Speaker 0: You know what?

306
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,704
Speaker 0: The game's not that well thought out.

307
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,230
Speaker 0: the game it isn't.

308
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,982
Speaker 1: I think that is the number one thing that can be said about this game.

309
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,810
Speaker 0: The game is hero quest.

310
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,778
Speaker 1: Yes hero quest is.

311
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:50,963
Speaker 1: it's a Milton Bradley, right?

312
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,750
Speaker 0: It is a Milton Bradley.

313
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,031
Speaker 1: It's.

314
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:59,159
Speaker 1: it's an old Milton Bradley game that they I'm pretty sure they don't make anymore because they make hero escape now Which is something else entirely.

315
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:06,410
Speaker 0: now the way hero quest works It is a game that's kind of like old-school beer and pretzel style D&D, but it comes in a box with everything you need.

316
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,801
Speaker 0: One person plays god.

317
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,249
Speaker 0: What's the stupid thing's name?

318
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,464
Speaker 0: Zargon, you're basically the Dungeon Master.

319
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,650
Speaker 0: you control all the monsters.

320
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:32,848
Speaker 0: You have the book that I'm holding in my hand right now that shows you know where everything is and how to deal with everything Mm-hmm, and then You are basically adversarial to the party which consists of up to four people who play four different characters the elf the dwarf the barbarian and the wizard and

321
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:39,105
Speaker 1: All you do really is there's a square grid and your old dice to see how much you move.

322
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:42,661
Speaker 1: so every character moves and then The monsters move and then the characters move in.

323
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,234
Speaker 1: the monsters move and if they're adjacent They can fight.

324
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,921
Speaker 1: and your old dice to see how you fight.

325
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:48,990
Speaker 1: and there's no levels or anything.

326
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,284
Speaker 1: There's just equipment and you can search for treasure to get more equipment and gold.

327
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,865
Speaker 1: and in between levels you can use gold to buy equipment.

328
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,809
Speaker 1: and That's about it.

329
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,494
Speaker 1: It's the players versus the Dungeon Master in a just dungeon crawl With.

330
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:08,370
Speaker 1: and if there's gonna be any role-playing the game isn't gonna help you at all with that.

331
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,032
Speaker 1: It's all you.

332
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:09,594
Speaker 0: the game.

333
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,443
Speaker 0: In fact kinda really prevents any sort of role-playing.

334
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,510
Speaker 0: There's no way to talk to anyone you meet.

335
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,310
Speaker 0: There is no way to bargain with anyone.

336
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,230
Speaker 0: There is no way to in any way interact with anyone by any means other than your sword.

337
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:31,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much the only things you can do in this game are walk search for treasure search for traps search for secret doors and Fight.

338
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:40,810
Speaker 0: now fighting is composed of attacking with a weapon or casting a spell possibly if you were at the kind of person who can cast spells and All of it pretty much comes down to randomness.

339
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:47,769
Speaker 1: I mean you either play a card, you know And it just works or you roll some dice to see how much damage goes down.

340
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:56,658
Speaker 0: Well, but it really comes down to is that it is a fun game for like a father to play with his kids Or a mother to play with his with her kids.

341
00:23:56,678 --> 00:24:05,515
Speaker 0: or Like if I'm uncle rim someday to someone's kids I'll run this game for them because little kids can have a lot of fun with this game.

342
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:11,775
Speaker 0: and when I was a kid I actually played all of hero quest with my dad and my little brother and occasionally my mom.

343
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:13,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't play until college.

344
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:24,189
Speaker 0: Wow, see when I saw hero quest at our way I thought oh and this whole flood of memory came back because I played the barbarian and my little brother played the elf and occasionally my mom would play.

345
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,318
Speaker 0: and when she did she was the dwarf.

346
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:36,528
Speaker 0: and We went through the entire thing where my dad was the DM and he won played the game much more Evily than he probably could have.

347
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:37,972
Speaker 0: he made basically the game.

348
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:43,010
Speaker 0: the monsters are all complete chumps Except for the super badass monsters.

349
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically every monster has one hit point.

350
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,346
Speaker 1: So you just to hit it once and it dies.

351
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:53,940
Speaker 1: a few monsters have more hit a couple monsters have two and pretty much in Any dungeon most of the monsters you're gonna meet have one.

352
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,098
Speaker 1: So you just kill them all and then this one boss who has more than one hit point I just gang up on him to beat him in like one or two turns.

353
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,045
Speaker 0: now The only way the game is not broken really is if you play it with people who aren't gonna play the game Optimally like a bunch of kids.

354
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:12,240
Speaker 0: They won't know the optimal way and they won't figure out the optimal way to beat this game.

355
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll have fun.

356
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,760
Speaker 1: Just walking around exploring a dungeon rolling dice and moving a guy.

357
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,440
Speaker 1: I mean if you like Candyland hero questions is that much better?

358
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:30,060
Speaker 0: well, also the game is really well done in that it has a big board with a bunch of rooms on it and The game is revealed to you and each setup is different as you walk around

359
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,551
Speaker 1: Yeah, and as things are revealed like this cool plastic furniture that comes.

360
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, the props that come with this game are numerous.

361
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:43,160
Speaker 0: However, I will note that the props while they're all fairly well done have absolutely no gameplay purpose whatsoever.

362
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,172
Speaker 1: However, they can sometimes get.

363
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:46,399
Speaker 1: well, no, that's not true.

364
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,488
Speaker 1: Sometimes they give hints as to the treasure that is in the room and sometimes not as in there's a Treasure chest in the room.

365
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:55,640
Speaker 0: if you search for treasure, you'll probably find something.

366
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 1: but sometimes the treasure chest in the room and you search the treasure and there isn't any and sometimes they'll be like a. You know a cabinet in the room and you'll search your treasure and it'll say in the in the bookcase you find whatever And it's like oh my god the flavor text match the furniture.

367
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:21,199
Speaker 0: Yeah now I know later in the game because I don't remember everything but later in the game There's like one a fireplace and when you pull it it moves away and it makes a secret door and there's stuff back there.

368
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,363
Speaker 0: Yeah Now the game is.

369
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:28,040
Speaker 0: it's really only fun if you're a little kid and the game is made to be adversarial.

370
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,688
Speaker 0: It's basically the Dungeon Master against the players.

371
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,394
Speaker 0: It's not really balanced.

372
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:36,006
Speaker 0: So the Dungeon Master is probably gonna lose It's not unless he cheats.

373
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:36,729
Speaker 0: now.

374
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,220
Speaker 0: when I played it was just me and my brother most of the time as a kid.

375
00:26:39,662 --> 00:26:43,760
Speaker 0: So my dad basically had to play sub optimally or we would have just died.

376
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,735
Speaker 0: So he just kind of made it fun for us kids.

377
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:49,852
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I think that's it either has to be that way or it doesn't work.

378
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:54,299
Speaker 1: because I mean there's some games that are you know Just like this kind of like Dracula where?

379
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,063
Speaker 1: Fury of Dracula.

380
00:26:56,103 --> 00:27:03,458
Speaker 1: Dracula is sort of like the evil wizard and that you know, it's him versus the players but really he's just making the game interesting for the players.

381
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,485
Speaker 1: or what's the doom?

382
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:11,457
Speaker 1: where one guy controls the demons and the everyone else controls doom guys and you're controlling the demons you can win.

383
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:15,900
Speaker 1: and Mutant Chronicles and all the other similar type games, you know.

384
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,537
Speaker 1: But in hero quest the DM really can't win and the other games he can.

385
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:21,867
Speaker 0: now There are a lot of expansions to this game.

386
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:27,219
Speaker 0: There was a barbarian and an elf solo quest Whoa that Ryan as a kid.

387
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:31,174
Speaker 0: there are also a whole bunch of other expansions that Alex has and I also had.

388
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:36,152
Speaker 0: and then there are Things like advanced hero quest which we won't talk about.

389
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,276
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about it.

390
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,400
Speaker 1: So we can't talk about it.

391
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:42,300
Speaker 0: I never actually played it or saw it in person, but it looked real fancy.

392
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:53,140
Speaker 1: Yep but generally the problem with hero quest is that if you are an intelligent person you will realize that number one monsters can't open doors.

393
00:27:54,006 --> 00:28:08,860
Speaker 1: so in any given map if There aren't any you know monsters about like you've killed every monster that's you know Roaming the hallways and every monster in all the rooms You've already opened then there can't possibly be a monster unless you decide to search for treasure.

394
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:13,498
Speaker 0: So I guess at this point what we'll do is we'll describe how we caused Alex to pull all of his hair out.

395
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,966
Speaker 1: Yes, and so you have a map.

396
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:25,439
Speaker 1: every door is closed and there are no monsters and which means Nothing can happen to the players unless they search for treasure or open a door.

397
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,799
Speaker 1: Now you roll dice to see how many spaces you move.

398
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:36,950
Speaker 1: well, if there are no monsters and you don't search your treasure and the only you know, you basically Roll a bunch of.

399
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:40,570
Speaker 1: you don't have to roll dice You just go wherever you want to go for free.

400
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,959
Speaker 0: because essentially what you do is you roll the dice move roll the dice Move roll the dice move and it doesn't matter.

401
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:50,177
Speaker 1: Yeah You can just keep rolling forever and ever and ever and nothing can ever happen to you or change you can.

402
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:53,577
Speaker 1: you can do That till the end of time until you have your little.

403
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:57,875
Speaker 1: you know Your adventures in the exact squares you want them to be in.

404
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:59,119
Speaker 0: So what did we do?

405
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:02,370
Speaker 0: We arranged ourselves seating wise in the optimal player order.

406
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,720
Speaker 0: we would then arrange ourselves perfectly outside of each door.

407
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:20,181
Speaker 0: I would then say I take 12 meaning I'm informing Alex that I'm going to sit here and roll 2d6 Continually until I roll a 12 and everyone is just going to stand still outside the door until they roll a 12.

408
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:26,142
Speaker 0: Yes, and then once I and then basically I said we didn't have to actually roll it out because obviously it's going to happen at Some point.

409
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:26,464
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

410
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:29,840
Speaker 0: So then we'd kick open the door rush in and kill everything.

411
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:37,423
Speaker 1: Yeah basically Because we choose what order we go in we can kill all the monsters because you only have one hit point before they have a chance to even hit us.

412
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:43,846
Speaker 0: occasionally a monster would survive long enough to hit at us once and it might not hit because we Collect all the equipment.

413
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:47,000
Speaker 1: I mean then we would arrange ourselves in each and every room perfectly.

414
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:53,540
Speaker 1: Search your treasure once to make sure there wasn't any default treasure and the worst that would happen is one monster would show up.

415
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,469
Speaker 1: You'd immediately kill.

416
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:57,105
Speaker 0: I Just wonder where that monster came from.

417
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,711
Speaker 0: We're in a tiny room.

418
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,156
Speaker 0: It's completely empty.

419
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:01,420
Speaker 1: He was he was like the predator.

420
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,210
Speaker 1: He was invisible and then it ran out.

421
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,859
Speaker 1: So then he's like, oh shit, and we got him.

422
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:12,465
Speaker 1: You know That's where that monster came from and we would do this for each and every room in the game until we collected all the treasure And beat all the bad guys.

423
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,434
Speaker 1: rinse and repeat the game is boring.

424
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:15,238
Speaker 1: if you know what you're doing.

425
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:19,517
Speaker 0: three treasure chests have been stolen while being taken to the Emperor.

426
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:26,660
Speaker 0: a reward of 240 gold coins has been offered to any group of heroes who can return the chest and all of the goals.

427
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:42,059
Speaker 1: You know, it would be much cooler if it was say two groups of two heroes competing to get the treasure or if it was Like you met other adventurers down there who are NPCs who you'd fight to get the treasure or something like that.

428
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:45,220
Speaker 0: Here's the thing one of the things that bothers me about the game.

429
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:48,039
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna complain about the game because the game is made for little kids.

430
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I remember there's Milton Bradley people.

431
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:56,980
Speaker 0: now I am a reading ahead in the book Which if Alex ever wants to run the game for us, I just spoiled something.

432
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,194
Speaker 0: But I'll note that I've played through all of your requests before.

433
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:03,940
Speaker 0: you don't remember it though But I remember this one and that's why I want to talk about it.

434
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:04,333
Speaker 0: All right.

435
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,624
Speaker 0: Now think about what I just said.

436
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:11,194
Speaker 0: a reward of 240 gold coins has been offered any group of heroes who can return the chest and all the gold.

437
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:22,559
Speaker 0: So I we go off to get the chest and if you beat this dungeon, you find that there are three chests each of which contains 250 gold coins, so why would you?

438
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,480
Speaker 0: 750 gold plus a whole bunch of other items of value to the prince and Emperor.

439
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,350
Speaker 1: So why would you give it back to the king?

440
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,853
Speaker 1: Just keep it.

441
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:30,657
Speaker 0: All right.

442
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:31,180
Speaker 0: All right here.

443
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,627
Speaker 0: I'll read the text under here.

444
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,472
Speaker 0: There are three chests.

445
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,040
Speaker 0: They are marked with the prince's royal symbol.

446
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:39,879
Speaker 0: each chest is locked and contains 250 gold coins and other items of value to the prince and Emperor.

447
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,547
Speaker 0: a Hero can carry only one chest at a time.

448
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,660
Speaker 0: when carrying a chest the hero may only roll one red die for movement.

449
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,359
Speaker 0: All right, the heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chests, huh, why not?

450
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:58,320
Speaker 0: The heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chest period then why even specify how much is in there?

451
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,990
Speaker 1: Why not make it some other McGuffin?

452
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,240
Speaker 0: because they're sadists Because I remember when I was a kid and we we were kind of weak and my dad won.

453
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,740
Speaker 0: My dad kind of cheated and he gave like all the monsters magic and he was just putting us.

454
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:15,340
Speaker 0: Well, we ended up like getting the monsters in the chest room to chase us away.

455
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:19,360
Speaker 0: Then we ran back in and grabbed the chest and kind of bit by bit got the three chests out.

456
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:24,684
Speaker 0: And then we had the dwarf pick the lock and we opened him and we were like, we're just not going back We're keeping the gold.

457
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:26,733
Speaker 0: and my dad says you can't keep the gold.

458
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,300
Speaker 0: and I said why not?

459
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,589
Speaker 0: And I said you just can't keep.

460
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:35,037
Speaker 0: and he said you can't keep the gold Yeah, and my brother and I raised holy living hell over there.

461
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:40,370
Speaker 0: Oh, oh Rim what breaking news for rim.

462
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,976
Speaker 0: breaking news breaking news.

463
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:42,398
Speaker 1: You're ready.

464
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:42,900
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

465
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,238
Speaker 1: Capcom classics minis mini mix screenshots.

466
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:55,320
Speaker 1: on September 19th Capcom will release Capcom Capcom class classics mini mix for the GBA.

467
00:32:56,562 --> 00:33:09,531
Speaker 1: the game re-releases the NES versions of Strider and mighty final fight and Bionic commando GBA cart for 1995 that is already purchased.

468
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:19,652
Speaker 1: I September 19th 2006 look his screenshots look a good fucking guy.

469
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:21,637
Speaker 1: It's just an emulator of how to commando.

470
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:25,809
Speaker 0: I Hope they don't dumb down bionic commando.

471
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,438
Speaker 1: It's it's the NES game just default.

472
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:29,160
Speaker 1: It's an emulator.

473
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,440
Speaker 1: You're basically buying, you know an NES emulator and a ROM on a GBA cartridge.

474
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,654
Speaker 0: That game bionic is also mighty.

475
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,559
Speaker 1: final fight in Strider.

476
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:39,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, Strider was okay.

477
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but bionic commando is probably my second favorite Nintendo game ever.

478
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,425
Speaker 1: All right here request.

479
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,033
Speaker 1: but that was breaking news that could not be denied.

480
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:49,654
Speaker 1: I just found it.

481
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:50,537
Speaker 0: It is gaming day.

482
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:51,018
Speaker 0: So it fits.

483
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,884
Speaker 1: Yep Okay here.

484
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:53,446
Speaker 1: Okay.

485
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,011
Speaker 1: Not as good as bionic commando.

486
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,860
Speaker 0: heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chests.

487
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:01,820
Speaker 1: No, they can but bionic commando can steal your coins.

488
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:06,879
Speaker 0: The other thing I find fascinating about this game is that the way it's set up.

489
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,639
Speaker 0: there are a whole bunch of quests and The second quest is really easy.

490
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,818
Speaker 0: The third quest is really easy and they get progressively more difficult as you go on but not unmanageably.

491
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,411
Speaker 1: So yeah It's like the first quest is way harder than the second third fourth.

492
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,596
Speaker 0: That's what I was gonna say.

493
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:21,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you kind of ruined it.

494
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,368
Speaker 0: I was gonna build it up and do something funny.

495
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,900
Speaker 0: Oh, well, but instead you just came out with it.

496
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I just dumped right out there.

497
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,815
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna pretend Scott didn't say that.

498
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 0: Okay now.

499
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,020
Speaker 0: Then you go back and you realize that there's you know quest one because I said it starts at quest two and gets easier.

500
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:42,271
Speaker 0: quest one is Harder than any other fucking quest in this whole game.

501
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:47,179
Speaker 0: Oh my good God Do the monsters just rape you in the ass repeatedly?

502
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,320
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it is that in the first level you have no items and no equipment.

503
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:55,639
Speaker 0: Also, there are more monsters than in like any other dungeon in the first one.

504
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I think what they want to do is you know, the first time you're playing the game That's what you're gonna do.

505
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:07,559
Speaker 0: So, you know, they want to make sure that it's a no They want to scare you because what one of these rooms probably the most bitching room in the game is.

506
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,023
Speaker 0: I mean, there's.

507
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:12,680
Speaker 0: there's a room with a tomb and a whole bunch of crap and there's stuff all over the place.

508
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:17,419
Speaker 0: But and there's really really dangerous things to fight everywhere and the heroes are barely gonna survive.

509
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:23,115
Speaker 0: One room has two chaos warriors, which are pretty much the badasses of this game.

510
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,665
Speaker 0: in that room It's a treasure chest.

511
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,958
Speaker 0: in that treasure chest is bupkis.

512
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 0: What?

513
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,878
Speaker 0: bupkis, okay.

514
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:35,404
Speaker 0: Also There's an armory.

515
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:40,279
Speaker 0: in the first dungeon you go into this armory and there's monsters defending it you kill them.

516
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,068
Speaker 0: What would you think you would do if you just killed monsters?

517
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,760
Speaker 0: and there's an obvious prop of a whole bunch of nice shiny weapons.

518
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,706
Speaker 1: Take the shiny weapons.

519
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:53,620
Speaker 0: the weapons on this weapons rack are chipped rusted and broken.

520
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,650
Speaker 0: There is nothing here that the heroes would want.

521
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,660
Speaker 1: they're better than my nothing.

522
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,305
Speaker 1: I'm using nothing.

523
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:03,560
Speaker 0: at the beginning of the you know, you had a serviceable short sword and I had a serviceable long.

524
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,014
Speaker 0: So no, I didn't even have a long sword.

525
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:05,520
Speaker 0: I had a broad.

526
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,340
Speaker 1: So I would rather take a chipped and rusted bastard sword than a serviceable short sword.

527
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,999
Speaker 0: Well, hey, at least you bought that stick and then immediately found a stick.

528
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,969
Speaker 1: I know it's like I paid how many gold for a hundred.

529
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,862
Speaker 1: I paid a hundred gold pieces, which is like God $10,000.

530
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:27,120
Speaker 1: All right for a stick that I could have gotten in the woods for free.

531
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:32,235
Speaker 1: And then I'm in a dungeon killing things with my stick and you know what?

532
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,298
Speaker 1: I find a stick.

533
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:35,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

534
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,214
Speaker 1: There's a stick.

535
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,568
Speaker 1: Oh great,

536
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:51,679
Speaker 0: ooh I probably shouldn't look at this so much but and I just flipped through and I was gonna say that the nice thing about this Game that I thought was really cool, especially as a kid is that it gives you in the back a template Where you can make your own dungeons.

537
00:36:52,182 --> 00:37:00,211
Speaker 0: They they urge you to photocopy these two pages and then cut and paste with you know Your little paste and scissors and make dungeons and continue playing the game.

538
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:00,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

539
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:03,180
Speaker 0: So the game is basically infinite playtime.

540
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:13,066
Speaker 0: Yeah And I see here that Alex or someone in his family has at some point made in pencil a dungeon and the goblins look Really really happy really?

541
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:13,427
Speaker 1: Let me see.

542
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,454
Speaker 0: the goblins are cute little happy goblins.

543
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll have to give me the little paper.

544
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,351
Speaker 1: Let me check the goblins out.

545
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,000
Speaker 1: Oh happy goblin.

546
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Alex did this.

547
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if he even knows it's in there.

548
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:28,763
Speaker 0: maybe Alex by the way is our Dungeon master.

549
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:34,640
Speaker 0: among other things he is one of our staunchest board game players and he's currently downstairs playing Final Fantasy legend, too.

550
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,580
Speaker 0: He may or may not be listening to us while we record the show live.

551
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:39,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know but he drew happy.

552
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:45,920
Speaker 0: He did mention at one point that he feels like listening to geek nights is redundant if you live with rim and Scott.

553
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:50,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that would be exactly true because this is what we say.

554
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, you realize when we start recording.

555
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:57,907
Speaker 0: it's pretty much in the middle of a conversation just like this and when we stop recording we Continue this exact conversation.

556
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:01,623
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm geek nights could go almost 24/7.

557
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,779
Speaker 1: Oh, well, there really aren't that many dungeons in this game.

558
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:15,263
Speaker 1: No, no, oh wait, if you look at the size of dungeon one and just compare it to the sizes of the other dungeons Yeah, and the number of green guys and furniture is just way more In.

559
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:22,280
Speaker 0: just remember one hero quest is really fun in College to play a little bit with people who don't know what this game is about.

560
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:23,344
Speaker 1: Hero quest is good.

561
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,960
Speaker 1: If people don't know how to play the people are little kids or people are drunk.

562
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:33,780
Speaker 0: It's also really fun If you played it as a kid to play it again just enough to realize how much smarter you are now.

563
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,152
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a castle of mystery.

564
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:35,878
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

565
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:42,522
Speaker 1: Okay, so this game can get a little creative, but it still doesn't fix it entirely and I hate to say it But that's it.

566
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 0: I would have read the flavor text from beating hero quest, but that's a spoiler.

567
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:52,020
Speaker 0: It's so anti-climactic that I could not bring that pain upon you.

568
00:38:52,382 --> 00:39:05,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway in terms of meta bits The only thing I think is if you apply for membership to the forums Which you should if you're not already a member of the forums then you do not receive an email that says Congratulations.

569
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,048
Speaker 1: You are now a member of the forums.

570
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:08,794
