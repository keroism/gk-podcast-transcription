00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,317

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,000
Speaker 1: They're like we need more from you, and I'm like I can't really give you more right now.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,139
Speaker 1: I'm like can you wait till I move to the city that I give you a little bit more?

26
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,445
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

27
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:48,440
Speaker 1: I can't give what you're looking for so I don't know if it counts as laid off or if it counts as Fired insubordination or whatever.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,106
Speaker 1: Technically, I don't know.

29
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:50,850
Speaker 1: It's you know.

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,735
Speaker 0: I don't know how that works.

31
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:52,539
Speaker 0: I've never been fired.

32
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:55,212
Speaker 1: And I was fired once at RIT.

33
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,846
Speaker 0: Well RIT doesn't get.

34
00:01:59,409 --> 00:01:59,871
Speaker 1: I worked in.

35
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,140
Speaker 0: I didn't technically get fired from the back.

36
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:13,239
Speaker 1: I worked in these two offices in the art building the student services offices because the art building had two different ones and then In the summer I stopped working at one and worked almost exclusively the other one.

37
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:16,899
Speaker 1: But then the person who used to work at that other one they came back.

38
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,460
Speaker 1: So then I left there, and I got fired from there.

39
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:23,980
Speaker 1: That's I immediately had to go to these scheduling office.

40
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:29,240
Speaker 1: Where is where I worked which is much better first of all is a much higher profile job for more money.

41
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:36,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I worked there as love for until I left RIT the closest I ever got to being fired like actually fire fired.

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:41,838
Speaker 0: What was de Bella's when basically they asked me if I was quitting because they weren't sure.

43
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:48,477
Speaker 0: yeah I didn't wake up like I. just I remember my alarm went off And I had to be up like I had to go there at 7 a.m.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,472
Speaker 0: And chop onions, and I just went back to bed.

45
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:54,485
Speaker 1: the thing is if I quit you know It's like I could have said no I quit.

46
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,091
Speaker 1: right if I quit.

47
00:02:56,151 --> 00:03:00,991
Speaker 1: I definitely can't get any unenjoyment moneys But I think I can't tell like it was.

48
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,015
Speaker 0: you say unenjoyment.

49
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty good That's.

50
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:06,012
Speaker 1: everyone says that I've never heard that never heard that.

51
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:06,273
Speaker 1: no.

52
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:07,518
Speaker 1: It's it's always called that.

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,527
Speaker 0: no I've never heard it.

54
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,679
Speaker 1: I've heard it a million times.

55
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:11,369
Speaker 0: Anyway, I never have.

56
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:18,294
Speaker 1: I'm being honest here all right they You know it's like I looked at all the requirements for what makes you eligible right.

57
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 1: so on a New York State website It says first of all you know if you were fired because you're insubordinate or whatever that you can't get it, right?

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,540
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the case in your situation.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,604
Speaker 1: I don't know it kind of.

60
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:29,246
Speaker 1: it depends.

61
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:31,393
Speaker 1: You know that form that I signed.

62
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:36,477
Speaker 1: you know they like checked off three boxes Which were like you know not showing up to work when we want you to?

63
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,007
Speaker 1: So I guess it kinda is.

64
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,012
Speaker 0: they had a form.

65
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:41,157
Speaker 1: yeah, there's a form.

66
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,605
Speaker 1: as a son It was like.

67
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,732
Speaker 1: you know this is why we're firing.

68
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:44,255
Speaker 1: you sign it.

69
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,100
Speaker 0: you could have just nods.

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,008
Speaker 0: I don't know how that we could just not signing.

71
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,294
Speaker 1: it basically says yes.

72
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,460
Speaker 1: I have seen these forms.

73
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,387
Speaker 1: Yes, I know what they mean.

74
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:51,991
Speaker 1: It's one of those.

75
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,725
Speaker 1: It's not a. I agree I will be fine.

76
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:58,000
Speaker 0: remember when I left IBM, and they made me sign like ten different things.

77
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:02,586
Speaker 1: I said a lot more shit when I quit than when I got fired, but the funny thing is I remember I'm like.

78
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,540
Speaker 0: I'm going through all these papers.

79
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:12,320
Speaker 0: I liked my manager, and I was I was doing it all in good faith And I signed the like non-compete and I signed the NDA and I signed the non head under stuff because you know I was nice.

80
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,190
Speaker 0: but I remember one point.

81
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:17,846
Speaker 0: I asked my manager like so Do I have to sign these?

82
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:19,673
Speaker 0: and she's like yeah, and I'm like no no really like.

83
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,216
Speaker 0: do I have to?

84
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:20,899
Speaker 0: what if I just didn't?

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,760
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

86
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,824
Speaker 0: And she was like I don't know.

87
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:28,979
Speaker 0: I guess I just take your badge the same as I'm gonna do and we're done with this.

88
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:32,409
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, no you know.

89
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:33,815
Speaker 1: so they took all my stuff.

90
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:34,720
Speaker 1: I sent a little email.

91
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:36,492
Speaker 1: You know it was.

92
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:38,543
Speaker 1: it was very unexciting But it was definitely.

93
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:43,460
Speaker 1: it was a better experience than quitting the previous job to come to the car at all.

94
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, most recent job because I pretty much when I quit that job.

95
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:47,540
Speaker 1: They're like oh bye.

96
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,749
Speaker 1: But it was like what I didn't even have a chance to like talk to anyone Or or anything like that.

97
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,556
Speaker 1: You know it's weird at least this one.

98
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,502
Speaker 1: I got to be like bye Cuz.

99
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,733
Speaker 1: I remember you ran keep in touch.

100
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:00,939
Speaker 0: when I quit the hospital.

101
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:05,440
Speaker 0: it was Like I gave him a month notice like I'm gonna quit in a month expecting.

102
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,780
Speaker 1: Oh at the hospital you didn't seem like you had anyone to say goodbye to.

103
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, well there was one cool guy.

104
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,606
Speaker 1: the only reason I didn't quit this job is because there were like a few people there was Still like it was up.

105
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,055
Speaker 0: There are two cool guys there.

106
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:20,960
Speaker 0: one cool Guy was my manager who worked for like two weeks and then quit.

107
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:25,280
Speaker 1: No, but I mean these are some of these people I've been working with you know two years.

108
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:36,560
Speaker 0: It's not like you know No, but the only other cool guy at the hospital quit after I'd worked there for about a month And I remember the email he sent out was like so long and thanks for all the fish.

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,006
Speaker 0: And I was like yeah, you were cool.

110
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but the other tech guy who was the only tech guy It's still there now.

111
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:45,340
Speaker 1: He he's a. he's up in Massachusetts.

112
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,974
Speaker 1: So when we go to anime boss, and we probably you know go do lunch with him or something.

113
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,560
Speaker 1: Ah me good time.

114
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:52,783

00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:53,586
Speaker 1: he likes good food.

116
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:54,731
Speaker 0: He's not one of those.

117
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:57,060
Speaker 0: so maybe maybe it's time to work on stuff.

118
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,829
Speaker 1: It's definitely time to work on stuff.

119
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,232
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

120
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,740
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish some this week.

121
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,271
Speaker 1: I'm definitely finishing one thing.

122
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,771
Speaker 1: as soon as that's done I got something else in the pipe that I'm gonna make.

123
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,896
Speaker 0: it's in the hopper.

124
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 1: It's in the hopper.

125
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,020
Speaker 1: It'll probably only take me two weeks to get something that works Right and does like the minimum.

126
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:28,533
Speaker 1: I need to put it up and maybe put some ads on it try to make some money And then I'm also of course simultaneously going to look for actual safe jobs at the same time yep, and then You know as long as you know stuff is cool.

127
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:29,015
Speaker 1: Well.

128
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,312
Speaker 1: You know we'll see where it goes And that'll be that.

129
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:39,240
Speaker 0: Good, you know can't be sitting around being a bum right, but apparently that's what they want you to do to get unemployment, right?

130
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,736
Speaker 1: So I don't know if I'm eligible cuz I first of all was I fired.

131
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,877
Speaker 1: it was I laid off I was kind of fired, so I guess I'm sort of can't right.

132
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:56,100
Speaker 1: but also It says on the New York State website if you're working for yourself Even if you aren't making any money you can't you're not eligible.

133
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:59,342
Speaker 1: So it's like if I start working on something I mean sure who are they?

134
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:03,409
Speaker 1: they won't know they won't have any idea, but technically right I?

135
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,949
Speaker 0: I'm working on something like what's the difference?

136
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,736
Speaker 0: What if you're working on open source stuff?

137
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:09,520
Speaker 0: Is that a job?

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,644
Speaker 1: No, it says self.

139
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,860
Speaker 1: You know it says if you're working on actual work for you.

140
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:20,580
Speaker 0: It sounds like that only applies if you actually like file your taxes as I am a self-employed individual.

141
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,900
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they wouldn't know if I didn't file the taxes.

142
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:29,827
Speaker 1: But you know I might file the taxes if something works out in the next you know month or two I might have to file the taxes.

143
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,216
Speaker 1: I would like to file the tax very much.

144
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:42,636
Speaker 1: I'll be very nice It actually we wouldn't be very nice because I have to pay some accountant to do it cuz I'm sure as hell can't do It for myself if it's anything more complicated than you know the simple stuff, which I already do.

145
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:45,026
Speaker 0: well if anything I'm working from home.

146
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,975
Speaker 0: I think on Wednesday, so we can go to the kybo.

147
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:51,575
Speaker 0: Oh Kyvo lunch on Wednesday, and just hanging out around too, so we can grab her.

148
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:57,571
Speaker 1: you're gonna have to pay for me No more no less.

149
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:03,900
Speaker 0: operate for Scott Yeah, but I see I could buy you lunch, but I'm kind of eyeing that eclipse across the street.

150
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,186

182
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:24,899
Speaker 0: oh, there's smoke coming out the exhaust the cars making these screaming noises, and I can't tell.

183
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,040
Speaker 0: It's either the power steering or the transmission.

184
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,864
Speaker 0: But I can't tell.

185
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,797
Speaker 0: unless I like get out of the car and fiddle with it, and you know I'm driving home.

186
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,951
Speaker 0: I got stuff to do so I just keep driving trying to guess.

187
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,140
Speaker 1: I'll like so how did you get to the train today?

188
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,673
Speaker 0: Well, I drove the car like that.

189
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:45,523
Speaker 0: You know the next morning And then that night finally I drove around with Emily and then I came home And I I went.

190
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:51,077
Speaker 0: I went over to that parking lot by the auto parts store over there And I was on.

191
00:09:51,097 --> 00:10:03,295
Speaker 0: yeah I drove it around slowly in a circle with the hood open like walking next to it Turning the wheel and listening and looking and listening and looking and I figured out all right Something's wrong with the power steering definitely not the transmission.

192
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:04,059
Speaker 0: Which was a shock.

193
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:11,452
Speaker 0: so I stop it and I Look and I see that there's like oil and burn all around.

194
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,339
Speaker 0: the power transmission flew or the power steering fluid.

195
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,178
Speaker 0: well Mm-hmm, huh?

196
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,476
Speaker 0: The smokes coming from - yeah, so I take a rag.

197
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaker 0: where the smoke this fire I twist it to open it and the top pops off and all the power steering fluid had like burned away.

198
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,392
Speaker 1: Are you supposed to like not open that?

199
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,860
Speaker 0: now you can open that okay?

200
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,386

00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 1: you're not supposed to open and other stuff.

203
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,552
Speaker 1: You're only supposed to open when it's on and other stuff.

204
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:38,780
Speaker 1: You're only supposed to open if it's off.

205
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know this stuff.

206
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,336
Speaker 1: You're only supposed to open if you're a professional.

207
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,923
Speaker 1: yeah It's like the thing.

208
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:44,546
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

209
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:45,088
Speaker 1: is this stuff.

210
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,232
Speaker 1: You're never supposed to open.

211
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,400
Speaker 1: Why is it open a bowl?

212
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,087
Speaker 0: So the mechanic can open it.

213
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:56,118
Speaker 1: right, but if the mechanic can open it They should have a special like thing that doesn't even look like it's openable except to a mechanic.

214
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,255
Speaker 0: You know Yeah, but at the same time the scary warning is enough.

215
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:03,860
Speaker 0: for most people it was Yeah, like I had a my son fired.

216
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,155
Speaker 1: So did you buy some power steering fluid at the AutoZone II.

217
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:06,739
Speaker 1: just dump it in.

218
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,605
Speaker 0: well I dumped it in.

219
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,499
Speaker 0: I also dumped in some because I found a leak too.

220
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,774
Speaker 0: So I dumped in some power steering fluid leak stopper.

221
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:18,038
Speaker 1: so speaking of Speaking of cars right so my car has you know it's an o6.

222
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:29,307
Speaker 1: I just paid it off which is good considering you have no money As these like strips of molding on the doors right and a piece of the molding sort of chipped off when I open the door One day, and I was you know.

223
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,020
Speaker 1: so I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.

224
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,973
Speaker 1: So I finally realized you know I went to the dealer.

225
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:34,939
Speaker 1: the dealer was closed.

226
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:36,928
Speaker 1: So I'm like well, what do I do here?

227
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,260
Speaker 1: I went and I was like hey, I'm stupid.

228
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:40,546
Speaker 1: I went and took a picture of it.

229
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,904
Speaker 1: I went to the Mazda forums, and I was like hey What do I do about this?

230
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:46,068
Speaker 1: You know what they said?

231
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,513
Speaker 0: What did they say?

232
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:49,419
Speaker 1: surprisingly everyone was like?

233
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,679
Speaker 1: Pretty much everyone in these forums takes those things off.

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,248
Speaker 1: Really, yeah, no one leaves them on.

235
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,766
Speaker 1: they're like and everyone hide all these pictures like look Here's my car with them off.

236
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:00,670
Speaker 1: I took them off.

237
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,740
Speaker 1: They look stupid and why should you have them on there?

238
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,017
Speaker 0: Huh, you're taking them off.

239
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,068
Speaker 1: Well the thing is to take them off.

240
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:07,354
Speaker 1: the guy gave me directions right.

241
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:10,231
Speaker 1: basically what you do is No first.

242
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,882
Speaker 1: I got a way for it to be warm Right.

243
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,540
Speaker 0: that way the adhesive will be gooier right so you can take a hairdryer to it.

244
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,887
Speaker 1: I could do that, but that's a lot of work right.

245
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,692
Speaker 1: so wait till it's warm right.

246
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,160
Speaker 1: then get some fishing wire.

247
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:29,680
Speaker 1: I just sort of go behind it and right off right, but then they'll be all this adhesive still stuck to the door.

248
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:36,137
Speaker 1: You got to go get some goo gone or some 3m adhesive remover or whatever and they have they.

249
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:50,720
Speaker 1: you know they have some that is specifically non damaging to auto paint whatever and Then you just use it and get all the goop off and then you just have a door That's perfectly clean, and then I guess that you know I should probably like wax the car or whatever after you do something like that.

250
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:51,928
Speaker 1: You know, but whatever.

251
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,479
Speaker 1: That's that's what I'm gonna do when it's warm.

252
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:55,870
Speaker 0: Take some pictures.

253
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:56,839
Speaker 1: certainly have free time.

254
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:05,421
Speaker 0: So I suppose we should talk at least a little bit about the iPhone OS 3.

255
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we can't avoid it.

256
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:11,100
Speaker 0: It's Monday Much like how twit has to talk about Twitter.

257
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:14,214
Speaker 1: Oh the twit today was so bad.

258
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:22,815
Speaker 1: just talking about Twitter Twitter and like Stupid Jason Calacanis the guy's doing his bad Christopher Walken impression.

259
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:26,108
Speaker 1: It's like they're not talking about Technology anymore.

260
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,313
Speaker 1: It's become like it.

261
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:31,805
Speaker 1: You know just like a tech celebrity They did like talk about spin right again.

262
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,246
Speaker 0: Did they?

263
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,189
Speaker 1: they tell you I spin right on security now.

264
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:42,460
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's yeah, I don't know the only podcast Listen to anymore anime world order and Dave and Joel.

265
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I just remember when twit used about talk about tech.

266
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:51,739
Speaker 1: but on the other hand I kind of like to it going out direction because it means hey, let's just do the twit thing It's not doing it anymore.

267
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,506
Speaker 1: So we can walk right.

268
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:56,300
Speaker 1: see you know it's like if Cartoon Network stops showing cartoons.

269
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:00,699
Speaker 1: There's room for us to come in and be carton show cartoons cuz they're not showing them.

270
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,687
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll switch up the Monday format.

271
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,955
Speaker 0: I just do a tech news roundup every time.

272
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:06,180
Speaker 1: real tech news roundup.

273
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah anyway, but not.

274
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:12,480
Speaker 0: but now you realize if we do that then after a year We're just gonna have to talk about nothing of a twit.

275
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:15,398
Speaker 1: Anyway.

276
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:20,411
Speaker 1: So the iPhone the 3.0 first of all just so people know right.

277
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:25,145
Speaker 1: they all they did was make an announcement of what the iPhone 3.0 software is gonna be.

278
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,473
Speaker 1: they didn't actually release it right.

279
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:35,139
Speaker 1: so it's probably gonna come out this summer and it's very likely that when it comes out there will be another iPhone a new iPhone for it to go on right.

280
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,764
Speaker 1: and It's that way.

281
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:41,620
Speaker 1: all the people who bought the very first iPhone their contract runs out in the summer.

282
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,646
Speaker 1: So they will probably buy the new iPhone right.

283
00:14:46,207 --> 00:15:04,820
Speaker 1: and I can see what's gonna happen here Is we're very likely going to see new iPhone software and new iPhones like every single June or July Whatever the month is for As long as you know that continues right because that way everyone who has you know their iPhone contract expires.

284
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:05,843
Speaker 1: Then they get.

285
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,596
Speaker 1: they just migrate over to the newer better one every two years to your contract.

286
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,620
Speaker 1: doo doo doo doo doo, right?

287
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,825
Speaker 1: And that's what they're gonna do.

288
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:12,569
Speaker 0: brilliant.

289
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,277
Speaker 1: It's it's business.

290
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,809
Speaker 1: Hey There's a lot of features.

291
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:18,899
Speaker 1: you can read online what they all are.

292
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:24,620
Speaker 1: Some of them are pretty exciting some of them not so exciting, you know, depending on what you care about.

293
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:35,420
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of the features are really for Developers more and not so exciting for users like the ability to buy stuff from within an app, right?

294
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:46,500
Speaker 1: That's sort of good because now when like you die right now you go to the iPhone App Store and it's like you'll see Like such-and-such program light such-and-such program not free right and the light one is free.

295
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:52,837
Speaker 1: So you go and you get the free one and then if you want the real one You got to go back and pay for the other one and delete the free one.

296
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:56,200
Speaker 1: now It's just gonna be like hey, you can buy stuff in the apps.

297
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:06,040
Speaker 1: that means you could buy a game and then buy levels for the game from within the game or you could go and get a Download a free demo and then from within the free demo buy the actual game.

298
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:10,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it's good in one way But at the same time it's good for the developers who are making mad Bank.

299
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,273
Speaker 1: Maybe I should you want to give me a hundred bucks.

300
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:13,420
Speaker 1: I could buy the iPhone dev kit.

301
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,174
Speaker 1: Maybe I won't wait so suddenly I have to fund everything.

302
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:19,215
Speaker 0: you do have no money savings a lot.

303
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,658
Speaker 1: Okay, I gotta be the cheapest possible.

304
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:28,955
Speaker 0: Jew I'm buying like a house and stuff, but my my thousands of dollars are going elsewhere.

305
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,119
Speaker 1: Well, it's all ramen for me.

306
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:39,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, um the thing that I'm the only thing that I'm actually sort of you know excited to see is like the notifications You know, which it's like.

307
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:45,679
Speaker 1: well if we can't have background apps Notifications sort of make up for it.

308
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:58,684
Speaker 1: Okay, if I can just have all my I am clients and the thing will be whenever I get an I am immediately But I don't actually have to like, you know, keep it open with the I am app on the whole time That sort of.

309
00:16:59,186 --> 00:16:59,386
Speaker 1: that's.

310
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:00,792
Speaker 1: that's sort of good enough, right?

311
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:02,840
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but will that hurt the battery?

312
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:10,638
Speaker 1: Ah, you know, well the way they're doing is don't last that long as it's true But they're doing it in a certain way that you know shouldn't hurt the battery as much.

313
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:22,190
Speaker 1: you know Where the I am purse, you know The company that makes the app sends the things to Apple server and then Apple server sends me the updates You know and it it shouldn't hurt the battery any more than you know.

314
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,096
Speaker 1: exchange push, right?

315
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:25,439
Speaker 1: It should be about the same.

316
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:32,740
Speaker 1: And I heard something about cal dev support which might eliminate the need for Google sync on the calendars and such.

317
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,820
Speaker 1: There'll be a lot more calendar goings-on which is very very good if that's if that is indeed true.

318
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:43,180
Speaker 1: It's also the copy pasta which everyone was excited about but you shouldn't be excited.

319
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,903
Speaker 0: That's like if they released a game Like I don't know.

320
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,091
Speaker 0: they made Mario and they put it on the iPhone and there

321
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,788
Speaker 1: was no jump button and then later they had Exactly

322
00:17:50,829 --> 00:18:03,635
Speaker 0: what I was gonna say Yeah No and then they Rumored the jump button but wouldn't admit whether or not it was gonna be there and they told people they didn't need the jump button And then eventually eventually they released the jump button, but only if you buy Mario -

323
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:04,156
Speaker 1: yeah,

324
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:05,700
Speaker 0: which doesn't have a jump button.

325
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:07,307
Speaker 1: Thing is the copy paste.

326
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:10,080
Speaker 1: it's like just the way the iPhone works and the way I use it.

327
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I would use the copy paste sometimes but I wouldn't really use it that much.

328
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,771
Speaker 1: I mean what you know, really what am I gonna use it?

329
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,880
Speaker 1: So where am I gonna copy and paste, you know?

330
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it's just one of those basic things.

331
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,479
Speaker 1: I might copy and paste like a URL from an email, but it highlights the URLs like you just touch them.

332
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:28,663
Speaker 1: So what?

333
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:39,756
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess more useful would be if instead if they'd included copy paste by default But instead they included by default some sort of annotation system for everything.

334
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,400
Speaker 0: I don't know I get a lot of vague ideas.

335
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,063
Speaker 1: Well, they got the.

336
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:47,665
Speaker 1: they're added the spotlight search which is pretty much you can search everything on the phone from one screen Which is a good idea.

337
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:48,569
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

338
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,296
Speaker 1: Sort of what the pre is doing a little bit.

339
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:51,100
Speaker 0: Oh the pre.

340
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:53,612
Speaker 0: I'm I'm kind of feeling the pre.

341
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,919
Speaker 0: I was feel on the pre.

342
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,440
Speaker 1: You know the thing about the pre is it's gonna be sore.

343
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,900
Speaker 1: It's weird because the iPhone is gonna be more like Windows and the pre is gonna be more like Mac.

344
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:12,150
Speaker 1: Right because the what the pre is gonna do is all the built-in stuff on the pre is gonna have like awesome Syncing suppose if it lives up to the hype, right?

345
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, it may or may not.

346
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,480
Speaker 0: This is Palms last guy.

347
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:21,738
Speaker 1: It's gonna have like all this awesome Synchronization with everything and you know, everything is gonna be like web stuff and it's gonna be.

348
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:25,820
Speaker 1: you know That has a big potential to be pretty much everything I could possibly want.

349
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:30,920
Speaker 1: But the iPhone with its app store, even though the app store is, you know, get a lot of problems.

350
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:35,866
Speaker 1: There's just so many apps And it's so widely supported.

351
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,470
Speaker 1: just how Windows is.

352
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,980
Speaker 1: so Windows is not that great but everything is for Windows.

353
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,310
Speaker 1: So it's like everything is for iPhone.

354
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,559
Speaker 1: There might what you want might not be for free.

355
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:53,738
Speaker 1: So even if the pre is better in and of itself the way like, you know, Linux is better than Windows If it doesn't have all the apps, it's like.

356
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,832
Speaker 1: well I can't you know do the thing I want because it doesn't get.

357
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,566
Speaker 1: no one made it for the pre even though the pre is Much like Windows.

358
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:09,198
Speaker 0: While there are a few killer apps that you need Windows if you want to use them The majority of the software out there is garbage and I mean look at the iPhone apps.

359
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:15,463
Speaker 0: We talked about Yeah a while ago where most people if they buy an app use it for maybe a couple weeks at most and the

360
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:22,487
Speaker 1: things I went through and deleted like almost all the apps on my phone except the ones I actually use and I keep even deleting more and more and more.

361
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:30,480
Speaker 1: and I mean after this update I can actually see myself using Less of them the only ones I think I would actually use or I still use the remember the milk, right?

362
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:40,707
Speaker 1: And I still you I would use them, you know if Meebo comes out with that app, which apparently they're going to I'd get that and then I'd cancel my text messaging and Then I don't know.

363
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,117
Speaker 1: I think that would be That'd be it.

364
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:44,547
Speaker 1: I mean really what else I got?

365
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,283
Speaker 1: the web browser on there and the email and the calendar and That's sort of.

366
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,317
Speaker 1: you know, that's sort of the thing right is the pre does all those things.

367
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:57,440
Speaker 1: So Yeah Yeah My contract I still got you know another year.

368
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:06,686
Speaker 1: so like this coming update is mostly, you know, it'll make the remaining year of my iPhone experience much better and then You know, it'll help out.

369
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:18,189
Speaker 1: the people who got the original iPhone and their contracts are up Now can get you know, probably a new iPhone and the new software, you know with the subsidization and renew their contracts And they'll be happy if they still want to stick with the iPhone.

370
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:27,360
Speaker 1: and then you know in June Oh 10 I'll definitely have a job or be dead by then or homeless or in Detroit or something.

371
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,627
Speaker 1: There's no way I can go that long.

372
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:30,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, just buy one of those $500 houses in Detroit.

373
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:34,231
Speaker 1: It's an option, you know, I know people out there.

374
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,399
Speaker 0: I can I can I can get you guns.

375
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:38,823
Speaker 0: You'll need guns.

376
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,910
Speaker 1: listen there's there are plenty of options.

377
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,759
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, there's like this foreign legion option.

378
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:54,253
Speaker 1: There's Peace Corps options plenty of options, you know, I could go volunteer for like, you know some African Plenty of shit I can do and not in any sort of.

379
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,920
Speaker 0: well foreign lesions not an option.

380
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,209
Speaker 0: You have to be able to do a push-up I'll just I'll just do something.

381
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:00,799
Speaker 1: I'll just do push-up Legion first.

382
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,340
Speaker 0: So the economy's bad.

383
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,649
Speaker 0: I remember it was interesting when I was I looked at this car and then I talked to the car guy and I was like Yeah, how are things doing with the economy the way it is?

384
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,838
Speaker 0: He's like, you know what use car sales?

385
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,762
Speaker 0: skyrocketing Really?

386
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:19,940
Speaker 1: Cuz they you think that you know new car sales nada.

387
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:34,771
Speaker 0: And basically what he was pointing out is that used cars, you know, because for in America I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but pretty much if you buy a car a new car it's brand new and it's exactly what you want and Five minutes after you have driven it off the lot.

388
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:40,732
Speaker 0: It's worth crap like it's lost enough of its value to where?

389
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:46,740
Speaker 0: economically I mean ignoring the Benefit the comfort benefits of knowing that you have a brand new car.

390
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:55,369
Speaker 0: Buying a used car like a one-year-old car saves you stupid amounts of money here Just because of the nature of the market in the industry.

391
00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:06,959
Speaker 1: Well, what it has is you have you have a situation of Exponentially diminishing losses right, you know, assuming that the car stays working and nothing bad, you know It doesn't break right the dip.

392
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:12,436
Speaker 1: When the carpet a car that's one-year-old is worth a lot less is like thousands of dollars.

393
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:18,379
Speaker 1: less than a brand new Two years old is worth a lot, you know Significantly less than a one-year-old.

394
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:31,439
Speaker 1: But as soon as you go on like a five and a four-year-old car not so much different as you know The difference between those two cars is not anywhere near the difference between a brand new one and a one-year-old car Even though it's a one-year difference.

395
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:48,244
Speaker 1: So buying a car that is brand new is if you look at it as an investment, you know It's pretty stupid if you you know, but if you look at it as I'm buying what I want I want something new then it doesn't really fucking matter, you know, it's sort of like Buy a house.

396
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:59,652
Speaker 1: Yeah people who buy a house to invest and people buy a house to drive, you know to live in Drive my Winnebago Winnebago, yes, I was not totally flubbing.

397
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,903
Speaker 0: Well, there's also the new Pixar movie That's true.

398
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,089
Speaker 1: That's not driving them.

399
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,170
Speaker 1: But no, you know, so if you buy a car to drive Maybe new is the right choice if you can afford it.

400
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:20,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know I feel like the American car industry Is already having a lot of trouble obviously and I feel like one of the biggest problems is that?

401
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,940
Speaker 0: They do this thing where every single year they make like a new model of every car.

402
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this was driven by the way our economy worked and the fact that people are constantly buying a new car.

403
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,848
Speaker 1: That's sort of like the fundamental.

404
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,334
Speaker 1: see that's a lot of people are talking about.

405
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:43,678
Speaker 1: This is that they're sort of fundamental things that people sort of accept as That's the way it is because that's the way it is and it seems like it's a law of the universe.

406
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:44,945
Speaker 1: But it's really not.

407
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,380
Speaker 1: why why does the car come here to make a new model every year?

408
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,545
Speaker 0: How come they have to make every model slightly different like?

409
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,135
Speaker 0: the 1997 Miata was a beautiful car.

410
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,920
Speaker 0: It was an amazing car.

411
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:55,848
Speaker 0: I love the 1997 Mazda Miata.

412
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:03,920
Speaker 0: So why did they have to make it crook slightly so in 1998 and then crook slightly so again in 1999?

413
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,342
Speaker 0: I mean what.

414
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:15,440
Speaker 0: the only reason they got away with that is because the economy was such that people were driven To buy new cars pun very much intended and the used car market was like this secondary side thing.

415
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:22,360
Speaker 0: But suddenly the economy's bad and people notice that they can get a car That's just as good as a new car for five to ten grand.

416
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,874
Speaker 1: Well, I think actually you know lemon laws have had this.

417
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:28,936
Speaker 1: you know cuz cars You know didn't used to be so long-lasting.

418
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:40,379
Speaker 1: the other thing I realized that lemon laws have forced people to make even if you buy the cheap crappy brands or you buy a Hyundai or a Kia or you know a brand of car that is.

419
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:47,337
Speaker 1: That's the thing I'm saying is like these are you know brand the the impression people have of these brands?

420
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:48,280
Speaker 1: that they're lower quality?

421
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,549
Speaker 1: Right they cost less.

422
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,120
Speaker 1: They don't have the fancy features.

423
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,240
Speaker 1: It's not like a Mercedes right and a Mercedes will last you like 25 years Mercedes aside, right?

424
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,120
Speaker 1: But you know, but I'm saying is you know, it's the the G even the cheapest cars from the crappiest.

425
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:07,270
Speaker 1: You know the lowest end cars They're they're great.

426
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,403
Speaker 1: the last you a long time cheap ass like Chevy Aveo It'll last you.

427
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:15,940
Speaker 0: what I've noticed talking to people and looking around is that in general?

428
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,300
Speaker 0: Older people are more likely to consider a new car first or be distrustful of a used car.

429
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:24,616
Speaker 0: But younger people seem to be more likely to buy a used car.

430
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:30,677
Speaker 0: not just for economics But I feel like it's perception because in the 80s there were cars that were just lemons.

431
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:35,380
Speaker 0: you could buy a brand new car And it just sucks already and you can buy a used car that you know.

432
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:38,080
Speaker 0: After a year the car is basically worthless because it was a lemon.

433
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:48,985
Speaker 0: But that doesn't happen anymore as far as I can tell at least I mean my son fire Lasted forever and I traded like crap and as far as I can tell also in fires last forever And then they all have the same problems.

434
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,392
Speaker 0: mine has ten years down the road.

435
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it used car still works.

436
00:26:52,361 --> 00:27:04,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you don't get in an accident or have you know some random breakage or something like that As long as you change the oil and such and maintain it minimally Just about any car is gonna work for quite a while.

437
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:07,968
Speaker 1: and you know I mean like you know a lot of the used cars out there.

438
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:17,983
Speaker 1: right like my grandma right she leases like you know a Toyota And then she just gives it back and gets a new one whenever cuz it just exists a constant cost for her It doesn't change.

439
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:22,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she's like why not just go put back the lease and get the newer one?

440
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,400
Speaker 1: I can always have the the great that I can always be driving a new one.

441
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,180
Speaker 0: I'm still kind of looking at leasing because you know I used to drive a lot.

442
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,743
Speaker 0: I used to put.

443
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:35,960
Speaker 1: yeah, if you don't mind paying the same price forever That's a great option because you always get the pleasure of a brand new car.

444
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:36,964
Speaker 0: I used to all.

445
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:43,132
Speaker 0: I used to put 50 to 70 thousand miles on my car every year Like I used to drive a lot.

446
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:44,178
Speaker 1: now you drive a lot less.

447
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,970
Speaker 0: now I put maybe nine thousand.

448
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:54,626
Speaker 1: my first year of ownership when I worked in the middle of nowhere I put like a bajillion miles on the car like 30,000. since then I've put like 10 like now.

449
00:27:54,686 --> 00:28:03,460
Speaker 0: the majority of the miles I put on my car this year were driving up to Hunter Mountain skiing Yep, that was more than my joy to my miles like driving to Connecticut and conventions.

450
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,175
Speaker 0: That's it yep, and those are all like you know trips, and we don't drive to Seattle.

451
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,239
Speaker 0: so nope.

452
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,740
Speaker 0: But yeah, I was thinking about that.

453
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,584
Speaker 0: Just why does the lease?

454
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:15,462
Speaker 0: and every two years I get a brand new car and I pay like 300 bucks a month for the Rest of my life.

455
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:16,627
Speaker 1: right, but think about this right?

456
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:24,580
Speaker 1: those cars that my grandma leases gives back and leases a new one Those are used cars now that one-year-old two-year-old car that my grandma drove.

457
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:28,399
Speaker 1: You can just lease you can buy that guy and it's way cheap.

458
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,388
Speaker 1: My grandma drove it for two years.

459
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:31,990
Speaker 1: It's perfect.

460
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:42,000
Speaker 0: the point of all this is that I Feel like there's going to be an even bigger day of reckoning for the car industry of the world And I think it's going to be precipitated by the Tata Nano.

461
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:47,520
Speaker 0: Okay, you know about the Tata Nano cuz this was rumored like five years ago.

462
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,135
Speaker 0: I remember Todd sighs like a Jessica character if people were talking about how.

463
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:58,455
Speaker 0: yeah, India There's this company working on like a hundred dollar car And it was China was working on like a $2,000 China, India.

464
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,387
Speaker 0: but there were a lot of rumors about.

465
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:14,210
Speaker 0: you know China or India or a nation like that is going to make like a Couple hundred dollar car, and it'll just go just barely and it's so cheap that you can just buy ten and it's finally come to fruition.

466
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:21,896
Speaker 0: the Tata Nano is Twenty five hundred dollars and is a perfectly street-legal car.

467
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:23,280
Speaker 1: and it in the United States?

468
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,280
Speaker 0: Well in India to start okay, but it looks like it's going to be made available in Britain.

469
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,384
Speaker 1: Is that four wheels?

470
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:30,529
Speaker 0: it is a real?

471
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,420
Speaker 0: How big is it for its five seats?

472
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,369
Speaker 1: Also, it's a size of a sedan.

473
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:37,474
Speaker 0: It is a real car.

474
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:38,499
Speaker 1: It's a four-door car.

475
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:42,214
Speaker 0: Well, yes, it's a. it's the size of a European sedan.

476
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:46,150
Speaker 1: Okay, that's not American But it's a. it's a four-door as four doors.

477
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:46,652
Speaker 0: Yes.

478
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:47,736
Speaker 0: It is a real car.

479
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:48,660
Speaker 1: Is it front-wheel drive?

480
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,962
Speaker 1: Yes, is it?

481
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:50,945
Speaker 1: how big is them?

482
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:51,828
Speaker 1: What's the biggest?

483
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:52,931
Speaker 1: All right, here's the thing.

484
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:57,987
Speaker 0: It's got a 624 cc two Cylinder 33 horsepower engine.

485
00:29:58,749 --> 00:29:59,973
Speaker 1: so it's a motorcycle engine.

486
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,480
Speaker 0: Here's the thing it weighs so little.

487
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,740
Speaker 0: It still goes 0 to 65 in like 17 seconds even with five fat people.

488
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,672
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is fat people won't fit in this car.

489
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,720
Speaker 0: It's made for India and then eventually Britain.

490
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:15,760
Speaker 0: Of course Britain is actually fatter than that.

491
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:20,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess if you had, you know light people that would they would work right.

492
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:23,060
Speaker 0: but but even that for city driving air conditioning.

493
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:27,463
Speaker 0: But here's the deal.

494
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:30,010
Speaker 0: it is a car that goes.

495
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:31,674
Speaker 0: it actually goes.

496
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,760
Speaker 0: it looks like it's reliable enough.

497
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,467
Speaker 0: It looks more reliable than you go.

498
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,100
Speaker 1: Well, it's real easy to fix - it's like a motorcycle, right?

499
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,068
Speaker 1: It's got a tiny little engine you could cut.

500
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,837
Speaker 1: the engine explodes big deal.

501
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:42,580
Speaker 1: It's a two-cylinder.

502
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,669
Speaker 1: I'll just get another one off this like Harley that's.

503
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:56,716
Speaker 1: it averages 60 miles per gallon And plus this would actually be a great car to buy like a high school kid because he's probably just gonna drive himself in it Right or yeah, and they get totally modded it to hell because it's so simple.

504
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:03,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, but The fact that they can make a car that goes just fine for 2,500 bucks retail.

505
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,173
Speaker 1: And yeah good car to send to like Cuba.

506
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:13,874
Speaker 0: and yet in America We make a new model of every single 10 to $40,000 car every single year.

507
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:16,160
Speaker 0: and now people can't afford to buy those cars.

508
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:22,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really just you know, the fact that cars last so long You know, they just we don't need new ones.

509
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,320
Speaker 1: We have enough cars for everyone.

510
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,008
Speaker 1: We can just use all the cars we have.

511
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:34,128
Speaker 1: and until you know until the point at which Someone wants a car and the car they want is not available Then we're not gonna need any more new cars.

512
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:46,267
Speaker 1: until then and looking at how many cars are sitting on boats Sitting on docks, you know sitting in factories We just don't need anyone to make new ones until the ones we have break, you know That's it's sorry.

513
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:47,960
Speaker 1: That's like the reverse razor blade model.

514
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 1: I imagine if Gillette made razors that lasted for five years will eventually every dude would have one.

515
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:54,205
Speaker 1: Well, you know.

516
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:55,479
Speaker 1: and then what is Gillette supposed to do?

517
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:04,597
Speaker 0: everyone's got actually a famous old parable about that the the Candle maker who was such an amazing candle maker that he invented a candle that never burned out.

518
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:07,127
Speaker 1: Whoa He's all the candle everyone.

519
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:08,052
Speaker 1: and then he was out of business.

520
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:09,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the parable.

521
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,854
Speaker 1: Yeah So what do we do about that?

522
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:12,460
Speaker 0: That's what we do.

523
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:26,131
Speaker 1: It's best for the world if the candle maker makes that candle but in a capitalist Society right with with free enterprise no one would ever make that candle and do what's best for everyone.

524
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:31,069
Speaker 1: and make that awesome candle the car that lasts forever because They wouldn't be able to make any more money.

525
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:42,160
Speaker 0: The real issue here is that America's economy in particular in a lot of places Really relies upon this inefficient, you know make new cars constantly model assuming that people will buy them.

526
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,769
Speaker 0: And now that people aren't buying them and now that people are buying foreign cars, too It all comes together.

527
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:49,420
Speaker 0: and well, he's too many cars.

528
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,786
Speaker 1: So here's one solution.

529
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:53,520
Speaker 1: right would be to set up the system such that right.

530
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:57,831
Speaker 1: Let's say I invented the candle to last forever or the car that never broke, right.

531
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 1: if the system if I'm able through You know to receive enough compensation for that to live a life of luxury until I die, you know Then that sort of works.

532
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:12,980
Speaker 1: I have the incentive to make that right because it's even though I'll sell one to everyone to be done I'm fine.

533
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,740
Speaker 1: Well Scott the problem is is a lot of people and there are not enough things for everyone to do?

534
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:25,890
Speaker 0: Well, no the the much more pressing issues that in the real world forget the stupid candle maker Industry and the economy rely on there.

535
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:31,372
Speaker 0: if we don't make these cars constantly What are all the people who work in the car fast and I'm saying do?

536
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:33,380
Speaker 1: all the people in my candle factory are fucked.

537
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:50,637
Speaker 0: I Don't know what to do about it But I feel like the economy kind of bringing this day of reckoning onto the car industry plus the fact that the super cheap car Actually came to fruition and is eventually very likely going to spread into the u.s I don't know what's gonna happen.

538
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,200
Speaker 1: I Can see you know that fundamental question we keep asking and never getting answered.

539
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,270
Speaker 1: You know that can only be answered by the invention of the replicator.

540
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:08,260
Speaker 1: or you know diamond age type technology I think is actually starting to have a real effect on the real world in everyday life.

541
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,340
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, what do you do when the only reason we have an economy?

542
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:24,600
Speaker 0: the only reason we have almost every problem in the world is because there's there are scarce resources and We have to decide how to distribute those scarce resources and at the same time There's an amount of work that needs to be done to get those resources.

543
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:26,293
Speaker 0: so how do we distribute the work?

544
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:37,639
Speaker 0: and Technology has gotten us to the point where it takes so little work on Average to get most of these resources that there's not enough work for every person to do.

545
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:42,460
Speaker 0: But we base our distribution mechanism on how much work people do and there's nothing out.

546
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,188
Speaker 1: What else can people do get?

547
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,260
Speaker 1: deserve the resources other than work?

548
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:52,620
Speaker 0: We base our system on either how much work you do or how much work the person who then gives you all of their money.

549
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:56,820
Speaker 0: But that's a whole different problem, so yeah, I don't know.

550
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:07,069
Speaker 0: I mean This is basically we're slowly coming across something that is on the same scale as the Industrial Revolution and that caused decades upon decades of massive social upheaval.

551
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:09,182
Speaker 1: I Don't have a job.

552
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,789
Speaker 1: I'm ready to a peeve again.

553
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,311
Speaker 0: I'll peeve.

554
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,937
Speaker 1: I can a peeve at any time.

555
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,807
Speaker 1: Call me Scott available for a peeving.

556
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,253
Speaker 0: Is this gonna be the end of your streak?

557
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:18,539
Speaker 1: What do you mean my streak?

558
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,824
Speaker 0: Heaved in many more in many moods.

559
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:23,607
Speaker 1: No, there was a I have peeved.

560
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,030
Speaker 1: there was the show about it.

561
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,406
Speaker 1: It was two years ago.

562
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,256
Speaker 0: I think I listened to that again when I was going through the archives.

563
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:44,296
Speaker 0: Oh, okay Yeah, so anyway things of the day I'm a fan of the beers and I actually love beers or dead beers.

564
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:49,520
Speaker 0: the beers, you know Dog bears up bears the bears the bears the drinking kind not the wearing kind.

565
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,328
Speaker 0: Yes, not the wearing kind and not the.

566
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:52,454
Speaker 0: you can't be a kind.

567
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:58,972
Speaker 0: Okay, but I didn't know much about India pale ale other than that.

568
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:01,800
Speaker 0: I see it all the time and then I found this article.

569
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:09,294
Speaker 0: I know there is a such a beverage as pale ale talking about some company Who is trying to recreate what India pale ale used to really taste like I?

570
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,222
Speaker 1: Should start.

571
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:14,560
Speaker 1: you know what I should do it all this computer work my new company.

572
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,988
Speaker 1: I'm gonna recreate the gross me hell banana.

573
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,972
Speaker 0: The gross me hell.

574
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:20,360
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to botany school.

575
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:31,090
Speaker 0: But anyway, actually I've got this crazy idea because I'm looking at houses And that bar down the streets for sale and it's got like a house apartment connected to it And I don't think it's that expensive.

576
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,839
Speaker 0: I asked, you know to check it out how much it is.

577
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:38,459
Speaker 0: I have this vague idea of buying it moving into it telling Pete to quit his job.

578
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:52,259
Speaker 0: Helen would come down here paying for his food and all he has to do is cook for me and brew beer and if he Succeeds, I'll open a brew pub and if he fails I will never open the bar and I will just have my own private bar.

579
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,764
Speaker 1: Let's do me a favor.

580
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:59,000
Speaker 1: Don't don't move anywhere until I have some incomes because I can't afford to stay here alone.

581
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,591
Speaker 0: Well, if I buy a house, I guess you could pay me rent.

582
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,262
Speaker 0: I Guess I could.

583
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,552
Speaker 0: I could loan you if you can pay me back on Tuesday.

584
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:16,080
Speaker 1: I can pay you back When I get money anyway, and if I can't pay you back I'll run away to Detroit or something.

585
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:39,682
Speaker 0: So beer was on the mind and apparently the from what I can gather from this article India pale ale was made the way it was so that it would survive the horrible horrible ship journey to India And as a result it had a very distinct flavor partly because the barrels were treated like crap and it got hot and cold and hot and cold and they get washed overboard and Stuff would see.

586
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,877
Speaker 1: so they just making some pale ale and then putting out a boat sailing around and bringing it back.

587
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:47,912
Speaker 1: Yes They're doing that's awesome.

588
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:49,120
Speaker 0: now, I find this awesome.

589
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,934
Speaker 0: However, I was like, huh?

590
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:55,780
Speaker 0: This interesting So I think is something is based on the assumptions from the article.

591
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:58,392
Speaker 0: I went to Wikipedia and I was like Wikipedia.

592
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:02,425
Speaker 0: Tell me about India pale ale and The facts between these.

593
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:05,875
Speaker 0: this article and that article don't line up and I have no idea.

594
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:07,360
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know.

595
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,324
Speaker 1: Here's here's the goal.

596
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:10,676
Speaker 1: only quite the first question that came to my mind, right?

597
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:11,340
Speaker 1: Is that okay?

598
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:17,740
Speaker 1: In the olden days, right if the India pale ale was meant to last the trip to India from say Europe, right?

599
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:25,260
Speaker 1: Then if they want to take it on a boat and bring it back are they gonna go halfway to India and come back?

600
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,127
Speaker 0: Yes, they're not going they're not taking?

601
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:29,639
Speaker 1: or are they gonna make it in India and then bring it up?

602
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,196
Speaker 0: I thought the article talks about that.

603
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:36,609
Speaker 1: actually Okay, how long it's gonna be out there, but they said I mean to be really genuine You'd have to have the drinkers on the boat.

604
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:37,494
Speaker 1: It wouldn't go else.

605
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:38,237
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be the same.

606
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,044
Speaker 0: Well Genuine is a fine line.

607
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:44,151
Speaker 0: I would say this would be an interesting experience.

608
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,256
Speaker 1: It's like manga that reads in the wrong direction.

609
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:47,921
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

610
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:55,057
Speaker 0: I just I like the idea of making things the old way just to see what they were like Even though the old way is often not better

611
00:38:55,278 --> 00:39:00,149
Speaker 1: or at least approximating it or at least You know possibly being closer to the way it was like

612
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:04,020
Speaker 0: that time when I made grog and you discovered that grog tastes terrible.

613
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:06,427
Speaker 1: Well rum tastes terrible.

614
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:07,612
Speaker 0: rum is delicious.

615
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:09,660
Speaker 0: it tastes like it's terrible tastes like cough medicine.

616
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:11,464
Speaker 1: It's all.

617
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:14,120
Speaker 1: alcohol tastes either like cough medicine or rubbing alcohol.

618
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:16,266
Speaker 0: You've never had good alcohol.

619
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, oh you have a low tolerance for it, but I thought this was neat.

620
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:22,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like India pale ale that much to be honest.

621
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,221
Speaker 0: I'm.

622
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:23,868
Speaker 0: I'm more of a like.

623
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,660
Speaker 0: I like Karen like Japanese pills nurse.

624
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:31,480
Speaker 1: I wouldn't know if I liked it or not, but I bet it tastes like either cough medicine or rubbing alcohol.

625
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:37,605
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so um, I Talked about the thing of the day.

626
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:45,208
Speaker 1: I think a week or so a while ago about love which is a game Building engine with the Lua language.

627
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,189
Speaker 1: There's apparently someone out there making a game called love Which is nothing to do with the game engine called love.

628
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:52,714
Speaker 1: So this is completely different, right?

629
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:59,147
Speaker 1: But it is also called love and It's some sort of like Water is poison has been hyping it up to me.

630
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:08,759
Speaker 1: And while I'm very skeptical of it as I am skeptical skeptical of everything There is some interesting stuff going on here is making some sort of like MMO FPS.

631
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:18,539
Speaker 1: It's very freeform and allows you to do all sorts of crazy stuff But like 200 people per server and sort of introversion style graphics anything.

632
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:23,854
Speaker 0: What bothers me about games like world of worker all these like MMO is what people play.

633
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:28,780
Speaker 1: even if this is just this could is Probably just gonna have the same fundamental flaws as other MMOs.

634
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:36,679
Speaker 1: But some way if they at least they're trying if they try to make it massive because the in the end, you know I'll complain about it doesn't look like they're trying to make it massive.

635
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,840
Speaker 1: It looks like they're just trying to make something that's a little bit more than counter-strike, but is actually that's massive?

636
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,211
Speaker 0: Cuz that's what I'm thinking about.

637
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:52,560
Speaker 0: I Complain about grind and all these other things But really what bothers me about MMOs is that the idea originally was that you can have multiplayer games.

638
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,219
Speaker 0: You know four people or eight people gaga in a deathmatch.

639
00:40:55,653 --> 00:41:11,470
Speaker 0: Yeah but the MMO was like what if we made a game that has like a hundred people all at the same time and MMOs started going in that direction and then for various very good and very bad reasons Became so parallel that they're not really massive.

640
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:11,590
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,960
Speaker 1: I mean when you play counter-strike or tribes, let's use tribes, right?

642
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,726
Speaker 1: There's 60 people on the tribe server.

643
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,378
Speaker 1: You're interacting directly with every one of those other 59 people there.

644
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,377
Speaker 1: That's like, you know, well the same way you're interacting with one other person.

645
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,184
Speaker 0: you're playing chess Even if not directly.

646
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:32,530
Speaker 0: you're indirectly in the context of the same stateful world having an effect that could be seen by the other people Right, but just they don't make.

647
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:41,531
Speaker 1: in an MMO like wow there's a whole bunch of other people's avatars around and you can look at them right, but You're very very few of the people.

648
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:43,219
Speaker 1: Are you ever actually directly?

649
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,354
Speaker 1: Connected with in that way like we go into PvP and like a battleground whatever?

650
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:51,740
Speaker 1: only the people in that battleground Are you connected to not the thousands of people on the server?

651
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,001
Speaker 0: Well, very simply the difference is that most MMOs became very parallel very quickly and as a result They're still.

652
00:41:58,022 --> 00:41:59,426
Speaker 0: you know, they're big games, but they're not.

653
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:03,480
Speaker 0: I almost wouldn't want to call them massive games because they're not quite there.

654
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,299
Speaker 0: They're more like a giant ready room and a giant exploratory room.

655
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then separate from that this massively parallelized game that people play.

656
00:42:10,346 --> 00:42:11,748
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but this I don't know.

657
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:15,030
Speaker 0: this could do something cool Mm-hmm.

658
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:26,621
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this love game seems to have some potential and the person who's making it I think his name is Eskil Steenburg Has some interesting things to say and people who don't realize this.

659
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:32,143
Speaker 1: the game developers conference is like now tomorrow ish by the time you're hearing this is probably now.

660
00:42:32,223 --> 00:42:38,270
Speaker 1: ish, right and This guy is gonna give a talk at the game developers conference Tuesday at 4 45.

661
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,017
Speaker 1: So it's I guess for mo.

662
00:42:40,057 --> 00:43:02,410
Speaker 1: if you're listening to this on the Tuesday, March 24th 2009 that would be tip, you know today at 4 45 in room 304 He's given a talk and he put basically a longer version of his talk in text with pictures on his little blog here so you can read it and He says a lot of interesting things about game development.

663
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:18,729
Speaker 1: But the one thing he's saying That I have noticed has been true in all development of software recently is his emphasis on making tools right and I have noticed this trend for like a few months now and I really think that that there is something going on here, right.

664
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,058
Speaker 1: and Basically, what's happening is look at Twitter right.

665
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:26,126
Speaker 1: Twitter was a feature for Odeo.

666
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,430
Speaker 1: That's where it started out, right?

667
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:33,668
Speaker 1: It was a tool for Odeo that that Odeo people made right and then they gave up on Odeo And Twitter became the real thing.

668
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:37,304
Speaker 1: Django the Python web framework that I'm using it is awesome.

669
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:38,830
Speaker 1: Was it just a tool?

670
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,292
Speaker 1: It was just.

671
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:47,090
Speaker 1: you know, the guys at the Kansas City whatever newspaper it was Made this thing that they would build the Kansas City newspaper website on top of it.

672
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:54,510
Speaker 1: And then it you know was a tool that went on its own and became this bigger thing Ruby on Rails that 37 signals company.

673
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,982
Speaker 1: I think that was that though.

674
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:56,970
Speaker 1: I think that's the right company.

675
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:58,376
Speaker 1: well, it was just that right.

676
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:11,050
Speaker 0: and you see this trend in science and technology forever where You have a lofty goal But you have these very real-world Concerns in the way of that lofty goal and you want to solve them efficiently and quickly to get onto your lofty goal.

677
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:13,060
Speaker 0: And as a result, you're gonna make all these awesome tools.

678
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:14,949
Speaker 1: and some people buy tools.

679
00:44:15,332 --> 00:44:23,997
Speaker 1: Some people just do it without good tools and they just get it done Crappily get her done and some people out there actually are nowadays Making.

680
00:44:24,219 --> 00:44:33,148
Speaker 1: when they have something to do They make the perfect tool for the job and then that makes the doing of the actual thing they actually wanted to do real easy and wonderful.

681
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:46,565
Speaker 1: and The thing is those the tools themselves can often grow and be so awesome that you know, in fact Those are outgrow the thing that you know are more successful than the actual thing you made.

682
00:44:46,585 --> 00:45:03,610
Speaker 1: and he's talking about how like, you know if you do make tools, you should release them publicly because that will force you to maintain them to Give them features that you wouldn't have thought they needed, you know Other people will use them and you'll have all these people out there using your tools for their own purposes.

683
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,829
Speaker 1: so now there's all this talent out there that you can hire to work on your own stuff because they already know your tools.

684
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:27,430
Speaker 1: and I think there's gonna be a big emphasis on tools and especially as the line blurs more and more between you know You know tools, you know being things that make you know that right now We sort of view it as a tool is something you use to make something that someone consumes, right?

685
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:50,270
Speaker 1: But we're reaching the point where the things we consume our tools and we use tools to make them and I think there's really gonna be a huge blurring and and eventually no distinction whatsoever between a tool and it's been like a thing you consume You know, you're making will be Consuming very much, you know, you'll get all like the user generated content, right?

686
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:54,550
Speaker 1: Or I mean when you play rock band, you're also making a performance.

687
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:59,145
Speaker 1: Not only is it a tool of consuming the music it's also a you know.

688
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,730
Speaker 0: granted it's all degrees.

689
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:15,195
Speaker 1: I know it is definitely degree because I know people were thinking now it's not for There are definitely degrees to it But it's going to blur more and more as time goes on, you know little big planets and you know They know when you think about it.

690
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:19,130
Speaker 1: It's gonna blur in the other direction to Photoshop is gonna become more and more.

691
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:22,666
Speaker 1: You know a you know thing for people to entertain themselves.

692
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:23,430
Speaker 0: when you think about it.

693
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:36,150
Speaker 0: it's a lot like the efforts for heat reclamation in engineering where Humans as in the course of entertaining themselves will more and more create things as byproducts of their own entertainment.

694
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,890
Speaker 0: Like I think this is much broader social implications.

695
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,729
Speaker 1: I mean even watching a movie you're forming an opinion which is itself a work.

696
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:49,758
Speaker 0: if you Tools like the internet where by watching a movie you then blog about it You've now created a separate work.

697
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:50,703
Speaker 0: then someone else.

698
00:46:50,783 --> 00:46:56,101
Speaker 0: I don't know makes a techno Comments on it blog post and that techno remix turns into.

699
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:59,330
Speaker 1: so, you know, he's talking about making tools.

700
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,844
Speaker 1: I really think this is something that you really have to think about.

701
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:12,317
Speaker 1: if you're making something, you know even if it's not technology if it's a if it's an arts and crafts or an art or or whatever right and There's a tool you need.

702
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:15,209
Speaker 1: right, you know, I mean, where did the hammer come from?

703
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:15,510
Speaker 1: Right?

704
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:17,599
Speaker 1: It was they didn't make the hammer and the nail.

705
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:18,081
Speaker 1: first.

706
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:21,590
Speaker 1: some guy needed to like, you know Hold something up on the wall.

707
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:31,614
Speaker 1: So he made the nail and then he needed to get the nail in the wall and then he made the hammer And then everyone else said oh man, look at that hammer I'll let that one go.

708
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:32,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can let it go.

709
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,470
Speaker 1: But you see the tool comes after the job, right?

710
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:45,869
Speaker 1: so when you're doing something whatever you're doing if you need a tool for it that doesn't exist or there isn't a perfect tool in Existence make that tool and share that tool.

711
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:51,490
Speaker 1: That is the best thing you could possibly do to like have a very high chance of success.

712
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,570
Speaker 0: Here's a better piece of advice.

713
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:58,770
Speaker 0: If you are the kind of person who is funding other people doing things like you're a venture capitalist or whatever.

714
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:03,347
Speaker 0: find someone with a lofty goal set them on that goal and offer to fund them.

715
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:06,990
Speaker 0: but Take the rights to all the tools they make along the way.

716
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean look and that's where the real money will be and then let them have their project.

717
00:48:10,872 --> 00:48:13,464
Speaker 1: This is to make sure that they're making tools, right?

718
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:14,549
Speaker 1: I mean look at valve, right?

719
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:22,569
Speaker 1: Sure They make half-life 2. in the course of being half-life 2 they made the source engine Which is been much more valuable than half-life 2 itself, you know.

720
00:48:23,492 --> 00:48:24,676
Speaker 1: So that's that's the way to go.

721
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:36,464
Speaker 0: So in when I was in high school, I'm gonna call him you know, I don't want to use his real name because He might be out there somewhere if he didn't die already, but I had a friend in high school.

722
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:39,615
Speaker 0: We'll call him Donnie don't and Do it.

723
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:41,768
Speaker 0: don't do this Donnie don't does.

724
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:47,296
Speaker 0: and One anecdote about Donnie don'ts I remember hanging around in the camp.

725
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:53,334
Speaker 0: well in the physics lab of high school and we're there we're doing some sort of physics II thing But this is our guy.

726
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:54,397
Speaker 0: This is our guy.

727
00:48:54,517 --> 00:49:00,494
Speaker 0: Okay, so we needed we needed a bunch of really high molar hydrochloric acid To do what we were doing.

728
00:49:01,016 --> 00:49:12,539
Speaker 0: So we had a few hood and under it we had very very very concentrated hydrochloric acid Mmm and the physics professor walks out and says, all right now when you're all taking your sample Keep it away from your face.

729
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,342
Speaker 0: Whatever you do.

730
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:22,119
Speaker 1: Don't inhale the vapors Because not even if you waft it because you'll probably pass out not even if you left won't be good for you Wafting is no good.

731
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,269
Speaker 0: No one asked about wafting.

732
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,679
Speaker 0: Okay, and as he says you'll probably pass out.

733
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,330
Speaker 0: Donnie don't says really and proceeds to pass out.

734
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:32,199
Speaker 1: Did he drop the beaker on the ground?

735
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:32,822
Speaker 0: Yes.

736
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:33,967
Speaker 0: It was a tiny beaker.

737
00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:38,370
Speaker 1: Okay I was like if you're holding a beaker you sniff it and then you drop it can land on your foot.

738
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:40,638
Speaker 1: Yeah passed out and acid is burning your foot.

739
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:46,679
Speaker 0: Well, I did one spill an entire jar of Somewhat weak hydrochloric acid all over my pants.

740
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:47,963
Speaker 1: Did it burn?

741
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,689
Speaker 0: Not really because it was the shower.

742
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:53,049
Speaker 0: No, I just took my pants off with your legs wet.

743
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:54,773
Speaker 0: There were a little wet.

744
00:49:54,813 --> 00:49:59,306
Speaker 0: then I wiped them off with paper towels and then the professor while the teacher said rim.

745
00:49:59,768 --> 00:50:00,510
Speaker 0: Where are your pants?

746
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:03,376
Speaker 1: What did you do the rest of the day?

747
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:04,520
Speaker 1: didn't have another pant at work.

748
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:05,926
Speaker 0: actually I did.

749
00:50:06,227 --> 00:50:07,090
Speaker 1: you had another pant.

750
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,174
Speaker 0: I was in marching band.

751
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:11,890
Speaker 0: I had like a whole locker full of clothes you put on marching band pants?

752
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:14,510
Speaker 0: No, I had like a pair of jeans in my band locker.

753
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:18,031
Speaker 1: I see you walk down to the band room with no pants on Me.

754
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:22,405
Speaker 0: being in boxers was not an uncommon occurrence in high school in the hallway at high school.

755
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:28,234
Speaker 1: I Mean in the house, I understand in the high school in the hallway The.

756
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:33,736
Speaker 0: I feel like this is turning into an anecdote for a different show perhaps But I don't know.

757
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:39,038
Speaker 0: chemistry had some of my fondest memories in high school Even though I never actually took a chemistry class.

758
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,690
Speaker 1: really you never took a chemistry class not in high school.

759
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:46,810
Speaker 0: Well, I actually I took chemistry at the local community college and I skipped it in high school so I could take physics instead.

760
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,043
Speaker 1: Well, I took chemistry in high school.

761
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:50,987
Speaker 1: It's a goddess.

762
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:53,783
Speaker 1: chemistry in high school Teacher was a funny guy.

763
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,702
Speaker 1: There's quite a you know, he's a. he was a very.

764
00:50:57,742 --> 00:50:59,190
Speaker 1: he was one of the teachers that character.

765
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,299
Speaker 0: There's something about the high school chemistry teacher who is.

766
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:02,800
Speaker 0: you can tell.

767
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:06,994
Speaker 0: they can tell which kids are smart enough to be given dangerous Stuff to play with.

768
00:51:07,677 --> 00:51:08,783
Speaker 0: they can always tell.

769
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:18,158
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember when one day I'm not gonna use any names a certain chemistry teacher was like, all right you kids in the AP physics class I found this and I think you'll enjoy it.

770
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:22,582
Speaker 0: and he handed us a box and in the box was a cube of wax and Inside of the wax was lithium.

771
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:25,429
Speaker 0: Oh We had some fun with that.

772
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:28,484
Speaker 1: No, but that man the high school chemistry teacher.

773
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:39,330
Speaker 1: I remember him now, man he had this toupee and he made everyone call him godfather and He he would always give you the lab right and then he would teach you the chemistry afterwards.

774
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:46,142
Speaker 1: So it's like you do this lab and he would have all these questions like, you know do this math You know how much was there and this?

775
00:51:46,222 --> 00:51:47,730
Speaker 1: and it's like you didn't know how to do that.

776
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,493
Speaker 1: You didn't know and taught it to you wasn't any book Right?

777
00:51:50,714 --> 00:51:54,850
Speaker 1: and then after he did the lab and he graded it then he would teach you what you needed to know for the lab.

778
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:56,419
Speaker 1: That was the thing.

779
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,970
Speaker 0: That's probably a good way to go about it Because if you if you know what's supposed to happen lab.

780
00:52:01,212 --> 00:52:09,800
Speaker 1: He was also famous for yelling at the class like yeah But like you'd be like an angry tirade kind of yell and everyone be quiet and like oh shit He didn't throw the erasers did he?

781
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,905
Speaker 0: that's more of the physics teacher.

782
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:11,850
Speaker 1: No, he didn't throw anything.

783
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,410
Speaker 1: He would just yell and get all pissed off like a you know, whatever?

784
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:24,450
Speaker 1: Yeah No, but actually all the awesome, you know in high school there was good chemistry going on, you know Some you know bunsen burners and whatnot.

785
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:30,690
Speaker 1: But it was in summer camp actually that the most awesome chemistry happened because I went to a science nerdy summer camp.

786
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,191
Speaker 0: Well, isn't?

787
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:33,258
Speaker 0: it isn't summer camp pretty much the.

788
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,444
Speaker 0: I've got some sodium and there's a lake.

789
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:37,230
Speaker 1: that's pretty much what it was.

790
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:40,081
Speaker 1: I remember three things specifically what that we did.

791
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:40,824
Speaker 1: one of them.

792
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:41,305
Speaker 1: I don't know.

793
00:52:41,446 --> 00:52:43,557
Speaker 1: I can't remember the science I just remember what we did.

794
00:52:44,302 --> 00:52:45,590
Speaker 1: No, I remember four things, right?

795
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,238
Speaker 1: So you're the fourth awesome chemistry things at summer camp, right?

796
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,422
Speaker 1: Awesome thing.

797
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:50,084
Speaker 1: Number one.

798
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:51,950
Speaker 1: They mix some chemicals together.

799
00:52:51,950 --> 00:53:01,531
Speaker 1: I have no clue what they were nowadays, but it's like it started off as like a small pile of powder Right and they would pour something on to it or add something else to it I forget.

800
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:06,950
Speaker 1: and then it was sort of like sputter like a volcano and I think it changed like yellow to green.

801
00:53:07,052 --> 00:53:11,583
Speaker 1: I think was the colors I don't remember but changed color and it would erupt and erupt and erupt and erupt.

802
00:53:11,945 --> 00:53:15,519
Speaker 1: and it would just be like this pile of Powder would grow and grow and grow and grow.

803
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:24,454
Speaker 1: and it started off like this little tiny pile you know and it grew to like be like really tall compared to what it started out as and I have no idea what the hell it was.

804
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,029
Speaker 1: but it's really really impressive.

805
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:31,267
Speaker 1: and You know if you put that like in a jar or something you could probably freak someone out big time.

806
00:53:31,328 --> 00:53:33,380
Speaker 1: as you know It looks like a little powder in a jar.

807
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,789
Speaker 1: It's something the jar is full of shit.

808
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,630
Speaker 1: We threw sodium in a lake good times.

809
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:42,410
Speaker 1: We had like this big jar full of oil in the middle of the jar.

810
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:50,110
Speaker 1: Oil was like a block of sodium and they would take it out and they would slice You know chunks off of it and toss it in the lake and go boom.

811
00:53:50,991 --> 00:53:51,634
Speaker 1: And we joked.

812
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:54,405
Speaker 1: we thought we would put it in someone's toilet, you know in the upper deck.

813
00:53:54,626 --> 00:53:57,930
Speaker 0: No one ever did though It was a rumor going around.

814
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:03,625
Speaker 1: I Thought about it and I looked in the upper deck of the cabin toilet.

815
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:04,970
Speaker 0: was it already upper deck?

816
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,908
Speaker 1: It was solid black in there.

817
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:16,054
Speaker 0: So I was like Dan's worse than the free like it's upper decked by course of nature as opposed to by mischievous child.

818
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:17,759
Speaker 1: so I looked and I was like, huh?

819
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,949
Speaker 1: Wow, we really did put sodium in the toilet and the toilet exploded.

820
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:24,439
Speaker 1: and Basically the top of the toilet is completely black.

821
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:26,606
Speaker 1: That would be something mighty fee.

822
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:38,910
Speaker 0: I would be so fierce So fierce, um, well, I remember the the most trouble I ever got into was it because you know I never took chemistry in in high school or middle school because I took it all the local community college.

823
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:44,993
Speaker 0: but I did a lot of chemistry in the course of science Olympiad and most of it was Barely supervised.

824
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:51,352
Speaker 0: but I remember specifically we had to make this like Rube Goldberg machine for science Olympiad and all the use the chemical Energy.

825
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:51,552
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:54:51,693 --> 00:54:56,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we had like you got points for converted like going from one kind of energy to another kind.

827
00:54:56,711 --> 00:55:06,887
Speaker 0: So we wanted to have a thing where we had a clear liquid and a laser going through it and then the liquid becomes Opaque due to a chemical reaction as opposed to a physical reaction, you know blocking the laser.

828
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:17,730
Speaker 0: and then something happens and we came up with all these ideas that we're all technically physical reactions like Dilute something in the water and then the turbidity increases and then the laser doesn't get through and you just get food coloring or some shit.

829
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,940
Speaker 0: But that's a physical reaction.

830
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,934
Speaker 0: That's not a chemical reaction We could use.

831
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:24,728
Speaker 1: you could use an acid and then you could use like phenolphthalein solutions.

832
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:27,544
Speaker 0: now We see we were debating and we tried all these things.

833
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:32,830
Speaker 0: They were either too dangerous They didn't work or they weren't good enough or they like iodine.

834
00:55:33,512 --> 00:55:34,978
Speaker 0: But that wouldn't be a physical reaction.

835
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:35,981
Speaker 1: start with star.

836
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,249
Speaker 1: you put some starch in the water and you drop some iodine in there.

837
00:55:38,932 --> 00:55:43,069
Speaker 0: But it it because the water part is not intrinsic to it.

838
00:55:44,711 --> 00:55:58,498
Speaker 0: No, but the starch part is yeah, but then they would probably argue and other people tried similar things They would argue at the event that the turbidity or the opaqueness was caused primarily by the physical reaction as opposed to by Specifically a chemical reaction.

839
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:01,330
Speaker 1: if you didn't put the starch in there though wouldn't it turned as nearly as dark?

840
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,798
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you put the iodine in it might have turned dark enough.

841
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:06,127
Speaker 0: Anyway, they were real sticklers.

842
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:21,130
Speaker 0: So We're working on this and debating and then finally I'm just like poking through and I find the 11th grade chemistry textbook lay in there and on the cover Two clear liquids are being poured into each other and they're turning bright opaque yellow.

843
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:23,017
Speaker 1: He sure was just a Photoshop.

844
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:24,764
Speaker 0: So we go to the physics professor.

845
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:26,170
Speaker 0: We were like, what is this reaction?

846
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,835
Speaker 0: He's like fuck if I know.

847
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:34,481
Speaker 0: so he goes over to the chemistry people and they're debating and they're looking at it and they eventually Called the publisher and they found out what it was.

848
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:36,630
Speaker 1: and they're very dangerous chemicals.

849
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:47,130
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what it was, but it was some sort of mercury compound and some sort of Very dangerous chemical and some sort of lead chloride thing makes sense.

850
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:50,000
Speaker 0: So we there and we're like, can we do this?

851
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:53,534
Speaker 0: and they're like, well, it's not for really a school event It's kind of out of school.

852
00:56:53,574 --> 00:56:54,499
Speaker 0: So go nuts there.

853
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:55,865
Speaker 0: Here's the key to the chemistry lab.

854
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:56,709
Speaker 0: Stay away from the lithium.

855
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:07,388
Speaker 0: So we put it together and work perfectly Perfectly until we blew it out because we were stupid and we got disqualified for creating a dangerous situation, but that's another.

856
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:08,010
Speaker 1: that's great.

857
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,115
Speaker 0: That's another story.

858
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:09,377
Speaker 1: Let's see.

859
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:09,778
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

860
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:13,275
Speaker 1: Um, oh actually I remember even more For that summer camp.

861
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:14,340
Speaker 1: They had some urate.

862
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,163
Speaker 1: It wasn't uranium.

863
00:57:15,384 --> 00:57:20,755
Speaker 1: It was uranium something or other Just uranium.

864
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:22,890
Speaker 0: it was all the things you can find uranium in.

865
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:23,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had.

866
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:27,974
Speaker 1: it was you know, it was like, you know, uranium something I'd or something eight, you know one of those.

867
00:57:28,055 --> 00:57:29,224
Speaker 1: it was uranium mix with something.

868
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:33,749
Speaker 1: and They would like, you know, isn't a little lead box or whatever in a jar in a lead box?

869
00:57:34,232 --> 00:57:37,269
Speaker 1: But they would open it up and take the Geiger counter and be like look tick tick tick tick tick.

870
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,984
Speaker 0: We did that actually my mom used to collect and I believe still collects fiesta wear.

871
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:45,580
Speaker 1: Oh, well, that's pretty good That's not as radioactive as this uranium was.

872
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,950
Speaker 0: Well, my mom actually she used to be really into mineral science.

873
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:54,027
Speaker 0: So she actually has this gigantic gigantic collection of samples of almost every mineral.

874
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:56,777
Speaker 0: That is acquireable Little sample.

875
00:57:56,837 --> 00:57:57,663
Speaker 0: some of them are dangerous.

876
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:06,166
Speaker 0: Some of them are radioactive Obviously nothing like plutonium, but she has a fairly pure piece of uranium And a Geiger counter and all this cool stuff.

877
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:12,742
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh So they had you know, we threw cesium in the lake right?

878
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:15,270
Speaker 1: But what they have is you know, that's the sodium.

879
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:19,083
Speaker 0: I was gonna say that's that's quite some fun with the cesium.

880
00:58:19,143 --> 00:58:20,569
Speaker 1: No, they talked about cesium.

881
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:23,450
Speaker 0: You know you look at the periodic table and you're like sodium.

882
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,313
Speaker 0: What's under sodium?

883
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,387
Speaker 0: and you're going down the line and the further down you go the bigger the explosion is.

884
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:29,070
Speaker 0: That's right.

885
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:30,954
Speaker 1: Now they had.

886
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,041
Speaker 1: what they had is they had like all these.

887
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:35,850
Speaker 1: they ordered a jar full of sticks of phosphorus, right?

888
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:42,310
Speaker 1: And for the bonfire, they would put a stick of phosphorus like down low where no one could see and then they would like.

889
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:46,709
Speaker 1: You know, most of the kids didn't take the chemistry, you know, most, you know, very few people did so.

890
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:50,248
Speaker 1: Only the kids took the chemistry knew what the score was.

891
00:58:50,831 --> 00:59:01,010
Speaker 1: they would tell like some Indian legend and they would throw a glass of water on the pile of wood and it would start on Fire and like half the kids would be like, oh shit Brilliant!

892
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,716
Speaker 0: It was pretty brilliant The only course with phosphorus.

893
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:08,348
Speaker 0: Did you ever get to do the thermite reaction in school or the summer camp?

894
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:12,644
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, we made like, you know contact explosive, but it's very weak.

895
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:14,070
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you squeeze it and go.

896
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:15,014
Speaker 0: We're.

897
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:16,770
Speaker 0: sadly we never did anything cool with thermite.

898
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:21,390
Speaker 0: Everyone always talked about what if we took thermite and melted a hole through all the bleachers.

899
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:25,066
Speaker 1: Oh, man, not again the middle of the football field.

900
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:25,870
Speaker 1: Way to get expelled.

901
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:31,970
Speaker 0: But now the most we did was put it in a flower pot and melt through like a sheet of metal, yep, that's about it.

902
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:40,816
Speaker 1: The other thing we did is we would like turn on Bunsen burners and then we just throw like different metals into the fire and watch The color change.

903
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:42,870
Speaker 0: but I did that in the course of Science Olympiad.

904
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:49,411
Speaker 0: Just one of the events was they give you all these like samples of different chemicals and different metals and the event was here is A metal.

905
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:51,519
Speaker 0: there are 20 things with 20 different metals.

906
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,623
Speaker 0: identify them all.

907
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:53,586
Speaker 0: you've got five minutes.

908
00:59:53,847 --> 00:59:54,750
Speaker 0: Here's a jar of acid.

909
00:59:54,931 --> 00:59:55,835
Speaker 0: Here's a Bunsen burner.

910
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:58,728
Speaker 0: Here's like a bunch of pieces from the Mohs scale go nuts.

911
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:00,236
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You just got to figure it out.

912
01:00:00,478 --> 01:00:02,310
Speaker 0: So, you know put some acid in set it on fire.

913
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,850
Speaker 0: I was terrible at that event because I couldn't memorize any of that.

914
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:10,710
Speaker 1: Yeah memorizing was the hard part but it's like you would throw it in into the into the fire and the fire would turn green.

915
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:11,375
Speaker 1: She like aha.

916
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:15,477
Speaker 1: That's the green one, you know, you throw the iron Filings in and it was as far as I would get.

917
01:00:15,538 --> 01:00:19,330
Speaker 0: is that's the green one green one that melts in this acid, right?

918
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,714
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

919
01:00:21,237 --> 01:00:23,770
Speaker 1: We had labels on so we knew it was basically a reverse.

920
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:24,814
Speaker 1: It was like this is iron.

921
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,617
Speaker 1: What does iron do?

922
01:00:25,637 --> 01:00:26,541
Speaker 1: its sparks?

923
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:28,790
Speaker 1: and it was sort of, you know learning about fireworks.

924
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:30,780
Speaker 1: You know cuz that's how fireworks do is you?

925
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,609
Speaker 1: they start a fire and then they have.

926
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,770
Speaker 1: you know They want to make like the white sparkly bits.

927
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:38,465
Speaker 1: They put iron in there if they want to make the green sparkly bits.

928
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:39,730
Speaker 1: They put that other one in there.

929
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,639
Speaker 0: I was curious if you were gonna say which one.

930
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:42,262
Speaker 0: I forget.

931
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:44,070
Speaker 1: I only remember iron.

932
01:00:45,632 --> 01:00:48,950
Speaker 0: The other ones actually some of my favorite parts were making the lab works.

933
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:52,250
Speaker 0: We always got to make our own lab where especially in the local community.

934
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:54,076
Speaker 1: I never made lab where it was always.

935
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,943
Speaker 1: just get it from the shack cuz.

936
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:59,375
Speaker 0: you know in 10th grade instead of taking the lame Oh science in school.

937
01:00:59,415 --> 01:01:06,344
Speaker 0: I went and took stoichiometry and then I was done with that and I went back to the school and they were like That didn't cover everything.

938
01:01:06,364 --> 01:01:06,970
Speaker 0: So I'm like damn it.

939
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,729
Speaker 0: So I went back and took Argo and that was when I realized that I hate chemistry and everything about it.

940
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,118
Speaker 0: Organic chemistry was the most horrifying experience I've ever had.

941
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:19,390
Speaker 0: it was nothing but doing lab experiments that don't work and smell bad.

942
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:21,941
Speaker 1: Really I did, you know organic chemistry.

943
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:23,810
Speaker 1: I'd only took one class of it at RIT.

944
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:28,630
Speaker 0: It was sort of like, you know 101 time every lab was take naphthalene and do something stupid with it.

945
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:31,504
Speaker 1: I actually had you know some pretty fun labs.

946
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:32,670
Speaker 1: We only had to do the fume hood.

947
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,594
Speaker 1: I'm like the lab.

948
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:34,678
Speaker 1: we actually made plastic.

949
01:01:34,979 --> 01:01:36,466
Speaker 1: It was actually kind of shitty plastic.

950
01:01:36,486 --> 01:01:37,550
Speaker 1: It was more like rubber cement.

951
01:01:37,891 --> 01:01:38,974
Speaker 0: Oh, we didn't do stuff like that.

952
01:01:39,035 --> 01:01:39,897
Speaker 0: We got right past.

953
01:01:40,038 --> 01:01:43,910
Speaker 1: actually, you know, the stuff we learned was not so exciting.

954
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,189
Speaker 1: I wasn't super interested in it.

955
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:49,330
Speaker 1: It wasn't that difficult probably because it was just a 101 introductory type class.

956
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:58,025
Speaker 1: but the labs were actually kind of fun because a my lab partner was sort of competent and B all the labs involved like that sort of.

957
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:17,630
Speaker 1: they looked like mad Scientist shit where we'd have like a beaker on one end and then like all these pipes You know held up on you know with like the you know, the big sticks of the metal holders You know and all sorts like, you know The the glass tube that gets bigger and smaller again and you would watch the chemical go like up Swirl around and go down the other side, you know, we did all that sort of shit.

958
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:21,090
Speaker 1: See I remember it was cool to feel like a mad scientist with the chemists.

959
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:25,550
Speaker 0: It was fun when I'd go and check in to like do a lab because I'd skip the lab classes on the weekend.

960
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:30,779
Speaker 0: I have to like go over there and do my science stuff to not fail this class That the high school was paying for me to take.

961
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:33,977
Speaker 0: so I'd be hanging out over there, you know Like working on my lab.

962
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:41,733
Speaker 0: and I remember one day There were these two kids who just obviously went to the community college as their college as opposed to just you know Taking classes there.

963
01:02:41,773 --> 01:02:42,817
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with that.

964
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:45,025
Speaker 1: No, but they just made a still.

965
01:02:45,045 --> 01:02:48,155
Speaker 1: Oh On purpose.

966
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:49,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they just left with it.

967
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:53,762
Speaker 1: Oh They just took the school's equipment and left.

968
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:56,910
Speaker 0: yeah nice Well, cuz you had this breakage card.

969
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:07,765
Speaker 0: You had to buy it for like 50 bucks and then at the end of the year You would you would take it over like you get signed out of your cabinet and then every time you broke something They put like marks on it and you get whatever money back from stuff.

970
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:08,570
Speaker 0: You didn't break at the end.

971
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:10,740
Speaker 1: See a lot of the labs that we did.

972
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,683
Speaker 1: I remember at the RIT organic chemistry We didn't make a still as in to make beer and ferment.

973
01:03:15,944 --> 01:03:17,309
Speaker 0: you don't make beer in a still.

974
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:31,170
Speaker 1: But we did to make liquor in a still but we did distill things, you know It's not not alcohol usually something else, you know We would yeah and if you would have to like measure the molar before and after and stuff and that kind of shit.

975
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,124
Speaker 0: You know, of course, I remember I got in trouble.

976
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:33,910
Speaker 0: I got bored one day.

977
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:45,530
Speaker 1: So while the lecture was going on I silvered every piece of glassware in my cabinet, you know Occasionally I had I would get silvered piece or is partially silvered pieces of glassware, but I never silvered anything.

978
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:46,936
Speaker 0: Well, I silvered it all.

979
01:03:47,117 --> 01:03:54,389
Speaker 0: and then you know a couple days later I'm doing my lab and the guys like what happened to your lab equipment and I'm like,

980
01:03:54,449 --> 01:04:03,783
Speaker 1: oh, yeah I remember like we we one of the things that we threw into the Bunsen burners just change the color of the fire with silver Nitrate and then our hands were like mark.

981
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:11,070
Speaker 1: we got until we like the end of the summer By hand and silver nitrate on it, but I remember the lab instructors like you didn't do that to all your lab equipment.

982
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:11,411
Speaker 0: Did you?

983
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:14,343
Speaker 0: and I was like, well, what if I did?

984
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,230
Speaker 0: he's like it's pretty much irreversible.

985
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,775
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh That's good to know.

986
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,942
Speaker 0: Like you sure you didn't do it all your lab equipment.

987
01:04:23,023 --> 01:04:26,414
Speaker 0: I'm like, I got a breakage card Definitely day.

988
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:29,209
Speaker 0: I didn't get any money back for my stupid breakage card.

989
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:36,782
Speaker 0: That's all right, ah Actually a lot of sadly all my really cool memories are from physics.

990
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:38,789
Speaker 0: we tried to make a betatron and it didn't work.

991
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:42,823
Speaker 1: And physics, you know all my the physics labs I've ever done.

992
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:52,682
Speaker 1: We're always the sort of you know Drop a thing off the side of the table with a string attached to it in a pulley and a little calculator Measuring device.

993
01:04:52,702 --> 01:05:00,965
Speaker 1: or you know Make a little circuit and use a you know Multimeter and measure it, you know, and you know, that's sort of she.

994
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:02,070
Speaker 1: we never really did anything.

995
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,372
Speaker 0: We had a fun.

996
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:08,490
Speaker 1: We actually did the lab where all the cool stuff like the teacher would already already have a Tesla coil.

997
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:12,050
Speaker 1: You wouldn't make one or you you know, you would just turn it on and be like look this is Tesla coil.

998
01:05:13,054 --> 01:05:14,460
Speaker 1: That uh, that was you know, you'd be like.

999
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:15,887
Speaker 1: you already have a Van de Graaff generator.

1000
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:16,630
Speaker 1: You never made one.

1001
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:17,659
Speaker 1: He's just like look I have one.

1002
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:18,910
Speaker 0: I turn it on for one to tell it.

1003
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:24,747
Speaker 0: I think I've told it many times but Donnie don't and his interaction with the Van de Graaff.

1004
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:29,043
Speaker 1: He'd be like look This is my bell jar capacitor that is made with a two gallon jar.

1005
01:05:29,104 --> 01:05:30,669
Speaker 1: We are not going to fill this up.

1006
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,130
Speaker 1: He's like once the teacher in the room next door was play.

1007
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:42,830
Speaker 1: You know, the the like one pint bell jar capacitor was sitting on a table and the teacher next door picked it up.

1008
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:44,419
Speaker 1: He's lucky to be alive.

1009
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:46,249
Speaker 1: He said it felt like a sledgehammer to the chest.

1010
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:52,030
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that, but we never made one or charged one up or anything like that.

1011
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:53,890
Speaker 1: You know just here we have one.

1012
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,693
Speaker 1: See it learn it

1013
01:05:54,753 --> 01:06:09,242
Speaker 0: like the one I remember most because we actually calculate like, you know What we'd always do is we do experiments that were done famously back in the day to try to calculate gravity or try to calculate how far away the Sun was and We try to do it experimentally and then did.

1014
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:12,536
Speaker 0: the quest was, you know See who can get the answer?

1015
01:06:12,797 --> 01:06:20,943
Speaker 0: like we'd always have the award for who got the most accurate answer and who got the most precise answer And very rarely did the same person get both.

1016
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:21,686
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1017
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:22,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely.

1018
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:31,750
Speaker 0: But the most fun we actually did the Cavendish experiment, you know There's the lowercase G gravity constant and the uppercase G the like gravity constant.

1019
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:40,321
Speaker 0: Yep, we did the Cavendish experiment to try to calculate the uppercase G Mm-hmm, and we got it to almost a decimal point.

1020
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:42,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was so proud of that.

1021
01:06:42,408 --> 01:06:46,309
Speaker 1: Yeah And we didn't do anything quite like that.

1022
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:51,510
Speaker 1: I think once we did the take extension cords and whip them around like jump ropes to make electricity.

1023
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:52,610
Speaker 0: No, we did that too.

1024
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:56,570
Speaker 0: Well, I remember we did it and they were like staying north to south and whip it around.

1025
01:06:57,132 --> 01:06:58,057
Speaker 0: Now stand east to us.

1026
01:06:58,077 --> 01:07:00,186
Speaker 1: We actually jump roped while they were connected.

1027
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:03,296
Speaker 0: Yep We may we made fun stuff.

1028
01:07:03,698 --> 01:07:05,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish oh, I had some free time.

1029
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:06,670
Speaker 1: I could do science to go away.

1030
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:08,257
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah guys from free time.

1031
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:11,072
Speaker 1: No, no one will pay me not gonna work out I can.

1032
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:12,646
Speaker 1: only I can only do things that make money.

1033
01:07:12,808 --> 01:07:17,486
Speaker 0: Scott I'll give you five bucks if you can recreate the Cavendish experiment not enough.

1034
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:19,581
Speaker 0: It's not that hard It's gonna take.

1035
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:20,450
Speaker 1: you got a guy need more.

1036
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,232
Speaker 1: You need to give me all the resources and I need at least a minimum wage for the time I'm spending.

1037
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:27,925
Speaker 1: yeah, at least if not more my times worth a lot more than that.

1038
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:29,651
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

1039
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:33,486
Speaker 0: This is kind of a cop-out episode as we found some excuse for science.

1040
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:34,590
Speaker 1: We didn't have any tech.

1041
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,637
Speaker 1: You actually we had an idea that bombed.

1042
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:40,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were like, hey, why don't we look for funny job listings on Craigslist?

1043
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,050
Speaker 0: And just kind of go through them live and talk about like what they say what they mean.

1044
01:07:44,672 --> 01:07:47,464
Speaker 0: There was nothing that that well was empty.

1045
01:07:47,746 --> 01:07:48,730
Speaker 1: that well was very much.

1046
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:51,644
Speaker 0: I got to the bottom and there wasn't even like a scary ghost down there.

1047
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:57,644
Speaker 1: Nope, so Send us some Mondays and show ideas other than the ones you've already sent us.

1048
01:07:57,684 --> 01:08:03,322
Speaker 1: those require effort and we're holding off Something that we don't need to research or put a course effort into.

1049
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:09,169
Speaker 0: of course if twit keeps talking about tweeting Then we'll just have to switch to the fit format and that'll be into that.

1050
01:08:09,672 --> 01:08:12,766
Speaker 1: Let's not even even if it becomes a possibility.

1051
01:08:12,826 --> 01:08:13,489
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do it.

1052
01:08:13,952 --> 01:08:15,885
Speaker 1: We've never really done like a Twitter show have we?

1053
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:16,569
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

1054
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,359
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do one just to be like.

1055
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:23,723
Speaker 1: this is the one and we'll never do it again Because then we can you know, we can spend half it.

1056
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:24,890
Speaker 1: bitching about it amazes me.

1057
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:33,100
Speaker 0: I don't post on Twitter like that often but every now and then I'll post like one thing and then I see like 20 people Reply to me and it's like ah, you know, it's like.

1058
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:33,823
Speaker 1: I did it.

1059
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:34,929
Speaker 1: You know, I tested it.

1060
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:36,276
Speaker 1: We'll save it.

1061
01:08:36,357 --> 01:08:42,520
Speaker 0: We'll do a Twitter show And then I'll talk about spin right and then I'll talk about my book.

1062
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:46,279
Speaker 0: I'll talk about my blog, you know rim org Slash blog.

1063
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:57,046
Speaker 0: Yep This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
