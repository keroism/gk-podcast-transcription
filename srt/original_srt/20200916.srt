1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,670
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, September 16th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,091
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,999
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,415
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about the fantastic wolf walkers.

5
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:21,773
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:29,600
Speaker 1: So we had a like I think I alluded to in the closing bits in the last episode.

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:37,480
Speaker 1: Literally minutes after we finished recording geek nights the preamp in Scott's audio device died like it exploded or something.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,790
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure that we're pretty.

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,839
Speaker 0: we are pretty sure.

10
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,408
Speaker 0: That is the most likely scenario right.

11
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:50,649
Speaker 0: so you know when we're recording the podcast together We have like a mixer or a device with two inputs And that's we're good to go right.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,130
Speaker 0: so for me to record the podcast on my own You know to use a microphone with XLR.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,720
Speaker 0: you obviously can't just plug that into your computer.

14
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,402
Speaker 0: I've never seen a computer with an XLR input You need.

15
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:11,177
Speaker 1: I saw a sound card for an old case that had XLR inputs in the like five and a quarter inch like Five-and-a-half inch opening bay in the front.

16
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,922
Speaker 0: oh Sure sure.

17
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:21,320
Speaker 0: so the device I've had for six years for thing for scenarios like this is this thing which you can see if you're Watching the stream, but if you're not it doesn't matter.

18
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,288
Speaker 0: It's the sure X to you.

19
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,959
Speaker 0: sure the same people who make the sure microphones, right?

20
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:27,865
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm 57 you 58.

21
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:31,038
Speaker 0: yeah, literally the letter X the number two the letter you.

22
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:34,333
Speaker 0: it Literally is XLR to USB.

23
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:35,600
Speaker 0: it is a tiny rod.

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,939
Speaker 0: You can fit in your fist one end of it as XLR one end of it is USB and all it does is You know there's a monitor.

25
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:44,646
Speaker 0: There's a headphone hole on the sides.

26
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:45,951
Speaker 0: you could listen to it if you want.

27
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,300
Speaker 0: you can actually use it as a sound card and listen.

28
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,840
Speaker 0: also There's a knob for adjusting the gain on the microphone.

29
00:01:53,321 --> 00:02:05,560
Speaker 0: There's a knob for the volume of the monitoring and there's a knob to switch between when you're monitoring How much volume you want to hear from the computer side and how much volume you want to hear from your own voice, right?

30
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,787
Speaker 0: Or whatever instrument you're playing or whatever.

31
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,817
Speaker 0: and then there's a button for phantom power.

32
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:11,439
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,048
Speaker 0: It literally has no other feature whatsoever.

34
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,075
Speaker 0: It's really solidly built.

35
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:28,980
Speaker 0: it worked for six years and I'm 90% sure that this is the broken part because I tried it on a different computer With a different USB cable and a different microphone and it still didn't work, right?

36
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:32,251
Speaker 0: So we tried all that replaced all the other pieces.

37
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,700
Speaker 0: the microphones obviously working because I'm using it right now.

38
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,086
Speaker 0: That's not the broken part.

39
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,351
Speaker 0: The computer is working.

40
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:38,275
Speaker 0: I'm using that right now.

41
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,240
Speaker 0: That's not the broken part.

42
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:43,876
Speaker 0: So what it was happening is if you plug this into a computer, right?

43
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:44,680
Speaker 0: It detects it.

44
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,609
Speaker 0: The computer doesn't know anything's wrong.

45
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,077
Speaker 0: The computer is like, hey, there it is.

46
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:48,660
Speaker 0: We're good to go.

47
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:53,233
Speaker 0: But there's a little light an LED that can turn on green or red.

48
00:02:53,253 --> 00:03:03,678
Speaker 0: that indicates that you know Volume is coming through right that sound is coming from the XLR side and it's red when the sound is too hot and That light no longer turns on.

49
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,518
Speaker 0: when you plug headphones in the monitor, you don't hear anything anymore.

50
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:20,830
Speaker 0: and Even though the computer detects it perfectly if you look in the windows You know recording devices the you know, the level meter basically never moves ever So pretty sure.

51
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,980
Speaker 0: the preamp and this just died after six years.

52
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:32,800
Speaker 0: So I had to go buy something new and I had to buy my second choice because my first choice Was not available for a rush, you know quick shipment.

53
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:35,972
Speaker 0: It was out of stock everywhere and it won't be here.

54
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,220
Speaker 0: Even my first second choice won't be here till tomorrow.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,519
Speaker 0: So we'll see how that works and if we have to do anything, so there you go.

56
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:48,456
Speaker 0: So yeah, I don't know if they still make the sure X to you or if they still sell it.

57
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:49,880
Speaker 0: Should you buy it?

58
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:58,264
Speaker 0: I recommend buying it only if you really really need a small USB XLR interface.

59
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:08,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you and you expect it to last for six years if you're sitting at a desk or You're in any sort of that kind of scenario where you don't really need it to be this small.

60
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,699
Speaker 0: Pay the extra money and get you know.

61
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:17,380
Speaker 0: One of the ones I was looking at a pre-sonus one this scarlet focus, right one.

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,346
Speaker 0: And is this a moto one?

63
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:20,890
Speaker 0: you can google and you'll see.

64
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:26,870
Speaker 1: all of them are apparently like a plus devices Really like it comes down to what you're using them for.

65
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,994
Speaker 1: like I you I'm a really dedicated personas But I also set up really complex pipelines using their software.

66
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:34,340
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't need any of that crap.

67
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:36,426
Speaker 0: The personas one looked great.

68
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,174
Speaker 0: I just I ordered the focus right one because it was way smaller.

69
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:49,043
Speaker 1: not sure X to you small Yeah, but yeah My audio interface is like why it's like a rack amount thing that I got in a little rack down here And it was.

70
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:49,987
Speaker 0: it was well reviewed.

71
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:50,910
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

72
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,200
Speaker 0: but the moto one actually looked the nicest.

73
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:54,840
Speaker 0: It was just out of stock everywhere.

74
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:02,300
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah These are the trials and tribulations of like having to record podcasts and make panels and everything remotely during kovat.

75
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,235
Speaker 1: We'll be doing this for probably at least six more months.

76
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:05,878
Speaker 1: Maybe a year.

77
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:17,560
Speaker 0: So here I am using the panel set up for this show because I don't have any other way to use this microphone Which is good news to the recording yet another panel soon that you'll be able to see at Superman.

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had to it's coincidence.

79
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,418
Speaker 0: I had to set up this anyway, so why not?

80
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:32,440
Speaker 1: Yeah So in some actual anime news, you probably know if you've listened to geek nights at all Though I don't think I've mentioned this show in a long time doesn't really come up and casual conversation.

81
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,200
Speaker 1: But probably one of my favorite anime and all of my life is Irresponsible Captain Tyler.

82
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:42,420
Speaker 0: I'm just an anime that only old anime nerds like us even know exists.

83
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,533
Speaker 1: I found out about it before it even got released in the US.

84
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:46,879
Speaker 1: I was like into it.

85
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,119
Speaker 0: I found out about it at anime club.

86
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:52,840
Speaker 1: I watched a fan sub of the first episode and I was like really excited.

87
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,140
Speaker 1: I bought like the VHS's as it came out.

88
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:58,232
Speaker 1: It took a long time to come out But I didn't see the end of it.

89
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:03,940
Speaker 1: as much as I loved this show I couldn't get past like the first seven or eight episodes.

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,273
Speaker 1: I want to say it was like in high school and then we got to RIT.

91
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:13,000
Speaker 1: eventually at some point I Realized wait, I could just watch the rest of that show that I liked.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,912
Speaker 1: It's all the anime club library and we watched it all eventually.

93
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 1: and the movie - yeah And there's a bunch of OAV episodes and all this stuff.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,719
Speaker 1: There's a newer version of it like a series - maybe I'll give it a rewatch.

95
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,703
Speaker 0: I think it's cuz.

96
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,190
Speaker 0: I basically remember almost nothing.

97
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,320
Speaker 0: I remember the core concept and an alien girl.

98
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:29,682
Speaker 0: It's a.

99
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,114
Speaker 1: it's definitely in my top 10 of anime.

100
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:33,360
Speaker 1: I've liked in my entire life.

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:44,834
Speaker 1: Yeah hard to get it disappeared from streaming sites I want to say a while ago Like I have DVDs of it and that seems to be the only legit way I could watch it really.

102
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:55,635
Speaker 1: but somehow this show Like many other shows that have gotten a re-release in recent history It's getting a collector's ultra edition blu-ray release meaning

103
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,381
Speaker 0: I can write stuff Yep,

104
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:03,542
Speaker 1: so meaning I can buy those blu-rays rip them and then get rid of those blu-rays because I don't want them But

105
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,931
Speaker 0: gonna or wait for someone else to rip them and download.

106
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:13,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is This show if you've never watched it figure out a way to watch it Even if you're not invested enough to get this.

107
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:26,952
Speaker 1: like ultra collector's edition this and master Keaton Are possibly the most underrated Anime in Western fandom ever in terms of number of people who have watched them Versus how good they actually are.

108
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:29,123
Speaker 0: there are better shows Right.

109
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:38,517
Speaker 0: So master Keaton is basically really awesome Japanese, dude Except he's all humble and acts like he's not that as good as he is.

110
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:39,340
Speaker 0: Is that right?

111
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:44,600
Speaker 0: So it'd be like, you know, imagine if like Clark Kent didn't transform into Superman.

112
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:55,542
Speaker 0: He just like lifted a car occasionally and was like, yeah, I'm not so great He's a little bit like right like Keaton's a little bit like Matlock a little bit, right Irresponsible.

113
00:07:55,602 --> 00:08:00,519
Speaker 0: captain Tyler is a complete like, you know doofus, right?

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,072
Speaker 1: Or is it all a brilliant?

115
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,347
Speaker 0: Transcendent being it's a complete doofus who messes everything up, but somehow succeeds Despite being a doofus.

116
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:14,858
Speaker 0: and you're supposed the whole point is that you can't tell.

117
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:27,874
Speaker 0: is He pretending to be a doofus and is a secret genius or just so lucky That his doofus ness manages to succeed despite, you know what he's doing.

118
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,140
Speaker 0: It just stumbles into success, right?

119
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:36,740
Speaker 0: It's not an inspector gadget situation where there's like penny is actually making the success happen, right?

120
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:41,640
Speaker 0: Imagine if inspector gadget just succeeded without penny and brain being there.

121
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:43,525
Speaker 0: That's what.

122
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,260
Speaker 0: that's what irresponsible captain Tyler is.

123
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,060
Speaker 1: But it asked it builds and builds and builds and as funny as it is like it's primarily a comedy.

124
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,950
Speaker 1: It also has that thing that we love like tank police.

125
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:03,089
Speaker 1: has this to Dominion tank police or a Pat LeBourre Where there's a gang of idiots who are sort of like friends with or working with the main character and they're just doing their idiot Shit in the background all the time.

126
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 1: I love that in anime.

127
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,028
Speaker 0: So that's those are the.

128
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,839
Speaker 0: that's captain Tyler's coming back.

129
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:24,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, so other big news right discotheque media who is a come a US anime distribution publishing production company, I don't know which one they count as They often put out the good old Animes right.

130
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,600
Speaker 0: the license rescues the re releases that kind of stuff, right?

131
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:41,712
Speaker 0: So like if you told me pick one US anime, you know Distributing publishing company and you can have their library and but you can't have any other anime from any other the US companies Just go tech every time.

132
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:42,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

133
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:48,560
Speaker 0: So since there's a lack of anime conventions or lack of anime conventions to go to in person.

134
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:56,474
Speaker 0: Right what they did is rather than attend an online anime con They just did their own panel on their own right.

135
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,919
Speaker 0: they had some technical difficulties.

136
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,179
Speaker 0: Did their own.

137
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,320
Speaker 1: We have technical difficulties trying to make this stuff happen.

138
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:18,109
Speaker 0: Yeah they just did their own broadcast to announce all their shit on their own all at once and You don't need to watch that broadcast because they did a Twitter thread where they broke went down and broke down Everything they announced in the panel.

139
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,500
Speaker 0: they live tweeted themselves, right?

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,256
Speaker 0: So you could I just read the Twitter thread to see the live tweets and I got all the info.

141
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:25,466
Speaker 1: I scroll down a little bit.

142
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,380
Speaker 1: I see Rosa Versailles.

143
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:29,171
Speaker 0: There's some hot shit announcements in here.

144
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:29,392
Speaker 0: right.

145
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:47,900
Speaker 0: most of them are bure announcements But it doesn't matter because even if you don't care about getting plastic discs, like we don't want plastic discs it means that all of these shows are going to be legally available in high quality or Illegally available in high quality from somewhere, right?

146
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,980
Speaker 0: So Rosa Versailles which was on crunchyroll and I don't think is anymore that coming out bure.

147
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:55,779
Speaker 0: So that will be available again.

148
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:57,646
Speaker 0: How'd you may know it Bo?

149
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:00,054
Speaker 0: right awesome show that I don't think people watched.

150
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:03,053
Speaker 0: if you want to see a guy punch a bear In the face, right?

151
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:10,338
Speaker 0: There you go People who like the whatever giant robo this that like gin ray side thing, right?

152
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,185
Speaker 0: They're bringing that back.

153
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,717
Speaker 1: Yes, you can show I forgot all about again.

154
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:15,160
Speaker 1: She can.

155
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:16,644
Speaker 0: Is that even?

156
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:17,910
Speaker 0: I don't even see that on the list.

157
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,140
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm scrolling through their thread.

158
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,976
Speaker 1: That is a fan replying to them at the bottom of their thread.

159
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:23,560
Speaker 1: Never mind.

160
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:30,771
Speaker 0: Okay It's a show we completely forgot about right coming back in.

161
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:33,780
Speaker 0: not HD right SD blu-rays.

162
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,009
Speaker 0: Big big Lupin announcements, right?

163
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,995
Speaker 0: So they got Lupin the third Tokyo crisis.

164
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,380
Speaker 0: That's one of those Lupin movies.

165
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:42,244
Speaker 0: I think one of it.

166
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:43,529
Speaker 0: I think it's one of the newer ones.

167
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,513
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've seen it.

168
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,265
Speaker 1: I forget which one that is right.

169
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:52,372
Speaker 0: the Probably best new Lupin TV series the Fujiko Minae.

170
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:56,343
Speaker 0: right which funimation had and then Ended.

171
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:57,526
Speaker 0: they didn't renew it.

172
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,713
Speaker 0: So here comes discotheque.

173
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:00,856
Speaker 0: Just pick it right back up.

174
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,060
Speaker 0: It'll be available again.

175
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,977
Speaker 1: You fell off the Lupin the third train.

176
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,948
Speaker 1: Which that show the Fujiko Minae.

177
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:11,700
Speaker 1: Lupin basically starts a new era of a plus Lupin.

178
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,524
Speaker 0: Yep, what's interesting?

179
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:18,175
Speaker 0: Is that some of these funimation and other licensed rescue ones they're doing.

180
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:21,866
Speaker 0: they guess they purchased the rights to that Like the dub, but they're not dubbing it.

181
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,820
Speaker 0: They're like getting the dub funimation did and just putting it on there.

182
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,625
Speaker 1: That's the right way to go.

183
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,497
Speaker 1: You don't need to do a new dub.

184
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:28,863
Speaker 1: a lot of these We're just like.

185
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:32,114
Speaker 0: I assume they're paying funimation for that right in some way.

186
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,899
Speaker 0: All right, but yeah, why not?

187
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:39,514
Speaker 0: Big one project a co I don't think has been available.

188
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:45,939
Speaker 1: the third anyway I ever ever saw in my entire life in the 90s after vampire hunter d and robot carnival.

189
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,965
Speaker 0: Yep, other than that.

190
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:53,802
Speaker 0: There's some other ones you could you know that we don't care as much about like symphogear g Devilman.

191
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,690
Speaker 0: lady, I guess that's going to guy right?

192
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:03,075
Speaker 0: Yeah submarine super 99 Genosyber ninjas sent sent she topic cog, whatever these other shows are.

193
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,279
Speaker 0: There's a case closed in there.

194
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:16,085
Speaker 0: These are the shows I've seen but I don't really ever need to see again, but they announced 15 things at their special Discotheque only panel.

195
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:19,717
Speaker 0: so big-time anime releases coming in the u.s.

196
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:26,160
Speaker 1: Pretty good Tell you know we live in a golden age of access to good animation right now for everything else is going wrong with the world.

197
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:34,147
Speaker 1: We've got animation but anyway Things of the day.

198
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:34,890
Speaker 1: What do you got?

199
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,140
Speaker 0: So tying right in to my news, right?

200
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:47,510
Speaker 0: I mentioned that Discotheque is bringing back the project a co on booray and they bragged during their panel About how well sort of bragging.

201
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,057
Speaker 0: but they're like listen project a co.

202
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:49,820
Speaker 0: we're bringing this back.

203
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:51,686
Speaker 0: We can't get the Masters.

204
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:55,560
Speaker 0: the Masters are lost to space and time not uncommon in old anime.

205
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:02,480
Speaker 0: How are we gonna release project a co on booray in high quality when the Masters are just not available, right?

206
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,323
Speaker 0: They're gone.

207
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,287
Speaker 0: We just can't get them.

208
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,252
Speaker 0: It's not like what.

209
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,256
Speaker 0: no one will sell them to us.

210
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,160
Speaker 0: It's like no one has them.

211
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,605
Speaker 0: They're just poof, right?

212
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:13,020
Speaker 0: So what they done is they have this device apparently that I learned about.

213
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,325
Speaker 0: It's like a homebrew device.

214
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:18,359
Speaker 0: You can buy it or even make one called the domes de duplicator.

215
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,947
Speaker 0: and What the domes de duplicator is?

216
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,838
Speaker 0: it looks like an Arduino with two things stacked on top of it.

217
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:32,076
Speaker 0: I'm not sure exactly if it is an Arduino or not but what it does is you get a laserdisc player,

218
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:32,799
Speaker 1: right and

219
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:55,411
Speaker 0: Then you attach it to the laserdisc player in such a way that you bypass Most of the hardware that is internal to the laserdisc player and you're basically reading the signal from the laser in the laserdisc player like directly and you're recording it out to a real modern computer and Saving that signal in a file.

220
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:55,752
Speaker 1: Yep.

221
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,642
Speaker 1: It's raw RF Right.

222
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:08,459
Speaker 0: So you're taking this raw RF signal that and you managed to by not running it through all that other laserdisc hardware and Like into a you know, who knows what kind of device?

223
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,080
Speaker 0: That signal didn't get interfered with in any analog way, right?

224
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,399
Speaker 0: It's like you got the digital readout from a laser and you just record it.

225
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:24,700
Speaker 0: No analog interference in between right and now that it's in a file on a computer.

226
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:31,275
Speaker 0: What you do to it is really clever is Rather, it's still an un decoded signal.

227
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:32,601
Speaker 0: You can't watch it Right.

228
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:37,316
Speaker 0: What you do is you create a laserdisc player in software.

229
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:51,580
Speaker 0: you write Software that is a laserdisc player to then translate that that, you know raw read from the laser into Video that can be used and then made a booray out of eventually, right?

230
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:01,578
Speaker 0: so they can take the project a co laserdisc that they get from somewhere right which I guess they have and Get the best possible reading of that laserdisc.

231
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,780
Speaker 1: Yeah Now this article doesn't use that to make booray doesn't explain this but as best I will assume based on my knowledge of RF.

232
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,629
Speaker 1: What's going on here is the way RF works.

233
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,578
Speaker 1: is it's literally like radio frequency like the same kind of signals You send over the errors in the old days.

234
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:24,816
Speaker 1: and what it does is it encodes both chroma and luma together into one signal and It's an analog signal.

235
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:28,856
Speaker 1: Well not like an art like a wav file like it almost looks like a wav file in essence.

236
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:39,839
Speaker 1: and what you do if you ever heard of a comb filter is you basically use a Fancy version of an equalizer to say this part of the signal is the chroma.

237
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,740
Speaker 1: This part of the signal is the luma and like split them apart.

238
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:48,135
Speaker 1: But to do that in real time with analog signals using analog equipment.

239
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,020
Speaker 1: these filters are not a hundred percent.

240
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,368
Speaker 1: There's a lot of room for error.

241
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:56,036
Speaker 1: chroma and luma can kind of bleed into each other And that wasn't a big deal when you're outputting the signal to a TV.

242
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:59,732
Speaker 0: now I also don't know enough about how laser discs work, right?

243
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 1: It's just RF like, you know, like RF is RF.

244
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,670
Speaker 0: They just take RF and but it's it's still.

245
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,596
Speaker 0: it's the same as like a CD, right?

246
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:07,198
Speaker 0: It's still.

247
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:15,384
Speaker 1: you know That's on the laser disc but the data we get off is effectively a raw RF signal Isn't it?

248
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,740
Speaker 0: It's a laser disc is zeros and ones though, right?

249
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:23,137
Speaker 1: There's more in there that I'm obviously skipping but what you get the problem is at least I think it is.

250
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:28,107
Speaker 1: I could be wrong so I Can link to a video that actually explains this.

251
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:34,732
Speaker 1: that will do it much better than me because my knowledge of this is Weakening because RF is not relevant to the modern world except in cases like.

252
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:35,816
Speaker 0: what is it?

253
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:41,380
Speaker 0: This is really cool Right and it you know, let me tie my news and my thing of the day together into one item like that.

254
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,760
Speaker 1: So as a kid, I remember my uncle had a chip that he was trying to like futz with and what the chip would do?

255
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,599
Speaker 1: It was a better comb filter that would better separate luma and chroma.

256
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:56,044
Speaker 1: So if you plugged like an Atari into it you get a crisper signal But that was a long time.

257
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:56,305
Speaker 1: point

258
00:17:56,385 --> 00:18:15,860
Speaker 0: is if you've got a laser disc and you want to read that laser disc out And you don't want to use your laser disc player anymore and you want to get the best possible quality You can you can buy or construct this domes de duplicator set it up and it'll be a lot of work But you'll basically get a perfect rip of your laser disc.

259
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:24,800
Speaker 1: Yep It can't get better quality than the laser disc signal But it can get as good as you could have possibly gotten better than any lasers player ever could have in the wild.

260
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:32,188
Speaker 1: Yes So my thing of the day I'm not that much of a mountain biker these days.

261
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,200
Speaker 1: Like I tend to go like twice a year at best.

262
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,060
Speaker 1: Now I'm not really doing it at all for obvious reasons.

263
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:50,559
Speaker 1: But the thing about mountain biking compared to skiing is that I learned to ski From professionals who taught me a lot of techniques jargon words for things theory, etc.

264
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:57,912
Speaker 1: but I learned mountain biking by being a dumb kid and somehow Surviving just learning it on my own and watching other people and trying to copy them.

265
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:09,183
Speaker 1: this video which our friend Luke posted in the geek Nice forum recently is a really good mountain biking video because it's not just awesome mountain bikers shredding down a mountain Like a highlights reel.

266
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:45,400
Speaker 1: it's super long and super slow and it's basically two dudes one of whom's a pro one of whom is not as good Trying a trail over and over again analyzing like what they did and basically explaining the craft and technique of how to approach that trail safely like how to do it like When to hit the apex and all the different kinds of things to do using all the jargon mountain bikers do and I don't see many videos like this for either skiing or mountain biking where Basically pros speak in the language of their craft and address the problem and then attack the problem.

267
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:51,300
Speaker 1: I know long video like this is just really cool to me because I didn't actually know a lot of this jargon.

268
00:19:51,842 --> 00:20:03,300
Speaker 1: But I think I understand it all because I learned it intuitively and I wonder what people I try to teach skiing think When I use jargon that I assume they understand that they might not necessarily understand.

269
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:03,882
Speaker 1: It's just.

270
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:18,556
Speaker 1: I thought this is a really fascinating video and I haven't seen a video like this quite as good and actually Interesting as this partly because yeah the lines they're taking like the trails They're working on are I believe the technical term for this is fucking insane.

271
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:23,419
Speaker 1: These are not trails I would be comfortable doing in most circumstances.

272
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:29,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, on the one hand, you know when people just speak in their jargon of the pros, right?

273
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,908
Speaker 0: It's kind of disappointing because it's like damn.

274
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,474
Speaker 0: I can't learn from that right?

275
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:34,860
Speaker 0: I'm still not a pro yet.

276
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,780
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, I'm always disappointed especially with like sports interviews.

277
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:44,020
Speaker 0: It's like they'll interview some athlete after a game and they'd be like both teams played hard, right?

278
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,239
Speaker 1: It's like the pucks in to speak.

279
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:46,163
Speaker 0: It's like.

280
00:20:46,203 --> 00:21:12,344
Speaker 0: but if you go to practice and like we're able to listen to the coach and the players talking to each other It's like just talk like that when someone comes to interview you after the game be like, oh, yeah and that play I didn't do this and that and this other thing and you know, this is why I messed up on the wrong defensive Whatever, you know it's like talk like that and that will even if I don't fully understand it and I can't I'm not able to like learn to Be you from that.

281
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:17,040
Speaker 0: it is much more interesting to listen to and more entertaining and informative.

282
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:22,020
Speaker 0: Then the boring, you know Not giving you the information.

283
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:27,117
Speaker 1: Yeah Kind of talk with this video because it's one person who's way better like sort of guiding someone.

284
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,472
Speaker 1: through this You can start to learn and intuit a lot of that jargon.

285
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,938
Speaker 1: because you watch the pro do and you're like wow That looks really easy.

286
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,426
Speaker 1: Then he explains what he's gonna do.

287
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:38,863
Speaker 1: then you watch the other guy do it and even the non-expert you're like, wow He didn't do it as well.

288
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:39,827
Speaker 1: What's different?

289
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,533
Speaker 1: and then the guy starts.

290
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:42,156
Speaker 0: does he get hurt?

291
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,320
Speaker 1: No, no one really gets hurt.

292
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,325
Speaker 1: This is so.

293
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,475
Speaker 0: if no one gets hurt then I consider that a success.

294
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,620
Speaker 0: Well, that's like who cares.

295
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:48,429
Speaker 1: Here's the example.

296
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,319
Speaker 1: like skiing is the same way.

297
00:21:50,143 --> 00:22:04,560
Speaker 1: I could get down a double black diamond trail without dying many many many many years ago like I was able to do that like pretty early on because You can take it real slow and careful and boring or like scoop down on your fun.

298
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,833
Speaker 0: That seems like the way you should always be doing it.

299
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:07,196
Speaker 0: That's boring.

300
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:12,654
Speaker 1: I only do that when I'm like Luring a trail to figure out if I want to.

301
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:13,900
Speaker 1: like go hard on it or not.

302
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:19,160
Speaker 1: Like learn a trail first then go take the lift back up then ski it fast cuz now I know what to expect.

303
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,010
Speaker 0: But how about just don't do that second part?

304
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:23,956
Speaker 1: That second part is all I'm after.

305
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,503
Speaker 1: That's all I want Right.

306
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:27,246
Speaker 0: So you did.

307
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:30,056
Speaker 0: I could do it without dying but doing it with dying.

308
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,342
Speaker 0: That's what I'm after dying part.

309
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:42,436
Speaker 1: but like you build that flow state you learn those skills and this video just shows like a nice progression of that and It just really makes me want to get outside and go mountain biking skiing again instead of being cooped up.

310
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,623
Speaker 1: Good God in the meta moment.

311
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:53,750
Speaker 1: the geek nights book club book has been the tale of Hanjo tale of Genji since forever and We're not really first novel in human history ever.

312
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,400
Speaker 1: I'm hoping we just don't have time to read right now Like we're actually really busy.

313
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,464
Speaker 0: I've been I kept.

314
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:05,689
Speaker 0: I actually have like an urge to read fantasy novel and a little bit But I it's like every time I go to do it.

315
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,520
Speaker 0: I don't yep, and then I'm like I should read the tale of Genji.

316
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,587
Speaker 0: That's what I should be reading.

317
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,050
Speaker 0: I don't.

318
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:11,499

Speaker 0: It's like.

394
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:19,497
Speaker 0: I've never seen an Irish animation before let alone an Irish animation That is a full-length movie of 90 minutes that is looking so damn good, right?

395
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:20,300

00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:32,871
Speaker 0: and then few years go by they come along with some friggin song of the sea and we're like, whoa We didn't think they could do better, but they did.

399
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,399
Speaker 0: somehow they did right.

400
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,880
Speaker 0: Meanwhile while they were working on those two things they did some other stuff, right?

401
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:45,100
Speaker 0: Those two were directed by Tom Moore, but they had like Nora to me it had all these people.

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,244
Speaker 0: They did some puffin rock.

00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:49,116
Speaker 0: we did an episode on that.

405
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:50,140
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I think so.

406
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,127
Speaker 0: Right cart cartoon saloon.

407
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,416

Speaker 0: even Miyazaki has misses, right?

411
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:08,460
Speaker 0: So years ago right around the time of song of the sea shortly thereafter, right?

412
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,493
Speaker 0: We knew the next one they're working on was wolf walkers and based on the teaser imagery.

413
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:16,100
Speaker 0: We saw we're like, that's the one.

414
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:17,928
Speaker 1: Oh, we were we didn't do it.

415
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:19,375

416
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,179
Speaker 1: No matter like what?

417
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,233
Speaker 0: We didn't think you could beat song of the sea, but I can tell right now.

418
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,759
Speaker 0: That's the one that's it.

419
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:31,760
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they did one two three and the third time is like boom the home run, right?

420
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,486
Speaker 0: Not that the others weren't home runs.

421
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:33,767
Speaker 0: Okay.

422
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:34,671
Speaker 0: This was the Grand Slam.

423
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:35,113
Speaker 1: Haha.

424
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,860
Speaker 0: So we knew that in advance, right?

425
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:41,937
Speaker 0: So comes along a little while ago, I think we talked about this also on the show.

426
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:44,908
Speaker 0: Oh Wolf walkers is coming real soon.

427
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:51,039

428
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:54,000
Speaker 0: It's five bucks a month and you can get a seven day free trial.

429
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,959
Speaker 0: But I don't want to have to do that to watch this thing, right?

430
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,470
Speaker 0: Supposedly Tom Moore told me himself on Twitter.

431
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:02,979
Speaker 0: You'll be able to just buy it on iTunes.

432
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,652
Speaker 0: So it's because Apple funded the movie, right?

433
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:12,980
Speaker 0: So, you know, yeah G kids has still licensed to the movie in the US just like, you know, they have for all the past ones.

434
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,193
Speaker 1: Yep, so whatever theaters are existing and safe I'm sure you'll be able to see it as a theater.

435
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,710
Speaker 0: if there is a Theater that is safe to go to that you can go to.

436
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,640
Speaker 0: it may be showing there at some point also.

437
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,052
Speaker 0: Presumably they'll release a bure at some point.

438
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:33,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but in terms of digital It's gonna be Apple exclusive for most of the world for quite some time though.

439
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:35,022
Speaker 1: We watch it I don't know.

440
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:37,452
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's over yet, but we actually watched it.

441
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 0: You could it is over in a few days.

442
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,279
Speaker 0: I think you've got about four days left.

443
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:45,880
Speaker 1: Toronto International Film Festival has the premiere of this movie.

444
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:54,480
Speaker 1: So if you pay for access to it You can just stream this movie directly from the Toronto International Film Festival in really really high quality.

445
00:29:55,245 --> 00:30:08,373
Speaker 0: It's silver lining of a global pandemic As if it's really not even much of a line and considering how horrible pandemic is obviously right but We would not have been able to go to the Toronto International Film Festival had this.

446
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,600
Speaker 0: nothing wrong gone in the world, right?

447
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:24,820
Speaker 0: However, because it's online you can pay 19 Canadian dollars and you'll be able to watch this movie for a 12-hour window I think from the time you first press play and or if the film festival ends whichever happens first.

448
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:30,417
Speaker 0: So that is how we saw it and that is how we are reporting to you on what we saw.

449
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,280
Speaker 0: we watched the whole movie.

450
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we won't spoil anything at least for a while.

451
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:38,471
Speaker 1: We'll warn before we start spoiling but This movie is a 100% must-see.

452
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,260
Speaker 1: Like I'm not gonna just go watch it.

453
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,771
Speaker 1: Don't wait for us to tell you to watch this movie.

454
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:44,539
Speaker 0: We predicted and we were right.

455
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:50,259
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm so say it's the best movie cartoon saloons ever put out possibly.

456
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:54,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's up it's I think it's tied I think maybe with song of the sea.

457
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,185
Speaker 0: a little different anyway It's still for me.

458
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,779
Speaker 0: That's like oh, I'm tied with song of the sea.

459
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:05,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, though the tricky part is like I have to go watch breadwinner again, cuz that movie is real good - oh, that's so good.

460
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,157
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so just brief plot summary, right?

461
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:11,107
Speaker 0: You're in Ireland

462
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:12,220
Speaker 1: Kilkenny specifically

463
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:32,920
Speaker 0: Yep, the place where cartoon saloon is located in the real world and it's you know The times where the English were coming all up in Ireland's business, right Irish people weren't too happy on that and you know They're trying to you know, build out the area around the town, you know, civilize it and obviously the woods are not too happy about it.

464
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,173
Speaker 0: So you got a little uh, you know a little environmental story, right?

465
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:36,936
Speaker 0: What was that one?

466
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:38,040
Speaker 0: What Fern Gully?

467
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,619
Speaker 0: No, a little bit of Fern Gully there is.

468
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,895
Speaker 1: That is technically an apt comparison.

469
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:48,415
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna lie Not Fern Gully is a piece of shit compared to this movie.

470
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:49,500
Speaker 0: but the point stand.

471
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a little bit of Fern Gully story going on, right?

472
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,260
Speaker 0: But this is sort of a lives in the town.

473
00:31:55,601 --> 00:32:02,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can't clear the woods because there's wolves in the woods and they keep biting people and scaring people off, right?

474
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,215
Speaker 0: This girl from England and her dad obviously her mom is who knows where probably dead.

475
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:09,840
Speaker 0: They are living in this town.

476
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:14,480
Speaker 0: The dad's job is to hunt the wolves right so that they can clear the woods.

477
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:19,592
Speaker 0: The girl wants to go on an adventure and haunt wolves with her dad.

478
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,280
Speaker 0: The dad is like no you're gonna get eaten by a wolf.

479
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,067
Speaker 0: It's probably not a good idea.

480
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:35,575
Speaker 0: You're really tiny right and the girl meets You know the wolf walker the magic people in the woods Right and things progress from there as you would imagine in a children's movie.

481
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:35,876
Speaker 1: Yep.

482
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:39,210
Speaker 1: It is beautiful It is the music is good.

483
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,376
Speaker 1: The story is good.

484
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:41,120
Speaker 1: It's pretty.

485
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:42,546
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of like.

486
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:57,119
Speaker 1: the situation is more complex than Scott described because remember this was during Like the Oliver Cromwell area and if you know anything about how that government interacted with the island of Ireland Then you can see why the Lord Protector is the villain of this movie.

487
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:59,126
Speaker 1: But there's an interesting dynamic.

488
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,453
Speaker 1: on one hand the two made deal.

489
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:03,760
Speaker 1: the father and the daughter who have moved to Ireland.

490
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:20,516
Speaker 1: They're English the English are colonizers and subjugators of Ireland but simultaneously the townspeople are also themselves sort of colonizers and Quote, you know, I'm using this as a pejorative word in this case.

491
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:34,807
Speaker 1: I would be very clear civilizers of the previously existing populations and There's a dynamic of townspeople are sort of against the previous people the wolves but also against the English.

492
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:39,605
Speaker 1: the English are like everybody's against everybody and It's sort of a complex situation.

493
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:49,013
Speaker 1: and even still the father and the daughter have clearly come to Ireland to start a new life or to escape something like they are.

494
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:52,444
Speaker 1: they're not necessarily by choice But that's the life they have.

495
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:53,288
Speaker 1: like they got their hustle.

496
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:53,548
Speaker 1: They got.

497
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:56,660
Speaker 0: the girl is obviously happier in England.

498
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's not happy about coming here, right?

499
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:12,438
Speaker 0: So she's also You know, the dad was coming, you know for his own reasons, right but you know The girl is trying to you know, find a way to you know, either get back to England But she doesn't try it at that.

500
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:21,371
Speaker 0: But to you know find a new life for herself and in you know, find a way to enjoy, you know Her situation right instead of you know getting stuck.

501
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:23,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know happy but simultaneously she wants to be like her dad.

502
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:33,560
Speaker 1: So she wants to be a wolf hunter just like her dad and she goes out into the woods Like hunt the wolves and kill the wolves and oh she meets a wolf and turns out the wolves are pretty cool.

503
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,108
Speaker 1: And there we go.

504
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:35,938
Speaker 1: Here's a movie Yep.

505
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,620
Speaker 0: So this movie does have the common kids movie trope of the adult that won't listen to the kid, right?

506
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:53,371
Speaker 0: Which is understandable because she's trying to tell her dad that like fairy tales are real and he's like, yeah, whatever It's like I got this is serious.

507
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,134
Speaker 0: You're gonna get bitten.

508
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:59,127
Speaker 0: No, don't go out in the woods But it's one of those ones where it's like.

509
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,540
Speaker 0: yeah, if you had just listened to me right this would have been all sort.

510
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:02,661
Speaker 0: It's.

511
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:07,348
Speaker 0: that's a little bit frustrating right because as a movie watcher It's like it's weird.

512
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:14,896
Speaker 0: and now on the one hand you're like just listen to the kid Ah, but on the other hand, you're like, wait a minute If if the kid was coming up and telling me that I'd be like, uh-huh.

513
00:35:15,037 --> 00:35:21,700
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, because obviously in the real world fairy tales aren't real but I know they're real only because I'm watching a movie.

514
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,547
Speaker 1: Yep, but what I will say cuz we.

515
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:27,860
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the movie in depth which requires spoilers and I cannot stress enough.

516
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:37,298
Speaker 1: just go see this movie, but the movie has a very satisfying arc and it moves pretty quick like it it doesn't that is.

517
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:58,949
Speaker 0: one thing I've Noticed between this one and their previous ones is that I felt like you know Not that the pacing in Secret of Kells or Song of the Sea was bad or wrong in any way necessarily But it was definitely Sort of a little slower had a little bit more breathing room in there during certain parts of the the narrative Whereas wolf walkers, I don't think has any breathing room.

518
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:00,213
Speaker 0: It's like they it's not.

519
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:11,740
Speaker 0: it's only 90 minutes, which is normal movie length Right, but these days a lot of movies are going two hours, but in those 90 minutes, they pack it in tight But it doesn't feel rushed at any point, right?

520
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,065
Speaker 0: It's like they figured out the exact saturation point of you know, how much they could cram into every you know second of animation.

521
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:21,293
Speaker 0: and they're like, okay, that's how much we're gonna do.

522
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:25,457
Speaker 0: and they just did it at that pace throughout the Whole thing and it just keeps moving.

523
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:33,635
Speaker 1: Yeah And then it's over it moves past Where a movie that followed the troops of this kind of story likely would.

524
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,160
Speaker 1: that's one thing I will say.

525
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,518
Speaker 0: It's like you would think the climax and the ending will be at this point in the story.

526
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:42,792
Speaker 0: It's like nope It's actually further down the road right because they're moving.

527
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:44,740
Speaker 0: at a nice clip they get further.

528
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:55,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if they had you know, it was I wonder is it like, you know Cuz Apple paid for this right and clearly it wouldn't have happened had they or not anyone else done it, right?

529
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,527
Speaker 0: Netflix could have paid for it, right?

530
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,600
Speaker 0: But if no one paid it wasn't happening, right?

531
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,022
Speaker 0: They needed.

532
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,453
Speaker 1: I mean it was very hard to get secretive Kells made.

533
00:37:01,514 --> 00:37:06,419
Speaker 1: part of the reason why secretive Kells Obvious kind of just Peters out at the end was the difficulty in funding that movie.

534
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:17,331
Speaker 0: Yep, so I mean, you know secretive Kells and song of the sea basically on that reputation from those is what you know Convinced someone like an apple to pay for this and more

535
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:22,171
Speaker 1: importantly to let Tom Moore and cartoon saloon Do what they will with the movie like

536
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:22,894
Speaker 0: yep be

537
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:23,557
Speaker 1: a little bit.

538
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:30,212
Speaker 0: I wonder Yes, I wonder if there had been less budget constraints Like let's say they just had more money right would they?

539
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,759
Speaker 0: and they didn't have to care, you know.

540
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:35,639
Speaker 0: Would they have preferred it to be two hours and spread it out a little more?

541
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:43,862
Speaker 0: But I think actually maybe this is one of those cases where they were actually helped by with by the constraints on their creativity Right.

542
00:37:43,882 --> 00:37:45,046
Speaker 0: I think the 90 minutes worked.

543
00:37:45,086 --> 00:37:46,671
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually.

544
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:47,875
Speaker 1: it's actually a hundred minutes.

545
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,735
Speaker 0: Oh Ten more minute ten more minute.

546
00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:52,520
Speaker 1: All right.

547
00:37:53,062 --> 00:38:08,252
Speaker 1: so one other thing I'll say before we get into spoiler territory is that the animation is Utterly beautiful, but also there's definitely a form as function Situation in this movie where the way it's animated and we went to.

548
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:14,696
Speaker 1: we also attended the NS the NSC film festival online Where we got to see a an explanation of this which is the reason we know this.

549
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:15,540
Speaker 0: they told it to us.

550
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:31,056
Speaker 1: But it's apparent when you watch it to town scenes and forest scenes are animated in fairly radically different styles and both are animated in the way you might Expect cartoon saloon movies in this sort of triptych or trilogy to be animated.

551
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:34,937
Speaker 1: that combined Visual storytelling is huge.

552
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:35,500
Speaker 1: in this movie.

553
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,211
Speaker 1: A lot of things are not said out loud.

554
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:42,431
Speaker 1: you figure them out because you see it Or just feel it.

555
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:45,784
Speaker 0: you can't even if you don't can't Directly pick it out.

556
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:49,320
Speaker 0: It's like if someone says it you'd be like, oh, that's obvious, right?

557
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,760
Speaker 0: So for example when you're in town or town characters, right are drawn with straighter lines, right?

558
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,326
Speaker 0: The Lord Protector is like a box.

559
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:58,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much right.

560
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 0: and the Lines around the characters and around the things in town or the town objects, right?

561
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:17,060
Speaker 0: So a wagon or you know a crossbow right are thick solid You know clear lines and the the colors are contained within the lines, right?

562
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:25,876
Speaker 0: So everything townie is very rigid and straight and the color palette for everything in town is very cold gray Right blue, you know.

563
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:41,460
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of boxes like characters are often shown like especially the the main girl Behind windows behind bars Surrounded and boxed in by things and that even like later in the movie when some soldiers leave the town.

564
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:53,100
Speaker 1: It was a very interesting stylistic choice because when they go out into the woods to do a thing They put on helmets that basically put a grid over their own faces as they go out into the woods.

565
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:57,534
Speaker 0: They make a lot of good use in the movie of the portcullis in the town.

566
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,220
Speaker 0: I love a good portcullis, right?

567
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:03,454
Speaker 0: There's a great scene where there's actually a few scenes where they show the portcullis.

568
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:12,280
Speaker 0: from a direct side view I like cross-section and this character is on the left on the town side and characters on the right on the outside the town side.

569
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:19,003
Speaker 0: And so the contrast is like split right down the middle of the frame precisely There was.

570
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:24,899
Speaker 0: so is that obviously out in the woods the colors are completely different palette green brown red.

571
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:28,997
Speaker 1: very You know warm lines are a little soft like characters.

572
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,990
Speaker 0: hair is Yep, all the lot.

573
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,460
Speaker 0: the coloring in the lot doesn't stay in the lines.

574
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,799
Speaker 0: Like the color will sort of go outside the lines a bit.

575
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:41,232
Speaker 0: The lines will be thinner and sketch here more like with a pencil then with a pen.

576
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,820
Speaker 0: Everything is hella curvy and round.

577
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:50,186
Speaker 0: Everything is round outside the town right curves and roundness No, straight lines anywhere.

578
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:54,000
Speaker 0: the trees and everything are really hyper exaggerated, right?

579
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,740
Speaker 0: Like they've not realistic but good enough, right?

580
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:05,400
Speaker 0: Until you know It's a tree and you can you just get a completely different feeling in in both places and you can see in the main character.

581
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:09,632
Speaker 0: Right is like as she becomes, you know less townie.

582
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,939
Speaker 0: You'll see like they draw her right.

583
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:22,360
Speaker 0: It's like oh her colors are coming outside her lines Right as she's a little bit less townie and you'll see that transition happens visually as well as narratively

584
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:29,620
Speaker 1: And I Think we want to spoil some things beyond this point because I actually want to talk about specific moments and scenes in the movie.

585
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,604
Speaker 0: It's a kid's movie.

586
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:32,892
Speaker 0: It's hard to talk about too much without spoiling.

587
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:39,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I cannot stress again Don't wait for Oz like just go see this movie go into it without knowing anything more about it.

588
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:40,460
Speaker 1: that we've already said.

589
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:54,560
Speaker 0: I'm Expecting you to be listening to this not because you need someone to tell you whether it's good or not before you see it But because you've already seen it and you just want to vicariously hear people talk about it and go yeah Yeah, that's the purpose of this podcast, right?

590
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,599
Speaker 0: So if you have if you're at if you're hearing my voice now and you haven't seen the movie what's wrong with you?

591
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,163
Speaker 1: So spoilers.

592
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:05,980
Speaker 1: the one thing that I was actually surprised by was that both parents survived.

593
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:15,286
Speaker 1: I was so ready for at least one if not both of them to not make it and the movie Oh, yeah, really really set me up for that.

594
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:28,200
Speaker 0: I The mom and then it's like, you know, and they really dragged that mom survives question out quite a bit, right?

595
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,447
Speaker 0: And then the dad one I was like, whoa.

596
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:32,310
Speaker 0: Oh, you go.

597
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:32,752
Speaker 0: Okay.

598
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:33,595
Speaker 0: It's like wow.

599
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:34,900
Speaker 0: I didn't see her.

600
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:46,571
Speaker 1: I was like a hundred percent sure he was going down and especially because very early in the movie you have that scene where you know, he's setting the traps and Like the girl almost steps in the track check out check offs bear trap.

601
00:42:46,772 --> 00:43:02,100
Speaker 1: Oh my god, but after you see those traps Throughout the entire film the camera will cut two shots of people's feet walking and running briefly and Every time I almost winced like is this gonna be Chekhov's trap?

602
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:13,838
Speaker 1: I was actually pretty sure that either the mom the dad or Oliver Cromwell We're gonna die in a trap or that one of the two girls was gonna get caught in a trap And that was gonna be a plot point.

603
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:19,280
Speaker 1: I'm kind of glad that didn't happen, but that actually really ratcheted up the tension on certain scenes.

604
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,530
Speaker 1: But at the same time the movie did.

605
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:35,705
Speaker 1: it wasn't just like a false Chekhov's gun because there are scenes where Robin is running through the woods and the wolf girl she's like Knows about the traps clearly and the traps are like not a problem for her But she like.

606
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:36,350
Speaker 0: traps are.

607
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:43,286
Speaker 0: the traps are a plot point But no one ever you you I expected someone to get snared in one It'd be a big deal and that never happened.

608
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:43,447
Speaker 0: people

609
00:43:43,467 --> 00:44:04,192
Speaker 1: get snared in a less horrific trap than the bear trap But there's a like the girl at one point just throws like casually Trek Trips the trap right in front of Robin while she's blindfolded So she doesn't step into it which I think was a very subtle way to show How in tune with the forest the wolves are and how they like.

610
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:11,583
Speaker 1: the traps are not actually a threat to them They're not but they're more dangerous to the humans who were laying them than they are to these Characters.

611
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:18,440
Speaker 1: in the context of this film which sets up the power of the wolves and the wolf walkers later on Like that's the subtle storytelling.

612
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:22,283
Speaker 0: Right, usually it's situated, you know Like a fern gully.

613
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:22,603
Speaker 0: right.

614
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:38,418
Speaker 0: the situation when you is that the humans are so impossibly strong with their guns and their fire Right that the woods doesn't stand a chance and the woods has to like rally or you know level up somehow to You know do something or even get away, right?

615
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,440
Speaker 0: Whereas here it's like the wolves are clearly a plus number one.

616
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:49,620
Speaker 0: The humans have nothing on them even with their guns and there's also many scenes where they're trying to shoot wolves and they can't hit.

617
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,245
Speaker 0: Shit for shit like stormtroopers.

618
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:54,756
Speaker 0: They're like pew pew pew pew pew with our shitty muskets and they can't.

619
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:55,839
Speaker 0: they can't hit anything.

620
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:57,145
Speaker 0: pistol No can't hit.

621
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,531
Speaker 0: It's like the wolves.

622
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:00,480
Speaker 0: just own the humans.

623
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:03,418
Speaker 0: They're just better in every way from the start and they know it.

624
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:13,740
Speaker 1: Right, well because the movie definitely has a very clear point of view like a lot of movies with this kind of story would try To make a point of oh, there has to be understanding and like the city and the town coexist.

625
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:23,933
Speaker 0: Whatever the movie definitely is saying the forest life is superior full stop Yep, and also that you know the wolves interestingly enough.

626
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:25,920
Speaker 0: They don't want usually this kind of story.

627
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:29,900
Speaker 0: It's like the wolves want to stop the humans from chopping down the forest, right?

628
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,017
Speaker 0: It's like no actually what's happened here is all the other wolves have left, right?

629
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,605
Speaker 0: It's like okay humans You can have this one.

630
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:37,774
Speaker 0: We'll go to a different one, right?

631
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:48,320
Speaker 0: We're gonna leave But because of the situation right with the mom This one pack is still there and as soon as they rescue the mom and resolve everything then they leave.

632
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:59,360
Speaker 1: that leads to another like big surprise that I thought was wonderful and A minor spoiler for inglorious bastards if you didn't see it because it's a similar type of situation weirdly enough.

633
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:11,560
Speaker 1: But the movie actually just has a straight-up happy ending like everyone makes it But the fact that they kill Oliver Cromwell that does not obviously happen in the real world.

634
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:18,920
Speaker 0: Oliver Oliver Cromwell, I mean he is cast as Simon McBurney as Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell.

635
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:23,920
Speaker 0: Oh, did because they never say Oliver Cromwell out loud in the movie, but you say it's in the credits.

636
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,402
Speaker 0: You saw it.

637
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:24,803
Speaker 1: It's it.

638
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:27,753
Speaker 1: the Wikipedia lists the credit as Simon McDurnie.

639
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:29,800
Speaker 1: Okay, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell.

640
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:33,936
Speaker 0: Okay, because it's like if you know anything about Oliver Cromwell you 100% know that's all.

641
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:42,500
Speaker 1: yeah genocide and subjugation of Ireland the puritanical nonsense like the English as colonizers and oppressors.

642
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:48,100
Speaker 0: But if you're a if you're a kid, they don't say the words Oliver Cromwell in the dialogue even one time.

643
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:57,987
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like that thing where adults or really smart kids who know history or maybe Irish kids who have learned this probably I imagine better than any other kids, right?

645
00:46:58,428 --> 00:47:00,033
Speaker 0: They would know right?

646
00:47:00,073 --> 00:47:02,179
Speaker 0: What's the the extra layer, right?

647
00:47:02,842 --> 00:47:11,446
Speaker 1: That's going on there, but there's like Yeah, there's the moment where he dies though and when I get back to that because that involves another thing That's how Oliver Cromwell really died.

648
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:15,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oliver Cromwell was not bitten by a wolf and dropped into a pit of spikes.

649
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's this movie the whole time.

650
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:45,040
Speaker 1: if you know history like you're thinking about like the English prevail in many ways in the real world and continue to commit their atrocities and like the history of Ireland is something you should learn about if you don't know about it, but in Inglorious Basterds the whole movie is all these people are trying to kill Hitler and you watching the movie think But I know Hitler like doesn't get assassinated.

651
00:47:45,582 --> 00:47:46,324
Speaker 1: How is this like?

652
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:46,786
Speaker 1: how does it?

653
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,070
Speaker 1: where does this movie go wrong?

654
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,724
Speaker 1: and the end of Inglorious Basterds is no this is an alternate Timeline.

655
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,650
Speaker 1: they fucking killed Hitler.

656
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,604
Speaker 1: everybody succeeded This movie.

657
00:47:55,665 --> 00:48:03,433
Speaker 1: similarly the happy ending just the for the family Leaving on their own off into the woods clearly happy clearly free.

658
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:04,937
Speaker 1: They've escaped the English.

659
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,831
Speaker 1: like it's an Abjectly 100% happy ending.

660
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,220
Speaker 1: escaping the city was the right choice for everyone.

661
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:19,453
Speaker 1: It's very refreshing to see a movie that has such a strong Note to end on like that just the scene where the four of them are in the cart.

662
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,399
Speaker 1: The dad is clearly.

663
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:30,220
Speaker 1: I Think it's heavily implied that him and The other mom have now formed a relationship of some kind the way they are interacting.

664
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:35,072
Speaker 0: The two girls and also the two the two daughters are clearly, you know, they're.

665
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:36,778
Speaker 0: it's like it, you know.

666
00:48:36,858 --> 00:48:41,575
Speaker 0: on the one hand You usually when a movie like avoids being explicitly gay.

667
00:48:41,636 --> 00:48:47,437
Speaker 0: when it's trying to be gay You usually want to call them out for not being you know explicit and trying to sort of.

668
00:48:47,617 --> 00:48:53,880
Speaker 0: you know Work both sides right like that, but you know, these characters are too young.

669
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:56,340
Speaker 0: So I think that's kind of okay.

670
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:16,300
Speaker 1: it was both a coming-of-age story an escape from oppression story and a Coming-out story or an awakening story for these characters especially when you watch Robin and her progression and her like getting curious and Interacting with the wolf girl and changing herself as she realizes things about herself.

671
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:18,649
Speaker 1: Which gets into the third thing I love about this movie.

672
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:20,456
Speaker 1: when a character gets some magic.

673
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:23,129
Speaker 1: They just use it There's like well, I'm magic now.

674
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,355
Speaker 1: I'm gonna magic.

675
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,782
Speaker 1: I Hate it.

676
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:33,600
Speaker 0: There's no characters get magic and don't use it intelligently in any media Or don't use it to the fullest extent of its power.

677
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:41,542
Speaker 0: Yep The only way the only way in which there is any holding back on power in this movie is I think obviously because it's a children's Movie.

678
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:49,370
Speaker 0: the wolves in the action scenes, which are really well animated Did not at any point just like mall someone right.

679
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:58,344
Speaker 0: so it's like there were some times where like, you know It's like if it wasn't a kids movie that wolf could have just like tore open that dude's neck with his teeth And that would have been it right.

680
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:02,117
Speaker 0: and they they don't do that, but they do everything else, right?

681
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:14,443
Speaker 0: So And I just chalked that up to not wanting to show someone's intestines getting Don't show goring and mauling of people in a children's movie, but the movie Appropriate.

682
00:50:14,524 --> 00:50:21,352
Speaker 1: it set up the rules of magic Partly by explanation but mostly by again visual storytelling.

683
00:50:21,592 --> 00:50:22,214
Speaker 1: the bite marks.

684
00:50:22,274 --> 00:50:24,060
Speaker 1: check out his bite mark on the dad.

685
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,307
Speaker 0: They just you just what they no point.

686
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:30,020
Speaker 0: was there a scene where someone explains what wolf walking does, right?

687
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,602
Speaker 0: I guess there was.

688
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:32,329
Speaker 1: it's like there's a little bit of like when we're asleep.

689
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:33,674
Speaker 0: It's a very short one.

690
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:34,136
Speaker 0: Actually.

691
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's like.

692
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,559
Speaker 0: She's like yeah when I go to sleep I'm a wolf and then I wake up in the morning and that's it.

693
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:40,644
Speaker 0: That's like all.

694
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:49,114
Speaker 1: that's all the explanation you get and like oh don't bite people or they'll turn into a wolf walker But the fact that biting someone turns them into a wolf walker is used twice.

695
00:50:49,134 --> 00:50:53,793
Speaker 1: the mom like the dad gets bitten Possibly on purpose like that.

696
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,199
Speaker 1: That's just that's part of the movie.

697
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,716
Speaker 1: Yeah And I love that cuz that sets up the scene at the end with the Lord Protector where he is bitten.

698
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:01,960
Speaker 1: the magic is there.

699
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:05,698
Speaker 1: It is very clear that the healing magic could have saved him.

700
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:14,580
Speaker 1: He would have become a wolf walker and he explicitly chooses death rather than becoming like the wolf walkers.

701
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:16,417
Speaker 1: Fuck him.

702
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:19,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's a bad guy, but I like that.

703
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:20,710
Speaker 1: he chose his own death.

704
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:22,376
Speaker 1: I think they would have saved him.

705
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:32,599
Speaker 1: He chose this which very much sets up the One-note portrayal of that character and I think the one note of him really fits what this movie is.

706
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:40,040
Speaker 1: My only complaint about him like if I have any critique of this movie, there is one thing that happened a few too many times.

707
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,948
Speaker 1: Cromwell would tell the dead to do something.

708
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:45,472
Speaker 1: the dad wouldn't do it.

709
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:47,699
Speaker 1: Cromwell would then say well you fucked up.

710
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:51,282
Speaker 1: now If you fuck up one more time You're fucked.

711
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,453
Speaker 1: and then there really wouldn't be that many consequences for him.

712
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:58,020
Speaker 1: and that just kept happening over and over.

713
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:10,619
Speaker 0: eventually like he eventually made him like a foot soldier instead of a hunter and then He was still right there like doing the hunting job in the foot soldier costume, basically like that dialogue of.

714
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:14,073
Speaker 1: Here are consequences and then they're not really followed up on directly.

715
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,740
Speaker 1: happened a few too many times.

716
00:52:16,122 --> 00:52:18,436
Speaker 0: I feel like this is I think once or twice extra.

717
00:52:18,456 --> 00:52:18,738
Speaker 0: I agree.

718
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:26,109
Speaker 0: Yeah So the movie does have but I think because it's so speedy and jam-packed There wasn't a lot of time.

719
00:52:26,189 --> 00:52:28,419
Speaker 0: screen time for side characters, right?

720
00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:33,642
Speaker 1: Like a really good character the guy in the see look at something like an Aladdin Right.

721
00:52:33,682 --> 00:52:40,599
Speaker 0: an Aladdin gives quite a bit of time to like, you know, Iago the bird right or a poo the monkey Right or whatever, right?

722
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:49,715
Speaker 0: This doesn't give so much time to anyone other than the four main character, you know Even the mom right the mom the dad the two girls and Cromwell.

723
00:52:49,815 --> 00:52:50,899
Speaker 0: pretty much no one else is on.

724
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,104
Speaker 0: I mean really me.

725
00:52:52,244 --> 00:52:54,873
Speaker 1: all the wolves together are almost like one character.

726
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:56,780
Speaker 1: all the non wolf walker wolves.

727
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:58,226
Speaker 0: They're just like this spin on speed.

728
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:01,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just a fluid mass of undifferentiated wolves I like.

729
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:10,349
Speaker 0: the only other characters are like the the scullery maid who talks for like a minute maybe not even right and Fair child work his prayer.

730
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,377
Speaker 0: the old man in the stocks is like the best.

731
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:13,120
Speaker 0: He's awesome.

732
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,379
Speaker 0: Well, cuz he's interesting also doesn't have a lot of time.

733
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:16,605
Speaker 1: he like this.

734
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:25,095
Speaker 1: is this again the movie really subtly addresses like the cycles of Subjugation and oppression colonizer and colonized in that he like that.

735
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:26,800
Speaker 1: he almost represents the villagers.

736
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:34,580
Speaker 1: They fear the wolves and want to like tear use the forest to enrich themselves and better their lives.

737
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:39,920
Speaker 1: So they're at odds with the wolves But at the same time they are also at odds with the English.

738
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:50,840
Speaker 1: but the English are at odds with the wolves and the English like so they're sort of dependent upon each other in this triangle of Dependency and animosity and subjugation and oppression.

739
00:53:50,920 --> 00:54:01,620
Speaker 1: You don't see something that nuanced in a movie like this that often usually it's all the good guys Here are the bad guys, but also visually speaking right the old man in the stocks, right?

740
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:04,240
Speaker 0: He's on the one hand a villager.

741
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:11,400
Speaker 0: He's drawn with the solid lines that are colored in right on the inside, but his character design is very round.

742
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:16,860
Speaker 0: He's got a round jolly kind of Santa Claus ish kind of look and feel to him, right?

743
00:54:17,682 --> 00:54:25,736
Speaker 1: You know even in the stocks, he's like Like oh the wolves are scary, but then he's like yeah, but a wolf saved me.

744
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:27,644
Speaker 1: so Maybe they're alright.

745
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:29,391
Speaker 1: and then where the wolves come to fuck up the English.

746
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:31,739
Speaker 1: He's like fucking go wolves get him get him.

747
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

748
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,279
Speaker 0: So it's like because he has that wolf woods alliance that he's drawn with a rounder shape to him.

749
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:45,246
Speaker 0: but yeah, there's also a couple other good like Fun animation bits going on.

750
00:54:45,266 --> 00:54:47,793
Speaker 0: there's like a funny donkey right the bird.

751
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,478
Speaker 0: the bird is awesome.

752
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,095
Speaker 1: the sheep The chaos of sheep was one of my favorite animated scenes other than running.

753
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:55,300
Speaker 0: chaos of sheep was good.

754
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,323
Speaker 0: Also the wolves.

755
00:54:56,464 --> 00:55:07,100
Speaker 0: sometimes the wolves are in a swarmy pack similar to what Miyazaki like Beautiful like if you look at in Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke are the two biggest examples.

756
00:55:07,281 --> 00:55:15,598
Speaker 0: But Miyazaki does this a lot where they'll be like a swarm or a blob of something Spirited away when the sprites are all in a big blob, right.

757
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:19,659
Speaker 0: or you know The the water is crashing around in the inn and stuff like that, right?

758
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,260
Speaker 0: It's like he does that kind of thing.

759
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,779
Speaker 0: The wolves will sometimes do that blob movement where the pack is just in a blob, right?

760
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,460
Speaker 0: But then sometimes they'll all like line up rigidly in a grid, right?

761
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:43,972
Speaker 1: Healing magic tapestry or illumination where they're two-dimensional like they form like almost a painting Yeah, or a scene you'd watch the movie to see.

762
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:52,760
Speaker 1: it's really hard to explain this without some visual aid But the move cartoon saloon in general with these three movies has used perspective a to great effect.

763
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:57,384
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That's the one.

764
00:55:57,425 --> 00:55:58,410
Speaker 0: last thing is the.

765
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:03,940
Speaker 0: there are a lot of common Visual tropes they use between all three movies.

766
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:16,060
Speaker 0: The one that I stands out the most to me is that when they're showing the town like from far away like zoomed out It the town is drawn almost Cartographically, right and you'll see this in Secret of Kells.

767
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:16,762
Speaker 0: It's.

768
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:29,546
Speaker 0: the town is drawn like it's on a map, right and you'll even see scenes like a little character is walking onto the map Right and then it'll zoom into the town in store Song of the sea right?

769
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,108
Speaker 0: You'll like.

770
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:33,360
Speaker 0: they'll show the island as like two-dimensional from far away, right?

771
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,719
Speaker 0: It's like a little house on top of a rock, right?

772
00:56:36,903 --> 00:56:46,180
Speaker 0: And here when the town is shown from far away It's like a rectangle right well of walls filled with little tiny houses right and like, you know a game.

773
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:52,764
Speaker 0: And then only when they zoom in further do they get away from that sort of Style.

774
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:59,660
Speaker 0: so it's like there's a lot of like common Things between all three movies, but that's that's like the most visible one, right?

775
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,759
Speaker 0: It's like oh when they show the town and zoom out they draw it like it's a map.

776
00:57:03,442 --> 00:57:14,480
Speaker 1: Now and I know even as I a little while ago said to the effect of you know critiquing the The circular discussion between the punishment of the dad from Cromwell and how he's still there almost went on too many times.

777
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:20,780
Speaker 1: at the same time The dad was dependent upon the Lord Protector for his livelihood.

778
00:57:21,182 --> 00:57:29,960
Speaker 1: Like he didn't have all that he even if he had other options He did not realize it and he may not have even from the beginning is clearly not liking the Lord Protector.

779
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,500
Speaker 0: He's just sort of resigned to the fact that he has to do this.

780
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,522
Speaker 1: he has no choice and the right this to survive almost turns into a Will.

781
00:57:38,562 --> 00:57:39,826
Speaker 1: you follow me this far.

782
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:41,470
Speaker 1: is how about this far?

783
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,654
Speaker 1: How about this far?

784
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:44,900
Speaker 1: and he keeps every step he takes?

785
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,479
Speaker 1: he has to be more like the suppressor to be in his good graces for his own livelihood.

786
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:56,778
Speaker 1: and You see his struggle to break out of that cycle because attempting to break out of that cycle might just mean him and his daughter Die

787
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:09,459
Speaker 0: Yep, so he finally does break out right and it's the scene where he does break out is great because he's like he's doing all This stuff right trying to just you know caring about his livelihood even though he doesn't like what he has to do.

788
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:12,631
Speaker 0: Right because he wants to protect his daughter.

789
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,863
Speaker 0: right and then right He's like he's are.

790
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:23,269
Speaker 0: he's finally actually arguing with with his daughter a little bit and not just ignoring her and saying shut up Right.

791
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:25,946
Speaker 0: and he's like, you know I don't want you to end up in a cage.

792
00:58:26,026 --> 00:58:28,738
Speaker 0: and the movie has had so much cage imagery in it.

793
00:58:28,858 --> 00:58:35,484
Speaker 0: the port Cullises the gates on the faces of the soldiers the mom wolf in a cage It's just in cages.

794
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:37,874
Speaker 0: all over this movie right in the house is a cage.

795
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:42,771
Speaker 1: the windows everything That seems like a bolt of lightning in the movie, right?

796
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:45,660
Speaker 0: And then she's like, well, I already am in a cage, right?

797
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,036
Speaker 0: She's like I'm imprisoned in this house in this town with walls.

798
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:57,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like, you know the whole start the big very beginning of the movie is I want to get out of the house I want to leave town and I'm not allowed to write and immediately leaves town.

799
00:59:00,263 --> 00:59:02,719
Speaker 0: And that's when the dad realizes I think like oops

800
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:14,773
Speaker 1: but also the dad when the dad becomes a wolf to Like because he gives his daughter when she says that like she is a wolf and she is basically decided I am going to live with the wolves regardless of what you do like.

801
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:16,520
Speaker 1: she has made her choice.

802
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,740
Speaker 0: We done see you town sucks.

803
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:24,659
Speaker 0: And oh and there's those those kids in town the bullies who have a cage.

804
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're toy that they they bring with them everywhere.

805
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:29,160
Speaker 0: right the town bully kids.

806
00:59:29,286 --> 00:59:44,532
Speaker 1: Yep Which the allegory of the scene where she is Robin is trying to protect the wolf girl Just like her dad is trying trying to protect her and she basically tricks those kids into locking the wolf girl up in a cage During a pivotal scene.

807
00:59:45,055 --> 00:59:46,402
Speaker 1: and then yeah that's sort of where

808
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:46,844
Speaker 0: she on

809
00:59:47,747 --> 01:00:02,431
Speaker 1: one hand understands why her dad is coming from and also understands what the right thing to do like that scene is like her character transformation and then her saying I was already in a cage is Her like revealing of that and like the final decision.

810
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:03,033
Speaker 0: Yep.

811
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's the climax of the movie.

812
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,788
Speaker 0: And right after that is pretty much just resolution.

813
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:15,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Of okay, everyone's on this these sides now everyone's figured out their shit, but now we're gonna kill the big bag.

814
01:00:15,432 --> 01:00:18,370
Speaker 1: I also I like how the like it when she turns into a wolf like that.

815
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,699
Speaker 1: Magic is also very like.

816
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:28,947
Speaker 1: the rules of magic are very well Like she becomes a wolf literally and the consequences of her literally being a wolf are immediate and direct.

817
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:35,787
Speaker 1: Oh They also do this like the dad goes upstairs and there's a wolf Like what the fuck.

818
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:40,807
Speaker 0: My favorite episode of Samurai Jack is the one where there's the three art is there's no void.

819
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:41,550
Speaker 0: There's no dialogue.

820
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:45,488
Speaker 0: There's the three archers on the tower and Samurai Jack is trying to get up there to go to the.

821
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:52,246
Speaker 0: well Yeah, I was thinking that the whole time Samurai Jack can't beat the the archers, right?

822
01:00:52,286 --> 01:00:53,030
Speaker 0: They're too dangerous.

823
01:00:53,211 --> 01:01:01,884
Speaker 0: So he ends up like training and closing his eyes and learning to hear the arrows instead of seeing them Which makes no sense because the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

824
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:02,547
Speaker 0: but ignore that.

825
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:10,989
Speaker 0: Yeah But like In that Samurai Jack episode they do this thing where the screen is black, right?

826
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:18,827
Speaker 0: suggesting to you that set that Jack has his eyes closed and then they begin drawing single objects and playing that.

827
01:01:18,947 --> 01:01:24,984
Speaker 0: the sounds that go With those objects to illustrate how Jack is has his can't see.

828
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:35,261
Speaker 0: he's intentionally blindfolded himself But he can see the world through hearing right as these objects appear Drawn at a different art style and this movie does the same thing.

829
01:01:35,722 --> 01:01:40,981
Speaker 0: is like you're a wolf now and they draw everything To suggest to you.

830
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,710
Speaker 0: This is how the wolf sees the world.

831
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:45,176
Speaker 0: Smells are now drawn.

832
01:01:45,196 --> 01:01:47,101
Speaker 0: It's like they draw the smells.

833
01:01:47,482 --> 01:01:49,487
Speaker 1: that is such a beautiful scene.

834
01:01:49,507 --> 01:01:52,417
Speaker 0: any Vibrations that go through the floor.

835
01:01:52,537 --> 01:02:02,370
Speaker 0: they draw them right to illustrate and get across the point that yeah The wolf has these enhanced senses and sees the world this way and the human sees the world this way, right?

836
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:11,649
Speaker 1: Which you then is used to great effect both for that amazing running with a wolf scene where the like Robin Embraces being a wolf like like that's it.

837
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,446
Speaker 1: She's a wolf now.

838
01:02:12,931 --> 01:02:21,739
Speaker 1: Well simultaneously when the dad becomes a wolf and he starts to experience these things but without any help or friendship or context Like he doesn't understand what's happening at first.

839
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:26,443
Speaker 0: He's just suddenly a wolf like oops not But it was set up.
