1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,330
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 18th 2016.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,859
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight Crypto ransomware and why it can really only fuck you if you're dumb.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,443
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,255
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

5
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,559
Speaker 0: It's warm.

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,144
Speaker 1: Yeah And then it was cold.

7
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,207
Speaker 1: It was warm and it was cold that I thought it was summer.

8
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:42,371
Speaker 1: then it snowed and In fact, I didn't even do.

9
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:47,500
Speaker 1: usually there's a bunch of stuff I do to my bike because I like I grease it up in the winter because I do use it occasionally.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,785
Speaker 1: You know salt and all that nastiness.

11
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:52,540
Speaker 1: so I put heavy grease on and then I switch it for summer grease in the spring.

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:01:03,880
Speaker 1: I hadn't done the switch up yet because the weather had been coming and going but it was so nice today I was like fuck it and I just bike to work anyway and halfway through the bike ride Of course squeaky squeaky squeaky squeaky squeaky.

13
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:10,560
Speaker 1: So I've stopped and bought some teflon and lubed it up and it's it's spring now and we bike to work every day.

14
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:11,738
Speaker 1: I feel real good.

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,992
Speaker 0: hmm So I'm sure at this point in time was like 2015 2016. now.

16
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,701
Speaker 0: It's 2016.

17
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:24,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, people have heard like this babymetal thing that's going around Right.

18
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:27,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because I internet I knew about this a long time ago.

19
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:35,728
Speaker 0: Right as I know tend to know about a lot of things in advance because I internet so much But I usually what happens is I'll be like man.

20
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,071
Speaker 0: There's this thing.

21
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,936
Speaker 0: I knew about it before you.

22
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:42,971
Speaker 0: I'm so cool like a hipster But in this case, I was so wrong.

23
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,580
Speaker 0: I was the wrongest that you could be All right.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,760
Speaker 0: When I first saw babymetal, which was like they're actually I think they started like way back when they were in like middle school.

25
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 0: And at that point they were in middle school.

26
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,980
Speaker 0: They were really small and they didn't have a band or anything.

27
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:07,956
Speaker 0: It was actually the sort of like an offshoot of like a regular old idol group or whatever Right and when I first saw it, it was pretty much just oh, yeah, that makes sense.

28
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,080
Speaker 0: It's a weird Japan thing.

29
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,669
Speaker 0: I've seen those like a million times.

30
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,460
Speaker 0: I mean how many Japan things like that?

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,940
Speaker 1: I mean, that was the era where weird Japan was just like an even regular old pop culture, right?

32
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,148
Speaker 0: It's like you always see up.

33
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,960
Speaker 0: There's another thing that's weird from Japan.

34
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaker 0: They combine two things that hadn't been combined before or they took something from someone else and redid it, right?

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like okay.

36
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,880
Speaker 0: They made an idol group that happens to have metal music in the background.

37
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,179
Speaker 0: That's a cute one-shot thing, right?

38
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,243
Speaker 0: You know.

39
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:39,885
Speaker 0: and then you know, I saw it again and I'm like, oh maybe like two years ago I think maybe one or two years ago.

40
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:44,440
Speaker 0: I saw it again and I'm like, oh, I guess that kept going that thing, right?

41
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,690
Speaker 0: It's still not really a big deal, right?

42
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,776
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's you know weird thing.

43
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,889
Speaker 0: It's not commonly known It's just some you know, it's just a j-pop idol group.

44
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:55,691
Speaker 0: That's not good.

45
00:02:55,731 --> 00:03:06,560
Speaker 0: It's like perfect blue only it's metal right big deal Right, so and they you know, they were like, I know that they opened when like Lady Gaga had this weird tour in 2014.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:15,106
Speaker 0: I think that was like the art pop tour the art rave or something because crayon pop opened for that and like she originally wanted Crayon pop to open for the whole thing.

47
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,230
Speaker 0: I think couldn't.

48
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,300
Speaker 0: so babymetal opened for the other ones, right?

49
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,656
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, I guess they're still around right, but I didn't really care.

50
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:24,700
Speaker 1: is where this is going, right?

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,840
Speaker 0: I didn't care or like them at all, right?

52
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:35,369
Speaker 0: So then of course recently I'm sure now everyone knows who they are because they performed on Colbert's show Which used to be Letterman show which has a history.

53
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:43,158
Speaker 0: actually if people aren't aware of letting weird acts perform Yeah at the end of the show like going back to like PB Herman and even earlier, right?

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:52,690
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of people became famous You know in the United States because they were their weird-ass act was able to perform on that show Regardless of who is hosting it, right?

55
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,258
Speaker 0: So now everyone knows who they are.

56
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,492
Speaker 0: So because they came back again and like this is like.

57
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,160
Speaker 0: I've seen them now multiple times over the years.

58
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:06,093
Speaker 0: I was like why like I was like, why are they still here?

59
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:06,534
Speaker 0: Right?

60
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,960
Speaker 0: This is like a one-shot gimmick deal, right?

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,763
Speaker 0: Isn't this a gimmick?

62
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,851
Speaker 0: How is this gimmick continuing to last?

63
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,920
Speaker 1: Well, is it a gimmick if you're the only one?

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,642
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not.

65
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:20,240
Speaker 1: they're not quite guar level of like having the legend of Krauser happening there.

66
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:24,574
Speaker 0: That is how I was wrong because after they appeared on Colbert.

67
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,320
Speaker 0: I said, why are they still here this gimmick?

68
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,605
Speaker 0: Why is this not gone?

69
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:33,170
Speaker 0: This one this one-shot deal, so I looked into it Secretly without me noticing.

70
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:38,819
Speaker 0: for these past two years They have done something that I didn't realize could be done, right?

71
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,459
Speaker 0: And that is they are not what I thought they were.

72
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:49,340
Speaker 0: I thought that they were a Japanese idol group that happened to have metal music in the background.

73
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,312
Speaker 0: Right, you know of their regular idol songs and whatever.

74
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,499
Speaker 0: right that is not what they are.

75
00:04:56,144 --> 00:05:02,800
Speaker 0: Babymetal is Actually a completely legit metal band that happens to have Japanese idols.

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,227
Speaker 1: Wait, so you'd never listen to them like you?

77
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,451
Speaker 1: never no no.

78
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,012
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

79
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,600
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not the music that is legit, right?

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:21,035
Speaker 0: first of all when they got a band to back them up instead of just like a recording that helped a lot because The band that backs them up known as the kami band Right the god band is like literally.

81
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:21,900
Speaker 0: they went around Japan.

82
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,226
Speaker 0: I got like the best drummer.

83
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:31,300
Speaker 0: the best guitar is the bit like the best people that they could find Right and they made this band like the drummer used to be in the blue man group and the bassist is like this.

84
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,312
Speaker 1: Used to be in the blue man group is not a significant.

85
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,400
Speaker 0: It's not easy to be in the blue man group.

86
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:38,886
Speaker 0: You got to be talented to be.

87
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,071
Speaker 1: I'm saying there's a lot of them like.

88
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,260
Speaker 1: there's a lot of skilled percussionists in the world.

89
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,964
Speaker 0: He's really good, right?

90
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,168
Speaker 1: I'm not saying he's not.

91
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,752
Speaker 0: the bassist is some crazy six.

92
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,256
Speaker 1: There's a lot of big man.

93
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,125
Speaker 0: There are many yes But anyway, right.

94
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:57,560
Speaker 0: so they got like the totally like the sickest band that you could get of Japanese musicians or whatever.

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:12,400
Speaker 0: But like if you go online and look for performances that aren't say on late-night American TV It's like they've been performing it like Gigantic music festival in the UK with like a hundred thousand metalheads and shit, right?

96
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:20,898
Speaker 0: And I realized watching this that like oh my god This was the secret that all the other Japanese shit has not been able to do right.

97
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:28,573
Speaker 0: It's like if you look at like you go to the complex store For example, right and you see the manga and the manga is separate right?

98
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,417
Speaker 0: It's not with the other comics.

99
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,614
Speaker 0: It's Japanese comics, it's Japanese first and comic.

100
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:35,800
Speaker 1: Oh, I see we're going with this.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:42,560
Speaker 1: So they were just popular among metal people but not as a Japanese weird thing just as metal.

102
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:48,760
Speaker 0: Yes, every metal band has a gimmick right, you know Blind Guardian has a Lord of the Rings gimmick, right?

103
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,144
Speaker 1: What was Metallica's gimmick?

104
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,609
Speaker 0: No, they don't have a gimmick.

105
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,231
Speaker 0: That's their game.

106
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,599
Speaker 0: They're the only metal band that doesn't have a gimmick.

107
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,350
Speaker 0: AC/DC has like the schoolboy thing going on You know, it's like market machine.

108
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,380
Speaker 0: supremacy has the Commodore 64 thing going on.

109
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:05,464
Speaker 0: You know every.

110
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:10,100
Speaker 0: you know, Ramstein has the ridiculous stage things going on flaming penises.

111
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,880
Speaker 0: Every metal band you can think of has some kind of gimmick, right?

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:36,345
Speaker 0: This is a baby metal is a completely normal metal band right of Relatively moderate to high quality and that just has and their gimmick just happens to be Japanese high school girls Right, and I realized all the other Japanese stuff that can't break in right is because it's all the other cool Japan shit, right?

113
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:40,299
Speaker 0: It's because it makes itself Japanese first instead of what it is first.

114
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:45,227
Speaker 1: Like we've always said, you know, not that it's not Wednesday But with anime just take a show.

115
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,440
Speaker 1: that would be you know appeal to a demographic and just put it on.

116
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,344
Speaker 0: So this is so.

117
00:07:49,384 --> 00:08:02,109
Speaker 0: it's the fact that they're still there and they're that as big as they are I didn't realize just how big they were is proof right that the things that we've been saying all along are True and would really work if you were smart enough to try them.

118
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,545
Speaker 0: and apparently whoever runs this shit there at baby metal incorporated Knows what the hell they're doing.

119
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,451
Speaker 1: Are they actually baby metal incorporated?

120
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,193
Speaker 1: Did you just call them that?

121
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:10,775
Speaker 0: because it's some.

122
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,320
Speaker 0: it's some like something entertainment company.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,540
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you're like baby metal incorporated because that's literally what they are technically call.

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,313
Speaker 0: I mean baby metal is probably making all the money that they make now.

125
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't imagine the Like.

126
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:22,848
Speaker 0: they were the other idol groups.

127
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:23,590
Speaker 0: they have whatever.

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,697
Speaker 0: I can't imagine they're making a lot of money, right?

129
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:32,807
Speaker 0: Yeah So actually they have some crazy world tour going on now, right which is why they were performing and whatnot.

130
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:36,279
Speaker 0: because they guess their second album came out at the beginning of April or whatever.

131
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,260
Speaker 0: and So I was like, oh I wonder where this world tour is going.

132
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,820
Speaker 0: The world tour is ending and like some extravaganza at the Tokyo Dome like later in the year

133
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:45,784
Speaker 1: I'm not going to that

134
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:49,161
Speaker 0: it's gonna be in New York on May the 4th May

135
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:50,426
Speaker 1: the old Star Wars day

136
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,660
Speaker 0: and it was sold out something like oh, oh well stub hub.

137
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,487
Speaker 0: I went on stub hub and you know what?

138
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,351
Speaker 0: It was cheap.

139
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:57,596
Speaker 1: Oh, do you get tickets?

140
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:58,620
Speaker 0: I bought one ticket.

141
00:08:58,901 --> 00:08:59,865
Speaker 1: I guess I'm fine.

142
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,508
Speaker 0: Maybe we should go.

143
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:01,773
Speaker 0: I figured why not?

144
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:05,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like Okay, I'm not going to Hong Kong.

145
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:15,034
Speaker 0: It's on Wednesday and it's like four blocks from my office and it's like well Why be alive if I'm not gonna go?

00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,287
Speaker 0: it's right there Also get tickets and it's at the.

147
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,615
Speaker 0: it's at you know, I guess it's not it used to be.

148
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:23,120
Speaker 1: is it seating or like GA?

149
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,324
Speaker 0: It's GA.

150
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 0: So it's that ensure making sure it's at the PlayStation theater, which used to be the Nokia theater.

151
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,091
Speaker 1: Oh be I know where that is.

152
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we saw Blind Guardian.

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Speaker 1: We did see Blind Guardian there, right?

154
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,853
Speaker 1: So like that was that that was one of the rim is an old man.

155
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:39,540
Speaker 1: concerts cuz we went and it was great.

156
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:45,340
Speaker 1: There was the front rivers mosh and whatever and we all went to the back and sat in those seats.

157
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,930
Speaker 1: I just enjoyed the concert sitting there enjoying the music.

158
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,536
Speaker 0: I got new earplugs - I haven't used them yet.

159
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah.

160
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,252
Speaker 0: So like I've been sort of like once I realized what I had missed.

161
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:59,123
Speaker 0: right that's sort of and it's all on Spotify by the Way all their music.

162
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 0: so that sort of occupied my brain for like a whole day As soon as I realized what I had not paid attention to and was wrong about.

163
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:35,493
Speaker 1: So in terms of occupying people's brains This is most people are associating what I'm about to bring up with games the video game industry all that But it is equally associated but less talked about in tech and almost every modern profession that involves coding technology art anything and while this is not specifically technology it is Really important to talk about and it's also so close to all these issues.

164
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:36,998
Speaker 0: and oh this guy.

165
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,306
Speaker 1: Yeah this guy Okay, so it's like yes.

166
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:51,664
Speaker 1: We know this is not technically technology, but it's too close to home and Never before has there been an individual person who so exemplifies these toxic fucking attitudes Like I.

167
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:52,607
Speaker 0: can I mean well this?

168
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:56,600
Speaker 0: this is something that is a constant rumble which with occasional spikes, right?

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,671
Speaker 0: But this is the largest spike in this discussion that has ever occurred.

170
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:05,606
Speaker 0: so far despite me constantly trying to make it spike I haven't been able to do so.

171
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,600
Speaker 0: I guess you need the troll to make it spike and not be smart beavers.

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,349
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the reason it's spiking is that Alex st.

173
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,029
Speaker 1: John the shithead we're talking about to talk about is in Relation to John st.

174
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,290
Speaker 0: John.

175
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,256
Speaker 1: No who is amazing.

176
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,020
Speaker 0: Oh, he's a video.

177
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,600
Speaker 0: That's right.

178
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:27,280
Speaker 0: the video game aspect brought in the extra community power and not just the up because the last spike was the Second biggest spike was the EA guy.

179
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and he was.

180
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,831
Speaker 0: that was also games that I haven't seen.

181
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:40,660
Speaker 1: a lot of spikes in this just in pure technology area and I think it's partly because Game development like people assume and expect both publicly and privately that it's awful.

182
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,014
Speaker 1: But this is more whispered in technology.

183
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:44,817
Speaker 1: Like you don't have nothing.

184
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,400
Speaker 0: It's whispered.

185
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,264
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

186
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,631
Speaker 0: you know, I think it's technology.

187
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:48,254
Speaker 0: people like it.

188
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:55,950
Speaker 1: I have okay, so I'll put it this way I have never seen someone who has a slideshow of the presentation He gave on how to hire people.

189
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,060
Speaker 1: that literally spells out.

190
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:02,754
Speaker 1: It'd be like if the Communist Party in Soviet Russia legit was like.

191
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,960
Speaker 1: here's the slide on how we will oppress the work.

192
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:09,788
Speaker 1: Here's the slide on how this is just animal farm Like it is.

193
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,083
Speaker 1: so the deal is Someone.

194
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,274
Speaker 1: Dean Takahashi just wrote this article which was pretty smart.

195
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:16,819
Speaker 1: He's basically like look he's okay guy.

196
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:25,480
Speaker 1: Yeah He's like look video games have a problem and that we have perpetual crunch like due to poor planning and poor expectations and exploitation.

197
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:32,900
Speaker 1: We expect video game developers to work 70 80 hour weeks when there's literally no reason for it to be that way.

198
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:36,150
Speaker 1: no, and Alex st.

199
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,574
Speaker 1: John on venture beat decided to write an article in response to that.

200
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:48,472
Speaker 1: what I'm reading from is Rami Ismail who wrote a response to Alex st.

201
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:56,638
Speaker 1: John's response to Dean Takahashi Where he basically eviscerated this guy, but the gist of the article was that?

202
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:13,749
Speaker 1: People in Video games but you can apply this orthogonally tackle obviously need to work Crazy hours and not have hobbies outside of their work and dedicate their entire lives to their job or else They've fallen victim to the.

203
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:14,793
Speaker 1: what is it?

204
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,639
Speaker 1: the wage slave attitude?

205
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,000
Speaker 1: Uh-huh that and he goes on and on about how you should feel privileged to work like this.

206
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,292
Speaker 1: All you're doing is pushing a mouse around.

207
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,820
Speaker 1: you're not doing real work.

208
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:28,966
Speaker 1: So why would you?

209
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,178
Speaker 1: why do you feel like you should have to only work like 40 hours?

210
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,379
Speaker 1: Why do you feel like you should go home and see kids?

211
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,658
Speaker 0: Because I'm not a loser like you as a life.

212
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,939
Speaker 0: Yeah I have things to do beside if I only work because I have to not because I want to.

213
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:49,144
Speaker 0: there's not my fault that you have nothing in your entire life other than work that fulfills you and you're a pile of human garbage.

214
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:57,040
Speaker 1: and he's basically arguing that the idea of work-life balance is a myth and that you Cannot exist in the games.

215
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,680
Speaker 0: It sounds like someone who has no life and just wants no others to have a life because that makes him feel bad.

216
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:09,196
Speaker 1: It's a it's a lot like Like, you know, we gave Cliffy B a chance when he gave that keynote at PAX.

217
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:09,880
Speaker 1: I was like, you know what?

218
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,361
Speaker 1: I'll listen.

219
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:11,306
Speaker 1: I'll hear this guy out.

220
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,256
Speaker 0: I mean, I listen to David Jaffe.

221
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:13,979
Speaker 0: Listen, it could be.

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe he's better than David Jaffe stuff.

223
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,092
Speaker 1: That is true.

224
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,116
Speaker 1: That is true.

225
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:19,200
Speaker 0: That doesn't say he's good.

226
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,570
Speaker 0: He's a less smelly poop of the same flavor.

227
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,016
Speaker 1: He's pooping is.

228
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:24,960
Speaker 0: they're both poops.

229
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,420
Speaker 0: One of them is like a diarrhea and one of them just some turds.

230
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,431
Speaker 1: But Cliffy B's didn't really come out until later when unrelated to that keynote But he said a bunch of crap online.

231
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:39,599
Speaker 0: We're like, okay He seemed at the keynote like he knew better and he was trying but he just couldn't hide it.

232
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,839
Speaker 0: Yep, he couldn't hold it in but him too like this.

233
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:54,599
Speaker 1: they have this like ridiculous idea of how tech workers should live their lives and they're sort of building this narrative to try to almost demonize people who have social lives or

234
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,083
Speaker 0: because they don't want

235
00:14:56,123 --> 00:15:09,694
Speaker 1: to work 40 or 50 hours a week tops and do other things in the rest of their time and It wouldn't be that much news except that because of this teardown of it Everyone's talking about this.

236
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:12,880
Speaker 0: finally I've been trying to get people to talk about this for a long time.

237
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:20,784
Speaker 0: Because all you see on the startup things are people glorifying the you know, eat ramen, you know live in a startup house Get paid with.

238
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:26,373
Speaker 0: you know lottery tickets kind of culture and I'm every place that calls me to try to hire me has that Culture and I say oh fuck you, right?

239
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,820
Speaker 0: And that makes it pretty hard to find any place to work besides where I'm working.

240
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,624
Speaker 1: Exactly because

241
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:48,210
Speaker 0: like even though this guy seems like a like a you know, a crazy evil person Why if he's so crazy evil wide and he's you know, like a rare case of this crazy evil How come every single tech startup is act is doing basically what he says even if they're not writing the articles that he's?

242
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:48,833
Speaker 0: Alex St.

243
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,058
Speaker 0: John is writing this.

244
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:56,240
Speaker 0: someone who Runs the place has his attitude because all their people are working a ridiculous hours and not having lives.

245
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean basically if you have I went to interview at a place.

246
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,113
Speaker 0: there are people.

247
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,440
Speaker 0: they had a fancy kitchen.

248
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:06,405
Speaker 0: People were cooking and eating dinner in there as like a group like it was a family and it's like whoa Get the fuck out of here.

249
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:06,967
Speaker 0: No way.

250
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:14,339
Speaker 1: Am I working here now I could see situations I know you wouldn't do this But like if I owned a company or if I really cared about something like.

251
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,531
Speaker 0: so He's this guy Alex St.

252
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,360
Speaker 0: John owns a company.

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,126
Speaker 0: He really cares.

254
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,100
Speaker 0: he expects his workers to care as much as he does.

255
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:31,806
Speaker 1: I don't think he actually really cares because reading everything he's written It feels a lot like Cliffy B's stuff where these are like the rent takers in the industry who aren't actually Personally contributing that much.

256
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:35,078
Speaker 0: No, I mean people who managers don't contribute much.

257
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:38,620
Speaker 1: in general They do I think in well-functioning organizations.

258
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:45,880
Speaker 1: But like the problem is like in video games people expect like, uh You're gonna have to work like crazy hours for the last eight months of game development.

259
00:16:45,941 --> 00:17:01,986
Speaker 1: Like no that means you fucked up Wave way earlier in the project and now you're choosing to pay that cost with the lives of your workers Instead of just by pushing out deadlines, you know, whenever we talk about like Project management, especially in software.

260
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:04,473
Speaker 0: We always talk about the space shuttle.

261
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're like, yeah, we're not building the space shuttle What the fuck do we care right?

262
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,240
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because you had that article about how they built the space shuttle.

263
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:22,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is actually an article I read recently that was like here is actually the software process They use to write the space shuttle software and I was like, oh now we know exactly how they do it.

264
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,108
Speaker 0: And it's like well, it's not agile.

265
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,173
Speaker 0: No, it's fuck.

266
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,056
Speaker 0: No, it's not agile.

267
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:30,459
Speaker 0: and also Now I know exactly to what extent I never have to go.

268
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,629
Speaker 1: You know, what sucks doesn't really suck that much.

269
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,087
Speaker 0: but also if you're building something super serious like a space shuttle Why aren't you doing what they do?

270
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:43,746
Speaker 1: So in my industry, you know Wall Street crap Is the space shuttle.

271
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,777
Speaker 1: so I have some projects like some things that don't matter that much.

272
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,223
Speaker 1: so yeah agile Let's just push out a bill Let's go.

273
00:17:49,243 --> 00:18:00,119
Speaker 1: and there's other things where I will personally spend like six months Writing a spec like a giant book of the Bible that says here's what this thing needs to do And here's how it needs to be architected.

274
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:05,676
Speaker 1: That is like 100% like the stakeholders have signed off like the regulators like everyone is like.

275
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,100
Speaker 1: this is exactly what we're building.

276
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,189
Speaker 1: We understand it a hundred percent and then we build it.

277
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:14,300
Speaker 1: not everything I do needs to be that way But that's kind of orthogonal to this point.

278
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,130
Speaker 0: So I want you all but the point is that if you do that kind of stuff, right these management hours Issues aren't an issue, right?

279
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:21,754
Speaker 0: It's it right.

280
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:22,580
Speaker 0: That's how it's related.

281
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:27,708
Speaker 0: It's a matter of you care building things the right way and not you know Doing some agile nonsense bullshit.

282
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:33,927
Speaker 0: then, you know exactly how long things are gonna take you People and divide the labor properly.

283
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,291
Speaker 1: you might be wrong, but there's a big.

284
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:38,160
Speaker 0: it's gonna be way less off than eight months of crunch.

285
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:42,008
Speaker 1: There's a big difference between oh shit We're falling a little behind.

286
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 1: can we work?

287
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:50,494
Speaker 1: everyone work one extra weekend and work fine And then I'll give you all vacation after the games out versus yeah eight months of 80-hour weeks.

288
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,299
Speaker 1: Oh, and we're still behind.

289
00:18:52,399 --> 00:19:06,360
Speaker 1: so But I really want all of you gaming industry taking serving to read Every word that this jackass road because you need to understand that this is like this is exactly What the people who ask you to work late day after day are thinking in their heads.

290
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Speaker 0: I also want to just remind people the reason that these people can get away with this attitude is Because people agree to work for them and people who do work for them don't unionize and don't assert themselves.

291
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:24,471
Speaker 0: Right, if you go and someone like asshole like this is trying to hire you I don't care how badly you need a job say fuck no, right?

292
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,996
Speaker 0: I mean, would you rather be?

293
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,200
Speaker 0: I mean if you're unemployed?

294
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,358
Speaker 1: There's a level of privilege there Scott in that I pretty much get a job anytime I need to.

295
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,122
Speaker 0: if I Was between even if I couldn't get a job I would just.

296
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:39,720
Speaker 0: I would rather work at Starbucks than work at some ridiculous asshole place like this, right?

297
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,816
Speaker 0: I'll just move out of my apartment rather than destroy my entire life for someone else.

298
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:44,900
Speaker 0: What's the point of being alive?

299
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Speaker 0: What is the point of being alive if you're spending all your time?

300
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,360
Speaker 0: Just sacrificing all of your meant your you your young years your years of youth that you're able to work, right?

301
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,440
Speaker 0: Giving a hundred percent of your entire mental capacity to this other person for their garbage, whatever the fuck it is.

302
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,599
Speaker 0: So I would rather just be poor than do that.

303
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:07,860
Speaker 1: It goes way beyond that and that it really illustrates the sort of tech bro bullshit.

304
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:14,260
Speaker 0: And if everyone has the attitude I have Then those people won't be able to force anyone to do that anymore because nobody will agree to work for them.

305
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,915
Speaker 1: You really need to look at the slides that this guy posted.

306
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:17,860
Speaker 0: I looked at those slides.

307
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I was at that presentation, I'd go buy tomatoes and come back.

308
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,532
Speaker 1: You don't recruit and retain male engineers.

309
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,845
Speaker 1: you recruit and retain Wives and girlfriends.

310
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:31,035
Speaker 1: if the wife or girlfriend is unhappy the engineer is gone.

311
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:32,700
Speaker 1: the paycheck goes to her.

312
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,340
Speaker 0: You didn't let me finish about putting the rocks in the tomatoes.

313
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,559
Speaker 1: But like he even has his advice where's the thing that?

314
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:42,699
Speaker 1: like?

315
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:43,983
Speaker 1: Here it is?

316
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,549
Speaker 1: be on the lookout for the I'm quoting this guy.

317
00:20:46,910 --> 00:21:02,100
Speaker 1: be on the lookout for the holy grail the undiscovered Asperger's engineer and then what follows is literal advice on how to find someone with Asperger's syndrome And trick them into ruining their lives to make your company profitable.

318
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:02,782
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

319
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:07,537
Speaker 1: This is literally what your jackass boss is thinking and trying to do.

320
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:13,640
Speaker 1: Yep So I look forward to the continued just general disc.

321
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,391
Speaker 0: These are the people who venture capitalists give lend money to instead of lending them to someone like me Because they'd rather have some asshole.

322
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,160
Speaker 0: have the money to make the world a shittier place.

323
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,540
Speaker 0: Then have me go to the beach and make a better the world a better place by not bothering anybody.

324
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:34,815
Speaker 1: yep, that's why I'm very very happy in some regards to the Decisions I've made in my life in terms of the places like the plate.

325
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,928
Speaker 1: the last place I worked All my bonuses and everything were in lottery tickets.

326
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:40,737
Speaker 1: You know what that lottery did not come in but you know, that's a shock.

327
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,120
Speaker 1: But they paid me enough money to make rent in the meantime, and I only worked 40 hours a week.

328
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, well this guy's doesn't sound like the guy in a guy who's gonna pay enough cash.

329
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,386
Speaker 0: He's looks like he's a lottery tickets only.

330
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get I get job offers.

331
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,338
Speaker 0: I actually read something interesting today.

332
00:21:55,378 --> 00:22:04,107
Speaker 0: We're like There's some sort of like Wall Street is souring on certain companies like say Twitter who pay their employees with lots and lots of stock And not a lot of cash.

333
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:09,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's starting to cause some issues Like do you actually have any money to pay these employees?

334
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,060
Speaker 0: Are they gonna let you know?

335
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:17,760
Speaker 1: Well, but so it's interesting because retention in those spaces is a big problem, but it's interesting in video games.

336
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:31,090
Speaker 1: Retention is a problem because people get burned out and ruin their lives and just quit and disgust Eventually like after I hit a bottom like they hit rock bottom and someone tells them to quit and then they finally do because they're going Crazy, but I mean, it's a grasses

337
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,673
Speaker 0: on ants.

338
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,500
Speaker 0: It's a grass is always greener thing, right?

339
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:46,160
Speaker 0: You're working at some job where you hate your co-workers But you have a life and you get and you know you get money and you look at this game job and maybe it pays more and you see all these cool co-workers because they're all Game people and you're like, oh man that what a better life that is.

340
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:52,306
Speaker 0: Yeah you know you see the grass is greener you look at the things you don't have and you see that game job and it has The things you don't have now.

341
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,700
Speaker 0: so you move to it and you don't realize the parts that were worse.

342
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:56,885
Speaker 1: But see that's the difference.

343
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,854
Speaker 0: the guy that I have the priorities in order.

344
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,340
Speaker 0: Your life is number one priority.

345
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,176
Speaker 0: The only reason that you are working is because you could need to work in order to live.

346
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:10,231
Speaker 0: if we had diamond age We wouldn't work But at least in other industries starch like we wouldn't work.

347
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:11,938
Speaker 1: finance and a lot of technology.

348
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:15,991
Speaker 1: the people Usually make a lot of money and while they're still ruining themselves.

349
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:21,880
Speaker 1: They at least have a giant salary the whole time But in games you don't even get that.

350
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,326
Speaker 1: So if you're gonna burn yourself out and make these very poor decisions at least do it on Wall Street Because then at least you'll be making.

351
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,759
Speaker 0: I know someone who works for Bloomberg, right?

352
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:39,102
Speaker 0: And they don't tell me how much money they make but they've told me how they make a lot of money and they're planning to retire very very early like 40s early I was looking at.

353
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:42,033
Speaker 1: so actually Bloomberg has a job posting that is literally.

354
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,840
Speaker 0: Bloomberg pays really really well.

355
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,512
Speaker 0: I know I know they actually and it's not like it's not.

356
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,840
Speaker 0: um, it's not like some miraculous culture.

357
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:54,080
Speaker 0: That's like the best thing ever, but it's actually a pretty it's an okay culture over there, right?

358
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:04,198
Speaker 1: They don't make people work ridiculous And they have all sorts of luxuries in the bag repeatedly like whispered in my ear by people who are probably afraid that I would quit my current job.

359
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,650
Speaker 1: how Boring and horrible it is to work at Bloomberg.

360
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,744
Speaker 1: and I think they're afraid that I might just one day be like, you know What let's go work at Bloomberg.

361
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:16,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean everything I know about it is like it's you could work at a lot worse places And you get paid a lot and you can retire early.

362
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:17,839
Speaker 1: So you got any news.

363
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so lately there's you know 360 video which is when you have a YouTube video where you can drag and look around.

364
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:32,500
Speaker 0: Right has been coming a lot hotter because there's a lot of cheap cameras Now that you can buy that are basically two wide-angle cameras back-to-back on a stick.

365
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, the old days really like make a rig and then stitch it all.

366
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,359
Speaker 0: now They've got like GoPros doing a thing where it's like four GoPros all together, right?

367
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:45,407
Speaker 0: I saw a guy the other day Biking and he had one of those.

368
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:47,657
Speaker 1: you had one of those who's biking around like fight.

369
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:48,299
Speaker 0: I yeah, why not?

370
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,980
Speaker 0: So it's actually these things are getting cheaper and cheaper to get to make the 360 videos which are kind of fun.

371
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,240
Speaker 0: You can do cool things with them, right?

372
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,740
Speaker 0: I saw a music video that was made with one where all the people in the music video were like standing around it.

373
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,420
Speaker 0: So you could like look at the different band members, right?

374
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,100
Speaker 0: Like look at the guitarist over here and then you turn around and look, you know And you can see what someone's doing when like they're not the center of attention, right?

375
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:18,372
Speaker 0: And then I've seen stuff for like, you know someone goes in a tour of a city and it's like you're on the tour bus and you can look around and that the different Sites on your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.

376
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:22,268
Speaker 0: So 360 a video is it's okay With VR doing head tracking it's even better.

377
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:30,020
Speaker 0: right because then you don't have you don't have to keep clicking and dragging and stuff Right, you can sort of naturally look about and that feels like you're in a place that you're not and that you know, that's cool.

378
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,959
Speaker 0: But thing with 360 video is that until now?

379
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:40,381
Speaker 0: It's just been recorded, you know, and then you take all the cameras and combine the data after the fact and then upload it Right.

380
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:40,743
Speaker 0: Yep.

381
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:47,346
Speaker 0: YouTube is now adding a feature for the first ever I've ever seen Live-streaming 360 video.

382
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:50,373
Speaker 1: the example they show is already perfect because it's not just video.

383
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,898
Speaker 1: It also has the three-dimensional audio.

384
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:53,339
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

385
00:25:53,741 --> 00:26:09,518
Speaker 1: So imagine like the example they show is there's a jazz concert live For a million people and every one of you every member of the audience is sitting on the middle of the stage Just with a band playing for them and you can just look around and hear all the audio.

386
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:13,820
Speaker 0: Yep, so Live-streaming 360 video it's like man.

387
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,180
Speaker 0: I need some to subscribe to some channels and get some alerts of when people are going to be doing 360 live streams in various.

388
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:26,420
Speaker 1: Awesome guys, I want the NHL to put this rig in like the best seat at MSG.

389
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:29,216
Speaker 0: Dude, you could take the 360 cameras.

390
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:29,940
Speaker 0: They're so small.

391
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:34,040
Speaker 0: You could put a wide-angle lens on the front of someone's helmet and on the back of someone's home.

392
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:42,492
Speaker 0: Oh, you could be lies lie during the game Be Somewhat like the quarterback or whoever at any sport, right?

393
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:44,120
Speaker 1: I just want to be in the crowd.

394
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:49,380
Speaker 1: I just want to be sitting in the best seat at MSG and you need to look behind you.

395
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,010
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll look behind me and see like whatever drunk I have.

396
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,116
Speaker 1: you could take it just before.

397
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:58,140
Speaker 0: they could be like eight 360 cameras is like in the stands and you just pick which one you want to watch the game from.

398
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,833
Speaker 1: Yeah couple that with an oculus or something.

399
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,960
Speaker 0: It doesn't write in the stands.

400
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,760
Speaker 0: You can look behind you and be like, oh who's fighting?

401
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:09,540
Speaker 0: If the drunk attacks the right make the home viewing experience the same as the stadium experience.

402
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:17,026
Speaker 0: You could actually get rid of stands entirely one day and just play sports in much smaller spaces and just have 360 cameras like around the edge of the.

403
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:22,391
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this a lot and I've been talking to people who work in VR companies a lot.

404
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:26,790
Speaker 1: and the Spectation I got stuff we'll talk about on a Tuesday show.

405
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,797
Speaker 0: right the 360 thing makes spectation a big deal at anything that's not you know, just forward-facing right?

406
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,045
Speaker 0: think about like You know, I work for Broadway comm.

407
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:43,986
Speaker 0: there's a lot of Broadway shows where you're not just looking at the stage the whole time Right, you know like in cats the cats come out in the audience and in Phantom of the Opera They got the show Scott.

408
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,799
Speaker 0: Here's the one here comes over the top.

409
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,813
Speaker 1: There's something you probably forgot about this but there's.

410
00:27:49,280 --> 00:28:09,660
Speaker 1: Remember what we used to watch Penn and Teller's shows and stuff and all that like a long time ago and how they always talked About how the the best form of magic like the most amazing thing to see is the close-up magic Which is hard to get because the close-up magic is someone as good as like Penn Gillette Literally sitting in front of just you messing around and doing a trick in front of you.

411
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:13,964
Speaker 1: You could have people doing close-up magic to these rigs I mean, but I don't see.

412
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,399
Speaker 0: you're how that really enhances it that much unless part of the magic trick is behind you.

413
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,952
Speaker 1: Well, it's not just looking out at you.

414
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:24,944
Speaker 1: It's that you've got this sphere of Your sort of present.

415
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:28,777
Speaker 0: use a wide-angle lens facing forward the whole point of the 360 camera.

416
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:29,399
Speaker 0: We already have 180 cameras.

417
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:30,518
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

418
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:34,720
Speaker 0: The whole point of the camera is that something behind you is going on, right?

419
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,750
Speaker 0: There's a reason to look around if it's close-up magic.

420
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,619
Speaker 0: You're only looking at this person right in front of you, right?

421
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,221
Speaker 0: it's.

422
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:41,866
Speaker 0: I don't see how it's.

423
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:48,580
Speaker 1: so you discount how Powerful the effect is if you move your head a little bit and the world moves correctly.

424
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:55,509
Speaker 1: yeah, like that effect is very profound in humans because of our Biology and how easily tricked our brains are.

425
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:56,956
Speaker 0: there needs to be things in all 360 degrees.

426
00:28:56,956 --> 00:29:00,340
Speaker 0: 360 degree camera to be worthwhile.

427
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,605
Speaker 1: I mean even this concert.

428
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,092
Speaker 1: what's gonna be directly behind you?

429
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,060
Speaker 1: some other jackass watching the concert?

430
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,423
Speaker 0: Well, that's what I'm saying, though But see how that's.

431
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,251
Speaker 0: the example is not a normal concert.

432
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,440
Speaker 0: how often in a concert are you in the middle of the bed with?

433
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,683
Speaker 0: music coming from all sides Right.

434
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:18,119
Speaker 0: Imagine if every human being could like say shrink themselves to be really small.

435
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,907
Speaker 0: What we wouldn't make a symphony on a stage.

436
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:23,496
Speaker 0: we would have a symphony surrounding you facing inwards.

437
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,359
Speaker 0: it would sound way better.

438
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,257
Speaker 1: Arrangements would have to be changed a little bit.

439
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:28,500
Speaker 1: actually.

440
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,040
Speaker 0: I think you just have it, you know, it depends how many people you had, right?

441
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:43,560
Speaker 0: It's like you'd have like one violin equally spread out in every direction or maybe like, you know Like you get like, you know how they have the in New York City in a lot of places like the whistling bench And the whistling arches and set it up like that.

442
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,738
Speaker 0: So like even though the timpani is in the corner You can hear it on all the sides whistling basically effectively, you know, cuz you don't need four timpani's right?

443
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:51,440
Speaker 0: That's a little ridiculous.

444
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,509
Speaker 0: Like oh fuck me.

445
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,160
Speaker 0: I can't hear anything else.

446
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:07,130
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

447
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:13,409
Speaker 1: So if you didn't know Pyongyang in North Korea a place you should not go ever don't go there.

448
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:21,230
Speaker 0: Maybe one day you can go there like you can go to Cuba now It has a subway right but do not go there until I say you can go there.

449
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,380
Speaker 0: That's because by the time I say you can go there.

450
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,650
Speaker 0: It'll definitely be safe to go there.

451
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:35,098
Speaker 0: So only recently were foreigners ever allowed inside Pyongyang subway except like one station The shiny the shiny one that looked good and had actors in it.

452
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,710
Speaker 1: So this is a photo journal with a lot of pictures.

453
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:47,456
Speaker 1: This is basically the first group of foreigners who have ever been allowed to see the entirety of the Pyongyang metro system Every stage.

454
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:48,424
Speaker 0: people actually use it.

455
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:49,169
Speaker 0: or is it just for show?

456
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,501
Speaker 1: I think people actually use it.

457
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:51,370
Speaker 1: but remember the people in King.

458
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:57,030
Speaker 0: I remember hearing it was just for show and that like they saw people like oh no That was I think was the regular train station.

459
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,710
Speaker 0: They got off the train because they came in the train from China or Russia or whatever.

460
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:10,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then when they got off at the train station, there are people about the train station But there weren't any trains other leaving or arriving other than the one that they had just arrived on.

461
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,062
Speaker 0: so there were no reason for any people to be in that train station.

462
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:13,202
Speaker 0: that.

463
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:21,930
Speaker 1: but when Yang is sort of like the Propaganda city so it like people live there the privileged few or I guess the most trusted or best-looking or whatever.

464
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:24,558
Speaker 0: I'm sure their lives are not great when there's no foreigners around.

465
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,541
Speaker 1: but this is a lot of photos and they're Fascinating just from all the subway stations.

466
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:35,230
Speaker 0: It looks like every other photos I've seen in North Korea before but these you've never seen inside of here.

467
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,370
Speaker 0: I haven't seen those particular ones, but they the propaganda looks the same.

468
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,230
Speaker 1: It's all the most interesting notes about this.

469
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:47,710
Speaker 1: Later works their trains work one the trains themselves look straight out of like East Germany.

470
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Cold War it takes Dracula.

471
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,229
Speaker 0: It's a lot harder for him to get around those trains.

472
00:31:54,092 --> 00:32:06,410
Speaker 1: And two in almost every photo there's at least one if not multiple people Given the photographer the fucking death stare like people are not happy that this person is there.

473
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:09,510
Speaker 1: It is side-eye after side-eye after side-eye.

474
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,246
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just because they have to act while that person's there and they can't.

475
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:13,332
Speaker 1: well I press.

476
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:25,750
Speaker 1: I posited another idea that if you live in North Korea You are told your entire life that foreigners particularly Americans are the reason your lives are filled with such terror and privation.

477
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:28,270
Speaker 0: And why are they allowed in your country?

478
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,354
Speaker 0: so you just murder them on site.

479
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:37,539
Speaker 1: you see one being escorted around by North Korean security forces for whatever reason and It'd be like if

480
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:46,650
Speaker 0: I don't know today If I saw someone being escorted around the city by the security forces usually the security force is in the city You're just sort of standing there, you know doing their jobs doing nothing.

481
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I saw them escorting someone I'd probably rubberneck a bit and be like, oh who did they arrest him?

482
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,855
Speaker 0: For what reason it's got?

483
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,389
Speaker 1: what if a bunch of people who just looked like Nazi Hitler's.

484
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:02,522
Speaker 1: We're walking around taking photos in the subway suddenly and there's a bunch of cops Just like walking them around and guiding them and no other context.

485
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:06,469
Speaker 0: I'd assume that the cops are keeping me from killing them Which is probably correct.

486
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,297
Speaker 1: This is a fact in fact.

487
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:16,710
Speaker 0: that happens in the United States like when the KKK people like, you know Get a. you know a thing like a license to have like a rally or something, Illinois Nazis, right?

488
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,428
Speaker 0: The cops have to be there no matter how much they hate him - you know because they got to protect them from.

489
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,653
Speaker 0: you know The smart people.

490
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:23,980
Speaker 0: that's how it goes.

491
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,750
Speaker 0: You know, it's the cops aren't approving of them.

492
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,515
Speaker 0: It's just if you have your protest.

493
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,184
Speaker 0: that's anti KKK and the KKK protest.

494
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:31,648
Speaker 0: the cops will protect you from them.

495
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,722
Speaker 1: Also So I got you got a thing of the day.

496
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,108
Speaker 0: I do have a thing of the day.

497
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:41,570
Speaker 0: so There was that new Godzilla movie that came out in the US a while ago year or two ago.

498
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:46,679
Speaker 0: It's been a while actually, but the new Godzilla movie is directed by He deiaki.

499
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:47,810
Speaker 0: I know don't?

500
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,738
Speaker 1: I saw Twitter Flipping out about that trailer.

501
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:52,702
Speaker 0: Did you watch the trailer?

502
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:53,385
Speaker 1: I did not.

503
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:54,510
Speaker 0: well, that's my thing of the day.

504
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,479
Speaker 0: So we're gonna watch it now.

505
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:02,730
Speaker 0: So this trailer Basically, I watched the trailer and I said wow You didn't even need to tell me this is directed by Anno.

506
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:16,170
Speaker 0: In fact, I didn't know until after watching the trailer and I noticed while I was watching the trailer Like there's a scene in the beginning where some glass shatters and when the glass shattered I'm like that really looks like a building falling apart and say Akira or even jelly.

507
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:30,387
Speaker 0: That particular way they animate the buildings smashing but done in live-action Right, and then there was a scene where the tail there's a lot of tail action Right where the tail goes over these Japanese buildings in the street and the camera pans across the right.

508
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:35,550
Speaker 0: and I was like That really seemed like you know that what which angel had like the whippy arms?

509
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:45,170
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah And I'm like it really feels like that scene like I feel like I've seen this shot before That's and then when I saw Godzilla, it was a really scary Godzilla, right?

510
00:34:45,429 --> 00:35:01,346
Speaker 0: But he's got those t-rex arms and they were extra t-rex arms like yeah And I was like that reminds me of when I watched how we hono and the person who was the actor who was playing on Oh was doing a Godzilla impression and had that exact same body language.

511
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:02,290
Speaker 1: I gotta finish that show.

512
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:02,551
Speaker 1: I

513
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:14,310
Speaker 0: wonder if that person saw I know doing a Godzilla impression and stole that body language for his acting and I know also put his own body like his idea of how Godzilla's

514
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,797
Speaker 1: Blue blazes and think it was funny and then

515
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:23,356
Speaker 0: I don't know but it was definitely the same body language in both blue blazes and This Godzilla

516
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:23,718
Speaker 1: or Scott.

517
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:24,241
Speaker 1: is it possible?

518
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:26,312
Speaker 1: That's just Godzilla's body language I think.

519
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:31,889
Speaker 0: I think that you know that Godzilla's body language is that but it's like it's.

520
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,109
Speaker 0: Has it has like this flavor right the seasoning of it?

521
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:41,530
Speaker 0: The raw material is still beef but the seasoning is definitely the seasoning of the crazy guy.

522
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:46,250
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna see this shit as soon as it gets English subtitles good or awful.

523
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,824
Speaker 1: So in the minute the booklet book will be Margaret Edward Oryx and Craig.

524
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:52,350
Speaker 1: I'm biking to work every day.

525
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,461
Speaker 1: So god, I don't want to read anything anymore.

526
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,487
Speaker 0: I'm about to start it.

527
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:56,854
Speaker 1: Yep I'm pretty much done with.

528
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:59,829
Speaker 0: that was only like there's only like one manga sitting on top of it.

529
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,370
Speaker 1: I learned a lot of stuff about Randell tour and stuff happened.

530
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,741
Speaker 1: So I'll move on to another book for a while and let that said good.

531
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:09,450
Speaker 1: We're going to be at PAX East this weekend.

545
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:40,841
Speaker 1: It's the weird Department.

546
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:43,709
Speaker 0: It's handheld lounge - I think I'm trying to do the circuit.

547
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:47,136
Speaker 1: my goal Is to do everything.

548
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,402
Speaker 0: I mean, that's your excuse now.

549
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got every I've always got every year.

550
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:56,008
Speaker 0: It's the way to make yourself feel good about working in a shit department every year in the forum.

551
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,943
Speaker 0: regret Not just being tabletop all the time like smart people seems like more work than other.

552
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,927
Speaker 0: table top is great.

553
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:01,610
Speaker 0: It's the best department.

554
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,095
Speaker 1: Main events is real fun.

555
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,962
Speaker 1: live streaming was fun before.

556
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:11,770
Speaker 1: I didn't get to sit in the room anymore back when I got to be Pax 2 on the video all the time, but when you go to Pax if you're not working, where do you spend most of your time?

557
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,075
Speaker 1: Playing games in tabletop.

558
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:15,600
Speaker 0: So what's the difference?

559
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,028
Speaker 1: not playing games and walking around being a presence?

560
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:20,250
Speaker 0: sure Being a presence is good.

561
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,718
Speaker 0: You can tell people how to wit you see go up to someone and they're playing Carcassonne and they're about to put the towel In a real dumbass place and you're like, whoa.

562
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,145
Speaker 0: Well, what the fuck you do right there.

563
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:29,330
Speaker 0: put it over there.

564
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,895
Speaker 0: Don't let him finish that Cathedral.

565
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,182
Speaker 0: You gotta aim a road right at the heart.

566
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,627
Speaker 1: on Sunday 3 30 p.m.

567
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,294
Speaker 1: Arachnid theater.

568
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:38,384
Speaker 1: We were doing Atari game design.

569
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:39,309
Speaker 0: We've done it before me.

570
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:42,785
Speaker 1: I think thing is we've never put it on YouTube so you can't see it.

571
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:43,790
Speaker 0: Why didn't you put on YouTube?

572
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,774
Speaker 0: You record it like twice.

573
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna do it again.

574
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:46,984
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see.

575
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:50,760
Speaker 0: we didn't do good enough the other times We did except the Atari video.

576
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,905
Speaker 1: We didn't record the Atari video.

577
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:53,130
Speaker 1: We didn't actually video anything.

578
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,720
Speaker 0: I thought you were doing that with some ODB now DB.

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,706
Speaker 1: Yeah OBS, but the second time we didn't even record it ODB should retire.

580
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,815
Speaker 0: Pretty sure he's dead.

581
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:05,863
Speaker 1: So Pax is gonna be awesome.

582
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:06,566
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there.

583
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:07,570
Speaker 1: We'll see you in Boston.

584
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:11,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, also on the patreon I did put up.

585
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:11,770
Speaker 1: we hit that goal.

586
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:20,942
Speaker 1: so the first episode of geek nights ever the beta with commentary remastered is in the patreon for the backers, but publicly for anyone to listen to.

587
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:26,707
Speaker 1: I put just the Commentary because I listened to the whole episode and I did about 16 minutes worth of commentary.

588
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,150
Speaker 1: and Scott I said there's something in the commentary.

589
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:34,050
Speaker 1: We recorded a bunch of stuff before the first beta episode.

590
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:47,570
Speaker 1: I don't remember this to you know because in the episode at one point We say something like well We like, you know, we listen to what we recorded yesterday and blah blah blah.

591
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:53,750
Speaker 1: But I'm literally listening to the first audio file we ever made as far as I can remember must have lost one.

592
00:38:54,831 --> 00:39:00,150
Speaker 1: I get the impression we recorded a bunch of stuff in the alpha and maybe we just agreed to delete it.

593
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,058
Speaker 1: Like I don't remember.

594
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,483
Speaker 1: I just wondered.

595
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:02,190
Speaker 1: you remembered that.

596
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,492
Speaker 0: I don't know.

597
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:05,410
Speaker 0: I went to go to my backups recently to find some software.

598
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,156
Speaker 0: I wrote in college and I found everything.

599
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,985
Speaker 0: and so if your backups are not as good as mine.

600
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,350
Speaker 0: That's not my problem.

601
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,122
Speaker 1: 2005 it was October 11th is the first geek nice.

602
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,608
Speaker 0: You're the one who backed up all these things.

603
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:16,930
Speaker 0: Not me.

604
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I'm saying but we called it the beta.

605
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:22,793
Speaker 0: also since I'm not paying for the patreon I don't have these.

606
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:24,321
Speaker 0: I can't get the files.

607
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:25,145
Speaker 0: You can listen to them.

608
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:25,849
Speaker 1: You can listen to them.

609
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,915
Speaker 0: I'm not paying you any money.

610
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:27,861
Speaker 1: No, you can leave.

611
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:28,545
Speaker 1: got the backup.

612
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:29,470
Speaker 1: You could just listen to the file.

613
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,795
Speaker 1: You even know the fucking URL.

614
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,446
Speaker 0: I thought y'all I thought you found one that was even older.

615
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,250
Speaker 0: that wasn't at the URL.

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,655
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I can give you that one.

617
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,100
Speaker 1: Okay, then you just don't get.

618
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,606
Speaker 1: let's do a remastered unless you pay.

619
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,537
Speaker 0: Oh, no remaster It took me a while.

620
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:41,690
Speaker 1: It was hard to remaster that shit.

621
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:46,266
Speaker 1: It was actually really hard to remaster that shit and let me tell you smells like ramen.

622
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:55,618
Speaker 1: I am Really pleased with how well I was able to remaster that audio because if you hear what it sounded like originally It is almost unlistenable.

623
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:56,441
Speaker 0: Does it smell like ramen?

624
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:57,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, Emily's cooking in there.

625
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,328
Speaker 0: Is it ramen?

626
00:39:58,448 --> 00:39:59,353
Speaker 1: I don't know It's food.

627
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:00,701
Speaker 0: It smells like some food cooking.

628
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:09,869
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway So there's been a lot of stories about ransomware or crypto where lately to the point that I feel like we should at least explain A little bit about what the deal is there.

629
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,417
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, this is something that just sort of.

630
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:16,100
Speaker 0: this is one of those things that escaped being a show topic because it's just So common and so sort of like.

631
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:17,930
Speaker 0: it's never like spikes, right?

632
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,512
Speaker 0: It's always just like.

633
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:22,930
Speaker 0: there's always one once in a while and you tend to just sort of it just like a fact of life.

634
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,390
Speaker 1: Well, it also wasn't that common until the last few years like so if you took definitely been happening more.

635
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,270
Speaker 0: But it never happens like a whole bunch in a very short period of time.

636
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:37,484
Speaker 1: It's also one of those things where we always said years and years ago Why doesn't someone just do this with a virus like why don't you make some money?

637
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:44,430
Speaker 0: Someone is yeah Viruses in the old day were harmless pranks and fun or some of them would just like destroy your computer.

638
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:53,317
Speaker 1: But then they then they got to the point where people make viruses that would like literally just like ruin all your data delete random Files like literally destroy your life.

639
00:40:53,759 --> 00:41:03,950
Speaker 0: and then we got to the stage where viruses and malware wouldn't actually do any that they would Monitor you you borrow your CPU cycle send spam with your computer do all sorts of other things.

640
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:12,143
Speaker 0: That would basically just make money and let your computer keep running and hope you keep using your computer Because as long as your computer keeps working you keep it turned on.

641
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:16,502
Speaker 0: they make more money by using it Maybe in like a zombie army to do SPL or who knows what.

642
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:23,523
Speaker 1: now what's interesting is even in that era Very rarely did they try to steal like credit card numbers or things like they.

643
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,830
Speaker 1: just they did like spam bots or whatever.

644
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:31,250
Speaker 1: And then we entered the air after that where most malware was literally just trying to steal your credit card number.

645
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know your bank account number and now credit card numbers aren't even worth a lot of money on like the evil black market Right.

646
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you can just buy credit cards.

647
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,808
Speaker 0: It's a. you know passports physical ones are worth a lot of money, but that's hard to steal with its software.

648
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:51,110
Speaker 1: So Ransomware, I think part of the reason it had a big up-and-coming like the reason we're seeing it is the best way to make money.

649
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:55,890
Speaker 1: It's only a way to make money because bitcoins are still worth some amount of money.

650
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,613
Speaker 0: That's true.

651
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:03,406
Speaker 1: if you wanted to make a ransomware before Bitcoin Mmm, someone's got to send you the money somehow and that's tough to do.

652
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:04,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

653
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,553
Speaker 0: We're gonna be like yourself.

654
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:06,838
Speaker 0: You're gonna do the old.

655
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:10,230
Speaker 0: are you gonna do old suitcase briefcase of money next to the trashcan thing?

656
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,280
Speaker 1: Yep, mail the mail cash to this p.o box.

657
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,204
Speaker 1: Like you're gonna get caught.

658
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:14,947
Speaker 0: good luck with that.

659
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,392
Speaker 1: It's a lot of work You might cause.

660
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:24,935
Speaker 0: no point allows you to hold people's stuff for ransom and then get money from them in the form of bitcoins Without the police finding you.

661
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:29,899
Speaker 1: so the most basic ransomware and then we'll talk about cuz Scott was like How could you get gotten by this if you're not dumb?

662
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:31,468
Speaker 1: and the answer is you really can't.

663
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:42,237
Speaker 1: yeah but there are ways to make ransomware dangerous even to relatively smart and sophisticated people and we're seeing it get really Sophisticated in a hurry.

664
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:51,370
Speaker 0: So basic ransomware is as such you get some sort of virus Because you did something stupid like a download an email attachment or you went to a shady website and clicked on something shady.

665
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:53,685
Speaker 0: No, it's already exe from download.

666
00:42:53,726 --> 00:43:00,450
Speaker 1: calm now It is possible to get these things through, you know a zero-day exploit where there's nothing you could do, right?

667
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,312
Speaker 0: That would be but still is zero to exploit wouldn't be on google.com It would be.

668
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:08,590
Speaker 0: you went in your your unpatched browser right on or on the zero day.

669
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:17,014
Speaker 0: There is no patch yet But you visited a shady ass website except running the zero day like some legit websites have hosted this through their ad networks You can also run.

670
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,864
Speaker 0: you didn't have ad blocker, right?

671
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:26,690
Speaker 1: It's a dumb person but What they do is they get on your computer and then what they take all your files and start encrypting them.

672
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:28,330
Speaker 1: They have a little private key locally.

673
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they run something that's basically just like true crypt the thing that you would normally use to encrypt your hard drive.

674
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:35,509
Speaker 0: But they just start encrypting your drive.

675
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,450
Speaker 0: So they look like my document like everything still works because when you double click on a file it decrypts it.

676
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:51,737
Speaker 0: You might not notice it is slower, but you might not notice how it being slower because your computer is pretty fast Yeah, and then once it's encrypted It pops up the screen and it's like alright, dude I encrypted all your shit.

677
00:43:52,199 --> 00:44:00,691
Speaker 1: send, you know one Bitcoin to this address Within 48 hours or I'm deleting the private key and your data is literally unrecoverable Mm-hmm.

678
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,645
Speaker 0: See if they just deleted all your stuff it would you would first of all, you'd notice immediately.

679
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,275
Speaker 0: and second of all How could they ransom you like?

680
00:44:07,316 --> 00:44:08,360
Speaker 0: Oh, we'll give you your data back.

681
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,264
Speaker 0: It's like it's already gone.

682
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,287
Speaker 0: But by encrypting all of it It's like aha.

683
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:19,685
Speaker 0: We have basically taken your data hostage and now you must pay us into Unencrypted because to pot if you find the key after we delete the key.

684
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:20,770
Speaker 0: Good luck with that.

685
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:20,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

686
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:29,498
Speaker 1: Now if it's well written because there's been a few instances recently where smart people who are doing you know Basically doing white hat hacking right?

687
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:32,070
Speaker 0: You could just first of all if they use that method, right?

688
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,659
Speaker 0: They haven't deleted the key yet.

689
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,509
Speaker 0: You could unplug the computer real fast.

690
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:42,458
Speaker 0: Take the drive out, you know connect to the drive find the key that's on there somewhere And then use it to decrypt your stuff.

691
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:42,880
Speaker 0: Now.

692
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,130
Speaker 1: What if the key itself is encrypted?

693
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,676
Speaker 0: It's right, but it's still.

694
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:47,339
Speaker 0: it's easier.

695
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:50,493
Speaker 0: The key would be encrypted with something like AES Right.

696
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:53,129
Speaker 0: So that's it's a symmetric key and not a public-private key.

697
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they even know it.

698
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:06,170
Speaker 0: even though it's very difficult to crack It won't be impossible and most likely I can't imagine it being such a complicated, you know You would be able to eventually rescue your if your data was important enough to decrypt.

699
00:45:06,632 --> 00:45:08,763
Speaker 0: You would you would do it and if it wasn't important enough.

700
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:14,352
Speaker 1: you who cares right now It may I mean not talking about us But a general like.

701
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:21,235
Speaker 1: think about a normal person using their computer and suddenly it's like hey dog all your files What do you do?

702
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:23,767
Speaker 0: You don't even know how to get a Bitcoin and send it.

703
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:24,310
Speaker 0: So you're fucked.

704
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:30,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so actually these ransomware's usually provide very clear instructions on how to buy bitcoins where to buy them.

705
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,069
Speaker 1: They provide helpful links documentation Some of them have helps and facts.

706
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:48,242
Speaker 0: I mean you could really if you've infected the person's computer this much you could really just Like do everything automatically for them and just be like enter credit card info here to buy the Bitcoin Yep, and then they click OK and then here's it can be alright.

707
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,410
Speaker 0: and then I'd be like, oh, thanks for your credit card info.

708
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,339
Speaker 0: No, I'm just buy all the bitcoins I want with it.

709
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,650
Speaker 1: I would make one where once you give the Bitcoin to be like.

710
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, just kidding ten more bitcoins I would be like you'd have to type.

711
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:04,169
Speaker 0: I'd be just like, you know You type the credit card in now just buy coins up to your credit card limit and give them to myself the end

712
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,218
Speaker 1: And then not even decrypt the guys and

713
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,790
Speaker 0: then sell your credit card number to somebody to to make an extra buck.

714
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:17,710
Speaker 0: But these are highly effective and if you put stop if you stop the payment, then I'll remove the re-encrypt your computer.

715
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:25,858
Speaker 1: But they're highly effective if you don't have proper backups and why I say backups not Redundancy because you have a raid.

716
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:26,882
Speaker 1: these things are.

717
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:29,475
Speaker 0: we did a show about this a long time ago So you can go listen to that.

718
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:32,170
Speaker 0: We're talking about the different levels of backing up, right?

719
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,114
Speaker 0: And it's nothing.

720
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,610
Speaker 0: no information in that show despite it being really old has really changed, right?

721
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:45,166
Speaker 0: If you have your data backed up like if someone gave me ransomware on my computer today and was like We're gonna be encrypted all the hard drives in my computer and there's a lot of them.

722
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:47,172
Speaker 0: I'd be like Okay.

723
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:48,716
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do?

724
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:51,063
Speaker 0: Oh, no, there's a bunch of games.

725
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:51,745
Speaker 0: I installed.

726
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:53,190
Speaker 0: I can't get those from Steam again.

727
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:55,160
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a bunch of other apps.

728
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,044
Speaker 0: Okay, what?

729
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,150
Speaker 0: what file is on there?

730
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,692
Speaker 0: They can't give it.

731
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:02,230
Speaker 0: all the things that I've backed up are backed up in like two different cloud services and my NAS.

732
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,102
Speaker 0: Even if they could access my NAS and encrypted.

733
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,154
Speaker 0: that is like, okay, I've got it in the cloud still You can't access that.

734
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:10,321
Speaker 1: If your NAS is mounted they can and they will.

735
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,590
Speaker 1: actually they'll mount every file system and encrypt it.

736
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:13,576
Speaker 0: Sure, go for it.

737
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:13,858
Speaker 0: Okay.

738
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,924
Speaker 0: I got my cloud backup.

739
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:15,589
Speaker 0: You can't get there.

740
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:20,026
Speaker 1: Yep I literally dragged my entire two terabyte NAS up to Amazon cloud drive every month.

741
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:20,910
Speaker 0: I got the whole thing.

742
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,076
Speaker 1: I just do a snapshot of it.

743
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,664
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can't right?

744
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:27,149
Speaker 0: so then if someone did this to me I'm like, alright, it'd be a pain in the ass, but it won't be a big deal.

745
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:40,149
Speaker 1: But so even if it got me in the middle of a workflow like say I have 40 gigabytes of video from Scott on an SD card and I've copied it to my local hard drive And we haven't uploaded it to the cloud yet.

746
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:45,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like I just started uploading it to the cloud drive, but the ransomware has infected me already.

747
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,857
Speaker 0: I'm holding the SD card.

748
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:51,340
Speaker 0: I guess the ransomware could get the SD card walls If the SD card is still plugged in.

749
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,067
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we lost a panel video.

750
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:53,790
Speaker 0: the end of the world.

751
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:59,150
Speaker 1: It's totally worth a Bitcoin not so then it comes down to what are you willing to pay for that data?

752
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,703
Speaker 0: Or I'm willing to pay a dollar for this panel video.

753
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:03,546
Speaker 0: It depends.

754
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:07,025
Speaker 1: if it was a good panel I'd be willing to pay up to like 50 bucks.

755
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:07,750
Speaker 0: That's all you.

756
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,021
Speaker 1: One zero, but think about so.

757
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:19,190
Speaker 0: it's other thing is that it's you know Paying terrorists is not a good strategy because that encourages them to continue if they if no one's getting paid off of it.

758
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:26,402
Speaker 1: But that's why these ransomware is tend to ask for a Significant amount of money but not a huge amount of money.

759
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:28,530
Speaker 1: They never asked for like hundreds thousands of dollars.

760
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,593
Speaker 1: They're always like 50 bucks hundred bucks.

761
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:38,258
Speaker 1: Yep, you're gonna risk like every photo you have of your kid for a hundred bucks Mmm, so fuck up.

762
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:41,130
Speaker 1: I mean what's very interesting?

763
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,929
Speaker 1: Is that this ransomware has started to get a little more widespread and that they're starting to get into?

764
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:48,658
Speaker 1: Enterprise environment.

765
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,090
Speaker 0: so it may forget shouldn't the enterprise environment have backups?

766
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:58,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if the backup is mounted or mounted by accessible from the computer it'll encrypt that too.

767
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:08,409
Speaker 0: I mean usually even if you have a shared drive that everyone has mounted that's usually backed up somewhere else Right up to the cloud or to another storage machine or something.

768
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:12,281
Speaker 1: So I guess I haven't seen an example of this yet.

769
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:12,382
Speaker 1: Now.

770
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:13,786
Speaker 1: I've seen some pretty sophisticated one.

771
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:19,270
Speaker 1: So a lot of these to Force you to be able to basically to force you to just pay.

772
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:24,309
Speaker 1: They will give you like a one-hour countdown like yo, you've got an hour.

773
00:49:25,116 --> 00:49:26,609
Speaker 1: You're not sure what we've encrypted.

774
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:28,976
Speaker 1: You've got an hour to pay the Bitcoin.

775
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:33,050
Speaker 1: or we delete the key like that kind of thing like literally counting down in front of you.

776
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:34,741
Speaker 1: Some of them will do that.

777
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:35,970
Speaker 0: I'll just unplug the computer.

778
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:44,030
Speaker 1: So if you unplug the computer, maybe they've already deleted the key, but the key was transmitted to the overseas server.

779
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,407
Speaker 1: They won't send you a copy of it unless good for them.

780
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,664
Speaker 1: Good move Yeah, so you could make this stuff really sophisticated.

781
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:52,595
Speaker 1: if you want to be really clever You'd have to.

782
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:59,444
Speaker 1: I mean you could probably make one that would Encrypt all the files and keep encrypting all the backups you're taking.

783
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:01,070
Speaker 1: if it had a way to do that, right?

784
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:14,410
Speaker 0: That's the thing is if you take backups You know frequently right enough if the ransomware is dormantly encrypting things for a long enough time eventually your oldest backup Right, eventually all your backups are encrypted too and you don't realize it now.

785
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:19,183
Speaker 0: That would which is why you need to test your backups and make sure they work.

786
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:23,378
Speaker 1: Yep, and almost no one does that Nope, and when I did that.

787
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,287
Speaker 1: I do that at my previous company.

788
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:31,497
Speaker 1: when we did that We'd find a bad backup every now and then which was good because if we never found a bad backup I'd be worried that we weren't actually testing

789
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:37,487
Speaker 0: the thing that does our database backups also Not only does it MySQL dump but also loads them into a database to make sure they work.

790
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:44,906
Speaker 1: Yep But the ransomware is I think going to explode on the scene increasingly because it is actually.

791
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:46,370
Speaker 0: it's already big tech people.

792
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,110
Speaker 0: It was there then it was you know.

793
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,507
Speaker 0: Now it's like an everyday thing.

794
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:50,982
Speaker 0: It's an everyday thing for tech.

795
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:55,504
Speaker 0: people soon Expect to see it getting all over everybody who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.

796
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,090
Speaker 1: I've seen it hitting hospitals.

797
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,198
Speaker 1: I've seen it hitting like big companies.

798
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:06,930
Speaker 1: internally where you know, even if you've got a pretty good company There's always the trade-off between how much you lock down your PCs versus do you trust your employees?

799
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:11,584
Speaker 1: If you trust the wrong person malware up is oh that guy had access to the backups.

800
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:13,330
Speaker 0: Oh, well, it's not even that.

801
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:13,732
Speaker 0: It's like.

802
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:17,090
Speaker 0: if you know, even if your employees computers are way locked down and shit, right?

803
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,289
Speaker 0: You don't let them install stuff.

804
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,349
Speaker 0: Hopefully that would prevent the ransomware from getting them in the first place.

805
00:51:21,772 --> 00:51:26,599
Speaker 0: But if it doesn't because of some zero-day nonsense Maybe that person just has bad habits.

806
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,173
Speaker 0: and like they're in accounting and they saved a bunch of Excel sheets on their hard drive And that's it.

807
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:33,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't back them up and you can't make them back them out.

808
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:33,450
Speaker 1: It's funny.

809
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,093
Speaker 1: You mentioned that.

810
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:38,993
Speaker 1: so one of the examples I just pull up a ton of like exactly your whole company needs those Excel sheets That are encrypted.

811
00:51:39,113 --> 00:51:43,490
Speaker 1: I pulled up all these examples from the read from just recently just so I'd have like interesting points.

812
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:55,270
Speaker 1: There's the pet your ransomware, which is targeting HR departments in Germany specifically And because it's looking for that kind of situation of the HR person has a bunch of spreadsheets that they keep locally.

813
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,645
Speaker 1: They back it up occasionally like they're not stupid, but it's not automatically backed up.

814
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:04,706
Speaker 1: It's a thing just like on their PC Mm-hmm, and it goes one step further than just encrypting.

815
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:14,224
Speaker 1: it Crashes your PC into a BS OD suddenly once it's done and then when it tries to boot up It's encrypted the master boot record and all your data.

816
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:27,438
Speaker 1: Oh So they take that drive out and mount it on a Linux machine or something, yep Because zero days exist you pretty much cannot prevent 100% of the ways this could get a computer.

817
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:37,974
Speaker 1: the only way to absolutely protect yourself Ransomware is to have good reliable automated backups and Redundancy.

818
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:39,762
Speaker 0: see me know what that's actually like.

819
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:41,610
Speaker 0: that's actually kind of okay, right?

820
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,070
Speaker 0: Because you think about it a lot of other things like we're just gonna blow up your hard drive.

821
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,039
Speaker 0: It's like if there's a zero day, you're just fucked.

822
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, but something like this It's like oh, you know what backups are something you should be doing anyway.

823
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,369
Speaker 1: But if you didn't you're basically paying a tax to a terrorist to get your photos back.

824
00:52:58,032 --> 00:52:59,156
Speaker 0: I mean, they're evil for sure.

825
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,930
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say ransomware people are good, but at least they actually give you the files back.

826
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:12,926
Speaker 1: Sometimes yeah, no sometimes I found another example where there's a. there's a brand somewhere that had a bug in it So it actually wouldn't decrypt the files properly.

827
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:13,650
Speaker 1: It would just give you gibberish.

828
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,250
Speaker 1: But but someone like inspected the code and it looks like it's literally just a bug.

829
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:25,166
Speaker 1: So from what I can gather the guy who wrote the malware I thought the person who wrote the malware released a patch because they felt bad.

830
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:33,690
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, yeah They refunded the money of anyone who paid who fucked up like who lost their data and they released a patch.

831
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,889
Speaker 1: So if they hadn't like if they still had the messed up data, it would fix it for them.

832
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:38,954
Speaker 1: So, you know what?

833
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,689
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of honor left among thieves like the tiniest bit.

834
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:50,930
Speaker 0: We are punishing people who don't make but maybe it's just a huge campaign to get everyone to make backups Except I used to advocate for that in mid in high school.

835
00:53:51,010 --> 00:54:00,070
Speaker 1: I was like why don't I just write a malware that just nukes your computer and Just gives you and it fills your computer with nothing but pamphlets on how to have computer security?

836
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:01,860
Speaker 0: Sure.

837
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:10,400
Speaker 1: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
