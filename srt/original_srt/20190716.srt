Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a bunch of seafood places like right there.

12
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:48,346
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, I mean I would have gone to beach but I was dragged upstate.

13
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,779
Speaker 1: Oh Since I was dragged upstate I made the most of being dragged upstate.

Speaker 1: visited visited some nerds played some games You know ate some cake.

17
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07,530
Speaker 1: Went to cafe Maya to Sue Leonard.

18
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:15,817
Speaker 1: You know, it's pretty much everything possible that I could do on a trip upstate to make it Almost as good as going to be.

19
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:20,202
Speaker 0: like when we went to Rochester and we all went to the Wegmans That was that was like going to an amusement park.

20
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:20,926
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, pretty much.

21
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:21,490
Speaker 0: It was a good time.

22
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:22,504
Speaker 1: I wish I had a Wegmans.

23
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:29,170
Speaker 1: right now I'm trying to find some ingredients and I cannot find them at the store and I can't go to Whole Foods because until tomorrow.

24
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:34,219
Speaker 0: yeah, so you brought up the topic of Speed cloth.

25
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:35,248
Speaker 1: You're the one who brought.

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,880
Speaker 0: You asked me rim.

27
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,587
Speaker 0: Do you know about?

28
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,512
Speaker 0: Speed?

29
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:47,100
Speaker 1: well for a while I've been Researching right because you go to gaming cons and some gaming cons are ultra fancy and they put tablecloths in the tables But most of them do not.

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,410
Speaker 1: you got a plastic table, right?

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,945
Speaker 1: So it's like hey, you know, you're playing a board game with cardboard chips.

32
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:55,238
Speaker 1: You're playing card games You're playing something and you want to put down a cloth.

33
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,206
Speaker 1: you could you know CCG players.

34
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:01,693
Speaker 1: They just have the personal CCG mat, which is fine If everyone has one.

35
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:04,043
Speaker 1: you're playing CCGs, but you're playing a big old board game.

36
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,870
Speaker 1: You need a tablecloth to cover the whole table.

37
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:09,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like I should start bringing a play mat just to put it in front of myself.

38
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:14,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it doesn't cover like that center board area and sometimes it's too big for the game.

39
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,303
Speaker 0: Well, I gotta I gotta get one that's like small.

40
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:21,626
Speaker 0: I can eat a weird shape one That's only like I don't know seven like four to five inches.

41
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:22,510
Speaker 0: What tall?

42
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,704
Speaker 1: Is why mouse pad anyway weird mouse?

43
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,010
Speaker 1: I've been researching for a while.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,461
Speaker 1: Okay, what's a good cloth to get to use as a tablecloth and just you know, fold it up put it in my luggage You know, it should fold up pretty tight, right?

45
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah and bring it to cons.

46
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,894
Speaker 1: It would take up as much room.

47
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:38,978
Speaker 1: My luggage is like a towel.

48
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:50,950
Speaker 0: What's funny is I have that goldenrod tablecloth I bought along with those two butt pads to bring to conventions to deal with crappy chairs and crappy tables And I've never actually brought them to any convention.

49
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,144
Speaker 1: So I was researching, you know, what material to use.

50
00:02:54,204 --> 00:03:04,962
Speaker 1: someone once told me there was some kind of like like brush something brush Something something like that or something like that.

51
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,730
Speaker 0: What do you want a velour tablecloth?

52
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,336
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I found out more recently that there's a thing called speed cloth and like now this already reeks of gamer Goo to me.

53
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,688
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it reeks big-time.

54
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:30,670
Speaker 1: And I researched and I found out that basically people who make poker tables Which I guess people who are really into poker they get way into the materials The exact right cards the exact right chips the exact right table the exact right everything.

55
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,906
Speaker 0: I mean look at the nerds buying the wormwood like special wooden dice thing.

56
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:35,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think that right?

57
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:43,310
Speaker 1: It's like a man, you know, it's like all nerds are the same and those nerds are using that dice tower for a variety of Games, this is someone who plays one game.

58
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:48,228
Speaker 0: I mean, I was thinking about making custom pieces just for myself when I play Tigris and Euphrates.

59
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:53,645
Speaker 1: But anyway Apparently poker people are fans of this material called speed.

60
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:54,950
Speaker 1: cloth is better than felt.

61
00:03:55,452 --> 00:04:03,238
Speaker 1: I also saw some people may be using it for pool tables possibly which seemed weird cuz I think that sounds like What sounds like any pool tables are made out?

62
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like you need a regulated felt surface for a pool table.

63
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:07,295
Speaker 1: You can't be using.

64
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,130
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm seeing alternative cloth.

65
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:13,970
Speaker 0: I have seen all their coverings for pool tables usually because those are not even slate pool tables.

66
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:18,733
Speaker 0: but there are honeycomb pool tables also known as So garbage.

67
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:20,704
Speaker 1: that's like getting a non-photon air hockey.

68
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:21,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't play on that.

69
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,945
Speaker 1: I don't even play pool and I know that much.

70
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:29,153
Speaker 0: when we were kids Well, I was wanted a pool table because like the whole family played pool and weird like one day We finally got one cuz.

71
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:34,028
Speaker 0: my parents saved up to make sure we got a single piece slate pool table.

72
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:34,670
Speaker 1: That's fucking right.

73
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 0: I don't even I can't even barely hit the ball and I know that my dad spent like an entire day Leveling it before we were allowed to touch it.

74
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:43,347
Speaker 1: good did it right?

75
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:48,430
Speaker 1: Yeah Point is this thing called speed cloth and it's a. it's a cloth poker people are a fan.

76
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,570
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just polyester as far as I can tell.

77
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:55,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to see some in person and feel it up to know if it's actually any worth the damn.

78
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,297
Speaker 1: But it doesn't sound like it.

79
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:16,010
Speaker 1: but almost all the speed cloth I could find online is what's known as Suited speed cloth, which means it's not the smooth solid color it has basically the symbols of the four suits of cards spades clubs diamonds hearts and Sort of a grid and all of it in the whole world that I could find online as the exact same pattern on it.

80
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:18,857
Speaker 1: Only one place makes it.

81
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:26,405
Speaker 0: it's almost like if you were selling this stuff to nerds and you called it I don't know D&D because it has or like I don't know nerded cuz.

82
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,650
Speaker 0: it's got like the Dyson.

83
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:36,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only places I could pictures of dragons and elves I could only find a very few places to get unsuited speed cloth and it was like an auto upholstery place.

84
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,739
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,029
Speaker 1: I'll see if it's actually worth it.

86
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:53,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, my worry as I'm looking at the speed cloth more and more is that I don't think it would work Well for a gaming surface because if it's polyester the way I'm imagining then it requires Tension to be a nice man.

87
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:57,630
Speaker 1: It is I think it is meant to go up, you know onto a poker table where it's pulled tight.

88
00:05:57,852 --> 00:05:59,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see.

89
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:12,948
Speaker 0: yeah, I just I feel like we've thought about this a lot and a lot of nerds have because frankly most gaming cons like Actual spaces you have to play games Tend to kind of suck like PAX is a weird exception.

90
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:20,090
Speaker 0: and even then Yeah, but packs has all those side rooms while these packs West has all those side rooms.

91
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,783
Speaker 0: No, it's that are small and not that loud.

92
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:22,590
Speaker 0: No tablecloths.

93
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:31,737
Speaker 0: I feel like we need to put together our kit of the stuff we bring for the premium experience gaming at Nerd tabletop conventions.

94
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,124
Speaker 1: We'll go to fabric store in the city and feel up some cloth.

95
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,409
Speaker 0: I feel like we should feel them up.

96
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,898
Speaker 0: So there's a whole bunch of gaming news.

97
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:41,930
Speaker 0: We're just gonna touch on a little gaming episode in a while.

98
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 0: I know which is usually the show that's easy to do.

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Speaker 1: It's really hard to you know, you know Keep like several weeks of gaming news.

100
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,130
Speaker 1: We always end up doing the gaming news from like fucking today.

101
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:56,544
Speaker 0: Yep, so, uh one thing I saw this that I'm pretty excited about.

102
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,491
Speaker 0: this is posted actually yesterday at 7.

103
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,177
Speaker 0: So it's pretty new.

104
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:04,230
Speaker 0: but as you know overwatch Among other great like it has pretty good game design.

105
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,520
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things I like about.

106
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:19,891
Speaker 0: overwatch is one of my favorite games But one of the things that Kaplan the game the game equivalent of a showrunner the game director He has taken a very hard line on leavers on toxic people on cheaters Etc.

107
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:23,961
Speaker 0: because as far as I'm concerned zero tolerance zero forgiveness.

108
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:24,703
Speaker 0: No appeals.

109
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,287
Speaker 0: You're just done all these things.

110
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:26,748
Speaker 1: I agree.

111
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:34,893
Speaker 0: So They're implementing a much more comprehensive Cheating response System.

112
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:36,480
Speaker 0: Okay, and the way it'll work.

113
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,750
Speaker 0: Is that in any overwatch game?

114
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:51,662
Speaker 0: Even if it's competitive just like any game if the system detects that even one player is cheating in any way The game will instantly end Will not count at all and the cheater will be banned.

115
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,987
Speaker 1: What if it's a false positive?

116
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,777
Speaker 0: Uh Frankly, I'm willing to take that chance.

117
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:57,379
Speaker 1: What if it's you?

118
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,330
Speaker 0: I Doubt that will happen because I am upper silver.

119
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,334
Speaker 1: What if it happens?

120
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:03,398
Speaker 0: I doubt it.

121
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,919
Speaker 0: I mean if their algorithm is wrong, it'll destroy the game.

122
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,440
Speaker 0: That point out there thing is I'm pretty sure kind of like look with leavers and everything.

123
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:26,080
Speaker 0: They've been done pretty good at giving people like the right number of strikes before they're just done because you know You might be playing a competitive game and you leave because your house literally is on fire.

124
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:29,480
Speaker 0: So I feel like everybody gets one like sometimes your house burns down.

125
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:35,726
Speaker 1: I just feel like you know, that's a good thing because at least now there won't be any tainted games on record Right, which is good.

126
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,859
Speaker 1: But also it's sort of annoying to have your game just end.

127
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'd rather the game end than play at all with a cheater.

128
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:51,418
Speaker 1: Sure, but also I feel like if your cheats Even with just a system like say VAC which just bans you if you cheat and that's it, right?

129
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,983
Speaker 1: Presumably It's like.

130
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:56,714
Speaker 1: well if it detects you you're banned and you're not gonna get into too many games.

131
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,467
Speaker 1: and if it doesn't detect you Well, this system isn't gonna really help with that.

132
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,269
Speaker 1: You're still gonna.

133
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,838
Speaker 1: you're gonna play cheaty games with people of undetectable cheats.

134
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,008
Speaker 0: Yep I think this is mostly in response to.

135
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:16,540
Speaker 0: I think what's going on is they have a better way to detect cheaters that they're comfortable turning on mid game instead of like post game review follow-up bans.

136
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,565
Speaker 0: So, I mean the update was I think what they.

137
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:26,445
Speaker 1: you know, I think the biggest thing is simply just like let you know when you're a player Who's not a cheater, right?

138
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:31,560
Speaker 1: It's you know, you never know if someone was cheating or not, right?

139
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:31,984
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

140
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:43,820
Speaker 0: and to that point 99% of the time when I'm in a game and someone says oh so-and-so is cheating No, so-and-so is just good and you're bad and you think that guy's cheating because he actually knows how to shoot exactly.

141
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,100
Speaker 1: So the point is it'd be really nice if you could just know for sure like aha that guy was cheating the whole time.

142
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:06,700
Speaker 1: And also if you see aha that guy was cheating the whole times like a game end and it call out a person and ban Them and you say aha then in that situation You just described where someone is just good and not cheating someone says so-and-so is cheating.

143
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,592
Speaker 1: Well, how come this game hasn't ended yet and they haven't been man yet.

144
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:12,022
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess they're not cheating Are they?

145
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,427
Speaker 1: I was just in a game.

146
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,895
Speaker 1: I saw that the anti cheating thing clearly works.

147
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 1: I've seen it happen.

148
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:18,886
Speaker 0: I was and it's not happening now.

149
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:24,224
Speaker 1: Therefore either this is undetectable cheats, which is or They're not cheating.

150
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:35,020
Speaker 0: where I was playing a game the other day where someone on the other team was getting salty and kept complaining that like our our Tracer was cheating like all that tracers will see me through walls and like freaking out like kill me all the time.

151
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,240
Speaker 0: So then I end of global chat.

152
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,009
Speaker 0: I was just like hey, I'm gonna start cheating too.

153
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:44,043
Speaker 0: And all I did was focus fire at that guy Mm-hmm.

154
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,309
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything different.

155
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:47,378
Speaker 0: He was just really easy to kill cuz he was really bad.

156
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:53,938
Speaker 0: Yeah So there is actually some other overwatch news, I think is the biggest gaming news today here.

157
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:09,220
Speaker 0: because Right now eSports is still in this interesting sort of liminal period where it's big money and it's growing But it's also inheriting a lot of the problems of non eSports and it's a panel on this once and almost no one was there.

158
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:13,618
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's hard to tell I don't blame it was like Monday morning at PAX West.

159
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,399
Speaker 0: Yep But so tired, there's a whole big space going on there.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:25,360
Speaker 0: But one of the biggest problems with eSports is that while there is a home team The home team in most eSports does not play in its home.

161
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,020
Speaker 1: I mean overwatch League is like one of the only sports like with you know teams going on.

162
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,920
Speaker 1: You know, even the other ones that have teams like MOBAs.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,898
Speaker 1: It's like well they all get together and all play and all the all the whole.

164
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:36,903
Speaker 1: you know Dota International.

165
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,995
Speaker 0: everyone's there and it's easy for nerds to underestimate the power of that.

166
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:40,296
Speaker 0: cuz like.

167
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:48,339
Speaker 0: I don't like baseball I don't really care that much about baseball but because I live in Queens if the Mets win I feel a little good and I'm a little bit inclined attention.

168
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,424
Speaker 1: This is the thing that you know.

169
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,172
Speaker 1: nerds may not realize.

170
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,000
Speaker 1: they don't pay too much attention to real sports.

171
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:01,908
Speaker 1: Which you should is that you know a sport like football, you know, NFL football is a You know national sport, right?

172
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,574
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter where.

173
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:08,160
Speaker 1: if you are interested in football You can follow the whole football, right?

174
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,280
Speaker 1: You know every team what every team is doing, you know, a football game is like a nationally televised program, right?

175
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:21,200
Speaker 1: Soccer is like a world, you know, some of it at least is a world level sport like the Premier League.

176
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:24,560
Speaker 1: You know those teams have fans around the entire world.

177
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,812
Speaker 1: There are people in like, you know, all sorts of random countries is a Premier League game.

178
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,319
Speaker 1: That is a world broadcast event, right?

179
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:31,820
Speaker 1: Usually.

180
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:45,840
Speaker 1: but you know Major League Baseball in the United States is a Super local event, even if you follow it and are into it you are following most likely almost entirely your team in your area.

181
00:12:46,221 --> 00:13:00,508
Speaker 1: There's a lot of content for a lot of people but in a small Geographical space, right and people who aren't in New York or for some reason a Mets fan who doesn't live in New York You're paying no attention to anything.

182
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 1: The Mets are doing you can't name a player on their team, you know Right Mets games are broadcast in the New York area.

183
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,993
Speaker 1: You have to like do crazy shit to watch them outside the New York area, right.

184
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,100
Speaker 1: and baseball is a very local sport.

185
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:22,094
Speaker 1: so all eSports right since they're digital and broadcast to the whole world are sort of Global events to everyone who cares about them, right?

186
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,140
Speaker 1: It's the Dota International.

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,131
Speaker 1: It's like I. everyone who plays Dota is watching this doesn't matter where you are.

188
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:35,118
Speaker 1: All right, so trying to introduce Locality to eSports sort of is a mismatch but is sort of also desirable.

189
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:41,960
Speaker 0: Yep I think it's the right move commercially to help eSports grow and like really enter the mainstream in the long run.

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,080
Speaker 1: Right because when you have something an eSport like, you know a MOBA where especially the player count on teams is low, right?

191
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:51,240
Speaker 1: Then you and you bring the whole world together.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,360
Speaker 1: There's a very small number of people who can make enough money on that, right?

193
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,406
Speaker 1: But if you can get people to care about, you know, the local eSports team Right, right.

194
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:04,435
Speaker 1: That's playing in regular stuff.

195
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,414
Speaker 1: that greatly Increases the audience and the revenues.

196
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:08,474
Speaker 1: so

197
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,640
Speaker 0: as much as I want to know

198
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:14,702
Speaker 1: And then also mostly the number of people who can make a living by being athletes But

199
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:21,752
Speaker 0: as much as I want to be a fan of the New York team versus other teams They all didn't know them played in New York.

200
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, the New York team does not play in New York.

201
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,540
Speaker 1: They visit New York a lot and they like do events here and stuff.

202
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,780
Speaker 1: I've never gone to one even though I thought about it, but like I wouldn't I wouldn't watch all their games.

203
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,369
Speaker 0: I would just decide randomly.

204
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,420
Speaker 0: Hey, I feel like watching overwatch.

205
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,299
Speaker 0: I was looking to see if a game was on and I would watch whatever game was on did not care who was playing.

206
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,146
Speaker 0: Nope So now the changes are.

207
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:59,580
Speaker 0: they're moving to a division based format, which is more like traditional sports and so there'll be four divisions and Every team is now required to host at minimum two and at maximum five local weekend events.

208
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:05,160
Speaker 0: The teams are responsible for selecting and operating their own venues and the league will be in charge of the broadcast.

209
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:09,179
Speaker 1: So if you're interested enough in the sport to attend it locally, right?

210
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,920
Speaker 1: You're suddenly going to care about that team because you're gonna see them every time you go to the local event, right?

211
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:25,600
Speaker 1: You're gonna see other teams mixed up, but you're always gonna see that same team when you go to the place near you Yep, whereas if you're only watching online you're seeing whoever's on at the time you happen to be on.

212
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:31,445
Speaker 0: I think this is big news because the experience of seeing a sport in person as to my knowledge No one has done this.

213
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,074
Speaker 0: Yeah with fans around you.

214
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:34,060
Speaker 0: It's a very different.

215
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:37,900
Speaker 0: I love hockey but hockey is just better if you're with a crowd of screaming idiots.

216
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:45,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I want to be in a crowd of screaming idiots watching overwatch Yep, so I will go to any games that are in New York if I'm able to.

217
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,500
Speaker 1: there have been games in New York.

218
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,950
Speaker 1: You didn't go.

219
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:53,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that cuz I didn't know about them till after because I didn't expect it I told you about them before.

220
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,680
Speaker 0: no, I don't think you did or you told me too late.

221
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,868
Speaker 1: They had a thing at Barclays didn't they?

222
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,715
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Barclays does not count.

223
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:00,618
Speaker 1: Okay.

224
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:05,352
Speaker 0: I'm not going Under no circumstances while I go to Barclays right where it's gonna be then.

225
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:05,955
Speaker 0: I'm not going.

226
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,420
Speaker 0: Barclays is a hole.

227
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:09,990
Speaker 1: It's super new that's all.

228
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:11,340
Speaker 0: yeah, it is a hole.

229
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:22,460
Speaker 0: So in some other sort of meta news as you know, and we talked about a while ago Civilization 6 added a feature that has been lacking from Civ games since the beginning of time.

230
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,847
Speaker 1: But since the beginning of time has been added to Civ by players doing it their own way Which is play by email.

231
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:38,220
Speaker 1: you play a game of Civ you take your turn you save the game You send the file to someone else they open the game They take their turn and they save the game and they send you the file.

232
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:53,980
Speaker 1: so then this was first done with floppy disks then done with emails then now it's done with apps like giant multiplayer robot Play your damn turn Third-party apps that handle it for you and arrange things for you and make it a little bit easier.

233
00:16:54,361 --> 00:17:07,626
Speaker 1: They finally after six versions of civilization the game have added an official version of this to the civilization 6 client at least on PC not on any other release on iPad or anything or Now.

234
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:12,967
Speaker 0: I have played multiplayer save online Extensively for years.

235
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,359
Speaker 0: I have games that have been going multiple years that I'm still playing.

236
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,530
Speaker 0: I'm currently in five active games.

237
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,836
Speaker 1: I'm only in two games.

238
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:26,599
Speaker 0: However The Civ 6 play by cloud does not fucking work at all.

239
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,874
Speaker 1: What if I as of today see they added it and I was like.

240
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,039
Speaker 1: finally they added it.

241
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:31,803
Speaker 1: now I will never.

242
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,309
Speaker 0: you had all the right features.

243
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,920
Speaker 1: I was like they will that I will never use this unofficial thing again.

244
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,442
Speaker 1: Let me finish the two games I'm in.

245
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,563
Speaker 1: then I'll start games using the official but more importantly and never had Uninstall these unofficial.

246
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,335
Speaker 0: it had the features that no one could do with a third party.

247
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:54,923
Speaker 0: the main feature that would make it a killer App is that if you take your turn you can also go back in and just look at the map anytime like oh Which is there?

248
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:56,409
Speaker 0: that's in the Civ 6 thing.

249
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,192
Speaker 1: Very nice.

250
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you're thinking like what should I do?

251
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,159
Speaker 0: Someone else's turn is happening and they want to maybe coordinate some some raiding and pillaging with you.

252
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:14,819
Speaker 1: Oh, you can open up and take do diplomacy Just like get into a discord and be like, okay So you can open up the game at the same time and do diplomacy with them.

253
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,273
Speaker 0: You can know you can open up the game at the same time and just see you can.

254
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:19,124
Speaker 0: I can look at the game as Though it's a single-player.

255
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,196
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like yeah, I got an extra citrus.

256
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:36,338
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, send me send me that you a spear man in three turns and if Multiple players are online at the same time and I take my turn and you're already in the map It'll just turn into your turn for you.

257
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,610
Speaker 0: Like you're playing a real live online game.

258
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:49,852
Speaker 0: So you can have a play by mail game during the week But then say every other Sunday you agree to just all play a whole bunch of turns together for a few hours and as

259
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,353
Speaker 1: of today 100%

260
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:56,687
Speaker 0: of these civ6 play by cloud games I have started or joined

261
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:57,510
Speaker 1: have failed

262
00:18:58,772 --> 00:18:59,354
Speaker 0: The main.

263
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:10,421
Speaker 0: there's a lot of bugs a lot of UX issues But the main problem is that it seems to just randomly kick Players out of the games and replace them with a eyes.

264
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:11,645
Speaker 0: There's no way to put the.

265
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,910
Speaker 1: who fucking knows What does it look like when it happens?

266
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,750
Speaker 1: Okay, you take your turn and then and then an AI just takes the next person's turn and then it's the next person's turn.

267
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:22,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, like yeah stuff like that happens.

268
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,783
Speaker 0: So if I go into my games now one of them shows two out of eight players.

269
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,469
Speaker 0: that game had eight humans in it.

270
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,340
Speaker 0: None of them quit on purpose.

271
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,010
Speaker 0: None of them did anything weird.

272
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,925
Speaker 1: No one tried to kick them out and take too long to take their turn and there's no.

273
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,090
Speaker 0: that feature doesn't exist.

274
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:39,350
Speaker 0: You can't set timers to kick people out.

275
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,420
Speaker 0: Okay, that feature only exists in all these third-party things.

276
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,430
Speaker 1: and what feature is there for the AI taking over?

277
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,710
Speaker 0: Uh, it just happened and now the games are all ruined.

278
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:55,510
Speaker 0: So we've quit them all and now we've started a new civ6 game using player damn term because it actually works.

279
00:19:55,891 --> 00:20:00,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like we have to use a thing called GMR to place it five and you IDT to place it.

280
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:07,109
Speaker 0: so What I don't understand the reason I'm talking about this?

281
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,113
Speaker 0: This is not a hard feature Is it?

282
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:15,284
Speaker 1: you like online plenty of games get online real-time multiplayer, right?

283
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,109
Speaker 1: Look at overwatch, right?

284
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:19,880
Speaker 1: You play online in real time and it works.

285
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:20,402
Speaker 1: it works.

286
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:22,270
Speaker 1: It's this turn-based multiplayer.

287
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:26,830
Speaker 1: How come almost no games used to have it and almost no games get it, right?

288
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,488
Speaker 1: It's way way way easy compared to doing real-time multiplayer, which several games do.

289
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:38,510
Speaker 1: yep Why can a tiny game studio make like a rocket league with effectively perfect online multiplayer?

290
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,629
Speaker 1: Nintendo can't make an online multiplayer, but that's besides the point.

291
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:42,452
Speaker 1: But how come?

292
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:51,767
Speaker 1: like even civilization the world's number one turn-based game, which I assume is the number one turn-based game in the world Wasn't able to do this even since the 90s?

293
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,158
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just.

294
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:54,711
Speaker 0: it's amazing to me But it did.

295
00:20:55,113 --> 00:21:03,486
Speaker 0: it has failed us so consistently that we're just going to ignore it and maybe in a couple of years I'll look and see if maybe save seven seven gets it, right?

296
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:11,943
Speaker 0: Yeah Until someone tells me that it's working I'm just never gonna use this playbook cloud feature again, because it's just not fucking work the same.

297
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:14,310
Speaker 0: so some other news.

298
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:29,817
Speaker 0: The nation of Jordan you may have seen recently banned pub G Yeah And now they're on a spree of banning lots of other games and it seems like the main criteria for being banned is being online Multiplayer and popular.

299
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,790
Speaker 0: Yep, so they're going to ban fortnight.

300
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:41,260
Speaker 1: All right, so everyone start playing a game that is not popular and keep switching FPS is they'll never find them all start playing Quake 1. let's see him ban that.

301
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:41,664
Speaker 0: yep.

302
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:44,367
Speaker 0: Ah They could trivially ban that.

303
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:44,690
Speaker 1: how?

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,965
Speaker 0: Well, well, so I guess yeah, if someone runs a local server someone could play it.

305
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:50,587
Speaker 0: That's right.

306
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:51,370
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

307
00:21:51,711 --> 00:22:01,139
Speaker 0: There's no point in banning games that aren't just online with modern services because kids have no idea and will never be able to Connect to an off-the-grid game.

308
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:09,090
Speaker 1: Let's start popularizing quake 2 in Jordan and create the ultimate FPS gods and then Get them to come to the US and be overwatch guys.

309
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:17,695
Speaker 0: Just make make a battle royale in like the quake 2 or quake 3 or unreal engine and just to see Mod battle royale.

310
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:22,170
Speaker 1: then get it popularized and go to Jordan bring it on a DVD or whatever.

311
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,675
Speaker 0: All you got to do is teach people.

312
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,659
Speaker 0: It's not there.

313
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,610
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, it's just quick to just got to teach people how to run.

314
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:31,788
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is what they seem to be going after is games that kids will play online.

315
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:47,628
Speaker 0: Yep Which goes back to a point that I bring up a lot on geek nights that the US government has a lot of problems But the only thing that would be worse than the US having control over what games are allowed to run online Would be if literally any other country on earth had that power.

316
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:58,457
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Destiny 2 which is a game that I have zero interest in playing but it's basically like an online Loot shooter kind of game.

317
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,170
Speaker 0: you either know about it and play it know about it and have the same opinion.

318
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,096
Speaker 0: I do like that.

319
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:14,010
Speaker 0: This is one of the popular games but there keep being Exploits and ways to quote-unquote cheat and the newest one is extra funny that all come down to the same thing.

320
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:18,590
Speaker 0: People want to get a whole bunch of loot in this game, but you can't get the loot without grinding.

321
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,100
Speaker 1: Yep, the grinding game.

322
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:20,623
Speaker 0: Yep.

323
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:27,407
Speaker 0: So Lately, the latest exploit is that there's this one kind of match you can play in the game.

324
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,590
Speaker 0: I don't play destinies.

325
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:48,410
Speaker 0: I got no idea what this is The Forge Whatever it is, and if you join a Forge match and just walk away from your computer You'll just stand there and eventually you'll lose and then you get loot and then the game Automatically puts you in the queue to be added to another game of Forge where you will then die and lose and get more loot.

326
00:23:48,851 --> 00:24:06,870
Speaker 1: And it's gotten to the point to where a huge number of people like a scary person are leaving their computers on computers on playing this mode Just collecting loot doing nothing What they're basically doing progress quest, but they're actually getting actual progress in an MMO effectively.

327
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:06,953
Speaker 1: Yep

328
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:23,345
Speaker 0: I feel like the main warning sign that a game is not actually fun and is just addictive or is using addictive things to trick You is if you would feel the desire to do something ridiculous like this to level your character up in the game like that is.

329
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:25,900
Speaker 1: This is what happens.

330
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,804
Speaker 1: You have video games.

331
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:28,090
Speaker 1: You've had them for a long time.

332
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:33,896
Speaker 1: They're rewarding mastery or Rewarding learning or rewarding it.

333
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:40,810
Speaker 1: they reward time spent and they don't reward and the only way they can measure time spent is not They can't actually measure your human time.

334
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:45,069
Speaker 1: They can only measure your CPU time and that's basically what Bitcoin is.

335
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:46,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically all right.

336
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:49,881
Speaker 1: We'll rank each other by who will spend the most CPU time.

337
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,790
Speaker 1: and now you know video games do it coins do it.

338
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,369
Speaker 1: It's all bullshit.

339
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:54,316
Speaker 1: But I feel like they're not.

340
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:59,423
Speaker 0: waste your CPU time on bullshit like Like trying to think of a good example like Borderlands right.

341
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,950
Speaker 0: Borderlands was kind of fun to play.

342
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:09,890
Speaker 0: We were playing it for a while, but the game that rewards time spent Yeah, and then we quit because we saw everything we could see and everything else to see just involve waiting.

343
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:15,230
Speaker 1: Oh, I got a different colored gun that shoots different colored bullets and kills different looking bad guys faster.

344
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:16,749
Speaker 1: But it's the basically the same thing.

345
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:24,934
Speaker 0: But in that game if someone gave you an option to just give yourself max stats and the best weapons Would you do it?

346
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:28,810
Speaker 1: I'd play through the entire campaign once and then stop yep.

347
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:37,021
Speaker 0: And that that's how you can figure out if a game is tricking you and it's tricking your rat kid brain Into doing something addictive and dumb like Final Fantasy 6.

348
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:39,330
Speaker 1: I play the whole game beat beat Kafka and then be done.

349
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

350
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,418
Speaker 0: Well granted as a kid.

351
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:44,510
Speaker 0: I farmed dinosaurs until I got everyone could cast Ultima.

352
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:46,355
Speaker 0: That was kid brain.

353
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:47,420
Speaker 1: you had nothing better to do.

354
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,208
Speaker 0: Yeah adult brain would not do that time.

355
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,704
Speaker 1: for that time I might.

356
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:06,080
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day so breath of the wild is still in my opinion the best Zelda game ever released.

357
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:07,324
Speaker 1: Have you played them all?

358
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:07,746
Speaker 1: how do you know?

359
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:08,991
Speaker 0: I played a lot of them.

360
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:14,659
Speaker 0: name name a Zelda game better Than breath of the wild and your direct personal opinion?

361
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:20,919
Speaker 1: Hmm No, no, it's basically tied with like, you know Zelda ones all the three?

362
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:24,213
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, but I think it's just a better Zelda one like Zelda one.

363
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,960
Speaker 0: I would not expect kids to play today.

364
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,066
Speaker 1: So the one just has kids suck.

365
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:28,809
Speaker 1: It's not cuz all the ones.

366
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:31,300
Speaker 0: so Zelda one was a product of its time.

367
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,380
Speaker 0: It's not that good by a completely naive modern standard.

368
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:39,029
Speaker 1: I think it's very good to think people just lack Imagination because they have been exposed to the modern times.

369
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:48,380
Speaker 1: if you're if your brain was not exposed to breath of the wild and you had You know, you grew up at the time cuz my kid brain was willing to burn every bush until I found every secret.

370
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:49,445
Speaker 1: That's right a kid have?

371
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:52,840
Speaker 1: I made a baby right now and that baby never saw breath of the wild.

372
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,864
Speaker 1: They would burn every bush.

373
00:26:54,867 --> 00:27:02,099
Speaker 0: I would just put the kid in breath of the wild and let them experience a modern good game Yeah, and then later show them Zelda one in a museum.

374
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:07,231
Speaker 0: Zelda 2 is also arguably a better game the Zelda one, but I think so.

375
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:15,855
Speaker 1: The two is down at the bottom, but it is above Minish cap and Minish cap is above the train one.

376
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:16,760
Speaker 0: Oh, I did.

377
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:20,891
Speaker 0: I played like two ish hours at the train one and then I sold it.

378
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:24,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the train one called a phantom hourglass?

379
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,400
Speaker 0: No, not phantom hourglass is better than yeah, but I didn't beat phantom hourglass either.

380
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,210
Speaker 0: It's better than Zelda 2, but it stood now.

381
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,036
Speaker 0: Zelda 2 was better than phantom hourglass.

382
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:33,277
Speaker 1: Nope.

383
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,880
Speaker 0: I I did not beat phantom hourglass cuz I got really bored Wasn't as boring as Minish cap?

384
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:50,487
Speaker 0: But one of the things that makes breath of the wild so particularly good is that among other things the sound design is Utterly fucking phenomenal.

385
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:53,279
Speaker 1: I mean, that's how it is, you know, they paid attention to all that's.

386
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,484
Speaker 1: you know That's what Nintendo does.

387
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,287
Speaker 1: is they polish?

388
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,416
Speaker 1: the fuck right and they pay attention to all these.

389
00:27:57,457 --> 00:28:02,030
Speaker 1: ridiculously tiny Is semi procedurally generated like music.

390
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,740
Speaker 1: people don't know, you know, they're all these crazy crazy detailed.

391
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:17,694
Speaker 1: Very, you know tiny were intricate work like when people paint like, you know, there's really tiny things you can only see with a magnifying glass and basically, you don't notice it when you're playing you just go wow, this game is fucking incredible.

392
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:25,304
Speaker 1: and then you know If someone actually takes out the magnifying glass and points out these details, you're like, oh my god I didn't know that was there.

393
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,357
Speaker 1: I didn't know that tiny owl was hidden on my dollar bill.

394
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:28,979
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

395
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:48,225
Speaker 0: so this video in about 10 minutes goes into a lot of detail on the specific techniques that the sound design of breath of the wild did and Some of these things are really subtle or they're things that an average player even after beating the game May have never encountered.

396
00:28:48,727 --> 00:29:00,262
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the thing that really bothers me the most is that you know I've seen quite a hint quite a lot of videos about not only breath of the wild but other Nintendo games and other games in Pointing out.

397
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:07,086
Speaker 1: look at this really subtle thing that you would never notice that they did to make this game great Right, and it's like.

398
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,594
Speaker 1: well everyone watches these videos.

399
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:13,271
Speaker 1: They get tons of views They get posted links everywhere and all the gaming news sites, right.

400
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,000
Speaker 1: and then you look at other games.

401
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:17,929
Speaker 1: Pretty much don't do them.

402
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,303
Speaker 1: It's like gee Christ if you're making a game Right.

403
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:21,965
Speaker 1: It's like.

404
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:25,134
Speaker 0: go watch all the videos like this and I can tell you why.

405
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:32,227
Speaker 0: it's the same reason why there's no more advanced Wars games because the amount of human effort it takes to actually You might not be able to do it to the same degree

406
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:46,774
Speaker 1: But you could at least do learn something from it and incorporate some amount of it into your other game Right instead of putting out an unpolished, you know blocky ass, whatever.

407
00:29:47,055 --> 00:30:03,480
Speaker 0: Well one thing I can say from I have seen a lot of industry stuff internally talking about how Among like the bigger studios They spending about as much effort on polish as you spent on core design is the norm.

408
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:11,831
Speaker 0: yeah, that's very and that is not feasible for a smaller game unless that game is Basically just entirely polished and basically just a proof of concept.

409
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:19,833
Speaker 1: No, no, you can't spend equal to if you're a small place You can't spend equal time but you can spend a little bit more than I see a lot of places spending.

411
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:28,897
Speaker 0: the way the music in the Grasslands and breath of the wild works and the way the day-to-night transitions happen and the way town music works.

412
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,446
Speaker 1: Holy shit I mean, you know she gave me a motto.

413
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:35,300
Speaker 1: he once famously said a delayed game is eventually good.

414
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,735
Speaker 1: Oh a bad game is just bad forever.

415
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:43,200
Speaker 0: by that logic Half-life 3 is the greatest game any human has ever conceived.

416
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:46,455
Speaker 1: Maybe it is but that's actually what happened with half-life 1. is they just get?

417
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,640
Speaker 1: they didn't set a release date.

418
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:49,513
Speaker 1: They just kept fucking delaying that shit.

419
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:52,628
Speaker 1: delaying it delaying it Eventually came out like oh it's perfect.

420
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,920
Speaker 0: now the craziest one at the end of this video.

421
00:30:55,361 --> 00:31:18,907
Speaker 0: The thing that's so subtle is there is a thing that happens and you can only experience it if you are in The upper parts of the atmosphere like on the highest mountains that are usually dirt like constantly raining or snow storming Mm-hmm, and it happens to be daylight and the weather which happens very rarely happens to get sunny and clear While you are standing up there.

422
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:24,657
Speaker 0: something specific and coded just to that moment happens And it's pretty cool.

423
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:25,974
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

424
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,506
Speaker 1: What did I have?

425
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:35,600
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so Hockey's far away and all the summer sports, you know, we had a lot of them just ended like the international ones.

426
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:36,498
Speaker 1: We won some soccer.

427
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:38,999
Speaker 1: You know some tennis just ended.

428
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:42,327
Speaker 1: No baseball is not going to great.

429
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, I I've been.

430
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:46,540
Speaker 0: I'm planning to watch that Wimbledon match later.

431
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:49,493
Speaker 1: I know the outcome but I saw when I was standing in a Verizon store.

432
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:53,088
Speaker 0: I saw the outcome so I know spoilers I guess but I actually want to watch it.

433
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really good.

434
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:55,740
Speaker 0: tennis is real good to watch.

435
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,785
Speaker 0: She's one of my favorite sports.

436
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, tennis is one of the best sports.

437
00:31:58,794 --> 00:31:59,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, you want to learn how to play tennis?

438
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,259
Speaker 1: No, I hate playing tennis cuz I got to run back and forth.

439
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:03,788
Speaker 0: Not if you're good.

440
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,863
Speaker 1: I Just like hitting the could.

441
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:07,831
Speaker 1: I stand perfectly still just hit the ball only.

442
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:10,422
Speaker 0: Uh, if you're really good at racquetball You could.

443
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:11,606
Speaker 1: let's just play badminton instead.

444
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:12,691
Speaker 0: Let's play right badminton.

445
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,242
Speaker 0: Yes, you think you don't have to run around in bad man As far.

446
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:18,706
Speaker 1: yeah Much smaller court.

447
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's play some badminton.

448
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:21,760
Speaker 0: I want to see how this goes.

449
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,097
Speaker 1: Actually, I recently found out there's like a super like badminton place over in like Regal Park.

450
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,326
Speaker 1: Oh anyway The point is it's not.

451
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:33,252
Speaker 1: most of the sports are not happening.

452
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,740
Speaker 1: Especially our favorite sport of hockey is not happening right now.

453
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:45,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I found some interesting Off-season hockey stuff is actually really old but it doesn't have too many views and basically it is real behind-the-scenes shit Right.

454
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:50,060
Speaker 1: It's like you hear all the time about, you know teams and sports trading players, right?

455
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,752
Speaker 1: And it's like up on the news.

456
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:56,114
Speaker 1: suddenly on the news They're like so-and-so traded so-and-so for this and that and the other thing, right?

457
00:32:56,194 --> 00:32:59,646
Speaker 1: or people are reporting it Beforehand and all kinds of stuff like that, right?

458
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:04,000
Speaker 1: It's like what actually fucking happens when teams trade.

459
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:09,927
Speaker 1: It's like how do you like if I oh if I'm a GM of a team and I want to trade player I call the other GM on the other team.

460
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:10,448
Speaker 1: We agree.

461
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:10,910
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

462
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,315
Speaker 1: I'll trade your rim for Joey.

463
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:13,900
Speaker 1: Jojo Shabbadoo, right?

464
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,027
Speaker 1: All right, we've agreed now.

465
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:17,011
Speaker 1: What the fuck do we do?

466
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,760
Speaker 1: How do we make this trade happen now, right?

467
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:33,915
Speaker 1: Well, here is a video that shows you 100% with nothing cut out of the phone call and paperwork and such that is required To make a trade happen in the National Hockey League.

468
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:40,652
Speaker 1: as of what year like 2011 and you can date it partly by it hasn't changed much since then?

469
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:48,247
Speaker 0: according to what people have said the phone on this dude's Desk is the exact IP phone that I used to have Like he.

470
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:54,156
Speaker 1: like it is the exact same phone Right, so the dude in the video is the NHL official whose job it was in 2011 to do this.

471
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:58,523
Speaker 1: I'm sure it might be a different person now Maybe not who knows?

472
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:04,500
Speaker 1: and the two GM's call the person they have a discussion and then the trade is officially in the books.

473
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:07,334
Speaker 1: It is quite fascinating to see how it is done.

474
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:11,472
Speaker 0: in the meta moment Book is the tale of Genji.

475
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:12,878
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah updated that website.

476
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

477
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,614
Speaker 0: That's right, not just a novel but arguably the first one.

478
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:17,197
Speaker 0: No, not.

479
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:17,780
Speaker 1: arguably.

480
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,213
Speaker 1: It's literally the first novel in human history that was ever written.

481
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:26,458
Speaker 1: I feel like if you're gonna read novels You should maybe start with the first one.

482
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:28,650
Speaker 0: So we will be reading this.

483
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,860
Speaker 0: click on the link to make sure you get the right translation.

484
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mike's the best one we can find.

485
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:43,187
Speaker 1: There is a newer translation But my research has told me that the second newest translation is I guess the one to read as of 2019 unabridged.

486
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:43,800
Speaker 1: also.

487
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,601
Speaker 1: I get the feeling that it's important to read this book because this is one of those situations We're like.

488
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:55,139
Speaker 1: I feel like lots and lots of media and other stories reference this all the fucking time and you don't know it.

489
00:34:55,563 --> 00:35:01,336
Speaker 1: And as soon as you read the tale of Genji You're gonna see tale of Genji popping up and every all these other things like oh my god.

490
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,300
Speaker 1: It's a tale of Genji reference.

491
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,826
Speaker 0: I missed it in high school.

492
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,060
Speaker 0: I read a bunch of excerpts from it, but I didn't read the whole thing.

493
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,086
Speaker 0: I don't know the whole story.

494
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,180
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna take a while to read the whole thing.

495
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,339
Speaker 1: So this book club ain't happening for moons.

496
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:20,535
Speaker 0: Also, you might have noticed that Emily and I have started a sideshow which is posted on the patreon and I Joe is that?

497
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:20,937
Speaker 1: is it a?

498
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:21,780
Speaker 1: is it a bearded lady?

499
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:22,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it?

500
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,260
Speaker 1: Is it a snake charmer, you know?

501
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,271
Speaker 1: fire eater It's kind of what kind of side show it's the geek now.

502
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:40,316
Speaker 0: so we are doing a Analysis review and commentary on every Disney theatrical animation from the beginning to today.

503
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:41,820
Speaker 0: in chronological order.

504
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,426
Speaker 1: That means you're gonna have to watch a lot of garbage.

505
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:44,069
Speaker 1: You haven't watched.

506
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never seen Pocahontas either.

507
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:49,331
Speaker 0: I've never seen the hunchback of Notre Dame.

508
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:50,095
Speaker 1: I did not either.

509
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,808
Speaker 0: I've seen scenes from them But I've never actually seen them as movies.

510
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:53,169
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

511
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,099
Speaker 1: I seen TV commercials for them back in the 90s.

512
00:35:55,601 --> 00:36:01,440
Speaker 0: Yep, I had seen however all the shorts in the first one that we just reviewed.

513
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,639
Speaker 0: That's up on the patreon and will be up publicly for people who give us no money soon.

514
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:14,280
Speaker 0: Academy Awards review of Walt Disney cartoons, which was technically the first Disney theatrical animated release.

515
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:14,941
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

516
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:21,037
Speaker 0: It was shown in theaters as a movie as a promotional thing ahead of Snow White.

517
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:26,193
Speaker 1: coming to theaters There were quite a few anthology type things like my favorite fun and fancy free.

518
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:27,297
Speaker 0: Ah, that was later.

519
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:27,959
Speaker 1: It was later.

520
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:40,155
Speaker 0: but one thing we noticed though in Academy Award review Walt Disney cartoons that Characters on a table where there's big food everywhere happens more often than you might realize.

521
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:44,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah in silly symphonies Yeah, but I mean can't beat goofy in the jello.

522
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,762
Speaker 1: That was the best know.

523
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:52,829
Speaker 0: goofy the jello is the best one but you can see the precursor to goofy in the jello with Kitten looking at the jello like substance.

524
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,983
Speaker 1: I mean everyone is seen right how Disney would often, you know What was the?

525
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:59,779
Speaker 1: I think it was like Jungle Book and they showed like and then they showed another.

526
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,494
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they were used like roto the old animation, right?

527
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,060
Speaker 1: Was it Robin Hood and Jungle Book?

528
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:08,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and Snow White they all they've reused a ton of stuff.

529
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:12,214
Speaker 0: Did you see the documentary or all the animators were like?

530
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,880
Speaker 0: it didn't save us any fucking time.

531
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:16,400
Speaker 0: It was harder to do that than just to animate it from scratch.

532
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,040
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's such a pain like the animators hated it.

533
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,665
Speaker 1: Apparently it was but I think even though it may have been a pain that didn't save time because you still had to draw the Drawings is a different character, right?

534
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:29,960
Speaker 1: I do think that it's like well one person animated something fucking incredibly.

535
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:33,219
Speaker 1: It's like well, we can just have something else animated incredibly as well.

536
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:43,498
Speaker 0: Yeah I saw it in multiple interviews in this documentary with the animators who literally said things to the effect of Yeah, it would have like if I copy link sword swing from breath of the wild.

537
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:48,586
Speaker 1: now Fucking badass sword swing in my game and you probably won't notice Same thing.

538
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,299
Speaker 1: It might be take just as much work.

539
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:56,538
Speaker 1: It's not gonna save me any time but it is gonna make sure that my game has the best sword swing without me having to invent my own.

540
00:37:56,939 --> 00:38:10,133
Speaker 0: and Finally if you are not planning to be at the penny arcade Expo in Seattle You're missing out because we will be there and as of today Only Friday and Monday badges are available and Friday is almost sold out.

541
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:10,916
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

542
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,245
Speaker 1: No one wants to go Monday, apparently Monday.

543
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,397
Speaker 0: luckily our panels are not on Monday.

544
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:23,534
Speaker 0: All right In fact our panels are on on one hand if you have seen these panels before One of them will not have new content.

545
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,300
Speaker 1: which ones you submitted?

546
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:37,571
Speaker 0: I submitted a bunch but for various reasons the ones packs want us to do are on Friday at 1230 p.m In Hippogriff theater the 40 tabletop games you must play And on Saturday at 11 a.m.

547
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:40,240
Speaker 0: In Hippogriff theater the 40 games you must play.

548
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:43,692
Speaker 1: So we're just doing two clickbait garbage panels.

549
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 1: click they want to do harm of games again.

550
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:48,174
Speaker 0: I didn't submit harm of games again, cuz you didn't say you wanted to do it.

551
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,240
Speaker 0: I submitted a whole bunch of other ones.

552
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,124
Speaker 1: I mean we did it already.

553
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:51,009
Speaker 1: Why don't we just keep doing it?

554
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,220
Speaker 0: Well, the difference is harm of games.

555
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:59,900
Speaker 0: we have a really good YouTube video of it and That is the panel that I don't have any YouTube videos of 40 whatever.

556
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:04,400
Speaker 0: So actually we've never done because 40 games we did like a trial run at magfest.

557
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,095
Speaker 0: so now I'm gonna like rewrite that panel to make it really good.

558
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:16,820
Speaker 0: and In terms of 40 tabletop games at packs West This is the kind of thing that will attract the audience of people who don't know who the hell we are.

559
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,880
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just taking my free badge.

560
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:19,944
Speaker 1: But yeah, we should.

561
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,520
Speaker 1: if they're gonna give us two panels at least one of them should be a non garbage panel.

562
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:29,880
Speaker 0: I don't I think that remember our selling point is that our panels have the clickbait title, but they actually teach you.

563
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,940
Speaker 1: This is not as good as the usual situation.

564
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:33,278
Speaker 1: I don't know.

565
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,486
Speaker 0: These are some of our based on.

566
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:37,280
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to write some new panels to get your clickbait out of the rotation.

567
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:44,340
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I have the stats on the YouTube channel and our panels with the clickbait titles are far and away the most popular.

568
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:50,100
Speaker 1: Yes, the my poison sugar sold way better than my healthy vegetable.

569
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:58,640
Speaker 0: Therefore the poison sugar is better But in turn like real harm of games like a tenth as popular as nostalgia versus game design.

570
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:00,747
Speaker 0: Neither one of those was a clickbait title.

571
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:01,228
Speaker 0: Hmm.

572
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:04,700
Speaker 0: So I don't know if the panels I write seem to get more traffic.

573
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:10,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you're trying to get traffic with your poison sugar, how is nostalgia versus game design poison sugar?

574
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,846
Speaker 0: That was just a straight-up good panel.

575
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:12,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

576
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, we will see I got the stats are.

577
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,335
Speaker 0: Actually, our most popular panel is still designing game rules.

578
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:31,651
Speaker 0: Oh my panel Uh, the one that I mostly made the slides for and wrote no That one the one where I have the change log in Google of me making almost all those slides I'm sure I made the rules panel.

579
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:33,343
Speaker 0: Uh Did you?

580
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,268
Speaker 0: are you sure?

581
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:36,258
Speaker 0: do you really want to have this fight with me on the air?

582
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,103
Speaker 1: No, I don't care.

583
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,392
Speaker 0: I have the change log.

584
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:43,734
Speaker 0: I know who made that panel Panel in detail is the stats are not what is important.

585
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:44,980
Speaker 1: It is the quality of the content.

586
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:46,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think this is cool.

587
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,458
Speaker 0: I mean you you don't have to do these panels you want.

588
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:48,740
Speaker 0: I'll do them.

589
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:49,639
Speaker 1: So I need a free badge.

590
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,424
Speaker 0: You can be my camera.

591
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,893
Speaker 1: guy bought the purchased badge I have given to someone.

592
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,312
Speaker 0: you can just be my cameraman and I'll do the panel.

593
00:40:57,353 --> 00:41:03,575
Speaker 0: no so Long time ago, there were measured games and there were Castlevania games.

594
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,197
Speaker 0: They were both good.

595
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:05,160
Speaker 0: They did their things right?

596
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,800
Speaker 1: Well, actually the original Castlevania games were just side-scrolling with several levels.

597
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:18,067
Speaker 1: Yeah even though the levels were structured in a way with ladders and several rooms to give you the impression of You know going into this big castle even cut.

598
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:22,280
Speaker 0: it was side scroll like varied weapons plus a whip of some kind.

599
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:25,560
Speaker 0: Fight some monsters spooky Dracula, right metric, right?

600
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:25,861
Speaker 1: It was.

601
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:27,148
Speaker 1: it was that you know, that's cool.

602
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:34,699
Speaker 1: based hard right platformers Platforming and combat involving enemies all over the place and not just the ones right in front of you.

603
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:40,240
Speaker 0: Metroid Early concept of leveling up and that like you make your whip stronger by collecting the numbers and all that early.

604
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:44,094
Speaker 0: But it was there that like there was a. the precursor technology was there.

605
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:56,287
Speaker 1: it had these sub weapons at least Self weapons and Metroid 1 was the game that really invented going in all different directions Exploring but is L. I mean Zelda had that too.

606
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:58,714
Speaker 1: But but I think Metroid does.

607
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,038
Speaker 1: Metroid one predates all to one.

608
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:04,286
Speaker 1: I feel like it does but anyway It was side.

609
00:42:04,326 --> 00:42:08,940
Speaker 1: scroll II platform II explore II right shooting bad guys in all directions.

610
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,022
Speaker 0: Metroid 1986 Zelda 1 1986.

611
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:14,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

612
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:21,303
Speaker 0: So February 21st 1986 for you have to imagine they were making these Zelda came first All right.

613
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,959
Speaker 0: Anyway, August Metroid didn't come out till August.

614
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:32,940
Speaker 1: They were developing at the same time Anyway, but Metroid had to get different items unlock different areas of the game situation, right?

615
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, the high jump to get over there.

616
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,320
Speaker 1: You need the bomb to get over there that whole thing, right?

617
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:43,120
Speaker 0: There was a third kind of game that was basically just level up your shit like Final Fantasy or whatever, right?

618
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:57,280
Speaker 1: So as time went on right the these formulas were improved right and the ultimate versions of these games were Super Metroid right which basically perfected what Metroid was?

619
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:16,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time when Castlevania switched from being you know on the NES Right and then it went to SNES Super Castlevania Which is Castlevania 4 which is basically the same kind of deal only way fancier, but when they moved to PlayStation Symphony

620
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:21,757
Speaker 0: of the night was the pen pineapple apple pen right of all these genres.

621
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:22,900
Speaker 1: Symphony of the night.

622
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:30,020
Speaker 1: They took the Metroid bits and merged them into the Castlevania bits to create the masterpiece game.

623
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:37,149
Speaker 1: And then while there weren't that many more Metroid games basically Not too many for a long ass time.

624
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,860
Speaker 0: remember the first-person shooter on the DS, right?

625
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:45,840
Speaker 1: And then when they're finally were Metroid games again They were like, you know Metroid Prime and stuff in that span.

626
00:43:46,201 --> 00:44:01,949
Speaker 1: There were many Castlevania games holding that torch for the Metroid style game Without you know, but still incorporating the Castlevania bits, you know the GBA Castlevania Right, basically Symphony of the night Not to review Symphony of the night.

627
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:16,640
Speaker 0: But basically what it did is it had the ability to level up and get a whole bunch of different weapons and fun stuff coupled with the Metroid level of exploration coupled with the Castlevania aesthetic and combat

628
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:22,056
Speaker 1: coupled with being fucking enormous at least relative to other games in the genre

629
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:23,942
Speaker 0: by having the Square

630
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,689
Speaker 1: boss the upside-down castle motherfuckers

631
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:30,800
Speaker 0: instead of just having the square boss of fight a guy then fight the real guy.

632
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,620
Speaker 0: It was beat the game then beat the whole game again.

633
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,916
Speaker 1: You could beat the game pretty early quickly and it's like you.

634
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:46,240
Speaker 1: it would just be like, okay you won Congratulations beat Dracula, but if you beat the game the right way you went into the middle area fought that other boss, right?

635
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,126
Speaker 0: It's kind of like in final fantasy.

636
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:49,009
Speaker 0: Oh really?

637
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:49,451
Speaker 1: Okay.

638
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,053
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

639
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:51,720
Speaker 1: Here's the whole game again.

640
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,615
Speaker 1: We're gonna take the whole map of the game turn it upside down.

641
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:58,331
Speaker 1: on top of itself It's actually twice as you're just twice as much game as you thought.

642
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:00,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, you thought you were at a hundred percent.

643
00:45:00,178 --> 00:45:00,983
Speaker 0: you were at 51%.

644
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,300
Speaker 0: that's right.

645
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:10,755
Speaker 1: And also this entire upside-down copy of the entire map is full of completely different bad guys and bosses and different secrets and different everything.

646
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:11,238
Speaker 1: good luck.

647
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:15,751
Speaker 1: and While there are some magic super Metroid was like, oh you beat mother brain.

648
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:16,212
Speaker 1: Guess what?

649
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,803
Speaker 1: There's actually an entire flip side of the map That's as big as the map.

650
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:20,364
Speaker 1: We just played.

651
00:45:20,425 --> 00:45:27,466
Speaker 1: nor fair to meridia - everything everything - and is like it's completely Populated completely differently.

652
00:45:27,526 --> 00:45:28,088
Speaker 1: Keep going.

653
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:31,480
Speaker 0: So it it's not a perfect game.

654
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:40,760
Speaker 0: It has some flaws and like time like we've evolved the genre since then But it started something important and basically since Symphony of the night.

655
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,430
Speaker 0: One of the things I've wanted out of gaming.

656
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,920
Speaker 0: It's just more of that just pump it into my veins, right?

657
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,580
Speaker 1: Exactly, there are so many genres of game and we always talk about, you know, we do want originality in gaming.

658
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,148
Speaker 1: We wish people wouldn't just keep doing cookie cutter.

659
00:45:54,289 --> 00:46:04,040
Speaker 0: FPS is no keep doing, you know cookie cutter platform But at the same time you want to see a genre like reach its culmination like fully explore.

660
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:08,536
Speaker 1: Yes was not enough, but we've now had so many FPS as we got too many, right?

661
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:11,006
Speaker 1: There's certain time It's like your favorite food.

662
00:46:11,046 --> 00:46:12,513
Speaker 1: Maybe your favorite food is ice cream.

663
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:14,220
Speaker 1: Okay, I eat some ice cream.

664
00:46:15,003 --> 00:46:16,590
Speaker 1: I could eat more ice cream.

665
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,080
Speaker 1: There's a point at which okay too much ice cream.

666
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,940
Speaker 1: I want to eat something different, but at the same time more ice cream is still good.

667
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:27,020
Speaker 1: There's a time and a place for just having more ice cream.

668
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:36,565
Speaker 1: So that is why so many indie games have gone down this Metroidvania route because it is a genre that is was not milked to Death by the big studios

669
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:41,559
Speaker 0: and while there had been a ton of games on the DS and 3ds that scratch that itch and we're

670
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:41,820
Speaker 1: good.

671
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:43,919
Speaker 0: I could have still played more.

672
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,691
Speaker 1: They weren't quite at the same level.

673
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:47,495
Speaker 1: a lot of those.

674
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:51,318
Speaker 0: while they were good I would argue some of them were better in some ways than Symphony of the Night.

675
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:55,670
Speaker 1: like No, I don't think any DS Castlevania is as good as Symphony of the Night.

676
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:58,680
Speaker 0: A Portrait of Ruin was pretty fucking solid.

677
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:00,547
Speaker 1: Solid is not Symphony of the Night.

678
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is it's still good, right?

679
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:12,201
Speaker 0: But I'm saying you could list a lot of the DS 3ds games and Symphony of the Night Together and like rate all their different attributes and they're all in the same league Right.

680
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:19,352
Speaker 1: So anyway, since everyone abandoned Konami or Konami purged everything good about itself Quite right a while ago.

681
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:20,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of the people who?

682
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,467
Speaker 1: Fled that key person.

683
00:47:23,488 --> 00:47:37,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, these Koji Igarashi basically the person who is Responsible for Symphony of the Night if you can pin it on one person because all those indie games that try to make Metroidvania is The reason those games probably fall flat is that they didn't have Igarashi, right?

684
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,654
Speaker 1: So Igarashi comes along a while ago.

685
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:42,000
Speaker 1: I think it already feels like years ago.

686
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,924
Speaker 1: I don't know exactly when.

687
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,451
Speaker 1: when was it the Kickstarter?

688
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:45,596
Speaker 0: Oh the Kickstarter.

689
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:48,893
Speaker 1: Oh my god I kick-started it the day they put it up, but I forget what it was.

690
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,260
Speaker 1: Oh feels like a long-ass time ago.

691
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, let's see.

692
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:53,063
Speaker 0: He left Konami in 2014.

693
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:54,590
Speaker 1: yeah, when was the Kickstarter?

694
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,080
Speaker 0: I'm trying to figure that out on the Kickstarter page.

695
00:47:57,181 --> 00:48:00,077
Speaker 0: No Kickstarter sucks at that because it doesn't want to remind you that.

696
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:00,640
Speaker 0: oh this thing.

697
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:04,191
Speaker 0: So the Kickstarter says the game will be delivered in March of 2017.

698
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:07,060
Speaker 0: Okay, so definitely before then.

699
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:13,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so put up a Kickstarter and said hey, we're gonna make a game called blood-stained ritual of the night wink-wink.

700
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:18,980
Speaker 1: This is just gonna be fucking Symphony and I obviously we can't use any Castlevania intellectual properties.

701
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,920
Speaker 1: We're gonna make all new artwork and characters.

702
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:22,922
Speaker 0: Castlevania!

703
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:23,725
Speaker 0: Spooky castle!

704
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:27,660
Speaker 1: We're just gonna make more Symphony of the Night that Konami never let us do.

705
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,509
Speaker 1: Kickstart it give us money.

706
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:30,919
Speaker 1: We will make it for you.

707
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:32,919
Speaker 1: And I said shut up and take my money.

708
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:41,500
Speaker 0: Based on everything I saw the Kickstarter like the people involved the level of detail I said well, I have to bet on this and I don't have to bet too much.

709
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,929
Speaker 1: So any of them right?

710
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 1: then I waited a long-ass time.

711
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,140
Speaker 0: They were at 64,000 people pledged five and a half million dollars to this.

712
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:55,567
Speaker 1: So we waited a long-ass time and eventually we got blood-stained Not ritual of the night.

713
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,275
Speaker 1: We got blood-stained.

714
00:48:57,697 --> 00:48:58,319
Speaker 1: curse of the moon.

715
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, blood-stained curse of the moon was basically a redo of Castlevania 3 Dracula's curse.

716
00:49:04,382 --> 00:49:05,808
Speaker 1: It was that style of game.

717
00:49:05,848 --> 00:49:07,757
Speaker 0: Castlevania 3 is not Dracula's curse.

718
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:08,500
Speaker 1: Which one is Castlevania 3?

719
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,370
Speaker 0: Castlevania 2 is Dracula's curse.

720
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,420
Speaker 1: Castlevania 3, Akumajou Dracula.

721
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:16,351
Speaker 1: I'll give you a Japanese name cuz I forgot the English one.

722
00:49:16,672 --> 00:49:18,280
Speaker 1: This is Castlevania 2 is Simon's Quest.

723
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,592
Speaker 1: Castlevania 3 is Akumajou Dracula Dracula's curse.

724
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,098
Speaker 1: How could I be wrong about it?

725
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:25,740
Speaker 0: I think you were right.

726
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:26,365
Speaker 0: I was wrong.

727
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, Castlevania 2 is Simon's Quest.

728
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,909
Speaker 0: Anyway, I never beat Castlevania 3 because it was too hard.

729
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:34,359
Speaker 1: Because it's hard as fucking balls and so is curse of the moon.

730
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,187
Speaker 1: It's a little easier.

731
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:41,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Yeah, so curse of the moon is basically a Castlevania 3 style game.

732
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:42,920
Speaker 1: That is pretty good.

733
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,765
Speaker 1: It has several characters.

734
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:46,000
Speaker 1: you can play through it as and you know, it's not bad.

735
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:49,759
Speaker 1: And if you needed to hold over while you're waiting for ritual of the night, there you go.

736
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:53,059
Speaker 1: But finally just a couple weeks ago, right?

737
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:58,120
Speaker 1: Ritual of the night blood-stained ritual the night finally released on all platforms.

738
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,019
Speaker 1: it came out on PC PS4 Xbox first and then a week or two later it came out on Steam.

739
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,587
Speaker 1: and here it is.

740
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:11,240
Speaker 1: I Foolishly had chosen the Steam version, but I chose it way back.

741
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,808
Speaker 1: See, I should have stuck with my.

742
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:16,814
Speaker 1: I usually have that steam policy.

743
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:18,018
Speaker 1: My policy has.

744
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,428
Speaker 1: yet again I basically proved myself right.

745
00:50:20,488 --> 00:50:33,126
Speaker 0: I deviated from a policy and I got burned now in one hand like for example There are games like wargroove or slay the spire that I really want on a switch because I'm just Chose PC for those games as well.

746
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:37,700
Speaker 0: Why wisely so slay the spire and wargroove are both great to play like on a plane.

747
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:41,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I wisely chose them for PC as well as well.

748
00:50:41,696 --> 00:50:44,844
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Think they're better on switch.

749
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:55,620
Speaker 0: this game if it was just fine on switch would be better on switch But it's as of today not just fine doesn't work that well on the switch, right?

750
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,976
Speaker 1: So the switch version has shittier graphics is lower FPS and it's like.

751
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,120
Speaker 1: I don't care about graphics too much.

752
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:08,580
Speaker 1: But the FPS is low, but also it lags and crashes way worse than the versions on the other platforms.

753
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:10,812
Speaker 1: I should have gotten the PC one now.

754
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:12,019
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I have it on the PC.

755
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:19,100
Speaker 0: I turned every single setting up to the maximum possible and it runs like a champ and it looks beautiful.

756
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:24,229
Speaker 1: My plan is to since I already bought I couldn't change my mind I had the switch version right is to.

757
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,439
Speaker 0: I kick back and spire twice like I did with.

758
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:31,822
Speaker 1: no I'm going to keep playing the switch one, which I've been managed to get through despite being meh I can still.

759
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:34,611
Speaker 1: it's still playable right kind of mostly right?

760
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:36,437
Speaker 1: Oh, it's crashed on me a couple times.

761
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,350
Speaker 0: the the other Castlevania - I forgot about the Gameboy games.

762
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,917
Speaker 0: That was Belmonts revenge.

763
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,636
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, my plan is to play it until I you know, I did.

764
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,650
Speaker 1: I did beat it But that was the easy beat.

765
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:48,660
Speaker 1: that doesn't count, right?

766
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,544
Speaker 1: I plan to beat it.

767
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,276
Speaker 1: beat it for real beat it, you know upside down castle beat it.

768
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:59,649
Speaker 1: and then When I feel in the future that I must replay it because I mean Symphony night was good enough to replay several times.

769
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:00,552
Speaker 1: I play that again.

770
00:52:00,632 --> 00:52:02,700
Speaker 1: Even this will be get replayed.

771
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:09,796
Speaker 1: So when it's time to replay it and is a big steam sale Then I will get the PC version and stop playing the switch version.

772
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:21,208
Speaker 0: Yep So in terms of a short review like switch issues technology issues Notwithstanding if you have it on a PC or you just want to talk about the gameplay It's great.

773
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:22,357
Speaker 0: It's everything I wanted.

774
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:31,249
Speaker 1: Yeah regardless of the switch issues this game blood stain ritual for the night is a Another symphony of the night exactly as advertised.

775
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:31,590
Speaker 1: Yep.

776
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:32,974
Speaker 1: It plays the same.

777
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,180
Speaker 1: It feels the same boss fights.

778
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:43,540
Speaker 1: It's a new it's a. it's new map But with you know new enemies new story new characters new difficulty curve is right like it feels right.

779
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:55,588
Speaker 1: Everything feels right basically as it might as well be symphony of the other night or symphony of the day or any of next month or Orchestra the I don't know whatever.

780
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:57,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get the idea.

781
00:52:57,756 --> 00:52:59,726
Speaker 1: if you like symphony night You will like this game.

782
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:03,844
Speaker 1: if you haven't played symphony tonight play some of the night Then play this game.

783
00:53:04,366 --> 00:53:04,869
Speaker 1: I get more.

784
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:05,632
Speaker 0: just play this game.

785
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:06,254
Speaker 0: This game's great.

786
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:07,640
Speaker 1: I think you want to play simply night first.

787
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:13,251
Speaker 0: No, yeah, honestly, though You should play all the DS ones as well because they're great.

788
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:24,960
Speaker 1: and if you can't get enough after playing symphony night and Curse ritual of the night curse of the blood-stained ritual night Right, then you can play the DS ones and and then you're gonna start running out of stuff to play.

789
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:33,960
Speaker 0: But it especially in terms of because what makes this game great Is that the maps really big and there's a lot like every monster has its shard and most of them are useless.

790
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:38,249
Speaker 0: But you still want to mess with them Say like that's the kind of things I liked about.

791
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:42,530
Speaker 1: all has the Metroid thing where you get different shards Which will let you unlock different areas.

792
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,300
Speaker 1: like I finally get a shard let's me go in the water.

793
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,229
Speaker 1: I finally got the shard.

794
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:46,380
Speaker 1: let's me shoot the reflecting beam.

795
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,032
Speaker 1: But then some areas you got the shard.

796
00:53:48,112 --> 00:53:49,119
Speaker 1: let's me do the double jump.

797
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:53,800
Speaker 0: But then some areas you can just go to like any time or like pretty early in the game.

798
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:57,940
Speaker 0: But the monsters are just ray too strong unless you're way good.

799
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:02,757
Speaker 0: So you want to come back when you've leveled up or when you've gotten better shards or just gotten more HP.

800
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:06,856
Speaker 0: Yep It's got a good food system, this is the thing.

801
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:17,440
Speaker 1: the crafting food system in this game pretty fun is When usually I ignore all that bullshit, so here's the genius things this game has done in terms of quests and whatnot, right?

802
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:23,100
Speaker 1: So first of all, there's a person who gives you quests to kill ex bad guys, right?

803
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:29,459
Speaker 1: So first of all, the game really helps you find those bad guys by putting little symbols on the map showing you where they live.

804
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,243
Speaker 1: Guys respawn.

805
00:54:31,263 --> 00:54:34,073
Speaker 1: when you leave the screen you can just easily find the bad guy.

806
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:35,037
Speaker 1: kill him leave the screen.

807
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:37,471
Speaker 1: come back kill him leave The screen come back kill him and complete the quest.

808
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:38,600
Speaker 1: in no time, right?

809
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:42,692
Speaker 1: As you go through the game, they give you quests in batches.

810
00:54:42,873 --> 00:54:45,463
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, here's five guys I'll give you quests for.

811
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:51,967
Speaker 1: when you complete all those they give you quests for the next set of guys and Those guys are in an order.

812
00:54:52,108 --> 00:55:03,300
Speaker 1: that is the order that you were going to be exploring the map in Right, so it's like as you go through the game naturally You are then encountering the next set of enemies along which there are quests to beat those enemies.

813
00:55:03,443 --> 00:55:07,673
Speaker 0: So it gives you like Excuses to go poke at things and it gives you reasons to mess with stuff.

814
00:55:07,713 --> 00:55:13,260
Speaker 1: then you go back to you teleport back to the Beginning of the game to visit the quest person after completing the quest and they give you rewards, right?

815
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:26,520
Speaker 1: There's another person who gives you quests to get certain foods Right and to get the foods you have to go to this other guy who will let you Basically cook food and you need combinations of things like crafting, right?

816
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,520
Speaker 1: So you get combinations items you visit the dude you craft the items, but here's the brilliance.

817
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:33,187
Speaker 0: There's recipes right.

818
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:39,113
Speaker 0: every unique recipe you eat gives you a one-time Permanent stat boost the first time you is.

819
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:47,200
Speaker 1: that gives you a huge incentive To cook every kind of food once and eat every kind of food once even if you're not using the food to restore your health.

820
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,467
Speaker 0: I mean, that's me tonight.

821
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:49,895
Speaker 1: There was no reason to do all these foods.

822
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:50,720
Speaker 1: They were just there for fun.

823
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:52,710
Speaker 0: Tonight you find some wall meat good enough.

824
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:53,091
Speaker 1: Yep.

825
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,840
Speaker 0: Wall meat is all you needed exactly.

826
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,852
Speaker 1: And then you give the foods to this person.

827
00:55:57,952 --> 00:55:59,260
Speaker 1: They're looking for specific foods.

828
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,880
Speaker 1: You give them the quest food and then they give you rewards, right?

829
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:11,511
Speaker 1: And as you go through the game You're encountering the enemies that drop the things that you need to cook the foods that are in and the quests are in the right Order.

830
00:56:11,593 --> 00:56:23,854
Speaker 1: Yep There's another person who gives you quests For items and you craft items much in the same way that you craft food only you don't eat them for a permanent stat boost And the person is giving you rewards for getting certain items and crafting.

831
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:25,840
Speaker 1: most of them are the items you need to craft.

832
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:37,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, bring them back to them and they reward you with items right that you can maybe then use to craft other things or use or who knows and these three different quest II people.

833
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:51,131
Speaker 1: They reward you with items that are often needed to complete the quest of the other quest Right back and forth with the food person in that right and the and it's like a. really, you know as you progress through the game, it's really smooth.

834
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:57,750
Speaker 1: and then the best thing is That this game gives you a reason to have money because there's a shopping person.

835
00:56:58,352 --> 00:57:01,019
Speaker 1: the shopping person does two amazing things.

836
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,480
Speaker 1: one They sell things that you actually need for cooking and crafting.

837
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:06,180
Speaker 1: I went to the as soon as I had a bunch of money.

838
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,740
Speaker 1: I went to that shop and I was about five of everything.

839
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, right because it was actually you everything was good.

840
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:14,320
Speaker 1: But also as soon as you go out into the world, right?

841
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:25,760
Speaker 1: For example, I needed this like mako oil to do a lot of cooking because I needed like oil for pizza dough and I had to kill these makos or whatever the fuck they're called.

842
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,880
Speaker 1: There's like these plants in this one area and I really didn't want to sit there farming these fucking plants, right?

843
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:36,480
Speaker 1: After I got some oil and then I did some cooking with some oil then I visited the shop person.

844
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:37,625
Speaker 1: They're like, guess what?

845
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:39,011
Speaker 1: I'll just sell you the oil now.

846
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:40,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got any stock.

847
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,140
Speaker 0: I got a guy.

848
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:52,186
Speaker 1: It's like as soon as you get an item and start like, you know shopping or I don't know what the exact requirement is, but the shop starts selling it and then you don't need to farm it anymore and It's like holy shit.

849
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:52,347
Speaker 1: Now.

850
00:57:52,408 --> 00:57:55,384
Speaker 1: I can just craft all those oil based things No problem.

851
00:57:55,404 --> 00:57:58,357
Speaker 1: As long as I have money and you just get money by playing easily.

852
00:57:58,398 --> 00:57:58,900
Speaker 1: No problem.

853
00:57:59,402 --> 00:58:07,085
Speaker 1: So that setup is like one of the best that I have seen in terms of quest craft recipe Shop money actually matters.

854
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:07,928
Speaker 1: I want money.

855
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:09,492
Speaker 1: Yep things the other.

856
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:14,686
Speaker 1: any game is better than the way Symphony Night does it with library guy The other thing that I very much like.

857
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:21,966
Speaker 0: there are a lot of different kinds of weapons and they all act Very differently.

858
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:25,540
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah when it comes to armor and equipment, I choose just what gives me the best stats.

859
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:33,839
Speaker 0: I don't care what it looks like even but it does change like 20 different kinds of swords that are all Different in right like meaningful interesting ways.

860
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:38,598
Speaker 1: Yeah So there was a sword I got that is like really fast and really short-range a lot like Strider here.

861
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:44,100
Speaker 1: use sword Using that but then I turned it in for a quest and then I went to go get another one.

862
00:58:44,402 --> 00:58:56,014
Speaker 1: but while I was trying to get another one, which it did eventually get I Discovered the flying sword which is a sword that when you swing it It flies straight out like a projectile super far like almost half the screen.

863
00:58:56,636 --> 00:58:58,100
Speaker 1: then it comes back.

864
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:02,565
Speaker 1: But on its way back it goes up and spins Most bad guys.

865
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:05,877
Speaker 1: this thing hits them two or three times in one swing.

866
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,760
Speaker 1: It's a little bit slow.

867
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:11,160
Speaker 1: Yes, you throw it out and wait for it to come back, but it's basically cheating.

868
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,500
Speaker 1: I just hide behind something and keep throwing the sword over and over and then the bad guy dies and I'm well out of Their range and they're no problem for me.

869
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:27,140
Speaker 1: so I don't care that this thing doesn't do a lot of damage because it does multiple hits and Basically is like infinite armor because it protects me from so much damage.

870
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:31,415
Speaker 1: I very much enjoy not really switch to any other weapon because I haven't found anything better.

871
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:35,370
Speaker 0: in every metro in any game I always enjoy like what are the cheap?

872
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:36,153
Speaker 0: What cheap way?

873
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:37,418
Speaker 0: Can I beat this boss?

874
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,860
Speaker 1: Yeah I just try to figure out the cheapest way to do everything the whole game with the flying blade.

875
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:44,859
Speaker 1: There might be some better weapon, but why even bother flying blade?

876
00:59:45,241 --> 00:59:45,522
Speaker 0: I like.

877
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:50,320
Speaker 0: I in these kinds of games I tend to like the super slow super heavy mega damage weapons.

878
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:51,745
Speaker 1: I like the fast.

879
00:59:51,805 --> 01:00:00,507
Speaker 1: I like whatever keeps me safe and I like whatever I like super risky Like anything that'll get rid of our Things that are fast.

880
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:03,260
Speaker 1: so I could as I can fast as I can press the button I can swing the sword.

881
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,607
Speaker 0: I like to be super slow.

882
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:05,371
Speaker 0: No armor.

883
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:07,120
Speaker 0: Like I only got to hit the guy once.

884
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,776
Speaker 1: I just got it actually kill the guy in one hit.

885
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:10,460
Speaker 1: That's okay.

886
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:13,860
Speaker 1: But when sometimes when you can't kill a guy in one hit I hate the slow.

887
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,115
Speaker 1: Well because I have to go in Swing and then do a bunch of dodging and running away.

888
01:00:18,135 --> 01:00:18,979
Speaker 1: It's like a swing again.

889
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,540
Speaker 0: But that's why I don't like along these lines a lot a lot of the different Castlevania games.

890
01:00:23,682 --> 01:00:24,638
Speaker 0: Some of the weapons have been guns.

891
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,260
Speaker 0: They've always been just pointless and stupid and like you never want to use those things.

892
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,780
Speaker 0: Yeah in this game the guns are actually interesting and good and there's tons of different kinds of ammo.

893
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to make and learn and craft all kinds of different ammo.

894
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:39,879
Speaker 1: That is all kinds of different effects and they're all fun.

895
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,246
Speaker 0: But here's the genius.

896
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:51,720
Speaker 0: every gun you might have special ammo But if you run out of ammo or you don't want to waste your a good ammo There's always an infinite ammo option that just kind of sucks, but works.

897
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:55,080
Speaker 0: Yep, so you can have fun with the gun if you want to play with the gun.

898
01:00:55,562 --> 01:01:03,560
Speaker 0: It's like a subtle little game design decision that makes the guns fun and interesting to use Without you hoarding them like you hoard elixirs in a Final Fantasy game.

899
01:01:03,685 --> 01:01:10,200
Speaker 1: Yeah Also, you know the game that the all the weapons most of them at least have some sort of fancy move you can do.

900
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, where you input a street?

901
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,208
Speaker 0: Oh, that was it as soon as I noticed that that like.

902
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:17,482
Speaker 0: oh with this kind of weapon like do a hadoken and it'll do A thing.

903
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:20,156
Speaker 1: Yep, but I haven't found the one for the flying sword yet.

904
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:20,899
Speaker 1: Maybe I should google it.

905
01:01:22,242 --> 01:01:25,615
Speaker 1: The game smartly all around the game are these bookcases.

906
01:01:25,655 --> 01:01:29,440
Speaker 1: if you go to a bookcase and read it Sometimes it gives you a journal entry with some lore and plot.

907
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:37,740
Speaker 1: Yeah half of them will just tell you the input commands for the special moves and it tells you which weapons those special moves apply to.

908
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:40,409
Speaker 1: And it's like oh, there's a weapon called that.

909
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:41,573
Speaker 1: maybe I'll try to find one.

910
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:43,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game always tells you everything.

911
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,932
Speaker 1: There's no hidden learning and knowledge based stuff.

912
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,360
Speaker 1: It's like, oh you want to craft that recipe?

913
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:51,765
Speaker 1: You're gonna need a consomme a black pepper This into that.

914
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:55,366
Speaker 1: it's like there's no hidden info nothing to look up No strategy guide needed.

915
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:57,680
Speaker 1: all the info was shown to you on the screen.

916
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:01,571
Speaker 1: You and you can always go look at all these guidebooks and menus in the press.

917
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:01,892
Speaker 1: start.

918
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:03,075
Speaker 1: Everything's there.

919
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:06,002
Speaker 1: It's really great Pretty good.

920
01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:06,464
Speaker 0: Yep.

921
01:02:06,744 --> 01:02:07,688
Speaker 0: The music's good.

922
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:08,591
Speaker 0: The background is good.

923
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:09,333
Speaker 0: The arts good.

924
01:02:09,353 --> 01:02:11,400
Speaker 1: The animation is good, but not simply not good.

925
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,859
Speaker 0: Well now but simply the night was good for a lot of reasons.

926
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:23,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to start to recreate that amazing characters are not as interesting or The main character is female which is great.

927
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:26,758
Speaker 0: frankly most of the DS ones even had better plots than this.

928
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:32,680
Speaker 0: the plot of this Is just yeah Dracula's castles back and some alchemists did something a long time ago.

929
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:44,380
Speaker 1: Yes, there is a guy you can visit who's basically Edward Scissorhands who can change your characters look like your colors Your haircut and you can get books with different hairstyles in them to unlock different looks.

930
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,972
Speaker 0: I guess I'm not playing Metroidvanias for the plot.

931
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:50,240
Speaker 0: I go into them assuming now it's gonna be dumb.

932
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:52,046
Speaker 0: They're gonna tell me there's a boss.

933
01:02:52,286 --> 01:02:53,912
Speaker 0: The boss is not the real boss.

934
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,156
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a side.

935
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:56,400
Speaker 0: character ends up being evil.

936
01:02:56,661 --> 01:02:57,525
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a boss.

937
01:02:57,545 --> 01:03:00,460
Speaker 0: We've never even heard of who shows up like two-thirds of the way through.

938
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:04,475
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a secret way to fight a boss to unlock even more of the game.

939
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:05,660
Speaker 0: That's all I care about.

940
01:03:05,861 --> 01:03:14,640
Speaker 1: The other thing I care about you didn't mention is the thing that symphony night and Metroid Super Metroid at least both do which is Having lots of really unique interesting rooms.

941
01:03:14,786 --> 01:03:21,034
Speaker 1: Yes unique looking rooms unique Places so that you really feels like you're traveling around in different areas.

942
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:22,660
Speaker 1: Like I remember this is the blood room.

943
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:23,899
Speaker 1: I remember this is the train.

944
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:26,666
Speaker 1: This is the water room.

945
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:27,549
Speaker 0: This is I have not.

946
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,595
Speaker 0: I've not unplugged the blood room yet.

947
01:03:29,896 --> 01:03:31,000
Speaker 1: I have unplugged the blood room.

948
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:32,246
Speaker 1: This is the.

949
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:35,100
Speaker 1: this is the room with the giant cat in the middle of it, right?

950
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,269
Speaker 1: It's like is the flying sword room.

951
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,176
Speaker 1: This is the paintings that come to life.

952
01:03:39,196 --> 01:03:40,180
Speaker 1: This is the clock room.

953
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,662
Speaker 1: This is this.

954
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:47,291
Speaker 1: the room where you can sit in a chair is the room where the guy takes you on his chariot And it's I love the chariot guy and it's like.

955
01:03:47,351 --> 01:03:50,383
Speaker 1: this is what makes it interesting to explore that Metroid.

956
01:03:50,563 --> 01:03:56,586
Speaker 1: one doesn't really have as much where it's like, okay, you're in the yellow room in the green room Yeah, but Super Metroid.

957
01:03:56,627 --> 01:04:00,240
Speaker 1: It's like oh you're in Norfair in the lava zone now now you're in the plant zone.

958
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:11,560
Speaker 1: It's like making the different areas feel like different interesting areas Memorable landmarks and interactive bits and just interesting eye candy and all sorts of flavor.

959
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:16,183
Speaker 1: You know that that is what makes these games, you know That's what.

960
01:04:16,263 --> 01:04:21,771
Speaker 1: that's what encourages you to keep exploring and going and you know Not getting bored when you go back to the same place.

961
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:23,480
Speaker 1: and they definitely did a good job.

962
01:04:23,921 --> 01:04:39,267
Speaker 0: So the takeaways from this game one is great like just get it and play it like it's great But - Sometimes you need that like you need the talent like the person who knows how to make this game and happen to be Igarashi Yep, like that's the magic sauce.

963
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:42,160
Speaker 1: I'm so in terms of negative things, right?

964
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,635
Speaker 1: I got to say I'm not a fan of the controls for the map, right?

965
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:46,941
Speaker 1: So you can.

966
01:04:46,961 --> 01:04:51,578
Speaker 1: actually there's one good thing which is that the the mini-map in the corner shows you where you came from.

967
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,743
Speaker 1: Oh, not only that.

968
01:04:53,025 --> 01:04:55,134
Speaker 1: you can customize the fuck out of the mini-map.

969
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:56,520
Speaker 1: Yes, you can make it bigger.

970
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,486
Speaker 1: You can make it smaller.

971
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,331
Speaker 1: You can zoom it in.

972
01:04:58,371 --> 01:04:59,075
Speaker 1: You can zoom it out.

973
01:04:59,095 --> 01:04:59,960
Speaker 1: You can make it transparent.

974
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:00,865
Speaker 1: You can make it opaque.

975
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:02,394
Speaker 1: You can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

976
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:03,460
Speaker 1: That is awesome.

977
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,404
Speaker 1: The actual map.

978
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:07,550
Speaker 1: you press like the select key.

979
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,773
Speaker 1: you bring up the actual map.

980
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,538
Speaker 1: it zoomed the fuck out right.

981
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:11,180
Speaker 1: by default.

982
01:05:11,722 --> 01:05:14,011
Speaker 1: You got to press a to center it on yourself.

983
01:05:14,051 --> 01:05:16,120
Speaker 1: It doesn't default to centering on where you are.

984
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:17,045
Speaker 1: That's annoying.

985
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:19,539
Speaker 1: and then you got to zoom your ass in.

986
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,569
Speaker 1: It's like the main the.

987
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:27,274
Speaker 1: if I press select to open the big map It should start centered on me already zoomed at a reasonable level.

988
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:28,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really kind of annoying.

989
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,508
Speaker 1: I had to do that.

990
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:30,862
Speaker 0: I got used to it But it was.

991
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:32,368
Speaker 0: it wasn't ideal and it works.

992
01:05:32,649 --> 01:05:35,561
Speaker 1: if you open up the big map you press select to open it Right.

993
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:38,450
Speaker 1: My natural inclination is to press B to close it.

994
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:41,440
Speaker 1: No if you press B, it puts like a marker on the map.

995
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:42,265
Speaker 1: It's like a fuck.

996
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:44,117
Speaker 1: and then you like you have a marker on the map.

997
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:48,279
Speaker 1: now You have to move the cursor exactly onto that marker to press B to remove it.

998
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,958
Speaker 1: Then you got to remember you press select again to close.

999
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:53,850
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like I keep putting markers all over my map.

1000
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,704
Speaker 0: I am still putting markers on the map Unintentionally.

1001
01:05:57,764 --> 01:05:59,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like that is really annoying.

1002
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,424
Speaker 1: They need to fix the can.

1003
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:03,940
Speaker 1: that is something that applies to not not just the switch version all the version.

1004
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:10,260
Speaker 0: I saw some people complaining that they thought the controls were sluggish, but I think they are which I don't know If it's just the switch or not.

1005
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,725
Speaker 1: But yeah, it is love it's like it.

1006
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:12,487
Speaker 0: the.

1007
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:14,694
Speaker 0: the fighting like attacking feels right.

1008
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:16,480
Speaker 1: jumping depends on the weapon.

1009
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean some weapons are slow on purpose.

1010
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:25,419
Speaker 0: The jumping feels like a Like a fraction of a millisecond too slow.

1011
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:30,680
Speaker 0: But other Castlevania games have had far worse problems with their control.

1012
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the point of sympathy tonight has no flaw and these in the control department It is, you know flawless.

1013
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:40,632
Speaker 0: It feels like the difference between Mario 3 and Mario world like how jumping works between the two.

1014
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:47,721
Speaker 0: This feels more like Mario world and Symphony of the night felt more like Mario 3.

1015
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:54,353
Speaker 0: That is how granted I have not played symphony tonight in like six years Symphony night controls are ridiculously tight.

1016
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:55,800
Speaker 0: I should play symphony the night again.

1017
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,343
Speaker 0: It's been a while.

1018
01:06:56,363 --> 01:06:59,540
Speaker 1: if you did that you might come back to this and be like, uh, why am I in jail?

1019
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:00,683
Speaker 1: Why is going on?

1020
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:01,004
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

1021
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:05,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it'll just be a mario 3 mario world situation.

1022
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:09,291
Speaker 1: See, I'm only like according to the percentages in the game.

1023
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:12,060
Speaker 1: I'm only 60 something percent done with the game out of what?

1024
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:17,612
Speaker 1: I don't know what percent that's out of so we're gonna see.

1025
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:20,380
Speaker 0: but the other takeaway I think from this game

1026
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:23,796
Speaker 1: it is not short like you are not gonna be disappointed from the game being too small

1027
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:33,644
Speaker 0: if You're gonna take a classic genre that you feel like just needed more and you're gonna try to do the bloodstain Treatment to it.

1028
01:07:34,348 --> 01:07:37,805
Speaker 0: You've gotta spend all your time Polishing it.

1029
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:41,120
Speaker 1: you did you got it, you know do what made the original one great.

1030
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,254
Speaker 1: There are a lot of other indie and non indie metroidvanias out and about that.

1031
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:51,582
Speaker 1: people have tried to make in You know in between but they're all just kind like they're very Satisfying.

1032
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:55,878
Speaker 1: one that was a dude who's like a gun dude who sneaks into a base, right?

1033
01:07:56,059 --> 01:07:58,073
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, that was what it was called.

1034
01:07:58,093 --> 01:07:59,000
Speaker 0: and the game of cube, right?

1035
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,800
Speaker 1: No, I played on an Xbox, but I don't know what it's available on.

1036
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,699
Speaker 1: But the point is that game was actually great in so many ways.

1037
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,100
Speaker 1: But the problem with it is it was just too small.

1038
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:11,790
Speaker 1: It was really small map and you finished it and then you were done.

1039
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:16,327
Speaker 1: if they would have made that game bigger like ten times As big it would have been an all-time great game.

1040
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:16,528
Speaker 1: Now.

1041
01:08:16,568 --> 01:08:18,073
Speaker 1: It's a shadow complex.

1042
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:18,395
Speaker 1: Yes.

1043
01:08:18,456 --> 01:08:19,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one.

1044
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:19,580
Speaker 1: that's the one.

1045
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:28,750
Speaker 1: Then there's games like Hollow Knight, which a lot of people are huge fans of and I get you know It is Metroidvania, but personally it's not.

1046
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:34,240
Speaker 1: it's not in anything like Super Metroid or Castlevania And I was not into it as much as all these other people who love it.

1047
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,999
Speaker 1: I couldn't play it too far at all.

1048
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:45,890
Speaker 1: yeah, and you know it also I think part of its problem it focused a lot more on like being difficult and having bad guys that Were like hard to deal with and they kept killing me.

1049
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:47,939
Speaker 1: and it's like that's not what these games are about, right?

1050
01:08:49,680 --> 01:09:03,139
Speaker 0: So I guess take that to heart if you if there's a kind of game Like me with Advance Wars that you feel like just needs to be remade polish and really understanding what specifically about that game you wanted more of.

1051
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:06,439
Speaker 0: Very few people can truly figure that out, right?

1052
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:16,620
Speaker 1: And I think you know, it's like if you're in a genre that has been overdone like say FPS That's when you need to mix things up and go your own way and show some new flavor and creativity.

1053
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:28,595
Speaker 1: If you're not right make something crazy, but if it's an underserved genre Like Metroidvania, you should literally just copy from the steal from the forgotten masters Make the same fucking thing and just change what you got to change.

1054
01:09:28,636 --> 01:09:32,270
Speaker 0: You don't get sued Yep, right and then just take that and make more of it.

1055
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,259
Speaker 1: Yep, you know, it's like all these people made adventure games.

1056
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:37,140
Speaker 1: now They're out of business telltale of it, right?

1057
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like you should have just fucking directly cut.

1058
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:43,279
Speaker 1: did exactly Lucas arts adventure games just more of them.

1059
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:44,850
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have done your own thing.

1060
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:46,158
Speaker 0: Well, there were.

1061
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,032
Speaker 0: Well, there are other factors with them many.

1062
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:50,620
Speaker 1: I feel like you get the idea.

1063
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,212
Speaker 0: I feel like a studio will reemerge to make those kinds of games.

1064
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:57,387
Speaker 1: Yes, and they should just make Lucas arts adventure games.

1065
01:09:57,467 --> 01:09:57,930
Speaker 1: literally.

1066
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,698
Speaker 1: they should look like they were made in the 90s.

1067
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, same stupid mechanics of nonsense garbage.

1068
01:10:04,472 --> 01:10:05,435
Speaker 1: Just new ones.

1069
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:06,900
Speaker 0: No, I would go the other route.

1070
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:13,181
Speaker 1: I'd make them more like just straight-up visual novels and not even pretend well, but then that's not that's not really that's a different thing It is.

1071
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:19,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they were trying to straddle a line between like narrative branching choices versus puzzle-solving.

1072
01:10:19,358 --> 01:10:23,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Play you're playing too much attention to my specific example.

1073
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:27,856
Speaker 1: Okay, if you want to make a platformer just make a fucking Mario just not Mario like.

1074
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:28,680
Speaker 0: look super meat boy.

1075
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:36,640
Speaker 0: as an example super meat boy took SMB and just polished it down to this little made it smaller this little.

1076
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:42,740
Speaker 1: I was watching a Mario maker on twitch a Mario maker player on twitch like last week.

1077
01:10:42,941 --> 01:10:45,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not watching twitch, you know right now obviously.

1078
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:49,580
Speaker 1: But and they were in a level that was basically it was just super meat boy.

1079
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:53,778
Speaker 1: They were doing wall jumps in between chainsaws and I was like, well, that's super meat boy.

1080
01:10:53,798 --> 01:11:03,820
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
