6
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:27,588
Speaker 0: no you jerk I point out.

7
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,391
Speaker 0: the listeners want it.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,218
Speaker 1: They just want whatever.

9
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,005
Speaker 0: I don't want Ah, but they want it.

10
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:33,652
Speaker 1: I should have acted like oh, man.

11
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:34,235
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

12
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,480
Speaker 1: How you did the date, and then you would have.

13
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,293
Speaker 0: So is it awesome?

14
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:39,996
Speaker 0: should I keep doing it?

15
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:46,619
Speaker 1: no well Because now the cats already out of the bag so whether whichever way I go it won't work.

16
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:48,165
Speaker 1: You know what I want.

17
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,573
Speaker 1: You know I've revealed my true desires.

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,817
Speaker 1: therefore it can.

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,231
Speaker 1: there is no Possible way I can conceal them again.

20
00:00:55,251 --> 00:01:03,200
Speaker 0: see now the important thing is that I win But you forget you you have to be a master of instilling doubt when there is no possible doubt.

21
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:06,178
Speaker 0: This is the art of the person who ran the RIT anime club.

22
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:06,440
Speaker 0: where?

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,118
Speaker 0: When a show was accidentally spoiled for someone you had to be able to instill doubt To where they wouldn't know if it was spoiled or not.

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,255
Speaker 1: yes That is that is thing is it depends on the specific thing right?

25
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:19,520
Speaker 1: so at this point?

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,757
Speaker 1: There is no way nothing that could possibly be said that would convince you that I actually are you sure?

27
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:29,536
Speaker 0: I mean I can Probably instill doubt in most of my most closely held ideals.

28
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:35,649
Speaker 1: if I really needed to Yeah, but it's like you've already told someone Very can be.

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,260
Speaker 1: even you do ranted about it.

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,020
Speaker 1: How could you possibly convince someone that you changed your mind so suddenly you know like maybe a year from now?

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,020
Speaker 1: I could be like yeah, you know looking back adding that year was actually a good idea.

32
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,297
Speaker 0: Here's why it doesn't work on me because if you said that I'd say awesome cool.

33
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:55,248
Speaker 0: We'll keep doing it Yeah, and you say no.

34
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,476
Speaker 0: I'll say I'm the audio editor.

35
00:01:56,496 --> 00:02:01,840
Speaker 1: We'll keep doing it Yeah, anyway, so I went to this conference today, which sucked.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,919
Speaker 1: I don't really want to talk about it.

37
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:07,293
Speaker 0: 99 for all you guys to go to anime cons and nerd cons and packs and everything.

38
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:13,649
Speaker 0: packs is greater than all cons and Like anime cons are greater than all cons that aren't.

39
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,532
Speaker 1: I mean it had some.

40
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:20,394
Speaker 1: it was Monday Tuesday and today right today was the Workshop day and there were good parts and bad parts and it sat and it apparently is.

41
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:26,214
Speaker 1: the workshop that I was not in Was probably a better workshop judging by the noises that were coming out of that room.

42
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,640
Speaker 0: wow that's like you're an anime con.

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:38,100
Speaker 0: You're watching some dumb panel on like I don't know Italia Crossplay making out and across the hall you just hear people screaming as gogo 13 shoots people and you can't go over there.

44
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:45,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no way anime con you can switch hallways, but when you signed up for a specific workshop You can't switch the people sitting behind me our workshop so that workshop.

45
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:53,660
Speaker 1: They've got sniper rifles, and you're taking turns doing what go go well It was also interesting how like there are people there who obviously came from far.

46
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:56,334
Speaker 1: I really feel bad for anyone came from far away because it was not.

47
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:57,540
Speaker 1: it was only good for us.

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,700
Speaker 1: Cuz the venue for the one part was actually right in your office and the venue for the workshops was you know also pretty close.

49
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:09,431
Speaker 1: I actually there are people who were in there with their luggage And they picked it up and left like in the middle of the day.

50
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,700
Speaker 1: some people left like after the first break.

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,087
Speaker 1: They were like oh man fuck this.

52
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:13,831
Speaker 1: They just they.

53
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,459
Speaker 1: they bolted at the first chance.

54
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,285
Speaker 1: You know they just did not return.

55
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 0: I found in my life that I almost every conference or convention I ever attend I Feel bad for the people who came that had to pay and travel to get there.

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my work paid which is the only.

57
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,780
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah I would not go to SIFMA if I had to pay money to go to SIFMA.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,745
Speaker 0: Yeah First instead SIFMA pays me.

59
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:37,868
Speaker 1: the thing is doesn't?

60
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,554
Speaker 1: doesn't SIFMA have like?

61
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:43,047
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing where you walk around like a trade Show right you walk around the booth.

62
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,780
Speaker 0: No it also has workshops and lectures.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was literally right.

64
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,180
Speaker 1: basically the first two days were two panel rooms.

65
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:59,737
Speaker 1: well actually two theaters right and The very limited programming in the second theater, and you basically had to choose between one of the.

66
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:00,540
Speaker 1: you know every slot.

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,934
Speaker 1: You either choose one theater or the other and that was pretty much it.

68
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:08,390
Speaker 1: and in terms of booths There was like five little stands with PR people.

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,193
Speaker 1: I didn't even talk to them.

70
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and there weren't even booths.

71
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,747
Speaker 1: It was just like a guy at a table with a laptop You know trying to sell his dick I guess as much as we complain about.

72
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:20,712
Speaker 1: and then on the third day was a workshop all day And you had to pick which one beforehand.

73
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:39,626
Speaker 1: and a thing is Everyone sort of knew who the people running the workshops are but I didn't know who they were so I ended up picking a not good one just based on the title and It wasn't even a workshop is basically an all-day powerpoint And it's like the other people had a workshop where they fucking made something and I was like god damn it This isn't a workshop.

74
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,340
Speaker 0: Hey that was the one at least at Connecticut.

75
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,315
Speaker 0: We only had like two or three workshops that weren't actually workshop.

76
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,680
Speaker 1: the thing is these are all internet e people.

77
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,900
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna write a blog post about how they saw how it's terrible.

78
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,168
Speaker 1: There were good parts, right?

79
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,540
Speaker 1: Obviously the other workshop was probably good.

80
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,989
Speaker 1: I didn't go to right and obviously it you know a lot.

81
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:03,667
Speaker 1: there were parts that I didn't like because I'm mostly a Programmer and it was obviously designer.

82
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,996
Speaker 1: It was a web design thing primarily.

83
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:12,740
Speaker 1: So a lot of it I was just like oh god, right and you know, so part of it was me and there were some good talks.

84
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,880
Speaker 1: I went to a bunch of the talks Monday and Tuesday and some were good.

85
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:26,200
Speaker 1: but some and even the ones that were Maybe I didn't like they were still well presented like they had speaking skills and presentation skills.

86
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,371
Speaker 1: It's just they didn't actually present any useful information there.

87
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,054
Speaker 1: Well, that's the.

88
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,680
Speaker 1: obviously they're basically pep talks.

89
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,652
Speaker 0: That's what I'm usually running into like look at packs where like some video game programmer people They have a lot of interesting stuff to say.

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,980
Speaker 0: they just don't know how to speak in.

91
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,084
Speaker 1: No, there were these guys.

92
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:45,620
Speaker 1: there are these designers and they had these their presentations like amazing because they're designers, right?

93
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:50,960
Speaker 1: And they're the things that their presentation skills were off the charts, right?

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,082
Speaker 1: They were enthusiastic and they they weren't, you know, only one person showed any nervousness You know.

95
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,460
Speaker 1: and they were exciting and energetic and like oh go get him, right?

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,960
Speaker 1: But all they were saying was like I'm not even a designer, right?

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,864
Speaker 1: I'm a programmer.

98
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:16,256
Speaker 1: and they were saying the same stuff like oh man Look at Apple and how they're designed so awesome and you know You'd know that something is right when you have nothing left to take away.

99
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,728
Speaker 1: it's like a G. I've never heard that quote before.

100
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 1: why don't you devote another five minutes to it, right?

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,920
Speaker 1: They didn't actually I mean theoretically the room was supposed to be full of web designers, right?

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,223
Speaker 1: Why don't you?

103
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:31,080
Speaker 1: I guess this is the kind of stuff that's gonna be in the blog post, right?

104
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:39,700
Speaker 1: I don't want to waste it all now But you know the primary thing that bothered me above all other complaints is that listen This is a conference of designers, right?

105
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,376
Speaker 1: You have to assume that everyone is coming is already designer.

106
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:43,705
Speaker 1: These are not nubs These are not.

107
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaker 0: people have never designed a day in their life Like, you know, we got X we do a lecture on you know game theory.

108
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,929
Speaker 0: We assume you've played some goddamn game, right?

109
00:06:50,949 --> 00:07:02,820
Speaker 1: You have to assume that we're not like gaming these and in the fifth century Assume that the people in the audience have like, you know, some of them probably have like masters or degrees in design, right?

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:14,119
Speaker 1: so telling them this nothing stuff or just a pep talk that's really energetic is not worth the Price that they or their employers paid for them to show up, right?

111
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:21,100
Speaker 1: So What you need to do is you need to actually give us something of actual substance.

112
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:26,298
Speaker 0: So Scott, I've been to one I do not know already technology convention my entire life.

113
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:31,531
Speaker 0: that met that Pangorcon the second Pangorcon in Novi, Michigan.

114
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,099
Speaker 0: That was the best technology convention I've ever attended.

115
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:34,540
Speaker 1: I agree.

116
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:39,013
Speaker 0: What we should start speaking at tech conventions, I guess I

117
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:52,532
Speaker 1: think the thing is when it comes to tech and Meetups though the ones that I like the most the ones that I've been to right are these little things in the city We go to right where you actually where everyone says stuff to everyone It's like, you know, and it's just the networking right?

118
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:57,647
Speaker 1: Like something like open everything Talking about right is is the?

119
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:59,694
Speaker 1: you know, I mean it's something like what I went to.

120
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:05,924
Speaker 1: people might show up for the networking But it's like I even have the talking just have the networking and that's it just have like a meetup right?

121
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,672
Speaker 1: or you look at something like PyCon right.

122
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:17,100
Speaker 1: you go to PyCon, which is a Python conference usually in Europe and While there is there are talks and lightning rounds and all these sorts of things.

123
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,612
Speaker 1: There's also people coding.

124
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,160
Speaker 1: they do stuff there, right?

125
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,016
Speaker 1: It's the equivalent of like tabletop at PAX is coding and actually making stuff at PyCon.

126
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,380
Speaker 0: So it's desktop.

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,960
Speaker 1: So it's yeah, right So but there was no designing going on at least I think there was in the other workshop.

128
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,008
Speaker 0: But then I see that other workshop.

129
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:41,200
Speaker 1: that's where everything was I know but that was only one out of three days, right?

130
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:51,190
Speaker 1: So, I mean while there was good stuff that I was missing and what you know It was like there were problems at this thing and if I had paid for it with my own money I or traveled a great distance.

131
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,860
Speaker 1: I would have been very upset.

132
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:55,690
Speaker 0: What said is I can still say everything that you said.

133
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:59,484
Speaker 0: just change some of the proper nouns about many of the anime and gaming I've attended in my life.

134
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,915
Speaker 1: What well, you can't say that there's really good presenters with.

135
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:05,206
Speaker 1: you know, what useful information There are.

136
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,899
Speaker 0: there are as I will point out Daryl Surratt Jared Rathkal, they have useful information.

137
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,807
Speaker 0: You me Mike tool.

138
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,071
Speaker 1: We all have useful information.

139
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,095
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

140
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:15,376
Speaker 1: Actually?

141
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,376
Speaker 1: No, except for you and me We don't have useful information now, but all the other people do we just?

142
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:28,180
Speaker 0: I think it was Luke Who said we have an amazing ability in panel rooms to bowl people over and whether they agree agree with us or not They feel like they should by the end even if we're wrong.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,296
Speaker 1: But we're actually giving information or at least making a case the people.

144
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,426
Speaker 1: a lot of the talks I went to are pretty much just like rah.

145
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,309
Speaker 1: rah design.

146
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,498
Speaker 1: Oh and every single thing I went to there was ie6 hating.

147
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:45,580
Speaker 1: It's like that's all web designers could talk about all day long every all three days was we hate isaac?

148
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,746
Speaker 1: So I 60 and I six.

149
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,838
Speaker 1: it's like we know everyone here hates ie6.

150
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,930
Speaker 1: We don't need to keep saying it a thousand times.

151
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:52,633
Speaker 1: I hate it too.

152
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:53,336
Speaker 1: You hate it.

153
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,058
Speaker 1: We all hate it.

154
00:09:54,721 --> 00:10:00,629
Speaker 1: Shut up, you don't need to say in every single panel and every single workshop 10 every 10 minutes Oh, but what about ie6?

155
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,052
Speaker 1: ie6 sucks?

156
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:03,644
Speaker 1: Ruins my day.

157
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:04,408
Speaker 1: What's you know, you know?

158
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,298
Speaker 1: Hey, what's the worst thing about your job ie6?

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,500
Speaker 0: This reminds me of back and way back.

160
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,974
Speaker 0: We were at an Otacon and we're at the feedback ceremony one by one.

161
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:19,659
Speaker 0: everyone comes up and they're like I've been coming to Otacon for 15 years and I've been coming to Otacon for 11 years and this is my 20th Otacon.

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,337
Speaker 0: and Our friend Pete goes up there and he's like I've been coming to Otacon for 500 years.

163
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,057
Speaker 0: And I feel like if you were talking at that conference, you should be like yeah mosaic that fucker.

164
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:35,720
Speaker 1: They talked about mosaic But they talked about it, you know, it's a historical thing.

165
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,549
Speaker 1: You know the way we'll.

166
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,400
Speaker 1: when we talk about something We'll start with the oldest thing to be historical and show you a progression.

167
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,694
Speaker 1: They started at mosaic when I wait whenever they needed to talk about progression.

168
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,180
Speaker 1: They tell you started with mosaic.

169
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:54,014
Speaker 0: I don't know why they didn't start with links at a web conference or everyone probably already knew anyway, exact I don't think the listeners on Wednesday night care much about that.

170
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,320
Speaker 1: No, that's just what bothered me today.

171
00:10:55,441 --> 00:11:03,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway Oh, wow That was a tangent actually because what I really wanted to talk about was that today when I was at the workshops on 59th in Lexington across the street.

172
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,309
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

173
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,755
Speaker 0: There's actually a link here.

174
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,220
Speaker 0: This is actually relevant.

175
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:12,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wow across the street from the workshops was the Argosy gallery.

176
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,580
Speaker 1: All right, you know what this is.

177
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,709
Speaker 0: I have no idea what the Argosy gallery.

178
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:23,491
Speaker 1: It is a store right which sells Argosy books prints paintings and maps right?

179
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,695
Speaker 1: I went in there.

180
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:31,360
Speaker 1: They had books from like the 15th century just on the shelf.

181
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,029
Speaker 1: I was like what it's like.

182
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,040
Speaker 1: this place should be a museum, but it's a store.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,369
Speaker 1: There's a place like that the newest.

184
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,196
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, you're on 59th Street.

185
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:42,240
Speaker 0: I think I know where you were.

186
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,924
Speaker 0: This place was that?

187
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,514
Speaker 0: wait this place also have Greek pottery.

188
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,377
Speaker 0: no, okay.

189
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,240
Speaker 0: There's another player.

190
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,725
Speaker 1: This is the place on the street view.

191
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,026
Speaker 1: see it.

192
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:50,848
Speaker 0: Okay.

193
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,580
Speaker 0: There's another place on 59th Street that sells actual Greek pottery.

194
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,586
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I gotta go there.

195
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have to go to this place.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,120
Speaker 0: Well, I guess technically I mean there is pottery from Greece in the 70s, but this Argosy place, right?

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,170
Speaker 1: Not only were they selling like books right and apparently the newest books they had were like As old as the books that are unlike my grandma's shelf.

199
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,113
Speaker 1: That was the newest books.

200
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,780
Speaker 1: They had were like 80s books, right?

201
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:22,140
Speaker 1: But they had stuff they're like, yeah Here's a letter from the desk of FDR's secretary in a plastic sleeve for $35 and it's just like it's just sitting there.

202
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:29,540
Speaker 1: It's like oh, no, not that much money No, but I'm saying is like they got that kind of stuff is like just all over the place.

203
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,720
Speaker 0: I should get something weird like that and just leave it out.

204
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,445
Speaker 1: But yeah, we had to.

205
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,540
Speaker 1: it's like we had to go to this place.

206
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:43,968
Speaker 1: You got to see it and it's it's weird because this build this building has many floors, right and it actually uses all the floors It's not and they have a really old elevator to go up.

207
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,060
Speaker 0: Oh, so this isn't actually linked to anime manga or comics.

208
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,755
Speaker 1: No, oh, I thought that it was just.

209
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:59,810
Speaker 1: that was the thing I actually wanted to talk about in my opening bit But I forgot because I started by saying I was at a workshop and across the street was the thing But I got stuck on the workshop because the workshop was.

210
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,356
Speaker 1: it took a while to get across the street.

211
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,504
Speaker 0: Yeah So there's a little bit of anime news But I do want to.

212
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:08,502
Speaker 0: I have two geek bite points to make Point.

213
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:14,259
Speaker 0: the first when we reviewed Eden of the East Scott had seen it all and I've seen all but the last two episodes.

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,620
Speaker 1: now.

215
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,644
Speaker 1: Oh, you've seen the last episode.

216
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:16,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the fuck.

217
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,079
Speaker 0: that was the most disappointing show I've ever seen.

218
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,992
Speaker 0: Because shows that are worse at least are not disappointing.

219
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:26,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically what.

220
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:27,799
Speaker 0: why didn't you tell me?

221
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,284
Speaker 0: Why didn't you warn me?

222
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,971
Speaker 0: You were like, yeah, it was B anime was okay.

223
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,155
Speaker 0: You were going along with.

224
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:33,199
Speaker 0: no fuck that show.

225
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,028
Speaker 0: Really that end was like.

226
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,440
Speaker 0: it was a B anime with a B end, but it could have been an a anime.

227
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,480
Speaker 0: That's worse than just being a B anime.

228
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,244
Speaker 1: Oh you think so.

229
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:49,280
Speaker 0: you could have been an a and you weren't because Kamehama just apparently is only good when he takes other people's works and reimagine them.

230
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,149
Speaker 1: I mean the situation is right.

231
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,012
Speaker 1: is that you got this?

232
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:58,914
Speaker 1: the beginning is so promising right in the end It does not live up to the promise right, but it's not a bad end.

233
00:13:58,955 --> 00:13:59,899
Speaker 1: It just doesn't live up.

234
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,352
Speaker 1: But here's here's why it had lived up.

235
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,380
Speaker 1: it would have been a so because it didn't live up.

236
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,740
Speaker 0: Here's why it's a bad ending.

237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,039
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about how the whole clothes like all the things I already talked about on the show.

238
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:10,687
Speaker 0: It's sad.

239
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:17,539
Speaker 0: reason number one They did the same bullshit that Gundam C did where they unkill a character for no reason except fan service.

240
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:22,554
Speaker 0: They unkill the character and they show them to you for two seconds to be like check it out.

241
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:27,699
Speaker 0: Not dead moving on All right, that was BS to the end.

242
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:33,500
Speaker 0: Didn't make sense it that none of that would have worked and nothing was resolved?

243
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,307
Speaker 1: Like no, I mean there was a result.

244
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:41,646
Speaker 1: I think the thing is is that there was so much that was unresolved, you know There's so many.

245
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:46,747
Speaker 0: the end was so stylistically beautiful Like it felt like the end of standalone complex.

246
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:51,298
Speaker 0: except imagine if the end of standalone complex didn't resolve anything at all.

247
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,526
Speaker 0: Yeah Fuck that show.

248
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:56,599
Speaker 0: That was the most disappointing anime I've seen in a day.

249
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,831
Speaker 1: I think it's like a Death Note situation.

250
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,260
Speaker 1: right people hate the second half of death.

251
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:06,820
Speaker 1: Some people do right, but I think but really if that second half of Death Note is actually good It's just the first half is great.

252
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:11,499
Speaker 1: So you think when you're putting and they're in the same work with the same title, right you go.

253
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,140
Speaker 1: Oh, man, this is terrible because you get your reference point is is shifted, right?

254
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,980
Speaker 1: So you see now in this case though if the second half of Death Note was its own manga on its own People wouldn't be like hating on it so much.

255
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:38,665
Speaker 0: First half of Death Note was an A and the second half was a B. this was a B show that the first three episodes were a and The entire second half of the show was C so it averaged out to a B. that's way different from like scrap princess, which was just a Standard generic B.

256
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:51,113
Speaker 1: and the thing is I will actually in my you know, my personal taste I will take that over these shows that are C C C C C C C C C C C or even F F F And then become a at the very end.

257
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:52,320
Speaker 0: fuck that go go go.

258
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,757
Speaker 1: I'm not sitting through right because I if it's good at least in the beginning and turns to crap.

259
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:57,660
Speaker 1: That's okay.

260
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,784
Speaker 0: I should have stopped cuz

261
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:12,280
Speaker 1: I remember it's like I got my goodness and that goodness will is like is like coal in the steam in The engine that will power me through and I can just sort of slide down the bad parts if I get before as long as It's not terrible for a very long time.

262
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,385
Speaker 1: Like if it was many episodes like let's say it was 50 episodes and it gets bad at episode 10.

263
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:17,140
Speaker 1: I'll just stop watching.

264
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,521
Speaker 0: Well, this show did like noir did this to the first episode of noir was one of the most awesome and promising things I'd seen.

265
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:28,420
Speaker 1: yeah, noir is the perfect example of gets bad like episode five six, right?

266
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,080
Speaker 0: That show was like a a B C F nuns with guns.

267
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:39,138
Speaker 1: It's like if it's bad for the beginning I mean if it's good from the beginning I can watch it and I'm watching good stuff.

268
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:39,720
Speaker 0: So what do I care?

269
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:47,360
Speaker 0: Heck episode 1 a. episode 2 B episode 3 through the end blah blah blah key over the Twilight.

270
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:51,680
Speaker 1: So if it gets bad, I can just stop watching and know that it's just bad.

271
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,540
Speaker 1: Right, but and I've still watched I only watched good parts.

272
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,959
Speaker 1: So I'm safe this show was so short that I was able to make it to the end.

273
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:06,880
Speaker 1: But if a show is bad and as a promise of being good, that means there's a chance I might be slogging through shit and at the other end more shit.

274
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,646
Speaker 1: So you can't right?

275
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,479
Speaker 1: so in that case, right it's like.

276
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:17,400
Speaker 1: You know the the the payoff you're basically risking a payoff and watching our ton of shit in the end.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
Speaker 1: What is good at the beginning?

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,334
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if it turns to shit because you can stop watching and you're not.

279
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:22,440
Speaker 1: you never watch the shit.

280
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:22,861
Speaker 0: It's just.

281
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:28,840
Speaker 0: there's the difference like we always say like a anime B anime C anime, but really B anime are in two classes.

282
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:33,811
Speaker 0: There's the B anime that's consistently B Maybe with some peaks some a episode some C episodes.

283
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,240
Speaker 0: and there's the B anime like Eden of the East.

284
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,959
Speaker 0: There's only B because the first episode a balances out the ease at the end.

285
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,907
Speaker 0: Ease whoa, not quite an E.

286
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,153
Speaker 1: I think if they're like C.

287
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,860
Speaker 0: It was a solid C at the end.

288
00:17:46,962 --> 00:18:01,010
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean at least gang kotsuo had the good graces to be really awesome Until the end and then just fuck up just the end as opposed to the long slow Peter out that even at the East head Any of these wasn't that long which helped it out.

289
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,440
Speaker 0: true last exile did that - it was awesome.

290
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,960
Speaker 0: And in the very end, which is kind of like what and notice how that show also unkilled someone for no reason.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, the very it was thing is last exile was good right up into the final episode which didn't resolve enough Climactically enough.

292
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,853
Speaker 0: Yep, and also unkilled people and killed people stupidly.

293
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:23,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, so I News, let's do news.

294
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,232
Speaker 0: I got one more thing to say another geek bite.

295
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,516
Speaker 0: I'm rewatching try gun.

296
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,640
Speaker 0: Okay, it's good show.

297
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:28,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it.

298
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:34,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, I had not seen try gun since we were freshmen RIT.

299
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:36,900
Speaker 1: I seen it more recently, but even so it's been a while.

300
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,815
Speaker 1: But I watched it many times at the time.

301
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:39,359
Speaker 1: I did watch it.

302
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:45,560
Speaker 0: So what I want to say is that it's a good show, but I don't know if I still put it in a category.

303
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's b-plus.

304
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,432
Speaker 1: It was always at the bottom of the a cat.

305
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:53,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was but watching it again it It's interesting how.

306
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:57,740
Speaker 0: I think I remember I'd seen try try gun before I saw cowboy bebop all the way through.

307
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:01,880
Speaker 0: I think that is the primary reason why I held it in such high esteem.

308
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:04,131
Speaker 0: The only reason I bring this up is still a good show.

309
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,500
Speaker 0: I got to finish for about halfway through.

310
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,511
Speaker 0: We just got to the episode with the Cyclops.

311
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:08,175
Speaker 0: I really like her.

312
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:12,935
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But I think this is the first time I've had a show.

313
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,180
Speaker 0: usually, you know, I like Ava.

314
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,114
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh I like that shows a kid, but maybe it's not good now that I watch.

315
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,240
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh that shows brilliant.

316
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,731
Speaker 0: Yep, every show I've rewatched until now.

317
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,555
Speaker 0: I've been like, yes.

318
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:31,439
Speaker 0: In fact, not only is it brilliant It's more brilliant than I realized like Evangelion was way more brilliant than I remember or even irresponsible captain Tyler Like that is in my top three right now.

319
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't finish it.

320
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:34,589
Speaker 1: I don't put it up there.

321
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,760
Speaker 0: Ah, if you watch all the way through I watched enough.

322
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:39,094
Speaker 0: Ah, no, you didn't.

323
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,640
Speaker 0: Anyway, try gun a mine is b-plus.

324
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,335
Speaker 0: We'll see how it goes because I forgot how long the kind of Tezuka style non sequitur crazy Characters always going off model beginning was.

325
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:56,375
Speaker 1: yeah Well, there's also you know, there's a whole bunch of episodes really in the middle where it's nothing.

326
00:19:56,415 --> 00:20:03,823
Speaker 1: but go to a new town You know a new bad guy, of course, then you get to dynamite Neon, that's.

327
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,130
Speaker 1: but I mean that's really really into dynamite.

328
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really just a two-parter with a bad guy.

329
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he was the great bad guy.

330
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,135
Speaker 1: I mean, they're all great bad guys.

331
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,425
Speaker 1: That's the thing like the sniper You know, every bad guy is great.

332
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:20,370
Speaker 1: It's just mostly go to town bad guy go to town bad guy slowly Reveal something's going on.

333
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:27,599
Speaker 0: We'll see though because I have watching it again I'm remembering that you that you don't know, you know what the show is until near the end.

334
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:31,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and I've never rewatched episodes episode 17, I believe.

335
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:37,160
Speaker 0: Yeah Where we stopped the show, we're like, did you download the wrong fan sub exactly?

336
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,214
Speaker 1: That's I believe that is the episode where it actually you know turns around.

337
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:44,949
Speaker 1: but so like but like, you know episode 13 is actually he.

338
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:50,051
Speaker 0: when is when he goes crazy, but like yeah with That's that's the one word, you know people actually die.

339
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:51,278
Speaker 1: It's like the demon episode.

340
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,137
Speaker 1: Yeah Diablo, yeah.

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,613
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

342
00:20:55,381 --> 00:21:00,920
Speaker 0: I mean the other thing is I've just gotten to the point where I remember the show getting way dark and way awesome.

343
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,190
Speaker 0: So it might still be an a-minus but it might be b-plus.

344
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:05,652
Speaker 0: I don't know.

345
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,218
Speaker 0: We'll see in anime news.

346
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:15,560
Speaker 0: very briefly Summer Wars is one of the one of my favorite anime movies just because it was great King Kong cosmon.

347
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,577
Speaker 0: So it's up for the Oscar, I mean pon you didn't win the Oscar last year, but it was.

348
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:20,160
Speaker 0: it was not.

349
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,405
Speaker 1: There's no way it's winning.

350
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,629
Speaker 1: So not a chance.

351
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,637
Speaker 1: Well if it wins I will bet money.

352
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:25,240
Speaker 1: It will not win.

353
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,712
Speaker 0: It's only up against among other movies how to train your dragon.

354
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:34,029
Speaker 0: despicable me the owl movies Toy Story 3 Story 3 already won.

355
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:38,511
Speaker 1: probably it's a horror And so I haven't even seen it.

356
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:44,740
Speaker 1: but I can guarantee I'm not even a movie person You know, he's not as not nearly as much as many other people in the world.

357
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,160
Speaker 1: It's Toy Story 3 is a lock for that category.

358
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,004
Speaker 1: There's no story.

359
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,740
Speaker 1: No way the stupid owls are winning ever know what the owls are in there?

360
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,340
Speaker 0: Right if Toy Story 3 was not in the running I would guess that how to train your dragon would win.

361
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean while summer wars is great.

362
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:04,005
Speaker 1: There's no way it's gonna beat those Even though it's pretty.

363
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:08,720
Speaker 1: I mean, it's probably actually, you know, like Toy Story 3 is obviously the winner.

364
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:14,169
Speaker 1: I mean summer wars is right up under it But it is no way it can get up to that.

365
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,650
Speaker 1: next level.

366
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,020
Speaker 0: summer wars has seven of those little leaf things on the poster.

367
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,003
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

368
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,972
Speaker 1: It deserves even more but it's not Toy Story 3.

369
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,457
Speaker 1: There's no way now it can't win.

370
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,360
Speaker 1: There's no chance.

371
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,449
Speaker 1: That's like it's like oh man who's going to?

372
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,115
Speaker 0: who's gonna win the ae86 or the ae85?

373
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,773
Speaker 1: No, it's more like all right rim, you know, who are you?

374
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,220
Speaker 1: Who are you putting in the ring?

375
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,867
Speaker 1: It's like I'm putting in Mike Tyson.

376
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:37,469
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

377
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,634
Speaker 1: There's no way he's gonna lose.

378
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:41,144
Speaker 0: Yes, Joe too bad I got Muhammad Ali.

379
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:48,168
Speaker 1: Oh, well, then so so Toy Story 3 is Muhammad Ali Summer Wars is Mike Tyson.

380
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:50,380
Speaker 0: So is Legend of the Guardian is glass Joe.

381
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:54,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, the owls.

382
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:56,354
Speaker 1: the owls is not even glass Joe.

383
00:22:56,414 --> 00:23:04,384
Speaker 1: the owls is the guy from super punch-out Gabby J. Yay All right.

384
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:09,923
Speaker 1: Oh Interesting thing right?

385
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:13,312
Speaker 1: Apparently there is a French Japanese thing going on.

386
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:13,954
Speaker 1: It's pay.

387
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:25,920
Speaker 1: It's some anime paid for by France's l'institut national de prevention de education, which is the National Institute That was the best French accent I ever heard preventative and health education.

388
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,220
Speaker 1: And basically they wanted to make a 10-minute don't smoke kids anime.

389
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,275
Speaker 1: So they got studio 4c to do it all high quality.

390
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,586
Speaker 1: Whoa And it's gonna be pretty awesome.

391
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:39,261
Speaker 1: I imagine I think you can actually watch it on the Internet's.

392
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:47,872
Speaker 1: yeah the complete short titled the attraction is now available at a website and it's got dubbed into Japanese or French and Then you get an English subtitles.

393
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,658
Speaker 1: Ooh So there you go.

394
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:54,900
Speaker 0: It saddens me that I think I still understand French more than I understand Japanese.

395
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,630
Speaker 1: What's interesting about this right is is two things.

396
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:05,080
Speaker 1: number one, right is like, okay They've got you know, usually stuff that's like don't smoke kids or don't do drugs.

397
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,526
Speaker 1: It's like low production value like remember all those raps from the 90s That'd be like, you know, don't do?

398
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:15,980
Speaker 1: they were the lowest when I was second grade value.

399
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:29,694
Speaker 0: I discovered that there was a place in the school library where you could check out instead of a book a movie Whoa, and I was like, oh man, and I saw this one called fast forward future Whoa, and I was like, this is gonna be awesome.

400
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 0: It was Possibly the most pathetic anti-drug hour-long movie I've ever witnessed.

401
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:43,959
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean so but imagine if say they paid like Steven Spielberg to make an anti-drug movie, right?

402
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:44,924
Speaker 1: That would be like.

403
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,293
Speaker 1: no one does that everyone.

404
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:49,195
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a joke I could make or they got actual like in the 70s.

405
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,476
Speaker 0: I feel like I could have said he did it was called and said the name of some movie.

406
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,260
Speaker 0: that would have been what it.

407
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,579
Speaker 1: What if they actually made like Star Wars?

408
00:24:57,424 --> 00:25:02,070
Speaker 1: Like like as good as episode four or five six anti-drug movie.

409
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:08,158
Speaker 0: well in Episode one he did say you shouldn't smoke because they were what cancer sticks or something.

410
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:08,660
Speaker 1: I don't know.

411
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was episode one not four or five six.

412
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:14,803
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it wasn't Star Wars Here.

413
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:23,672
Speaker 1: they basically got some of the best animes there are right, you know studio 4c To work on a 10-minute long don't smoke thing.

414
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,060
Speaker 1: So that that in alone is pretty awesome, right?

415
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,139
Speaker 1: The second thing that I find this really interesting is like smoking is actually as big a problem as it is here in.

416
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,680
Speaker 1: Oh in France in Japan in Japan, it's the worst everybody's and you can just smoke everywhere.

417
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,126
Speaker 1: You can smoke in your house.

418
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,832
Speaker 1: You can smoke in the restaurant.

419
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,675
Speaker 1: Yes.

420
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:42,740
Speaker 1: It makes me not want to go there.

421
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, even DC apparently, you know where we were at the rally, right?

422
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 0: We went to a restaurant and well We thought it was a restaurant.

423
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,207
Speaker 0: They're like smoking or not and we're like what?

424
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:55,620
Speaker 0: because apparently if it's also a bar they can have a smoking section.

425
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,931
Speaker 0: So we left and we found another restaurant that didn't have that.

426
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:00,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, we found a restaurant.

427
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:01,460
Speaker 0: There wasn't a bar.

428
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:06,916
Speaker 1: All right, but it's weird in New York City, like almost every restaurant you go to has a bar in it.

429
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,040
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway So what I you know, I thought was really interesting about this is right.

430
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,540
Speaker 1: I was like, I'm wondering how many cuz it takes a lot of people to animate something, right?

431
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Speaker 0: So I'm like how many of those people were smoking?

432
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:23,180
Speaker 1: How many of these guys a studio 4c who worked on this animation smoke?

433
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,136
Speaker 1: Right and how ironic is that these non-smoking people these smokers made this non-smoke.

434
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,180
Speaker 0: it would not be ironic.

435
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,360
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know one of them quit smoking because they made this.

436
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,260
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of them do or don't you know, I mean they could all be non-smokers.

437
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,013
Speaker 1: It's entirely possible, but the odds are in these countries where smoking is just so prevalent.

438
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:41,956
Speaker 0: Of course.

439
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,139
Speaker 0: I did read a study.

440
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,551
Speaker 0: I read the abstract of the study.

441
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:52,393
Speaker 0: It was a couple months ago talking about how American cigarettes are actually Particularly more dangerous than cigarettes the entire rest of the world.

442
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,000
Speaker 0: Yeah because of the way they're made.

443
00:26:54,521 --> 00:27:06,434
Speaker 1: Well, I think I think part actually part of the reason they make them that way right is a because burn more addictive cheaper more And the regulation isn't there but also because they're restricted.

444
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:09,100
Speaker 1: So I there are a lot less restricted in other places, right?

445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,940
Speaker 1: It's not like 18 plus, right?

446
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,500
Speaker 1: So for if they could just sell them to kids or to younger people as they can and of many other places.

447
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:20,800
Speaker 1: Right, then they wouldn't need to make a more addictive because they get you early.

448
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,270
Speaker 1: So you're already addicted to just the regular amount of nicotine.

449
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,417
Speaker 1: but because because they're gonna get you so late They got to up the ante to.

450
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,620
Speaker 0: you know Japan also has the workaholic culture that I think drives the smoking pretty heavily.

451
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,755
Speaker 1: Well, it's also Francis France because they let people smoke anywhere, right?

452
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,220
Speaker 1: You're just exposed to it all the time.

453
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,240
Speaker 1: So it's a lot of you, right?

454
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:45,245
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's a catch-22 because if you're exposed to it everywhere, then no individual person is gonna be like, yeah Yeah, I mean it's just.

455
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:48,819
Speaker 1: it's a whole problem and you know, we should just ban it outright.

456
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:50,196
Speaker 1: You should only be allowed to smoke.

457
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:55,740
Speaker 1: I mean Smoke in your house if no one's around who doesn't consent.

458
00:27:55,941 --> 00:28:00,499
Speaker 1: I'm fine with the way New York's doing it because the new laws I want to get it out of the sidewalk and out of the park.

459
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:11,956
Speaker 0: Ah, so the new laws that are basically crazily popular that are probably gonna pass also in addition to all the existing bands in New York City will ban smoking in boardwalks parks and any public plaza sidewalk.

460
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,280
Speaker 1: It's not banning the sidewalk.

461
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,300
Speaker 1: No, it is banned within 100 feet of any door and now I should be on the sidewalk all sidewalks period.

462
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:33,146
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So things of the day Emily showed me this and it was pretty badass.

463
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,490
Speaker 0: You can watch the whole thing on YouTube.

464
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:40,249
Speaker 0: This is a 2007 animated short by a Russian animation studio.

465
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:44,646
Speaker 1: Called the dog door was the guy who made it is his name Sergei.

Speaker 0: It's like ten minutes long.

470
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:08,995
Speaker 0: It's beautiful and while depressing it is as depressing as you could expect a Russian animation about dogs To be.

471
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,263
Speaker 1: does it have pockner styling?

472

Speaker 1: You already have the sprites in the game.

582
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:30,810
Speaker 1: I don't remember the other one over the boo one.

583
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:35,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, we need better and more cornucopias of geekiness.

584
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,342
Speaker 1: like pretend it's Photoshop Friday and it's like Photoshop this cornucopia and Add geekiness to it.

585
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:45,632
Speaker 0: or dicks geeky dicks Please don't.

586
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,850
Speaker 0: I don't think we ever did a show on Looney Tunes.

587
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,672
Speaker 1: I'm free.

588
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:55,350
Speaker 1: We might have discussed them as part of some show way back.

589
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,330
Speaker 0: We were like cartoons of our youth, but that was all he-man thunder.

590
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,610
Speaker 1: I think we actually did mention Looney Tunes in it.

591
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,046
Speaker 1: But why the hell not devote a whole show to something so important that I and the thing?

592
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:06,190
Speaker 1: other reason is not only is it?

593
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,816
Speaker 1: Very important and very awesome.

594
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,970
Speaker 1: I think it has actually been sort of neglected and forgotten.

595
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,750
Speaker 0: Well, I was looking around on YouTube and many of the classics were not easily available for free just online.

596
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:18,883
Speaker 1: No You gotta buy them on DVD or just a lot of money.

597
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:26,582
Speaker 0: and I was poking around Netflix and those and more importantly all the old Disney Equivalents like the Donald Duck cartoons and everything also really only available on DVD.

598
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and none of them are in the Netflix streaming.

599
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:41,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think the worst thing about it though Is that I mean when we were kids you would come home and you would watch cartoons Or you watch cartoons on Saturday morning and the thing was there would all the cartoons that you watched would change over time.

600
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:50,156
Speaker 1: Right, you know, it would be Transformers and Voltron But then it would be Thundercats and then that Thundercats would go away and then you'd have pup name Scooby Doo And they'd keep cycling in and out.

601
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:58,386
Speaker 1: but from the time that I was very young like three To the time that you know, pretty much my entire childhood life.

602
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:06,695
Speaker 1: I was 18 Looney Tunes always had a time slot whether it was Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon or ABC Saturday Morning or something.

603
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:16,250
Speaker 1: there was cartoon slots and Looney Tunes always had a spot in there Somewhere, you know pretty much after that It was Rocky and Bullwinkle always had a slot somewhere most of the time.

604
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,491
Speaker 0: I think.

605
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:19,320
Speaker 1: more important Looney Tunes always had a slot all the time.

606
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:29,432
Speaker 0: when I think back to watching Looney Tunes versus other cartoons I would never really want to watch an episode of like a pup named Scooby Doo more than once Exactly.

607
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,369
Speaker 0: Maybe I'd get stuck watching it twice because it was on and there was nothing else to do.

608
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,750
Speaker 0: But I pretty much never got sick of the good Looney Tunes.

609
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:37,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that you could.

610
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:39,690
Speaker 1: it was refused reruns all the time, right?

611
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,719
Speaker 1: Cuz after a couple years if you're a kid you would seen them all.

612
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:50,195
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen everything from Bosco The way through.

613
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:54,310
Speaker 1: I don't think you could find a Looney Tune all the way up to like Space Jam, right?

614
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,072
Speaker 1: So I don't think you could find something unless it was newer than Space Jam or older than Bosco that I have not seen Right.

615
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:00,814
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it depends.

616
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:10,614
Speaker 0: if we're just talking Looney Tunes merit melodies versus if you zoom out to count like the Max Fleischer stuff Tom and Jerry Doesn't count.

617
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,685
Speaker 1: the thing is those are all in the same time slots.

618
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,130
Speaker 1: we saw all those as well.

619
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,177
Speaker 1: All right, thanks Avery.

620
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,869
Speaker 1: We saw all of it, right?

621
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,127
Speaker 1: You know takes Avery had it.

622
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,952
Speaker 1: There was a text.

623
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:24,770
Speaker 1: Avery hour on fucking Cartoon Network for the longest time Scott because I know the answer to this.

624
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,981
Speaker 0: I think everyone who knows us knows the answer to this.

625
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:28,770
Speaker 0: It's your favorite Looney Tunes episode.

626
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:34,227
Speaker 1: Oh, you're you're I don't know how I know it, but I know you don't even know.

627
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,070
Speaker 1: you don't even know it.

628
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,358
Speaker 0: No, because I know you I was gonna quote it.

629
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:38,803
Speaker 0: I was I was modifying it.

630
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:43,634
Speaker 1: Oh, he's hiding in the store Just the line.

631
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,523
Speaker 0: when the dude comes on this stove he just coming.

632
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,469
Speaker 0: he'd be like, I know he's done it.

633
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,095
Speaker 1: That wasn't the same episode.

634
00:37:52,135 --> 00:38:01,070
Speaker 1: nobody was the same character wasn't carries that the thing is the episode with the stove is the superior Episode to the one with the the closet right which is that I don't know how he's done at one.

635
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:02,937
Speaker 0: I actually prefer that one.

636
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:07,290
Speaker 1: No, the the stove one is is the best one by far anyway.

637
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:13,446
Speaker 1: So yeah, these things were on TV no matter what every kid knew him.

638
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:14,530
Speaker 1: every kid saw him, right?

639
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,038
Speaker 1: It was sort of like for me.

640
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:18,190
Speaker 1: It was a lot like Batman the animated series, right?

641
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,369
Speaker 1: It's like they were sir.

642
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,092
Speaker 1: It was weird.

643
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:21,055
Speaker 1: my whole like.

644
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:24,365
Speaker 1: there were things that I would be really enthusiastic about right like it back.

645
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,007
Speaker 1: Oh fuck.

646
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:37,550
Speaker 1: Yes Thundercats Yeah, but it was only on for a short period and meanwhile there were things which were just always there staples Right, and I never got sick of them, but I also never looked forward to them.

647
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,674
Speaker 0: I see it's like shit bugs bunnies coming on but bugs money would be on and it would be awesome always Yeah, and sort of like.

648
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,079
Speaker 1: it's same thing with food, right?

649
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:48,330
Speaker 1: It's like, you know bread is awesome, right?

650
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,454
Speaker 1: But you have bread every day.

651
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:51,603
Speaker 1: So it's like bread and steak.

652
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,379
Speaker 1: you have like once a week once a month Maybe right not it's rare but steak.

653
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,226
Speaker 1: You're like, oh it better be rare, right?

654
00:38:57,246 --> 00:39:00,057
Speaker 1: But you're like, oh fuck Yeah steak, right, but you never.

655
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:07,366
Speaker 1: yeah, it's not until we're adults and we're wiser and we look back and we go Oh, yeah, right, you know, it's like when you have bread every day.

656
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:08,169
Speaker 1: It's just like bread.

657
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:10,399
Speaker 1: Looney Tunes is like that.

658
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,685
Speaker 1: It was just like Looney Tunes.

659
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,675
Speaker 0: part of it with Looney Tunes Is that the?

660
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:16,530
Speaker 0: I mean, especially you know, the original Looney Tunes and Mary Malick.

661
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,332
Speaker 0: You know They were like.

662
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:21,709
Speaker 0: quality was all over the place in those kinds of cartoons later on.

663
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:25,050
Speaker 0: Remember those weird like late 80s Tom and Jerry?

664
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,280
Speaker 1: Well, Tom and Jerry isn't Looney Tunes either.

665
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,095
Speaker 0: No it isn't, but I said those like that whole Cartoons like that.

666
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:34,510
Speaker 0: They got into weird eras, but Looney Tunes is pretty consistent and the early.

667
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:42,410
Speaker 1: There are some Looney Tunes that are not as good But you know most and some of them repeat the same jokes and you would totally see they repeated the same joke, right?

668
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know the good ones were beyond good, you know.

669
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:52,716
Speaker 0: But it was mostly that the production values were way high because those things are Ancients.

670
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,350
Speaker 0: they were made for theaters.

671
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,021
Speaker 1: That was that's the one thing that like get.

672
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,073
Speaker 1: that was the reason that they were able to be on TV right for all.

673
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:09,606
Speaker 1: that time is because if you looked and it always confused the hell out of me because I was like Weren't these things made it like the 40s or even older than that and these are really old right.

674
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,990
Speaker 1: but that you look at them They look way better than any cartoon.

675
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:18,554
Speaker 1: Then you look at like Scooby-doo from the 60s or 70s and you're like Why is this Scooby-doo?

676
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:23,410
Speaker 1: look like shit and Don this Donald Duck cartoon from a hundred years ago looks amazing, right?

677
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,169
Speaker 1: Because these things are made for movie theaters.

678
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:26,933
Speaker 1: I these are.

679
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:36,230
Speaker 1: this is film right and then they were just put on TV later, you know Some of them were made for TV later years, you know, but well, they're all great.

680
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:41,550
Speaker 0: There are those weird really like they would make movie compilations of cartoons.

681
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:48,195
Speaker 0: There were all kinds of different formats but Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales ones Yeah, but awful.

682
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:56,110
Speaker 1: a good number of them were actually, you know made for theaters And they ran in front of actual movies.

683
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:02,722
Speaker 1: You would go to the theater to see an actual movie and before the actual movie started you would see a Looney Tune And then the movie would start right.

684
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:11,510
Speaker 1: and nowadays They only really do that if you go to see something like Space Jam, right where there's a loop a Looney Tunes stick going on.

685
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:21,829
Speaker 1: And actually if I made movies I kind of want to make movies for Warner Brothers just so I could Get them to make a Looney Tune in front of every movie I make no matter what movie.

686
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:31,487
Speaker 1: it is Not that I'm ever gonna make a movie But I really think they need to bring that back where every movie you watch as a serial before it or something before it You know, that's we got to bring that back in a big way.

687
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:31,910
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

688
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:45,760
Speaker 1: So, yeah Looney Tunes is wicked awesome and it's sad that is not really like from what I don't watch TV obviously But I'm pretty sure they're not really on TV anymore Like you have to watch like the boomerang channel to see them.

689
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,070
Speaker 1: I mean even then I don't know how much they're on there.

690
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,794
Speaker 0: Here's my question.

691
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:51,470
Speaker 0: Is that really true or do we just not watch TV?

692
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,392
Speaker 1: I'm pretty.

693
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:58,310
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that they're not on TV like every single day like they were when we were kids.

694
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,284
Speaker 0: You know it well, some of them are not on TV because they're little.

695
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,070
Speaker 1: that was also upsetting.

696
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,219
Speaker 1: It's like at some point during our childhoods.

697
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,308
Speaker 1: They took off like speedy Gonzales disappeared.

698
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:13,022
Speaker 0: granted I watched some speedy Gonzales again and and Bosco disappeared pretty racist.

699
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:17,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it you know, I mean, it's not bad It's just you know, right?

700
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:24,950
Speaker 0: Well, it's it's bad for what it is But at the same time you don't ban the old works just because the world sucked back then.

701
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,180
Speaker 0: I know right just present them with context.

702
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,330
Speaker 1: It's like Nazi Disney, right?

703
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,842
Speaker 1: You know why you banning that shit or song of the south?

704
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:33,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

705
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,110
Speaker 1: That's the best example.

706
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,858
Speaker 0: That is a really racist movie.

707
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:38,265
Speaker 1: song of the south is awesome though.

708
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:42,790
Speaker 0: It is a good movie All right, at least I. I have not seen it since I was a very young child.

709
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,828
Speaker 1: Yeah I think you have to take the same approach that you take with the Tezuka's and all that kind of stuff.

710
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:54,050
Speaker 1: even Tintin right a lot, you know gives me Tezuka wasn't racist, but some of his depictions were racist depictions.

711
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:05,450
Speaker 1: But that's just was the style of the times and they put a note in front of all the his manga that have that You know some bad stylings in it Like look as it goes the exact opposite of racist, but that was the style of the time.

712
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:09,830
Speaker 1: We're not gonna edit it, you know, but you know, why would should we hide history?

713
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:20,870
Speaker 1: We in fact, that would be a disservice, you know We need to look at the racism of the past and that is how we know not to make that mistake again If we just wipe it off the head of history, that's even worse.

714
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:26,150
Speaker 1: Right then, you know making it prominent like look at the horrible racism of the past.

715
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,059
Speaker 1: You need to remember that the world was that way.

716
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,265
Speaker 1: so we don't go back to that way.

717
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,310
Speaker 1: if we just erase it.

718
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,730
Speaker 1: It's like that that's that's not a good idea.

719
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:37,290
Speaker 1: And the thing is even in cases like Tintin right where you know.

720
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:43,990
Speaker 1: There's actually probably a reason to believe least some reasons to believe that you know her gay was actually kind of racist.

721
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:48,848
Speaker 1: You know unlike Tezuka, you still shouldn't be censoring it, you know.

722
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:54,190
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I think that you should still have Speedy Gonzalez, even though he is racist.

723
00:43:54,551 --> 00:44:00,590
Speaker 0: Actually, I think one of my favorite ones overall as an adult and looking back is the kill the web killed.

724
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:02,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean all day.

725
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:13,024
Speaker 1: there were certain ones that were just you know Like the the ones that you could tell they put like the extra double effort into right the ones that stood out Right, you know like the opera one.

726
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:18,829
Speaker 1: I forget the name of it You know cuz it's got like and you could tell they were even better animated since some of the other ones, right?

727
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:27,653
Speaker 1: Well, how about the one with with Porky and Daffy in the hotel and the hotel guy who wants to Is Right or the bad?

728
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:32,406
Speaker 0: as a kid that one kind of scared me because it was weird and like.

729
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:38,628
Speaker 0: I was unnerved because a Lot of the things you wouldn't let him leave the hotel until they pay and a lot of the things that happen like.

730
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:51,821
Speaker 0: it's interesting watching old cartoons like that or like the ones that are set on farms where they kind of assume a lot of knowledge in the viewers about farm life or About the way the world worked back then.

731
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:53,690
Speaker 0: that just doesn't apply at all anymore.

732
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:54,513
Speaker 1: I mean some.

733
00:44:54,574 --> 00:44:58,370
Speaker 0: it's like it's weird because on the one hand that hotel manager scared the crap out of me when I was.

734
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the Looney Tunes stand up so well because they are timeless, right?

735
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:07,850
Speaker 1: But But some of them actually are not timeless.

736
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:17,465
Speaker 1: Right, like a lot of them will make jokes about famous people from a zillion years ago the same time I get the jokes, but a lot of people don't at the same time.

737
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:18,630
Speaker 0: Look at a lot of those old cartoons.

738
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:27,462
Speaker 0: It wasn't until Brett like in the last several years that I actually learned who Peter Laurie was But I recognized Peter Laurie through most of my life because he was.

739
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:30,150
Speaker 0: it was that face and that voice in the cartoons.

740
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean there were.

741
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:37,814
Speaker 0: I mean how many kids even when we were kids knew who Groucho Marx was and yet they found Bugs Bunny hilarious.

742
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:41,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are thousands of graduate marks references in there like all the time.

743
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:47,319
Speaker 0: Right also know how Bugs Bunny was kind of Metrosexual little weird and a jerk.

744
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,270
Speaker 1: Yeah cross-dresser, you know, but the thing is Bugs Bunny.

745
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,730
Speaker 1: I don't know how he became like the pride like the primary guy, right?

746
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,550
Speaker 1: It's like you look at Disney and Mickey Mouse is the number one guy.

747
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,792
Speaker 1: But you know how he became the number one guy is because he was the first guy not because they used him a lot or Anything like that.

748
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:05,358
Speaker 1: It's cuz he was the first guy right.

749
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,990
Speaker 1: they say, you know, I mean you look at like Marvel Comics, right?

750
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,615
Speaker 1: Why is spider-man the guy?

751
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,530
Speaker 1: it's actually Fantastic Four was the first guys, right?

752
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:20,090
Speaker 1: Spider-man was after that but it was you know, spider-man was the one that was the huge hit, right?

753
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,094
Speaker 1: But it's like was big.

754
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:22,463
Speaker 1: was Bugs Bunny the first?

755
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:23,710
Speaker 0: yeah, not really.

756
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,474
Speaker 1: No, there was.

757
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:25,137
Speaker 1: there were there were.

758
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,710
Speaker 1: they were making cartoons before they came out there making cartoons.

759
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,529
Speaker 0: But I thought we were just talking about Looney Tunes.

760
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:31,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were cart there were not.

761
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:35,450
Speaker 1: there were Looney Tunes with other non Bugs Bunny characters before Bosco.

762
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though you know, there are other ones right?

763
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:38,622
Speaker 1: He was not the first.

764
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,590
Speaker 1: very first one was not Bugs Bunny, right?

765
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,354
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that.

766
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:45,715
Speaker 1: and on top of that was Bugs Bunny really the big hit I think.

767
00:46:45,775 --> 00:46:47,485
Speaker 1: so cuz I mean if he was the hit.

768
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:50,036
Speaker 1: I'm like wow, you know Cuz he was the hit with another generation right?

769
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,370
Speaker 1: not our generation cuz I. Bugs Bunny was not my favorite guy.

770
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:54,638
Speaker 0: Who's your favorite guy?

771
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,330
Speaker 1: There was Daffy Duck my favorite guy.

772
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:57,876
Speaker 0: I really liked Daffy Duck cuz.

773
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:03,979
Speaker 0: he was such a just a goddamn asshole But he wasn't funny about it likes Bugs Bunny.

774
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,710
Speaker 0: He was just a jerk, but he was also crazy.

775
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,218
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the thing was right is like.

776
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,890
Speaker 0: it's kind of like an early rendition of Lewis Black in duck form.

777
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:23,383
Speaker 1: I don't know in terms of like, you know the coolness of the characters Right, like Marvin the Martian is like a cool character like, you know design and such.

778
00:47:23,744 --> 00:47:30,666
Speaker 1: but in terms of like the cartoon Like if you took all of the cartoons involve it, you know and averaged them together.

779
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:31,890
Speaker 1: I like the Roadrunner ones.

780
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:32,895
Speaker 1: It was always.

781
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,248
Speaker 1: it was like above average every time.

782
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:37,222
Speaker 1: you know Some of the other ones like a porky pig.

783
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:37,685
Speaker 1: It could be up.

784
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:38,330
Speaker 1: It could be down.

785
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,950
Speaker 1: Right, some of them were better than others, but any Roadrunner is like solid, you know.

786
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:45,784
Speaker 0: There were later Roadrunners that were actually pretty crappy.

787
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:46,266
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

788
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:46,487
Speaker 1: Like Lee?

789
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:47,070
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

790
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,577
Speaker 1: They're all the same joke every time.

791
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:50,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they started moving like when they started.

792
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,494
Speaker 0: they could like the Wile E. Coyote would talk.

793
00:47:53,734 --> 00:48:01,158
Speaker 0: that was only one episode retalked and I remember I never found the ones between Wile E. Coyote and the Sheepdog to be that funny.

794
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:03,230
Speaker 1: No, the Sheepdog one were not good.

795
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,496
Speaker 1: I'm only talking about the Roadrunner one.

796
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,085
Speaker 0: Okay, so just the Roadrunner.

797
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:06,507
Speaker 0: Yeah.

798
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:07,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, then we're good.

799
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:12,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually have this like five foot tall stuffed Wile E. Coyote from like the 50s.

800
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:12,810
Speaker 0: That was my dad's.

801
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:13,331
Speaker 1: Oh really?

802
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:14,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the what, you know, which I?

803
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,482
Speaker 1: so which one did you like?

804
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:21,110
Speaker 1: you really did not like and do not want Did not like and did not want.

805
00:48:21,552 --> 00:48:29,759
Speaker 0: There were the ones that were on TV all the time that as much as I liked them I just didn't want to watch them again Which usually was the Wile E. Coyote Roadrunner ones.

806
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:30,281
Speaker 0: Really?

807
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:37,590
Speaker 0: Like they were just always beyond and I'd seen like I'd seen The one where Bugs Bunny just tortures that opera singer like a hundred times.

808
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,684
Speaker 0: It was great, but I'd seen the Roadrunner ones like a million times.

809
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,410
Speaker 1: The ones that I don't like are the What's the stupid rooster's name?

810
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:46,531
Speaker 0: Really?

811
00:48:46,612 --> 00:48:47,355
Speaker 0: Foghorn Leghorn?

812
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:48,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like Foghorn Leghorn.

813
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,383
Speaker 1: I love him.

814
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:50,126
Speaker 1: Those are great.

815
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:51,110
Speaker 0: And the Chickenhawk?

816
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,278
Speaker 1: I mean some of the Foghorn Leghorn ones.

817
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:54,181
Speaker 0: Now the thing is the thing.

818
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,306
Speaker 0: and now see him.

819
00:48:55,386 --> 00:48:56,310
Speaker 0: Now see him.

820
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,970
Speaker 1: The ones where he tortures the dog, right?

821
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,686
Speaker 1: It was like the joke where he like would trick the dog into bumping into the fence.

822
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:03,410
Speaker 1: That was good.

823
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:07,583
Speaker 1: But like I when he was talking it's just like oh god, shut up.

824
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:08,787
Speaker 1: I can't stand him.

825
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:09,710
Speaker 1: No, he's no good.

826
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:10,492
Speaker 0: It was a good joke.

827
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:11,213
Speaker 0: It was a good shtick.

828
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:16,999
Speaker 1: No, and actually some of the ones that I did like were the Yosemite Sam on the boat with the.

829
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,814
Speaker 1: oh, man, they made the powder room joke No, I think.

830
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:22,370
Speaker 1: and then also the foreign legion joke.

831
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:32,970
Speaker 0: I think most people have not seen those as they were originally made Because a lot of those were added into those shitty compilation movies like Donald Duck and Speedy Gonzalez.

832
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:44,114
Speaker 1: Yeah It was actually weird right because like to actually see the Yosemite Sam on the boat or Yosemite Sam in the foreign Legion the only place I or like even some of the Tasmanian devil ones right.

833
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:50,170
Speaker 1: the only time I ever saw those was on the ABC Saturday morning, you know, like those ones, right?

834
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,897
Speaker 1: I never saw those on Nickelodeon.

835
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,745
Speaker 1: They might have been on there at some point, but I never saw.

836
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:56,879
Speaker 1: I don't remember seeing them Nickelodeon or on Cartoon Network.

837
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:58,550
Speaker 1: I only saw them on ABC Saturday morning.

838
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:09,167
Speaker 1: So it's like they were special like higher production cost ones Or something like that or newer or I don't know why they were only on that channel But at least in my day they were only on that channel.

839
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you can you think of any others that we may have neglected?

840
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:16,350
Speaker 0: I mean I can think of all a million.

841
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,170
Speaker 0: I think it's more I don't know.

842
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:27,791
Speaker 0: I feel I really have this urge to watch not just Looney Tunes but like the old Disney like Donald Duck's and Chip and Dale All that kind of old and Seen.

843
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:31,100
Speaker 1: well, I think you know, they're just first overall Donald Duck wins a car.

844
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:33,506
Speaker 1: They're just not as good as Looney Tunes.

845
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:35,692
Speaker 0: I Disagree.

846
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:39,905
Speaker 0: Donald Duck once made Huey Dewey and Louie's smoked cigars until they almost died.

847
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:40,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

848
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:41,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was hilarious.

849
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:44,324
Speaker 1: it's not as it's not as you know, they're not as good.

850
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:46,993
Speaker 1: first of all, right and You know.

851
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:50,850
Speaker 1: the the other thing with them is that you know, they weren't they didn't have the same.

852
00:50:51,473 --> 00:50:56,994
Speaker 1: You know, the production values were not quite as high and They were also.

853
00:50:57,014 --> 00:51:00,930
Speaker 1: a lot of them were made for like, you know to buy on home video like the goofy sports.

854
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,437
Speaker 1: It's like buy this on VHS.

855
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:04,065
Speaker 0: It's like the goofy sports.

856
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:08,103
Speaker 1: However, we're brilliant Yeah, and they're alright, but it's like nobody bought those on VHS.

857
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:09,369
Speaker 1: I did you only you.

858
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had them all in those huge like old-school clay.

859
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:20,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, those big plastic clamshell things Nobody, you know, so they had a lot less reach than the.

860
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,750
Speaker 1: the Looney Tunes are just on all the time.

861
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:23,172
Speaker 1: You know.

862
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:28,849
Speaker 1: and the Looney Tunes really the thing about it having something that's good That's on all the time.

863
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:33,710
Speaker 1: They just everyone watches without sort of realizing that they're a fan of it because it's not their focus.

864
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:39,410
Speaker 1: I think really helps to bring people together, you know more so than an individual thing.

865
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,470
Speaker 0: That's very popular among pop culture people.

866
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:47,750
Speaker 0: I mean American Idol is stupidly popular, but if you don't care about stupid things, you're not connected to that at all.

867
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:54,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but having something that just everyone watches that's below the radar, but it's just you know pervasive, right?

868
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,500
Speaker 1: It's like, you know very for a long time.

869
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,770
Speaker 0: The Simpsons was like that exactly, right?

870
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:03,409
Speaker 1: It's like, you know that it brings people together much better than you know.

871
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:07,790
Speaker 1: Anything that's stupidly popular is going to be divisive actually, right?

872
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:16,229
Speaker 1: You know, it's gonna be like if you try talking about it Someone's either gonna be your best friend or they're gonna be your worst enemy, but Looney Tunes Everyone is just gonna be your regular friend.

873
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:25,189
Speaker 1: Those are is only a very few people who are that crazy.

874
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:30,635
Speaker 1: Right because by the at the point we are now right because remember think about it Looney Tunes is so old.

875
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:34,410
Speaker 1: even old people watched it even the old people grew up.

876
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,886
Speaker 0: I actually never liked speedy Gonzales, really?

877
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:39,890
Speaker 0: I just didn't find him funny.

878
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:42,727
Speaker 1: I mean, he wasn't as funny as the other ones, but he was.

879
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:43,190
Speaker 1: he was alright.

880
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:49,310
Speaker 0: But my favorite episode ever other than him torturing the opera guy and I just suddenly remembered it like out of nowhere.

881
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,454
Speaker 0: This is one of those for the brain.

882
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:51,739
Speaker 0: like suddenly found a reference.

883
00:52:52,020 --> 00:53:01,670
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm was haha turn duck, Perry Actually, you know what I never understood.

884
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,041
Speaker 1: Sylvester and Tweety really really most of them.

885
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,155
Speaker 1: I mean they were just sort of average always, you know That was never really like.

886
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:08,658
Speaker 1: oh, yeah.

887
00:53:08,678 --> 00:53:09,724
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, okay.

888
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:10,750
Speaker 1: Why didn't Roadrunner come on?

889
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:17,430
Speaker 1: And it seemed like there were just so many of them, you know, like it would always be semester

890
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:29,129
Speaker 0: I always saw the same one over and over again and it was all word that we're Sylvester and Tweety and the dog are all in the hospital with broken legs and the ladies trying to Take care of them and they keep trying to like kill each other from each other's beds.

891
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:34,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's also because that one was part of one of those stupid compilation movies and it was always on.

892
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was an okay one.

893
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:36,540
Speaker 1: But I mean there was the.

894
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,283
Speaker 0: it's about that.

895
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:38,910
Speaker 0: They're trying to murder each other.

896
00:53:39,312 --> 00:53:40,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hospital.

897
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:44,769
Speaker 1: but there was some other ones that would be like, you know It'd be the same thing every time just in a day.

898
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,612
Speaker 1: It was like, okay now we're in the house in the winter and To eat.

899
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:49,279
Speaker 1: he's in the birdcage the best to try to eat him.

900
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,424
Speaker 1: and now we're in the house in the suburbs and now we're In that different house and now the dog is there but now the dog isn't there.

901
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:57,010
Speaker 1: and now there's a mouse involved.

902
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:58,188
Speaker 1: It was just the same.

903
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,930
Speaker 1: You know, I was not, you know on with that.

904
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,203
Speaker 0: I just I always wanted Sylvester to win because I didn't like Tweety.

905
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:06,830
Speaker 1: That's another thing, right?

906
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:11,606
Speaker 1: It's like you actually look at it and it's like, you know, it's Elmer Fudd really a bad guy.

907
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,774
Speaker 1: He's just a hunter He's just hunting.

908
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:15,039
Speaker 1: He's not any worse than any other hunter.

909
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,943
Speaker 1: He's kind of dopey.

910
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,469
Speaker 1: He's dopey but Bugs Bunny He was actually a jerk, right?

911
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:24,130
Speaker 0: See at least Bugs Bunny I can understand why he'd be a jerk to Elmer Fudd because Elmer Fudd is trying to kill him.

912
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:29,750
Speaker 0: Sometimes that opera episode Bugs Bunny is just like he basically tortures that guy to insanity.

913
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:38,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like sometimes he's trying to kill him But even then sometimes Bugs Bunny starts getting his revenge even before he's trying to kill him.

914
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:42,410
Speaker 1: You know or he'll like, you know, plus that gun never killed anyone.

915
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,350
Speaker 1: It just makes you look like, you know, you got exploded or whatever.

916
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:49,530
Speaker 1: So it's like you're basically just forcing the other guy to get shot with it.

917
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:58,419
Speaker 1: You know, some of it actually was just sort of cruel and I guess, you know, the ones that like the you know I the one I like the most the mafia one.

918
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:03,254
Speaker 1: It was actually like look these are bad mafia guys You know, it was actually.

919
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:07,730
Speaker 1: there wasn't really any cruelty and he he got them in a very clever way.

920
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:08,817
Speaker 1: Well, like Wile E.

921
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:10,449
Speaker 0: Coyote, who are you really rooting for?

922
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,798
Speaker 0: You wanted him to get the stupid Roadrunner.

923
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:14,521
Speaker 1: He was hungry.

924
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the Roadrunner was just a bird It wasn't?

925
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:19,410
Speaker 1: you know that ran around really fast.

926
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:24,124
Speaker 1: It's like wow, if you can catch that fucking thing Look how fast things go.

927
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:28,275
Speaker 0: I think we're done here.

928
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:37,630
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the only moral of this episode is that if you haven't actually seen Yeah, if you're if you're younger than us that means that you know and you you know.

929
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:42,586
Speaker 1: Or maybe it means either a you don't really watch TV because TV the days of TV are over.

930
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:51,129
Speaker 1: or be Looney Tunes Just weren't pervasive throughout all you know People as they were in our day or the days before us.

931
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:55,470
Speaker 1: But it's like I feel like we should keep that thing alive because we can keep that going.

932
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,739
Speaker 1: That's even older than the Simpsons right?

933
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:59,506
Speaker 1: This is decades and decades old.

934
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,880
Speaker 0: The Simpsons is only That it's older than the Simpsons.

935
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,930
Speaker 1: It's like three or four times older than the Simpsons, right?

936
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:18,300
Speaker 1: So and it's all on pirate bay Yeah, if we can keep it going right and make sure that it's in everyone's consciousness, you know It's it's in everyone's brain somewhere that can be.

937
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:26,770
Speaker 1: you know, just what we need there always has to be something It doesn't matter if it's Looney Tunes or something else that everyone has in their culture that what if it was the belief in?

938
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,839
Speaker 0: Rationality in the than the beauty of science.

939
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,010
Speaker 1: That would be good - that'd be good - good luck with that.

940
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:32,929
Speaker 1: That's a lot newer than Looney Tunes.
