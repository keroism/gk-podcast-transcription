1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,507
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 9th.

2
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:12,471
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,213
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:14,939
Speaker 0: This is geek nights.

5
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:19,419
Speaker 0: Tonight we teach you all about the domain name service.

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:22,858
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,180
Speaker 1: So I've been slowly putting together a new computer bit by bit.

8
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:38,884
Speaker 1: I've mentioned it briefly every now and again And I've watched the price come down from two thousand dollars to about a thousand dollars over the last few months for effectively the same If not more powerful computer.

9
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:46,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we pretty much just need something that can run the hotness games Encode the podcast faster.

10
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:53,080
Speaker 1: well most important I need a very powerful machine with a lot of RAM so I can do a lot of audio editing in real-time real quickly.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,090
Speaker 1: So I can experiment around a lot plus.

12
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:56,759
Speaker 1: I want to have a fast computer.

13
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:05,871
Speaker 1: Despite all the years I've had computers I've only owned four total because I keep one forever And then I eventually it dies.

14
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:11,060
Speaker 1: I spent a ton of money to get another one That's super powerful, and then eventually it dies years and years and years later.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,577
Speaker 1: But the thing is I've been leaning surprisingly toward Intel and a core to duo.

16
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:21,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know It's like if you asked me a year or two ago.

17
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:22,800
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even thought of Intel.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,439
Speaker 0: I'd be like Intel.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,360
Speaker 0: Why would you buy one of those because you know a penny in four days a penny in four is a crap food well?

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,340
Speaker 1: And before then you could buy an AMD chip for 200 bucks or get an Intel chip.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,106
Speaker 1: It was the same speed for like 800 bucks.

22
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:39,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous, but now these core two duos, man They are the hotness.

23
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:40,251
Speaker 0: They're incredibly hot.

24
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:41,215
Speaker 0: I wouldn't work.

25
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,743
Speaker 1: god damn They're slight.

26
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:46,420
Speaker 1: they were still slightly more expensive than the AMD's, but they performed a lot better.

27
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,040
Speaker 1: They were generally better architecture.

28
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:55,686
Speaker 1: I thought all right I'm going Intel and I've been watching Intel and making Intel systems with core two duos And I just picked out that all.

29
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,689
Speaker 1: everything was all said.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,302
Speaker 1: I was gonna get the e6 600 core to duo and everything was gonna Be awesome Today.

31
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:08,555
Speaker 1: today AMD announced like 50% price cuts across most of their line now.

32
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:16,517
Speaker 1: I can get the highest-end Athlon 64 x2 for like a hundred dollars less than the core to do.

33
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:17,279
Speaker 1: I was looking at.

34
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:21,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now I'm looking at AMD motherboards.

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,280
Speaker 0: That's fine because the Andy motherboards are actually a lot nicer than the Intel motherboards And they're also friendlier to people building computers.

36
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:32,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, well unless you spend 300 bucks to get those awesome 8-bit Intel motherboards.

37
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:34,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, those things though.

38
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:35,860
Speaker 0: They're just out of control.

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,161
Speaker 0: I don't.

40
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,667
Speaker 0: it's like too much thing is now.

41
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 1: I gotta hold out cuz April 22nd when Intel drops their prices.

42
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just don't think they're gonna drop them enough.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,201
Speaker 1: I don't think they're gonna drop the price of the core 2 by 50%.

44
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:51,840
Speaker 0: I'm still dealing with one new computer and sitting on my lap, so it's gonna be a while before I buy another new computer.

45
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,119
Speaker 1: I'm really looking forward to this.

46
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:54,045
Speaker 1: I mean I've been.

47
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:59,190
Speaker 1: I got a touch of it when I got Jameson here And I started doing that new computer thing to it.

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,033
Speaker 0: Yes, okay.

49
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:00,636
Speaker 0: That's a $20 computer.

50
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:05,211
Speaker 0: He's saying the $20 computer is better than yours actually.

51
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:16,227
Speaker 1: It's not despite the fact that the processor is About 70% faster and better architecture than my current main computer Because of the motherboard.

52
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:16,648
Speaker 1: $20.

53
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,112
Speaker 0: well one.

54
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,776
Speaker 1: It's a crap motherboard.

55
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:20,357
Speaker 1: It's the worst.

56
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:21,440
Speaker 1: It's $20.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,185
Speaker 0: What do you expect?

58
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,031
Speaker 0: all right you get.

59
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,440
Speaker 0: so you should be happy it works.

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,579
Speaker 1: That's a miracle in it aside from the fact that the video barely works.

61
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,525
Speaker 1: Thus the onboard sound.

62
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:35,380
Speaker 1: if the processor gets taxed at all I can hear it making noise in the sound card.

63
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,598
Speaker 0: It's just so awesome.

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,537
Speaker 1: But despite the fact that this computer is so much faster than my current computer one.

65
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:49,434
Speaker 1: this thing's running Ubuntu Which while the great is not the most optimized Linux to $20 motherboard.

66
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:53,519
Speaker 1: so my old Thunderbird gigahertz Run circles around this thing.

67
00:03:54,173 --> 00:04:02,145
Speaker 1: Yeah Gen 2 is pretty awesome despite the fact that this is a gen 2 that has not been updated in any way in About a year.

68
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,700
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm running an old-ass Firefox.

69
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:12,720
Speaker 1: I type to merge and it didn't just say oh you got to update your profile Blinking red text and it basically said what the fuck are you trying to do?

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,879
Speaker 0: That's what happens on the hosting if I try to do that.

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,298
Speaker 0: So I Usually make lunch at work.

72
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:24,871
Speaker 0: You know I buy I bring a loaf of bread and the peanut butter and a jelly to work And I have one knife at work that I wash.

73
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,620
Speaker 1: It's peanut butter jelly time.

74
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:33,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right peanut butter and it's really economical because I get a lot of lunch because two sandwiches pretty filling.

75
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:34,666
Speaker 0: It's real easy.

76
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,393
Speaker 0: I don't have to leave work and waste time.

77
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:46,269
Speaker 0: I can leave work slightly earlier and no one complains because I sat there all day, and it's really cheap because a loaf of bread is like two bucks and A peanut butter and jelly.

78
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,835
Speaker 0: you buy it once at last week's.

79
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:52,051
Speaker 1: see I try that but one No number of peanut butter and jellies will save me.

80
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:54,460
Speaker 0: I can be sated by two peanut butter and jellies.

81
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:54,966
Speaker 1: I can't.

82
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,120
Speaker 1: I just can't do it.

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,806
Speaker 1: So I always buy some ham or some turkey or something some sort of meat And then I need some other stuff.

84
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:06,539
Speaker 1: because just a sandwich like two pieces of bread and a piece of ham After a couple days at that that's really gonna get to you.

85
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I buy different kinds of meat then I don't save any money.

86
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,159
Speaker 1: I might as well eat out every day.

87
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:18,394
Speaker 0: So today, you know I knew I was out of bread at work and I didn't have a loaf of bread to bring to work.

88
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:26,677
Speaker 0: and when I Looked around near work for a place to buy a loaf of bread, and I couldn't I didn't look very hard But I couldn't find one in my cursory search.

89
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,114
Speaker 1: well Yeah, contrary to popular block radius there are grocery stores in New York City.

90
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:31,555
Speaker 0: There are.

91
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:36,431
Speaker 0: they're just you know not Obvious, they're not like super stop and shops or Wegmans or anything.

92
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:36,872
Speaker 1: well.

93
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:39,020
Speaker 1: They're also not right next to the area you work.

94
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:39,962
Speaker 0: That's correct.

95
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:47,338
Speaker 0: It's just clothing stores there, so it was very lucky that Emily randomly called me and said hey Do you want to go get lunch and I was like yes?

96
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:56,851
Speaker 0: So we just started walking you know randomly Towards the Chinatown area looking for a place to eat whatever.

97
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:04,238
Speaker 0: and she said first we passed by this place that sold Candy, and it was all sorts of Asian candies, and you just shoveled them.

98
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:07,471
Speaker 1: ah I really like Asian games, so it was.

99
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:08,254
Speaker 0: I went in there.

100
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,380
Speaker 0: the place is called.

101
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:22,159
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the bag hold on aji Ichiban And I went in there And I looked at the candy and they had some dried fruits And you know usual stuff, and then I see the marshmallows that are filled with gummy.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,803
Speaker 1: Marshmallows that are filled with gummy are Amazing.

103
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,294
Speaker 1: these are almost better than a koala.

104
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if you ever seen these things.

105
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,846
Speaker 0: It's basically it's.

106
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:49,560
Speaker 0: it's a. it's like a white powdery Disc that's about an inch in diameter Maybe a little over an inch in diameter, and it's squishy and inside of it It's made of marshmallow, but the middle of it has a gummy Artificial fruit flavor stuff in it and it's individually wrapped, and they had every flavor of this stuff.

107
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:57,480
Speaker 0: I had only thought there was a strawberry flavor So I shoveled strawberry and apple and I didn't want to shovel anymore because that would have been too much and that cost me like.

108
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,760
Speaker 0: Then we kept walking looking for a place to eat and Emily said there was a place that had dumplings on the cheap.

109
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,407
Speaker 0: But she didn't see it.

110
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:06,994
Speaker 0: We only we saw it on the way back.

111
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:07,316
Speaker 0: You're like.

112
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:07,918
Speaker 0: Oh there.

113
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:08,200
Speaker 0: It is.

114
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's got to really suck.

115
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,880
Speaker 1: you like you want to eat a dumpling and you can't find the this place.

116
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,558
Speaker 0: She said for like a dollar you can get a bunch of dumplings.

117
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:16,899
Speaker 1: god I gotta go there get some time.

118
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,752
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go there probably with some co-workers if I get a chance.

119
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,380
Speaker 0: I feel like hey, let's go to the dumpling house.

120
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:27,548
Speaker 0: Anyway instead we went to this random Chinese Lunch bakery type place.

121
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:34,992
Speaker 0: I got a pork bun, and I got this like Danish Roll twisty kind of bun with a hot dog in it.

122
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:35,915
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

123
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:36,939
Speaker 0: They were a dollar each.

124
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:42,283
Speaker 0: It was real cheap, and then we walked outside, and there was this place I saw.

125
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,569
Speaker 0: you know what this place is called.

126
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,453
Speaker 1: What was it called?

127
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:45,960
Speaker 0: egg custard King?

128
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,176
Speaker 1: That's not a good all right.

129
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:55,560
Speaker 1: So way back at RIT none of us well these most of us had never been to a dim sum breakfast a Chinese breakfast.

130
00:07:56,283 --> 00:08:12,860
Speaker 1: We're basically people will come by and they've got a cart full of stuff And you point at little tiny servings of various things And they just put them on the table and you just keep doing this until you're full and they'll be like little Dumpling thing with red bean paste in it or some tripe for all these little things, and they're all awesome.

131
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,012
Speaker 1: We need to ever try.

132
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,179
Speaker 1: I Do not hate trife.

133
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:19,329
Speaker 0: You don't get it on purpose.

134
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:42,412
Speaker 1: I will not go out of my way to ingest right Unlike cat who can eat like four pounds of it despite the fact that she's Anyway, and one of the things that they will have called an egg custard, and it's a little tiny pastry And it's basically just a little like pie crust shell and inside of it is a custard made from effectively egg yolk Yep, and not a lot else as far as I can tell.

135
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:50,060
Speaker 1: nope there are about 5,000 calories each And They're delectable yes.

136
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,404
Speaker 0: So I went in.

137
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,307
Speaker 0: we went in to the.

138
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:56,463
Speaker 0: we were hesitant to actually go into the custard King like after we went ate at the bakery.

139
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,639
Speaker 0: we walked over there and looked at the custard King and we were like That's dangerous.

140
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,474
Speaker 1: Our friend Luke almost ate my hand trying to get half of an egg custard.

141
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:13,007
Speaker 0: so I went in to the custard King The egg custard King and I saw egg custards and many Among other things.

142
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,932
Speaker 0: but not only do they have plain egg custards They had quite a few different flavors of egg custard.

143
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,859
Speaker 1: What flavor could you have other than egg?

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,567
Speaker 0: Well egg custards were 75 cents each.

145
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:23,969
Speaker 0: They had.

146
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,193
Speaker 0: ah they had egg.

147
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:28,323
Speaker 0: they had Strawberry.

148
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:32,316
Speaker 0: I forget the other flavors, but I strawberry egg, but I had honeydew.

149
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:33,098
Speaker 0: honeydew.

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,126
Speaker 0: I had a honeydew egg custard.

151
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,913
Speaker 1: you had a money melon egg custard.

152
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:37,516
Speaker 0: That's right.

153
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:43,624
Speaker 1: I Imagine because any five said because you're talking about this that it was as good as I could imagine It was.

154
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:51,820
Speaker 0: it was basically you bit into it And it tasted like well crust and then it tasted like egg custard and then it tasted like I guess honeydew.

155
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:54,490
Speaker 1: We should probably do a show on all these Asian foods.

156
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,059
Speaker 0: We like I don't know we do too many food shows.

157
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,127
Speaker 1: We actually we've held off on that for a while.

158
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:02,339
Speaker 0: I know but I feel bad doing food shows in a geek show.

159
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,470
Speaker 1: Hey, I think the worst was way back.

160
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,560
Speaker 1: We got our friend Adam on the show cuz he's really funny.

161
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,177
Speaker 1: We like having him on the show, but we didn't have a topic so we ended up talking about.

162
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,140
Speaker 0: that was your idea.

163
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,511
Speaker 0: I wanted to talk about something else.

164
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,759
Speaker 0: You didn't suggest anything I didn't have an idea, but I knew I didn't want that one.

165
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:22,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have to know what I want to know what I don't want And you know what I do want.

166
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,135
Speaker 0: I want egg custards anyway in the news.

167
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:26,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

168
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,632
Speaker 0: I'm looking for the bean curd King if anyone knows where bean curd King is.

169
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:33,592
Speaker 1: Ah, I Don't know what I like more red bean or black bean.

170
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:34,940
Speaker 0: I'm a red bean fan.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,517
Speaker 1: I think I'm more of a red bean fan, but I cannot deny the black bean is delectable.

172
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,065
Speaker 1: All right I said delectable twice.

173
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,151
Speaker 1: I feel like hedonism pot.

174
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:45,480
Speaker 0: Let's do the show anyway especially you hedonism bot.

175
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:50,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, so blu-ray and HD VD have one thing.

176
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:52,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that.

177
00:10:52,704 --> 00:11:00,204
Speaker 0: well, maybe I could say HD squared VD HD DVD.

178
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:04,219
Speaker 1: Well if I simplified further it would technically be HVD to the third.

179
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,310
Speaker 1: because But then again, is it HD - DVD?

180
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,900
Speaker 1: cuz then it's all sorts of pain in the ass.

181
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,769
Speaker 0: HD parenthesis D to the VD.

182
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:17,557
Speaker 1: I don't know D to the VD.

183
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:18,580
Speaker 1: the fuck did you get that?

184
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,058
Speaker 0: I was just making shit up.

185
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:25,420
Speaker 1: Anyway, one thing they share in common is the DRM in them.

186
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:34,020
Speaker 1: You might know how DVDs all have CSS and then the Linux community responded with D CSS that removed CSS and allowed you to watch DVDs.

187
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,689
Speaker 1: Yes I'm not gonna go into all the technical detail.

188
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 0: That's like we could do a whole show with the story of DC SS.

189
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:42,539
Speaker 1: But I'll put this in real simple terms.

190
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:50,089
Speaker 1: Win DVD is this garbage program that lets you watch DVDs on in windows Which I don't understand why.

191
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,260
Speaker 0: you know, you need like a special program.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,725
Speaker 0: Well, because watch DVDs.

193
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:58,040
Speaker 1: well because you can't have a program that decodes DVD without paying the license fee.

194
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,992
Speaker 1: That's why there were no technically windows media player.

195
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:01,273
Speaker 0: do it.

196
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:02,900
Speaker 1: No, cuz they didn't pay the license.

197
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:06,342
Speaker 1: I thought it could it might now but back in the day It didn't.

198
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:10,040
Speaker 0: because I guess I think if you have the windows media center you can do it.

199
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:13,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is way back in the day when win DVD was spawned.

200
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,500
Speaker 1: You couldn't play DVDs on a computer.

201
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:22,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had people had DVD roms But you couldn't actually watch DVDs if you put the DVD in the DVD.

202
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,740
Speaker 1: rightly because there was no soft.

203
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,410
Speaker 1: There was no soft and partly because computers weren't fast enough.

204
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could only use the DVD ROM to To get data off of D.

205
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:39,224
Speaker 1: I had a friend who had a hardware DVD decoder plugged into his video card with the special the only way Internal cable.

206
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:39,585
Speaker 0: Yep.

207
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:44,560
Speaker 0: That was the only way to watch DVDs on a computer originally was to have a DVD ROM.

208
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:53,060
Speaker 0: Connect the DVD ROM to a video card To an other card that connected to the video card with cables that were inside and all weird.

209
00:12:53,184 --> 00:13:01,443
Speaker 1: Well, no There was those other ones those horrible video cards where you had to have a VGA coming out of your video card Into this DVD thing and then out of the DV monitor.

210
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:16,636
Speaker 0: basically it was a card with a chip on it and all that chip did was take DVD data and MPEG-2 and convert it into something you could see that your monitor understands anyway Not go into technical detail even though I've already said that.

211
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:27,070
Speaker 1: Yep The DRM that is on these things is in win DVD 8 because otherwise win DVD 8 wouldn't be able to play HD DVD or blu-ray.

212
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,520
Speaker 0: of course win DVD paid to get that stuff right?

213
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:38,898
Speaker 1: well win DVD and on all appearances did not do their due diligence in protecting the Decryption method or the key or whatever they've got.

214
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,580
Speaker 0: So someone with a copy of win DVD busted it open and figured out how to break HD DVD.

215
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:50,560
Speaker 1: So it looks like someone started using this busted key to rip HD content and put it on bit torrent.

216
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:59,280
Speaker 1: And as far as I can read from this article It looks like the people responsible for a ACS encryption have revoked this key.

217
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:00,644
Speaker 1: And that is the news.

218
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:15,060
Speaker 1: ladies and gentlemen for you see if you have a DVD player that plays blu-ray or HD DVD and some hacker out there Compromises the key that your player uses your players just gonna stop working because they're gonna revoke the keys your player uses.

219
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:22,300
Speaker 0: yep, any new disc is gonna use a different key and It's actually to update your player to play those.

220
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,945
Speaker 1: it's actually more complicated than that.

221
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:32,100
Speaker 1: really new discs will it include in them a list of revoked keys and Fuck up any DVD player that they get put in?

222
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,140
Speaker 1: So it'll say by the way your keys revoked.

223
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:39,527
Speaker 1: So the only way to avoid getting your key revoked is to not ever buy a new HD.

224
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,098
Speaker 0: also give you a new key.

225
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:45,280
Speaker 0: Well see by default no, how do you get the new key?

226
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:48,280
Speaker 1: Well it depends on whether or not your player has a method.

227
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:54,666
Speaker 1: Maybe your manufacturer will be lucky or you'll be lucky and they'll send you a special DVD That'll patch it or something.

228
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:58,840
Speaker 1: or maybe because I know I think blu-ray players are mandated to have an Ethernet hole.

229
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:05,699
Speaker 0: Yeah I know that like the original HD DVD players were actually Linux computers that they would that Toshiba was giving.

230
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:11,790
Speaker 1: yeah But not all HD DVD players Apparently have to have this port.

231
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,722
Speaker 1: so there might be HD DVD players that aren't Updateable.

232
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:19,706
Speaker 1: and even then with the blu-ray you're gonna have to connect to the internet and do a bunch of stuff to make it Work again.

233
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:25,179
Speaker 1: Wow Luckily for people who use win DVD win DVD can just send out a patch.

234
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,606
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but this does not bode well for yon consumer.

235
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:38,720
Speaker 1: if you can have a piece of hardware that plays media and Based on the arbitrary actions of people you have nothing involved with that hardware could cease to function.

236
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,746
Speaker 1: awesome This is the first case of this.

237
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:46,500
Speaker 0: so or even worse you'll need an internet connection to watch DVDs.

238
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,298
Speaker 1: So of course the internet is all abuzz about it.

239
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:50,403
Speaker 1: I can't.

240
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:55,020
Speaker 1: I'll wait to see what the exact details are as to whether exactly what happened here.

241
00:15:55,583 --> 00:16:05,720
Speaker 1: I'm sure now if this is especially if this is a proof of concept We're gonna see a lot more of this because there's nothing hacker punk kids like more than causing problems like this for normal consumers

242
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:15,140
Speaker 0: You know, but really I have no sympathy because Cause the problems for themselves and people who buy their DRM products get what they deserve.

243
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:25,827
Speaker 1: Yeah The only reason I am NOT jumping on any sort of HD bandwagon is that every five minutes they change the standards or do whatever they can to DRM me a little bit more and it Costs a lot of money.

244
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:26,313
Speaker 0: and who cares?

245
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:32,600
Speaker 1: Yeah Granted it's almost to the point where it might be worth it if I had a bunch of money laying around and it weren't DRM.

246
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:44,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean just to make free up some room in the living room Yeah, and put a flat screen on the wall instead of yeah, so for anyone out there He uses instant messaging which should be most people.

247
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,966
Speaker 0: You might use aim.

248
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,271
Speaker 0: You might use ICQ.

249
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:48,772
Speaker 0: Who knows?

250
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:50,438
Speaker 1: if you're a loser you might use MSN.

251
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:52,745
Speaker 0: Who knows?

252
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:53,852
Speaker 0: I don't care what you use.

253
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:54,475
Speaker 1: if you're awesome.

254
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:55,200
Speaker 1: You probably use jabber.

255
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, only awesome people use jabber and all jabber users are awesome and Google Chat is basically just jabber.

256
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,888
Speaker 0: It's jabber powered by Google, which is fine.

257
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:09,449
Speaker 0: no matter what protocol you're using for instant messaging You probably have some client or another.

258
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:12,200
Speaker 0: maybe use the one that goes with your instant messenger.

259
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:19,898
Speaker 0: You might use the actual MSN client or you know, you maybe use the actual AOL AIM client Maybe use trillion or something like that.

260
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 0: Maybe you're like me and you use PSI or PSI or PSI or whatever you want to say it.

261
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,561
Speaker 0: I don't care.

262
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:29,916
Speaker 0: but a very popular one is the open-source gaim or game.

263
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:33,649
Speaker 1: However, you want to pronounce it It's pronounced gaim as far as I'm concerned game.

264
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:34,692
Speaker 1: people could die in a fire.

265
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:35,956
Speaker 0: I agree with rim.

266
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,059
Speaker 0: It is gaim.

267
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,467
Speaker 1: This game sounds lame.

268
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,290
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

269
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:52,700
Speaker 0: game sounds like something I play or talk about on Tuesdays anyway, anyway G aim is a very awesome client that I used to use but I don't use anymore only because it doesn't fully support jabber.

270
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,671
Speaker 0: And you'd think jabber is the open source protocol.

271
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,819
Speaker 0: It should support that one better than the other ones.

272
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:01,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, as far as I can tell the developers of GM is lazy.

273
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:02,697
Speaker 0: I think so.

274
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:04,846
Speaker 0: But GM is a pretty good.

275
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:10,084
Speaker 0: I am client if you're not using jabber and it allows you to sign into a whole bunch of Things at once.

276
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,993
Speaker 0: and they've been doing a lot of updates to it.

277
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:13,440
Speaker 1: Yeah tabs all sorts of fun.

278
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,685
Speaker 0: So it has some cool features.

279
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,378
Speaker 0: It's much better than using the standard AOL client.

280
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:17,880
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

281
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:26,555
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean pretty much if you're not using PSI or gaim or Adium I don't know what you're doing because there really aren't many better ones than those three.

282
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:27,980
Speaker 0: Oh me bow calm.

283
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,474
Speaker 1: Oh me bow calm.

284
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:36,900
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, gee aim originally was called GTK plus AOL instant messenger because all it was was an open source.

285
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:46,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, well instant messenger that ran and G used the GTK plus GUI live and apparently AOL said hey You can't have AOL instant messenger in the name of your product.

286
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:51,219
Speaker 0: Yep, so they changed the name to gee aim and AOL kind of laid off.

287
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:55,955
Speaker 0: But then later AOL started to harass them a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more.

288
00:18:55,975 --> 00:19:01,619
Speaker 0: and so finally Just now without telling anyone they decided on their own.

289
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:02,945
Speaker 0: Because they didn't.

290
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,417
Speaker 0: they weren't able to reveal the reason they were changing the name.

291
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:10,980
Speaker 1: most likely AOL forced them to not reveal it and AOL sued them or threatened to sue them and had some sort of deal.

292
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:18,580
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, GM is now called pigeon PID G in and not like the bird or the Pokemon Pidgeotto.

293
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:19,783
Speaker 0: No, not like that.

294
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:28,025
Speaker 0: It's pigeon as in what happens when people who know different languages try to communicate and create a new Combined language of some sorts.

295
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:34,162
Speaker 0: a good example of a pigeon would be from two or three centuries ago in Canton.

296
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:42,025
Speaker 0: as in Cantonese Canton there's Americans there were Chinese people there Portuguese people and they couldn't really Communicate very well.

297
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:58,780
Speaker 0: So a pigeon was created sort of not intentionally But it just happens this third language that sort of combines all three in a bastardized way So that these three groups of people who don't speak each other's language you can communicate to trade fun stuff.

298
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:04,487
Speaker 1: Now while this is a very apt name I'm gonna keep calling it Phoenix.

299
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:05,429
Speaker 1: I mean Firebird.

300
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,532
Speaker 1: I mean GA.

301
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,017
Speaker 0: I mean the revolution.

302
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:10,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the way Capstone.

303
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:16,840
Speaker 0: Yes, I used to think that changing names of things people would always stick with the old name forever.

304
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,191
Speaker 0: But no people are gonna call this pigeon.

305
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,517
Speaker 0: from pretty much now on I give up.

306
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,000
Speaker 0: I don't know.

307
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,839
Speaker 1: I really think I won't call it pigeon.

308
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:28,420
Speaker 1: Well hardly because unlike other things this game looks like G aim.

309
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:31,277
Speaker 1: It looks like AOL instant messenger only better.

310
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:35,032
Speaker 0: The thing is I've seen some screenshots and they're changing the look of it.

311
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,060
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't want him to change the look of it.

312
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,900
Speaker 0: Well, they're not really changing the layout but they're changing like the colors and stuff.

313
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,164
Speaker 0: So definitely not.

314
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:46,500
Speaker 0: doesn't look like GM, but I like got some blue in there and I like the lame thin gray.

315
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:48,509
Speaker 1: I'm sure here's what bothers.

316
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,080
Speaker 0: you can change your GTK theme to make it look however you want.

317
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,968
Speaker 1: People are allowed to change their names whatever.

318
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,840
Speaker 1: I mean it worked for Firefox, but here's my issue.

319
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 1: G aim called itself G aim GA.

320
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:01,810
Speaker 1: I am because AOL was messing with him over the name.

321
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:10,815
Speaker 1: now AOL back then never used AIM aim in any official capacity at all and apparently then eventually they did.

322
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:18,840
Speaker 1: apparently they trademarked it Fairly recently and now they're going after GM despite the fact that GM took the name GM long before.

323
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, of course AOL has had like aim calm for a long time.

324
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:25,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how long?

325
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,380
Speaker 0: I know We got to figure out what the dates on that stuff, but I don't really care about that.

326
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,779
Speaker 0: The point is GM is changing its name.

327
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:33,689
Speaker 0: It's kind of annoying.

328
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,879
Speaker 0: yet another open source project has changed the name.

329
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:52,478
Speaker 1: From this distant vantage point the earth might not seem of any particular interest But for us it's different.

330
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,807
Speaker 1: consider again that dot That's here.

331
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,616
Speaker 1: That's home That's us.

332
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:08,300
Speaker 1: Well, you've just heard is an excerpt from Carl Sagan's pale blue dot Which is a very excellent book and if you haven't read it, you really should.

333
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:14,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I knew the name Carl Sagan, but Scott asked me once who was a sci-fi author, right?

334
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,165
Speaker 0: Because that's right.

335
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,737
Speaker 0: That's what I associated the name with.

336
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:17,120
Speaker 0: I don't know.

337
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:21,659
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew he was a famous person who had to do with science or science fiction or something.

338
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,736
Speaker 0: and Now I think I have to go and check it out because I feel kind of dumb Only knowing the name and not knowing anything else.

339
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,203
Speaker 1: Yes Well, the thing is pale.

340
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:48,598
Speaker 1: blue dot was written partly because way back Voyager 1 which got very very far away from planet earth Took a picture of earth a very famous picture where earth is literally this tiny Tiny barely visible speck amidst a sea of billions of specks in a Sunbeam.

341
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:54,780
Speaker 1: all by itself Basically what my thing of the day is and this has been on all over dig and ever.

342
00:22:54,861 --> 00:23:05,560
Speaker 1: I'm sure a lot of people have seen it, but I think it bears mentioning This is an excerpt of Carl Sagan reading his own book and Carl Sagan is a very engaging reader and writer.

343
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:07,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, he sounds like a narrator.

344
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:08,853
Speaker 0: Like I didn't think that was him.

345
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:10,620
Speaker 0: I thought it was just some guy reading it.

346
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,399
Speaker 1: So again, if you've never read this book.

347
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:18,460
Speaker 1: This is a very eloquent and beautiful explanation of a lot of concepts that you really should be at least a little bit familiar with.

348
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:22,058
Speaker 0: Of course, if you're crazy, you'll just say I don't believe any of that stuff.

349
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,793
Speaker 0: He said Earth is the center of the universe.

350
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:25,660
Speaker 0: It's bigger than everything.

351
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,117
Speaker 0: Jupiter is just an illusion.

352
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,805
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, is that all you get?

353
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:38,376
Speaker 0: yeah, all right, so I gotta hear a video for you.

354
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:41,285
Speaker 0: this video is 30-seconds log.

355
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,462
Speaker 0: it is well worth more than 30 seconds It's.

356
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,519
Speaker 1: we really shouldn't explain what this video is because you've got.

357
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,234
Speaker 0: well I want to tell you this video contains what I would call a Russian hacker.

358
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,260
Speaker 1: I would call it Russian ingenuity.

359
00:23:55,781 --> 00:24:07,777
Speaker 0: Yes, see hackers are many things and but the main the core of what a hacker is someone who takes things and gets more out of them than you expect.

360
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:11,493
Speaker 0: someone who takes the toaster and turns it into a computer.

361
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:16,649
Speaker 0: someone who takes a Pencil and turns it into a slingshot.

362
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,082
Speaker 1: someone who takes some duct tape and a rubber band and makes a car drive another 40,000 miles Exactly.

363
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:32,695
Speaker 0: This is a Russian hacker who is using a machine in a way that it was not intended But to great effect and also for great humor.

364
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:38,733
Speaker 1: good god Just watch this and you'll see what we mean in Soviet Russia.

365
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:43,237
Speaker 1: I Can't believe you tried to make a Soviet Russia joke.

366
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:45,231
Speaker 1: What are you gonna say?

367
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,519
Speaker 1: boat paddles you?

368
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,563
Speaker 1: Joke makes you a lot.

369
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,027
Speaker 1: What were you?

370
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 0: were you gonna say after that you own hacker because in normally hackers own you?

371
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:55,615
Speaker 0: I don't know.

372
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,144
Speaker 1: Yeah That wasn't funny.

373
00:24:59,204 --> 00:24:59,765
Speaker 0: now wasn't?

374
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,731
Speaker 0: that's all I could think of right?

375
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:17,265
Speaker 1: so all that aside for the last several weeks We've been doing various how computers work or how computers work in layman's term Mondays Which have been greeted with a great amount of enthusiasm from people in the forums and from the countless emails We've been getting about them.

376
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:23,131
Speaker 0: I mean originally we didn't like these episodes so much but now Seems like people like them a lot.

377
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:23,492
Speaker 1: Mmm.

378
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:25,080
Speaker 0: It's getting better for us to do them.

379
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,765
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it was early on.

380
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:33,886
Speaker 1: we went into great technical depth on very narrow subjects and most people just glazed Over and didn't care about what a flip-flop was.

381
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:38,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so then we tried to be more accessible and everything started working out.

382
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:40,278
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not doing the dumb.

383
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:52,659
Speaker 1: DNS translates names into numbers the end But at the same time I'm not gonna talk about what the serial numbers mean or how exactly you should set up a caching DNS So that's not necessary.

384
00:25:53,488 --> 00:26:07,765
Speaker 1: But at the same time DNS or domain name service or domain name system or whatever you want to call it Regardless whether you know about it is one of the most important things on the internet and it's also something that you interact with Constantly, I mean

385
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:10,574
Speaker 0: without it technically the internet could work.

386
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,139
Speaker 0: It would just suck ass.

387
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:19,420
Speaker 1: Actually, I would submit that now with the age of Google you would you could really do just fine without domain names.

388
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:24,060
Speaker 1: Perhaps I almost never type URLs in I just type things into Google.

389
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:30,736
Speaker 0: Yes But there are things where the domain name service allows people to do pretty tricky stuff.

390
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:42,106
Speaker 0: For example, if you email well Especially when people have web applications, you know, you write a web application and you say hey web application You know connect to this You know URL and get stuff.

391
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:51,194
Speaker 0: and then if that person who runs that other URL is free to move their server around And stuff can still work without people having to rewrite web applications all the time.

392
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:55,770
Speaker 1: Well, you see all DNS does is You've got IP addresses on the internet.

393
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:59,389
Speaker 1: You might remember we talked about IP addresses So you should least understand what that is.

394
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,600
Speaker 0: Every machine on the internet has an IP address.

395
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,186
Speaker 1: It's effectively your address.

396
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:07,100
Speaker 1: And if you want to go to Google you type in Google's address, which is actually a number.

397
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:09,752
Speaker 1: Well numbers kind of suck to remember.

398
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:14,228
Speaker 1: I mean who wants to remember that 21.21.1 is the thing you want to connect to?

399
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:25,432
Speaker 0: yeah I mean imagine if like you're watching a commercial and it was like for Ford cars and they said hey You want to check out information on Ford cars go to 6 2 5 4 5 2 7 9 3. who knows crazy numbers?

400
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,419
Speaker 0: Yes, it wouldn't work.

401
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:35,820
Speaker 1: So what DNS does is it's a system whereby you can have names that are authoritatively?

402
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,945
Speaker 1: Assigned to these numbers.

403
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:42,123
Speaker 1: So if I want to go to Google, I don't know their number, but I know their name Google.

404
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:49,754
Speaker 1: so I type www.google.com and DNS translates that into the address of Google and sends all my stuff to Google.

405
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, you type in the name.

406
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:58,200
Speaker 0: Some computer somewhere will tell you how in a second figures out what number that name is equal to gives you the number.

407
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:06,820
Speaker 0: You don't actually see the number unless you want to look at it And then your computer once it knows the number can actually talk to the server and do all its business now on its base.

408
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:07,603
Speaker 1: That's it.

409
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:08,325
Speaker 0: that's all.

410
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:09,269
Speaker 0: it's all it does.

411
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,393
Speaker 0: it doesn't do anything else.

412
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:23,574
Speaker 1: and if you have an ISP Which obviously you do because you're getting on the internet somehow They probably gave you if they didn't set it up automatically via something called DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol Which I don't think we've talked about but

413
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,420
Speaker 0: I will talk about it soon.

414
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,632
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it at some point even though it's also actually very simple.

415
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:31,792
Speaker 1: it is at least on this level Yes, but they'll provide you one.

416
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:39,780
Speaker 1: they run a DNS server So whenever you want to type something in to go somewhere all the questions you ask all the names that get turned into numbers.

417
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:45,460
Speaker 1: It's all done by that DNS server that your ISP runs so you don't even have to run an ISP server or anything yep?

418
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,512
Speaker 0: So you want to visit front row crew calm you'd go open up your browser.

419
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:49,797
Speaker 0: type in front recruit calm.

420
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:54,700
Speaker 0: your browser Goes and it says it goes to your ISP's DNS server.

421
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:03,428
Speaker 0: So if your ISP is I don't know Roadrunner it goes to the Roadrunner DNS server and says hey Roadrunner DNS server What's the IP address of front row crew calm?

422
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,800
Speaker 1: and it tells you yep now behind the scenes?

423
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,030
Speaker 1: Roadrunner comms a DNS server might not know.

424
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,660
Speaker 1: it might only know about all the Roadrunner stuff.

425
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if nobody who uses Roadrunner ever went to front row crew calm before?

426
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:22,279
Speaker 0: The server never bothered to find out the number it doesn't know.

427
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:33,641
Speaker 1: So what it does and all DNS servers for the most part do this is if it doesn't know the answer it Knows who it can ask to get the answer and in turn those people know who they can ask to get the next answer and Goes

428
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:34,344
Speaker 0: all the way up

429
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,499
Speaker 1: and at the top of the internet you might have heard about every.

430
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:37,620
Speaker 1: now.

431
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,678
Speaker 1: And then there are these attacks on the root servers of the internet, and you might have wondered what that was.

432
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,625
Speaker 1: well It turns out the DNS.

433
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:49,866
Speaker 1: if you keep going up and servers keep asking higher up servers Eventually there's a top.

434
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:53,460
Speaker 1: the top are the 13 root DNS servers.

435
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:57,112
Speaker 0: They're scattered around the world aren't they named like ABCD.

436
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:58,979
Speaker 1: They are in fact named ABCD.

437
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:06,147
Speaker 1: There are only 13 of them partly due to a limitation of the way They were named and the way they were assigned early on.

438
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:10,380
Speaker 1: that limitation remains and also 13 has been more than enough to satisfy the world.

439
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,810
Speaker 0: People have keep trying to attack these servers to completely dis.

440
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:24,177
Speaker 0: if they were successful in disabling all these servers the internet would still work Almost 90% for a long time yep But you just wouldn't know be able to turn names into numbers as quickly or maybe not at all.

441
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:25,161
Speaker 1: actually no It's.

442
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,051
Speaker 1: it's much less than that.

443
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:39,255
Speaker 1: if the root server stopped working Due to caching and the fact that the majority of traffic is known and a lot of people keep copies of other DNS databases 99% of web traffic would still continue on as normal.

444
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:47,216
Speaker 1: awesome But anyway more of a long-term problem with there being no authoritative answer And there'd be a lot of ways you could screw with people.

445
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:55,464
Speaker 0: anyway people have tried to attack these things with varying measures of success and no one has been able to make a dent in the Functioning of the DNS system.

446
00:30:55,625 --> 00:31:00,360
Speaker 1: I think once four or five of them were taken down which wasn't even half so it wasn't an issue.

447
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:05,435
Speaker 0: I think the guys did more damage when they attacked Akamai than when they attacked the DNS.

448
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:06,378
Speaker 1: I remember that.

449
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,404
Speaker 0: yeah It was in I think like the second year college Maybe.

450
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:11,680
Speaker 0: I don't remember when that happened But I remember it happening.

451
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:26,913
Speaker 1: So I guess before we go any further because obviously we're stretching here is this DNS is actually very simple without going into great technical Detail yep, but you type in a URL you know www.frontrowcrew.com or www.google.com and there are a lot

452
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:27,737
Speaker 0: or dotnet

453
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,487
Speaker 1: of Misconceptions as to what all those parts mean.

454
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,532
Speaker 1: so we're gonna break it down very simply.

455
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:35,336
Speaker 1: now you type them in.

456
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:44,980
Speaker 1: you know from right to left www.frontrowcrew.com, but the way The way it's organized and the way computers look at him is actually backwards.

457
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,817
Speaker 1: So the way you would write that URL as far as the computer is concerned would be dot com dot front row crew dot www.

458
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:57,240
Speaker 1: It goes from least specific to most specific.

459
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:02,848
Speaker 1: It's a big tree a big hierarchy and at the top There's one thing the root the dot.

460
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:05,960
Speaker 1: because everything has the root and the dot you leave it out.

461
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:12,880
Speaker 1: So you don't type dot or www.frontrowcrew.com dot because it's assumed that you're going to the root.

462
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:13,566
Speaker 1: That's the top.

463
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:15,240
Speaker 1: It's like root in a Linux computer.

464
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,320
Speaker 0: Yeah Remember how we talked about how all the servers keep asking the next guy asking the next guy and they eventually ask the root servers.

465
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:26,420
Speaker 0: Well, the computers are arranged in a hierarchy and the names are also in a hierarchy.

466
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:29,900
Speaker 1: So I want to go to www.frontrowcrew.com.

467
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:42,131
Speaker 1: My computer goes to my ISP's DNS server and now I'm gonna not go over the how it Actually works now because there's a lot of tricks to make it faster and better But this is how it works in theory.

468
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:43,560
Speaker 1: And this is what you should really know.

469
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:49,568
Speaker 1: It's kind of like knowing the OSI model even though a lot of things violated Jump around and layers are all weird.

470
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:55,068
Speaker 1: Sometimes the concept is still solid and this is how it works Logistically and effectively.

471
00:32:55,671 --> 00:33:01,512
Speaker 1: so it asks the root root server All right, I'm looking for the root and it says I'm the root.

472
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,334
Speaker 1: what are you looking for?

473
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:04,140
Speaker 1: then it says all right root.

474
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:07,331
Speaker 1: Who would I ask to find out where calm is?

475
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,680
Speaker 1: and the root server would say go there?

476
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,611
Speaker 1: So then I go there and say all right calm I want to know where front row crew is.

477
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:17,684
Speaker 1: and it would say front row crew Dot-com is there.

478
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:21,575
Speaker 1: and then I would go to front row crew dot-com and I would ask it.

479
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,954
Speaker 1: All right in front row crew Where is?

480
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:25,083
Speaker 1: Www.

481
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,468
Speaker 1: and it would say right there.

482
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:32,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's how come you know, for example yesterday We set up Wes Knopf dot front row crew dot-com, right?

483
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,794
Speaker 0: You can set up all sorts of things under your domain all sorts of different machines.

484
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,464
Speaker 1: now here in lies the common misconception.

485
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:41,690
Speaker 1: a lot of people.

486
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:49,355
Speaker 1: they see a web browser and you see that HTTP colon slash slash and it's always there and very few people realize that.

487
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:54,415
Speaker 1: what that does is it says I'm going to use the hypertext transport port protocol.

488
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:57,848
Speaker 1: That is the protocol I'm using to connect to whatever I'm gonna type next.

489
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,200
Speaker 1: but because you're on the web everything you're doing is HTTP.

490
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:02,910
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really matter.

491
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,580
Speaker 1: It's just there on every URL.

492
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes you might do FTP or something else But that's not very often and usually use a different piece of software to do that.

493
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:15,476
Speaker 0: So your web browser is pretty much ninety nine point nine percent of the time always going to be HTTP.

494
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,799
Speaker 1: now Www a lot of people think is also something like that.

495
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,799
Speaker 1: Www means World Wide Web, right?

496
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,300
Speaker 1: So I type Www and that means I'm going on the World Wide Web and then I'm going to front row crew dot-com.

497
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:28,737
Speaker 0: Oh, it doesn't mean that.

498
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:36,745
Speaker 1: Very simply if you look at a URL the further right you go the more general it is and the further left you go The more specific it is.

499
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:38,532
Speaker 1: So on the far right, you've got calm.

500
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,360
Speaker 1: That's a top-level domain.

501
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:51,119
Speaker 1: These there are very few of them Gov int org net is Info edu and there's different countries.

502
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,449
Speaker 1: So starting there move a little bit to the left.

503
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,554
Speaker 1: now front row crew.

504
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,360
Speaker 1: that is a domain.

505
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:00,308
Speaker 1: So I can have front row crew comm.

506
00:35:00,388 --> 00:35:04,458
Speaker 1: it is the front row crew domain inside of the comm top level domain.

507
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:08,210
Speaker 1: now Front row crew net could be something totally different.

508
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,165
Speaker 1: front row crew dot int could be something totally different from all that Comm int gov.

509
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:15,100
Speaker 1: all these top-level domains are entirely separate.

510
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:17,498
Speaker 1: Now here's the interesting part.

511
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,966
Speaker 1: Www is not a domain.

512
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:21,733
Speaker 1: It's the name of a computer.

513
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,640
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean World Wide Web.

514
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:30,018
Speaker 1: Sure, it tends to stand for that and a lot of people use Www to be the name of their web server.

515
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:31,524
Speaker 1: Www dot.

516
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,780
Speaker 1: front row crew comm takes you to our web server.

517
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,629
Speaker 1: But we could have foobar dot.

518
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,875
Speaker 1: front row crew comm and that could be our web server.

519
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,324
Speaker 1: There is no inherent meaning in Www.

520
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:44,420
Speaker 1: it is just a commonly used name of a web server.

521
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could put any name I wanted there and point it at any IP address.

522
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:50,383
Speaker 0: I want a name any IP address It doesn't matter.

523
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:52,715
Speaker 0: I could make a name and point it at someone else's IP address.

524
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:53,580
Speaker 0: Nothing they could do about it.

525
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,777
Speaker 1: I could have multiple World Wide Web servers running internet stuff.

526
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:59,561
Speaker 1: so I could have Www dot.

527
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:03,816
Speaker 1: front row crew comm that has a web page I could have rim dot front row crew comm.

528
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:05,080
Speaker 1: that has my personal blog.

529
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,449
Speaker 0: You could do anything.

530
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,000
Speaker 0: you want any name any number?

531
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:18,454
Speaker 1: Now in general the one on the far right is always the top-level domain and the one on the far left is always the name Of the computer you were connecting to in the middle.

532
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:19,660
Speaker 1: You can have a whole bunch of others.

533
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:20,884
Speaker 1: You see you have a domain.

534
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,893
Speaker 1: you can have subdomains under that and subdomains under that.

535
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:28,291
Speaker 1: so we could have the domain foobar dot front row crew comm.

536
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:33,900
Speaker 1: and then inside of foobar we could have Www and Wesnoth and FTP and all those things.

537
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:36,488
Speaker 0: Www dot www dot.

538
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,611
Speaker 0: front row crew comm.

539
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:50,520
Speaker 1: yep, so if you look at the top-level country domains Which is something you might have run into if you ever go to Japanese websites or actually also things like delicious Yeah, or UK websites because remember the internet basically started in the United States.

540
00:36:50,580 --> 00:37:02,979
Speaker 1: so there was comm edu and all these things and People just never really thought about the fact that there would be other countries someday on the internet or that it might matter because there's also Country codes dot us is a top-level domain.

541
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:03,397
Speaker 1: Yep.

542
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:09,255
Speaker 1: So if you want a comm within us comm is a subdomain of us in that case.

543
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:14,479
Speaker 1: so you could have foobar comm or foobar dot co dot us.

544
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,559
Speaker 1: That might sound weird.

545
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:37,480
Speaker 1: That's because for various reasons that you don't need to worry about whenever people use the top-level domains That aren't the normal ones whenever they use something other than comm in edu But something like us or JP or CX its Convention that the one next under that like comm edu whatever will be shortened to two digits.

546
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,209
Speaker 1: I forget exactly why because it really doesn't matter.

547
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:47,290
Speaker 0: yep, so if we were in Japan our URL would probably Www dot front row crew dot co dot JP.

548
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:47,711
Speaker 1: Yep.

549
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:57,234
Speaker 1: That's basically the comm domain within the JP domain Mm-hmm and then front row crew is the domain inside of both of those and then Www is the name of our web server.

550
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:58,000
Speaker 1: you see how this works.

551
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,980
Speaker 1: It's actually really simple other than all the little intricacies and things that don't really matter.

552
00:38:03,302 --> 00:38:05,374
Speaker 0: Yes, see the real trick of DNS.

553
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:06,440
Speaker 0: is that okay?

554
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, all it is is turning names into numbers.

555
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:17,397
Speaker 0: to turn names into numbers on such a worldwide scale is Incredibly complex and there's a billion secret things that go on that you don't have to understand.

556
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:18,200
Speaker 0: so don't worry about it.

557
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:28,140
Speaker 1: However the fact that is so complex is the reason that for example a lot of people wonder How come there's so few top-level domains, there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to have anything I want.

558
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,433
Speaker 1: Why can't I have Bob dot rim or just a domain?

559
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:36,178
Speaker 1: That's just calm or Bubba-dub bubba-dub bubba-dub bubba if I want it.

560
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:38,408
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to.

561
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 0: I vote for the Bubba top-level domain.

562
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:47,180
Speaker 1: It's necessary except for the fact that the only reason DNS works is because it's a distributed database.

563
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:48,339
Speaker 1: It's all over the world.

564
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:56,640
Speaker 1: Every domain has its own DNS server taken care of it and you ask all the way up the chain And then you ask all the way back down the chain to eventually get to where you're going.

565
00:38:57,182 --> 00:39:00,600
Speaker 1: So each server only needs to know about its own tiny part of the internet.

566
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:06,120
Speaker 1: Or if it's a bigger server it only needs to know where to ask all those other parts of the internet.

567
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:15,200
Speaker 1: So the server is taking care of the comm top-level domain Only need to know about comm and the root servers only need to know where the server that takes care of comm is.

568
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:18,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, the root server doesn't know about front row crew.

569
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:19,840
Speaker 0: it doesn't know crap about front row crew.

570
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, it knows about comm net or us and all that.

571
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:24,796
Speaker 0: That's all it knows.

572
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:25,800
Speaker 1: That's all it ever does.

573
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,880
Speaker 1: In fact, that's the only thing the root servers will ever answer for you as far as you're concerned.

574
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you go to the root server and say hey, where's front row crew comm?

575
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:33,455
Speaker 0: it says calm.

576
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:41,896
Speaker 0: that way calm that You have these 13 giant super important computers and all they ever say is calm calm calm calm.

577
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:47,117
Speaker 0: or calm calm calm Japan calm calm Germany calm calm.

578
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:57,140
Speaker 1: So it's critical that the entire structure is hierarchical that there's a tree Starting from a root and then branching out from there because you can have any number of branches.

579
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,090
Speaker 1: Well, there is technically a limit on the number of branches.

580
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,544
Speaker 0: Yes, the number of letters in the language actually No, it's.

581
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:05,080
Speaker 1: it's actually fairly complicated.

582
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:20,087
Speaker 1: You can have any number of subdomains up to a certain number and each subdomain can be up to I think 260 63 characters or so so long as the total URL does not exceed 255 characters.

583
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,099
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of arbitrary rules out there.

584
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:30,166
Speaker 0: We should set up like in a lab a bunch of DNS servers and just make try to make it as crazy as we possibly can With how many subdomains as we can.

585
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:33,680
Speaker 1: you can trivially look up the exact rules of what works and what I want.

586
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,590
Speaker 0: I actually try it and like do it why it'll run.

587
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:42,679
Speaker 1: it'll either work or not or you can fucks with bind to make it Even if it wasn't supposed to work, oh really that sounds fun.

588
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:48,600
Speaker 1: You can do a lot of DNS servers will fudge things in order to make it faster or more reliable.

589
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:58,489
Speaker 1: Verisign actually got in trouble a while ago by not following the rules and setting it up so that if you typed in a Domain for their servers that wasn't an actual domain.

590
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,780
Speaker 1: It would take you to their web page show you an advertisement and all sorts of nasty.

591
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember when they tried that it was like if you typed in any URL that Wasn't?

592
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,631
Speaker 0: that didn't map to anything like it was.

593
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,755
Speaker 0: there was nothing set for that.

594
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:12,900
Speaker 0: No one had that domain.

595
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:15,811
Speaker 0: It would always go to Verisign's magic search page.

596
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:16,855
Speaker 1: It was bad news.

597
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:17,798
Speaker 0: It was very bad news.

598
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,854
Speaker 1: now You might wonder who runs these 13 servers that are scattered all over the world.

599
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,700
Speaker 1: who gets to decide who gets domain?

600
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,969
Speaker 1: I mean we want front row crew calm.

601
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:35,400
Speaker 1: What if the evil front row crew at the B I T anime club decided that they wanted the front row crew because of their business?

602
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean what if let's let's pick a random country.

603
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,420
Speaker 0: Zimbabwe was in charge of running all the rude servers, and they decided they didn't like front row crew.

604
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:46,340
Speaker 0: Hey, just take our domain away, and then what could we do about it?

605
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:54,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean what's to stop a registrar a person who gives out domain names or doing all that stuff from saying alright front row Crew we see you're getting kind of popular there.

606
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:58,120
Speaker 1: Give us ten grand or we're taking away your domain and giving it to a porn site.

607
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:05,730
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean the hierarchy is very resilient from a Standpoint of performance and a system that is very hard to destroy.

608
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:16,010
Speaker 0: however in terms of controlling the hierarchy If you're in you if you're holding on to all this stuff at the top You can control all the stuff down low as well.

609
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:23,818
Speaker 1: now the answer is I guess not surprisingly Incredibly complicated and currently subject to a great deal of controversy.

610
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:32,127
Speaker 1: yes I'm going to dumb this down to the point that it may no longer even be technically correct however as far as anyone else Out there is concerned.

611
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,480
Speaker 1: This is effectively how it works.

612
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:38,276
Speaker 1: There is an organization called I can the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers.

613
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:41,282
Speaker 1: they control Dns.

614
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:56,258
Speaker 1: they let registrars like Verisign or whoever who want to control com or edu or whatever Pay for the privilege of being able to control those domains, and they're semi regulated by.

615
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:56,819
Speaker 1: I can.

616
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,843
Speaker 0: yeah I'm pretty sure.

617
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:00,837
Speaker 0: Verisign controls come and I don't know who can.

618
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:02,599
Speaker 1: it's complicated Don't worry about it.

619
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:04,888
Speaker 1: And then it leases all the way down.

620
00:43:05,129 --> 00:43:08,000
Speaker 1: and then there are places like I don't know go daddy or we use what Gandhi.

621
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, we use a french registrar gandigandi.net.

622
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:12,400
Speaker 0: They're pretty good.

623
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:24,976
Speaker 1: Yeah And really simply if you want a domain you just go to any person who is licensed by these people to give out domains And they have to follow a very strict procedure to have the right to give out domains.

624
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:32,320
Speaker 1: it includes like a $50,000 non-refundable application fee and if they decide to not let you do it well you're out 50 grand

625
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:45,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they configure dns servers in various places to you know point your name at the IP address that you desire and Point your email at the various IP addresses you desire if you want that.

626
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:56,815
Speaker 1: But if you want a domain all you do is go to one of these people and you say I want a domain and you Tell them which one you want and you pay them some small amount of money And it's yours and they'll set up the DNS for you and all that 99% of the time.

627
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,087
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, what do we pay?

628
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:00,193
Speaker 0: I think I pay like $30 a year private.

629
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:04,614
Speaker 0: I think it's euros actually, so it's hard to tell exactly how much we pay.

630
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,980
Speaker 1: So what if there's contention?

631
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,353
Speaker 1: What if two people want the same same domain first come first serve?

632
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:09,754
Speaker 0: That's it.

633
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:10,999
Speaker 1: It's first come first serve.

634
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,768
Speaker 0: It's it's and you can give up your domain to someone else.

635
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,580
Speaker 0: Basically once you have control of a domain it's locked in.

636
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,759
Speaker 0: No one else can take it.

637
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,680
Speaker 0: So if someone who has a DNS server, like let's say rim has a DNS server, right?

638
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,136
Speaker 0: I bought front recruit calm rim on his DNS server because he could do whatever he wants to.

639
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:31,540
Speaker 0: his server says Front recruit calm is something else blah.

640
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:33,178
Speaker 0: It's not gonna work.

641
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:36,489
Speaker 1: Yeah Because we have these root servers and everything above.

642
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:43,090
Speaker 1: so anyone in the world trying to get to the site Isn't gonna ask my piddly little DNS server.

643
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:48,392
Speaker 1: They're gonna ask a real DNS server or if they're paranoid They're gonna ask a root DNS server and go from there.

644
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:54,660
Speaker 1: It's so difficult Normally to compromise DNS in any realistic way.

645
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:55,122
Speaker 1: Yeah,

646
00:44:55,443 --> 00:45:07,046
Speaker 0: but if I wanted to give rim my domain that I already owned there are things you can do to like say Okay it is okay for someone to take my domain away from me and you flick a switch and then someone could you can give it To someone and they give you money.

647
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:15,367
Speaker 1: now this did lead to the problem of cyber squatting Whereby say I know that there's some hot young company called I don't know pen soft and they're gonna.

648
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:21,451
Speaker 1: they're gonna go live and they're gonna need a website and all this business Say I just go and get pens off for five bucks.

649
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, pen soft comm is mine now.

650
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:32,434
Speaker 1: Well now I can extort them for practically any amount of money I want and just say hey I'll give you a pen soft comm for a thousand dollars.

651
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:41,311
Speaker 0: Oh That sucks, yeah, I have to deal with like pin soft or something else I don't know and there's very little recourse you have against this.

652
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:43,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not much you can do.

653
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:51,127
Speaker 0: If you're lucky and you're in a country with certain laws and they're in the same country as you Maybe you can do something.

654
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:51,850
Speaker 0: I think there have been.

655
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,420
Speaker 0: I think there's at least one successful suing case.

656
00:45:54,754 --> 00:46:07,042
Speaker 1: Yeah It really depends on the situation for example if Ford Motor Company somehow lapsed and didn't Update their domain and I bought it out from under them when they didn't renew it and then I tried to extort him and sell It back.

657
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:09,111
Speaker 0: they just be like a trademark infringement give back.

658
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,698
Speaker 1: the judges would probably just give it to them.

659
00:46:10,878 --> 00:46:13,779
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but at the same time you got to worry about that.

660
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:22,439
Speaker 1: There's also a scandal lately where if you go to a lot of registrars and you type in their little box that says hey Is this domain free?

661
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:30,219
Speaker 1: There's people who watch that information and if they see someone type a domain in they register it Knowing that you want it and then they try to sell it to you.

662
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:37,671
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of crazy people out there who they watch the news and they watch the internet and winning Depending on what's going on in the world.

663
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:39,120
Speaker 0: They'll just buy up domains.

664
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:50,876
Speaker 1: The other problem with controversy lately is that I can and all of this is basically run 99% by the United States which kind of bothers the rest of the world.

665
00:46:51,136 --> 00:47:00,620
Speaker 1: yet at the same time No one else has ever really stepped up to Actually be responsible for this and the UN while a lot of people say oh the UN should take it over.

666
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:03,274
Speaker 1: I scoff at that for a lot of reasons.

667
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:03,696
Speaker 0: Yes.

668
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:09,396
Speaker 0: I've read many Articles about what various people at the UN have said about them taking DNS and whatnot

669
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:18,558
Speaker 1: and it comes down to the fact that The people involved with the UN and a lot of foreign countries who say DNS should be democratized to the world Don't understand the technology at all.

670
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,400
Speaker 1: And if the US handed it over to them, it would basically fuck the internet up.

671
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:31,698
Speaker 0: Yeah the thing is politics and technology don't mix and what these people want to do is they want to get their politics all over our Technology because they don't know about the technology.

672
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:37,038
Speaker 0: We need to change it this way because that works with our politics and then up.

673
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:40,396
Speaker 0: sorry It's now everything's broken because you had to be an ass.

674
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:50,488
Speaker 1: luckily However, I can is very highly watched by a lot of people and it would be incredibly difficult for I can to do anything shady.

675
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:53,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically I can is is very careful with everything.

676
00:47:53,501 --> 00:48:01,000
Speaker 0: It does that, you know Like recently they said no xxx domain and stuff like that because the second they slip up people are gonna be all over their case.

677
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:04,838
Speaker 0: They're they're kind of very How do you say?

678
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:07,385
Speaker 1: They have a tenuous grasp.

679
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:12,663
Speaker 1: That's the word I was looking for and luckily they've been doing a pretty bang-up job All things considered.

680
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:17,743
Speaker 1: I mean think of this the internet is the wild wild west, you know www.

681
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:27,719
Speaker 1: it's the sea of worms and Trojans and elite AOL kids oars and Garbage and child porn and drug trafficking and everything horrible ever.

682
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:31,774
Speaker 1: Meat-spin and goat see and Each other left and right.

683
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,217
Speaker 1: It's chaos.

684
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:38,730
Speaker 1: the only reason your computer is not hacked 24/7 is because you're probably behind some sort of net and It's just.

685
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:39,580
Speaker 1: it's just nightmare.

686
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:48,180
Speaker 1: Imagine having to be the arbiter for the entire world when it comes to what names people can use on to internet.

687
00:48:48,963 --> 00:48:49,967
Speaker 1: That is what I can.

688
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:53,160
Speaker 1: rough has to deal with every single day.

689
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:55,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember when they first created.

690
00:48:55,568 --> 00:48:59,180
Speaker 0: I can cuz he used to just I think it was just very signed before then.

691
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,825
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

692
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:01,820
Speaker 0: or no network solutions, right?

693
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:02,942
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

694
00:49:03,403 --> 00:49:05,610
Speaker 0: but when I remember when they created I can.

695
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,776
Speaker 0: everyone was like I'm skeptical of this.

696
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:08,258
Speaker 0: I can.

697
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:09,625
Speaker 0: they're not gonna be able To handle it.

698
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:10,755
Speaker 0: Everything's gonna be fucked up.

699
00:49:10,836 --> 00:49:12,622
Speaker 0: Oh, no But they've.

700
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:13,344
Speaker 0: they've done.

701
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:14,849
Speaker 0: All right much better than expected.

702
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,574
Speaker 0: I mean, we're still it still works.

703
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:18,540
Speaker 0: It's a miracle unto itself.

704
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,889
Speaker 1: Here it is All right.

705
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:27,066
Speaker 1: The original mandate for I can was actually from the US government and it was when Bill Clinton and George W Bush were both in power.

706
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:41,920
Speaker 1: It was a long-term thing and on January 30th 1998 the National telecommunications and Information Administration An agency of the US Department of Commerce issued for comment quote a proposal to improve the technical management of internet names and addresses.

707
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,709
Speaker 1: Blah blah blah blah I can.

708
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,895
Speaker 1: it's actually these.

709
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:47,806
Speaker 1: there are many more paragraphs here I'm not gonna read.

710
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,579
Speaker 0: you can read it yourself people.

711
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,924
Speaker 1: yeah, just go to the Wikipedia on.

712
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:52,227
Speaker 1: I can if you actually care.

713
00:49:52,729 --> 00:50:04,398
Speaker 0: the fact remains that what I can does has almost no effect on how the internet works currently and You don't have to worry about it on the personal level but in the grand scheme it is super important.

714
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,320
Speaker 1: now We jumped around a little bit partly because there's not a lot to say about how DNS were I mean?

715
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, the episode really could just been hey DNS if you ask for what you know What number goes this name, and then it tells you the end.

716
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:20,019
Speaker 1: yeah, however if you're interested Let us know in the forums or email us.

717
00:50:20,523 --> 00:50:31,145
Speaker 1: We could do another episode in the near future on DNS servers and talk actually about how a DNS server really works and how to set one up why you would need one All kinds of stuff like that.

718
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:39,094
Speaker 1: yep because there's a lot of fun stuff there how to configure a domain how to configure a domain In your house, maybe yep how email works with DNS now.

719
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:47,639
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of complicated I'll think all will say is that email is weird and requires DNS to do special things in order for email to work.

720
00:50:47,899 --> 00:51:14,520
Speaker 1: the only Other thing I'll bring up because this is another common misconception that people seem to think that because you have a dot org domain You got to be a nonprofit or if you're a dot edu you technically have to be a school and all that business and Those rules have become laxer and laxer of time has gone on especially for dot org and dot-com and dotnet and effectively What top-level domain something uses is not a good indication of what that thing actually is.

721
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:17,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, except dot biz which basically means.

722
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:24,610
Speaker 0: I'm a shady and/or craptacular company Or dot foreign country which means I'm from that foreign country.

723
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,455
Speaker 1: Yes, usually granted.

724
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:32,974
Speaker 1: There was a big business in People who at the countries read domains like dot TV or dot CX selling.

725
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:34,439
Speaker 1: don't their domain names.

726
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:37,099
Speaker 0: yes CX is the Christmas Islands.

727
00:51:37,782 --> 00:51:42,360
Speaker 0: So you know the Christmas Islands obviously is not gonna have a lot of domains because they're not very large.

728
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:47,803
Speaker 0: So they were selling their domains to other people and all around the world And that's that.

729
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:50,800
Speaker 0: thus you get goat C dot CX and many other things like that.

730
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

731
00:51:51,462 --> 00:51:56,217
Speaker 1: then they realized after all these years exactly what go to dot CX was and promptly destroyed it.

732
00:51:56,778 --> 00:52:03,800
Speaker 1: sigh Yeah, well a small piece of the internet is fallen as that was like the fall of the Western Roman Empire right there.

733
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,318
Speaker 1: Now we've got the corrupt meatspin Empire to take its place.
