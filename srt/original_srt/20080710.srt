00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:34,819
Speaker 1: is that I?

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,880
Speaker 1: Once I spend a few days not at the beach I once again get to that point in my life where I decide wait a minute Why don't I just go live at the beach?

8
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,659
Speaker 1: I could afford it get some crap job and just be a beach bomb the rest of my life.

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,808
Speaker 0: Beach bum is on the list.

10
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:55,560
Speaker 0: It's actually relatively high on the list of you know careers.

11
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:59,360
Speaker 0: I mean Beach bum is a non paying job.

12
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,145
Speaker 0: It pays nothing yet It is above.

13
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,592

15
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:09,651
Speaker 0: I fail at that.

16
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:10,134
Speaker 0: I go down.

17
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:10,837
Speaker 1: It's like for us.

18
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:11,440

Speaker 0: and you know Beach bum comes above many paying position.

21
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:22,340
Speaker 1: He's thinking about that life.

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,620
Speaker 1: I live that life for a short time when I would meet after our IT and all that co-op and business.

23
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:32,420
Speaker 1: Me and Scott went to with Scott Johnson down to his beach house, then I lived there for a while.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,020
Speaker 1: You know what I could deal with that life.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,904
Speaker 0: I could well deal deal with that life when you don't have the House.

26
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,226
Speaker 1: the thing is you just live in a shithole near the beach And you sleep in a lot of places.

27
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,672
Speaker 1: those people to sleep on the beach.

28
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,660
Speaker 0: the thing is they have a beach patrol.

29
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I wouldn't live in if I was a beach bum.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,168
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go to Wildwood if I were to be.

31
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:52,991
Speaker 0: should you go to?

32
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:59,591
Speaker 1: you got to California one of those crap where they have Beach Patrol a lot of places you can be on the beach at night.

33
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know where.

00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:05,213
Speaker 0: Cuba Cuba You can live on the beach and not just Cuba besides.

35
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,940
Speaker 1: There's different levels of Beach bum.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,321
Speaker 1: I mean.

37
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:08,466
Speaker 1: are we talking about?

38
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:15,342
Speaker 1: I have no money and no job and in basically a hobo Beach hobo Only.

39
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,789
Speaker 0: the difference is hobos like do things like.

40
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:24,071
Speaker 0: they're hobos that like run pirate radio stations and hobos also Travel bums tend to not travel.

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,320
Speaker 0: they work less and they drink more.

42
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,304
Speaker 0: Hobos travel more.

43
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:40,240
Speaker 0: they work more, but they don't really make money, but they sort of do things and Hobos are saying you could look at a hobo some hobos.

44
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:49,780
Speaker 1: I read an article a couple years ago about this Emerging class of hobo by choice 20-somethings who just quit college and just kind of bum around.

45
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:53,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this homeless people that go to libraries and write blogs.

46
00:02:53,861 --> 00:03:01,073
Speaker 0: You know they spend a lot of time in libraries or beaches or other public places And you know it's all kinds of homeless action.

47
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,760
Speaker 1: No there's different levels of Beach bum.

48
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,540
Speaker 1: I mean the level I'd look at the level that's high on the list.

49
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,156
Speaker 1: Beach hobo is very low on my list.

50
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,424
Speaker 1: I would be Campus hobo before.

51
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,188
Speaker 1: I'd be Beach hobo.

52
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,397
Speaker 0: I'd be Beach hobo before college.

53
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:15,220
Speaker 1: can't think about it.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,113
Speaker 1: Go to RIT right college campus hobo of course.

55
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:25,600
Speaker 1: They probably cleaned it up now back in the day There were showers bathrooms and all sorts of stuff in those tunnels that no one else no one ever went down there.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,608
Speaker 1: You could pretty much live down there if you wanted to.

57
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:29,636
Speaker 0: so you know actually I was in Florida.

58
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:30,058
Speaker 0: right?

59
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,888
Speaker 0: the hospitals They're like you would want.

60
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,217
Speaker 0: they had this on the front desk of the hospital.

61
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,459
Speaker 0: when you walk in There's like this ball of stickers.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,705
Speaker 0: They're the guest stickers.

63
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:46,639
Speaker 0: cuz like you go in you they give you a sticker says guest in your name or whatever and then when you leave they take the sticker, and they make a ball out of it as a big ball.

64
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,740
Speaker 0: and I walk in like grandma, and she just keeps walking right past the desk doesn't stop.

65
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,469
Speaker 0: We didn't get any stickers and no one cared.

66
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,473
Speaker 0: no one looked at us.

67
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,245
Speaker 0: We walked right into whatever room We wanted to.

68
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,400
Speaker 0: no one said anything no one cared.

69
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,780
Speaker 0: You could just totally go in the hospital free like just walk right in from the street and do whatever you wanted.

70
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,780
Speaker 0: No one would stop you or talk to you or anything.

71
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:13,297
Speaker 0: You could totally just walk in and find an empty bed and now probably order food.

72
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:14,020
Speaker 1: that wouldn't work.

73
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,040
Speaker 1: You could probably get food But yeah.

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,966
Speaker 1: And you could probably find somewhere dank to sleep because most hospitals have a whole bunch of like side Infrastructure tunnels and things.

75
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:26,160
Speaker 0: you go to an empty an empty room, and there's no one in there.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,580
Speaker 1: Realize that in pretty much every metropolitan area finding an empty bed in a hospital is pretty much impossible.

77
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,050
Speaker 0: Okay, but you know in the hospital.

78
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,500
Speaker 0: I was in in Florida like half the beds are empty.

79
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:41,065
Speaker 1: What kind of hospital was it?

80
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,530
Speaker 0: It was a normal hospital.

81
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,855
Speaker 0: Just completely normal.

82
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:44,959
Speaker 1: What do you mean completely normal?

83
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,660
Speaker 0: I had an emergency room section, and I had a you know staying overnight.

84
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,871
Speaker 1: I realize asking you what kind of hospital is okay.

85
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,135
Speaker 1: It's like a hospital.

86
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,713
Speaker 1: It's like asking a non-computer guy Yeah, do you have a risk kernel or a cis kernel?

87
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 0: There was no specialist.

88
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:10,839
Speaker 1: It was better off going to a college campus because I would have a hard time Differentiating a lot of hobos from a lot of the people I knew at our IT.

89
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:17,000
Speaker 1: I guess that's true especially considering that half the people we hung out with at our IT We're not students.

90
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:21,355
Speaker 1: We're well over 25 and just happen to live in the area again.

91
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:24,202
Speaker 0: if you get one of those hospital gowns You're you're.

92
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:28,157
Speaker 0: if you can just get the gown on then they'll be like where did this patient come from?

93
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,808
Speaker 0: and they won't be able Identify you and they'll freak out and something will happen.

94
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,192
Speaker 1: I know what'll happen.

95
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:40,075
Speaker 0: it involves police, but hey hey I wonder what the sentence is for faking hospital stay.

96
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,220
Speaker 1: I don't know.

97
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,357
Speaker 1: I think if you're faking the hospital stay you've got more things to worry about.

98
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:50,932
Speaker 0: wait well They send you perhaps to the psych ward of the hospital Which is where you're trying to get in the psych ward of the hospital.

99
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:51,475
Speaker 0: Why not?

100
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,017
Speaker 0: I've been.

101
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,987
Speaker 0: no I just come in.

102
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:54,891
Speaker 0: they'd be like are you insane?

103
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:55,816
Speaker 0: I'd be like yes.

104
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,147
Speaker 0: I want to bed And I'll be crazy.

105
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,060
Speaker 0: I'll pretend I'm crazy and I'll just get to stay in the bed.

106
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,750
Speaker 1: I've been in those psych wards.

107
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,560
Speaker 1: you do not want to be in those place.

108
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone else is crazy, but I'm in my own room.

109
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,775
Speaker 1: No you're not.

110
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:07,779
Speaker 1: you don't get a private room.

111
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,194
Speaker 1: Why not you share with other crazy people?

112
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,060
Speaker 0: That's not fair.

113
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,422
Speaker 0: What then?

114
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,593
Speaker 0: how do they expect crazy people to get uncrazy?

115
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,840
Speaker 0: they put him with crazy don't?

116
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,160
Speaker 0: Why they got to separate the crazies or else they're gonna be more crazy.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,480
Speaker 1: It's a complicated issue, but all I will say is the four Crazy more crazy.

118
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,880
Speaker 1: No, it's like when you multiply two even numbers and two odd.

119
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,795
Speaker 0: Yes, you got to put each crazy person on the road or else.

120
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,060
Speaker 0: They will not be un-crazy.

121
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:46,020
Speaker 1: But the one time that way I can pretend to be crazy and get a bed I got you know I had I had the gigantic I am NOT crazy armband that is not removable from me so that I could get out of this place.

122
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:50,188
Speaker 1: I get in there and I find the network closet And you know I don't really see anyone around.

123
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,212
Speaker 1: so I open the network closet.

124
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,100
Speaker 0: I go in and I'm this crazy guy in there.

125
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,834
Speaker 1: God you know I found some scary shit in network closets sometimes.

126
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,382
Speaker 0: I'm glad I'm sorry cough a guy Baz.

127
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:05,034
Speaker 1: really I did open one once and find some guy asleep in it.

128
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:06,700
Speaker 0: was he a technician?

129
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,526
Speaker 1: No, I don't know who he was.

130
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:13,100
Speaker 1: all I remember is I quietly went in did my business and just shut the door behind me.

131
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,113
Speaker 0: He didn't say anything now.

132
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:17,084
Speaker 0: You should have poked him with a stick I didn't want to deal with.

133
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:19,173
Speaker 0: that should have thrown the bas really bad.

134
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,117
Speaker 1: I really didn't care.

135
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:25,746
Speaker 1: But no, so I'm working on this switch And I feel a little airy sure wasn't a mummy?

136
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:31,750
Speaker 1: I turn around and there is a semicircle of like 11 of these people Just staring at me outside the door.

137
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,240
Speaker 1: I'm completely trapped and surrounded.

138
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,494
Speaker 0: Why did they let the crazed people walk around?

139
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:37,520
Speaker 1: they just wander the halls?

140
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,459
Speaker 1: Why it depends on what kind of psych ward it is yeah?

141
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,906
Speaker 1: So they're all kind of standing around.

142
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:44,710
Speaker 0: I know you were there.

143
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,840
Speaker 0: They should have put them in their not hallway.

144
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,625
Speaker 1: They didn't don't care?

145
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:58,766
Speaker 1: the people who run the psych ward like hey have fun, and then they locked me in great I had to go to the airlock to get back up, but anyway When I when I say beach bum I mean

146
00:07:59,067 --> 00:07:59,708
Speaker 0: go live

147
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,957
Speaker 1: cheaply right near a pretty much a year-round beach.

148
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:03,840
Speaker 0: the problem is beach.

149
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,154
Speaker 0: Closed property is stupidly expensive.

150
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:11,754
Speaker 1: not always What you can live near beaches in really dumpy crappy places.

151
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:15,317
Speaker 1: often you'll be living semi illegally Semi illegally is okay.

152
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:23,000
Speaker 1: Yeah Like you live you work it like say a bar near the beach And then you agree to pay some pittance to be able to sleep in the bar when it's closed at night.

153
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:27,846
Speaker 0: Or you can just you know sleep in The hospital or you could.

154
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,916
Speaker 0: what's that guy who would get drunk ever and arrested every night?

155
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:30,977
Speaker 0: Oh?

156
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,823
Speaker 1: What's his name?

157
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,188
Speaker 1: the hero of FARC?

158
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,672
Speaker 0: Yes?

159
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:35,817
Speaker 1: I forgot his name.

160
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:49,100
Speaker 0: Ah Just get every night Just get stupidly drunk and from the money you begged or danced or sang for and then get arrested I would leave another Sleep in the local jail, and then they let you in the morning.

161
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,382
Speaker 1: That's a level below the kind of beach bum I want to be.

162
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,025
Speaker 1: that I'm.

163
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,996
Speaker 1: what I would do is live cheaply like in a bar.

164
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:59,028
Speaker 0: What's cheaper than Free bed at the local jail.

165
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:05,340
Speaker 1: I would rather have my freedom and just sleep in the bar You only lose your freedom at night.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,885
Speaker 1: No, that's not how that works.

167
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,891
Speaker 0: you go into the police station.

168
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,436
Speaker 0: It's not like the big jail.

169
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:12,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's you know It's like all right.

170
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:13,530
Speaker 0: We like you up.

171
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,113
Speaker 0: Okay.

172
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:14,877
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

173
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:15,380
Speaker 1: It wouldn't work.

174
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,831
Speaker 0: The old TV show what's it called with Barney Fife?

175
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:22,597
Speaker 1: Oh the Andy Griffith show.

176
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:23,359
Speaker 0: yeah, just like that.

177
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:26,637
Speaker 0: That's what it'd be like.

178
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:30,020
Speaker 0: they'd like you up, and there's the drug It would get.

179
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,009
Speaker 0: he got locked up.

180
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,385
Speaker 0: It would be exactly like that all right fine.

181
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:35,109
Speaker 1: Here's the deal.

182
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:39,230
Speaker 1: Next week we'll both go out to Southern, California.

183
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,610
Speaker 1: Somewhere you get arrested every night.

184
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:46,508
Speaker 1: I will find a job at a bar and see if I can crash there after they close.

185
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:50,430
Speaker 0: well You'll get the job at the bars that you can provide me with the alcohol to get arrested.

186
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:55,690
Speaker 1: I will provide you with as much alcohol as you want yeah, and I'll just give it to like some kid.

187
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,150
Speaker 0: I'll get her go to jail for one night, and then I'll be let out.

188
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,797
Speaker 1: We'll see how that works.

189
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:01,582
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna drink it.

190
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,790
Speaker 0: You know, but you could drink it.

191
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:13,317
Speaker 0: Oh Actually that would actually if you got the job at the bar and just drank the alcohol that would get you in jail for the Night, no it wouldn't why not They're not?

192
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,329
Speaker 1: they really won't jail you unless you're driving drunk.

193
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,037
Speaker 0: Oh, I just want to be.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,568
Speaker 0: not just being really drunk in public doesn't do it.

195
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,418
Speaker 1: I depends on the place.

196
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,550
Speaker 0: vomiting in the I go to the playground.

197
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:25,299
Speaker 0: That's a good place.

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,979
Speaker 1: I Try not gonna work besides.

199
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,889
Speaker 1: I would rather just have a job.

200
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:31,794
Speaker 1: That's the whole point.

201
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:31,994
Speaker 0: then.

202
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:32,978
Speaker 0: you're not a bum.

203
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:34,403
Speaker 1: yes, I'm a beach bum.

204
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,370
Speaker 1: beach bum is a very specific thing.

205
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,799
Speaker 0: That is nothing to do with bombs.

206
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,101
Speaker 0: No.

207
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,470
Speaker 0: It's very a lot to do with bum.

208
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,544
Speaker 1: No, because there are beach bums, which are actually above Beach Hobo.

209
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,449
Speaker 1: I'm talking about dude.

210
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,875
Speaker 0: That's just a surfer, dude.

211
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:50,190
Speaker 1: No you can be a dude beach bum - the only difference is you don't have a future.

212
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,466
Speaker 0: You need a surfboard.

213
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:52,855
Speaker 1: They're cheap.

214
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:53,819
Speaker 0: No really.

215
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,804
Speaker 1: I'll learn to have their cheese.

216
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,125
Speaker 0: There's new.

217
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:55,387
Speaker 0: the new.

218
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,090
Speaker 0: there were good ones.

219
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:57,989
Speaker 0: Have a good one.

220
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,579
Speaker 1: Okay, I wouldn't surf in once I fell over.

221
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,109
Speaker 0: it was the end of that because you see that crappy surfboard.

222
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,110
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know how to surf, and I didn't get a lesson.

223
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,423
Speaker 1: I rented a surfboard in Florida my all.

224
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:15,630
Speaker 1: I well rented surfboards And I went out and I didn't know what I was doing and I stood up on it twice.

225
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:19,410
Speaker 0: I'll just get the you know the ski do and cut your surfboard in half and go.

226
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,861
Speaker 1: Beach bums can't afford see dudes.

227
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,250
Speaker 0: I didn't say I'd be a beach bum.

228
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:32,880
Speaker 1: I just I feel like I want to be a beach bum because I'll see you go Wake up right every other day.

229
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,699
Speaker 1: Go to the beach fall asleep wake up again Go swimming come back to the beach.

230
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,630
Speaker 0: You know what I see in the future life of the beach bum.

231
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,162
Speaker 0: Skin cancer.

232
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,121
Speaker 1: you know what I see Sunscreens not that expensive.

233
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:47,469
Speaker 0: also winter.

234
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,704
Speaker 1: Let's go to Southern California where it's always 76 degrees.

235
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,643
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think we've run the course of this discussion.

236
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,210
Speaker 1: this discussion didn't really go anyway.

237
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:58,865
Speaker 1: I can't say one thing though.

238
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:03,187
Speaker 1: at the beach I for various reasons bought the SPF 15 instead of the SPF 30. why?

239
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,264
Speaker 1: Because I kind of wanted to tan as opposed to just not burning.

240
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:11,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really care about tan I care about not skin cancer.

241
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:16,672
Speaker 1: You know what it worked real well and actually using that sunscreen as opposed to all the other ones I've used.

242
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:20,149
Speaker 1: this is the first time I've ever gone to Wildwood and come back without a sunburn.

243
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:21,542
Speaker 1: Uh-huh first time ever.

244
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:31,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually only get sunburn You know from not applying often enough or not applying to every spot or that sort of or they always the last day.

245
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,079
Speaker 1: Let's go to the beach real quick before we get on the road.

246
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't need sunscreen.

247
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,348
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna burn.

248
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,817
Speaker 1: ah shit We're all burn now.

249
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,490
Speaker 0: It really has nothing to do with the SPF's.

250
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:44,712
Speaker 1: Well the one thing I noticed though is I put it on a lot more because it was the SPF 15.

251
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:46,233
Speaker 1: So I kept putting it on That.

252
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,360
Speaker 0: that's definitely what it is.

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,050
Speaker 1: then you got at the same time.

254
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:54,212
Speaker 0: I tended to put it on once a day and then late in the day would be worn off because it only lasts a few Hours.

255
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,610
Speaker 1: it always avoid put lazy to keep putting it back on because I actually wanted to tan a little bit.

256
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,452
Speaker 1: So I'd be really hard to not just burn but now with the 15 or the 4 or the whatever I'll.

257
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,430
Speaker 1: I'll just kind of slowly tan the whole weekend.

258
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:14,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, I definitely I got a shop around because there was that study that said you know don't stop using sunscreen But you know different.

259
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,644
Speaker 0: well, you know, they're not as effective as you thought they were.

260
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,716
Speaker 0: and then they're like there's this chemical That's in the sunscreen.

261
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:21,141
Speaker 0: It's not sold in the United States.

262
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:22,465
Speaker 0: That supposedly is amazing.

263
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,690
Speaker 0: Well, we haven't verified that.

264
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:35,041
Speaker 0: I haven't verified that I'm saying supposedly supposedly Because I read something like last year that said some chemical is used in all the sunscreens and all the world Except in the United States because it's not FDA approved.

265
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:39,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's super amazing and awesome And we just don't use it here because we're stupid or something like.

266
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,051
Speaker 1: there's also the the scam of SPF 90.

267
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:49,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just stupid also, so I'm gonna do a lot of research and figure out the best Suntan lotion sunscreen, whatever.

268
00:13:49,737 --> 00:14:00,230
Speaker 0: Well sunscreen and suntan lotion and sunblock are three different things I know but I'm gonna buy pretty much the best one of those that my research Tells me to and then I'll buy a big one and then use that.

269
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:10,576
Speaker 1: You know, it's such a shame because on one hand one quarter of my family has a history of skin cancer But on the other hand, I really like laying in the Sun Like it might.

270
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:20,150
Speaker 1: maybe you know, there might be some sort of genetic correlation because Maybe my desire to lay in the Sun is what caused relatives of the past my ancestors to all die of skin cancer.

271
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:25,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'm also next time I go to a doctor I'm gonna have them check out all of my mole freckle things.

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,863
Speaker 0: just you know, why not?

273
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:28,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're more moly than me.

274
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:29,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got like.

275
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:34,725
Speaker 0: I got one on my neck I got one on the back and I got the one on my upper left chest.

276
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,190
Speaker 0: that's been there for like a thousand years.

277
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,052
Speaker 1: See one thing I've always been happy about I've got very few moles and the ones I do are very very small and but Not like.

278
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,608
Speaker 1: the biggest one I've got is like half the size of an eraser.

279
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you know, I got eraser.

280
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:49,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one on my neck is about that big.

281
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:50,759
Speaker 1: Yeah.

282
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,884
Speaker 1: Anyway, well that was talking about nothing.

283
00:14:54,905 --> 00:15:00,346
Speaker 1: That's what you get for Thursdays Especially when we're tired and Scott's whining because I turned off my air conditioner.

284
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,230
Speaker 0: It's a little hot in here.

285
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,126
Speaker 0: Do you want to talk about the all the conventions and stuff for you still do that?

286
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:04,669
Speaker 1: I guess we could.

287
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:12,585
Speaker 1: you know it's Thursday, so it's kind of the night which is kind of weird because a Lot of people listen to like Tuesday and Wednesday like together.

288
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,970
Speaker 1: a lot of people listen to the whole show But a lot of people listen to just Thursday.

289
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:19,929
Speaker 1: So you guys miss out on a lot of the kind of other things we talked about.

Speaker 1: We're gonna be running some like teach and then play sessions with some of the more hardcore board games Where we'll act as a wicked awesome gaming room at Kineticon.

300
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:22,130
Speaker 0: and even when we're not in there We have some front row crew associates who will be in there rocking games from pretty much the entire con.

301
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,823
Speaker 1: So if you like anime or video games or web comics any of those three

302
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:37,870
Speaker 0: or even video games or you know I mean, there's a miniatures gaming room in there and I swear There's like the same old guys every year go in there and play like a miniatures war for like the whole weekend.

303
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:40,681
Speaker 1: I really like Kineticon because it's not really an anime con.

304
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,648
Speaker 1: It's just a geek con straight up and it doesn't really pretend to be Anything else?

305
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:54,250
Speaker 0: Yeah it's got a little bit of anime styling like on the face of it and I guess the majority of the crowd is sort of like the anime con ish fan crowd, but it's not really a big con.

306
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,190
Speaker 0: It's sort of like just the right size.

307
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,210
Speaker 0: You can be comfortable and most of the merchandise in the dealer's room is anime con type merchandise.

308
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,596
Speaker 0: But you know, it's.

309
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,470
Speaker 0: it's got some comic book action going on.

310
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,564
Speaker 0: It's got gaming heart really awesome game room was.

311
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:09,890
Speaker 1: Kineticon is really cool in that.

312
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,222
Speaker 1: That's the con where they really pretty much they.

313
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,869
Speaker 1: let us test new events there.

314
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,126
Speaker 1: So when we're gonna do a new live show like we come up with hey What do we do a panel about Semprene?

315
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:27,950
Speaker 1: All right Well, let's put it together and then we do it always for a test audience at Kineticon And that's kind of the place where they really let us play around with like formats of things and it's worked really well for us.

316
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:32,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's you know, cuz it's so small and such It's really easy to you know.

317
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,083
Speaker 0: sort of have our run of the place and then like kind of.

318
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:43,841
Speaker 1: the example I would give is if you see it like One of our live shows that Otakon or Penny Arcade Expo or any of those like Baker katsu con They're kind of chair facing forward.

319
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:44,845
Speaker 1: We give a talk.

320
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,852
Speaker 1: We teach you something We do something.

321
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,397
Speaker 1: Kineticon is the.

322
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:52,170
Speaker 1: we're sitting backwards in the chairs kind of just chilling and talking with our crowd.

323
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,439
Speaker 1: Yep, like hey, so we're talking about this.

324
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,524
Speaker 1: What do you guys think about this?

325
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:56,970
Speaker 1: What would make this bla bla bla bla?

326
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,535
Speaker 1: Hey great to hear from you.

327
00:17:58,735 --> 00:17:59,719
Speaker 1: Hmm.

328
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,299
Speaker 0: So the weekend after Kineticon the second weekend in August is the Otakon.

329
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,148
Speaker 0: Otakon.

330
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:10,307
Speaker 1: Otakon is pretty much the best anime convention in America.

331
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:13,919
Speaker 0: Yep Been to it for the past six or seven years.

332
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've paid for one Otakon.

333
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,616
Speaker 1: good god We've been doing panels there.

334
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,070
Speaker 0: I think I've paid for two or three, but that's about it.

335
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you didn't jump in on that anime club summit action as quickly as I did not really my bag.

336
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,870
Speaker 1: But yeah, well that was my first foray into doing panels with those club summits back in the day.

337
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:38,730
Speaker 1: But Otakon we're actually doing two panels this year Which is kind of cool because they denied a lot of people panels and yet they gave us two because we're awesome.

338
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, well being panelists for every figure but we're talking about.

339
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,779
Speaker 0: Well, should we reveal what we're talking about?

340
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

341
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:46,025
Speaker 1: All right.

342
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,130
Speaker 1: What are our panels?

343
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:48,827
Speaker 0: one of the panels.

344
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,970
Speaker 0: One of the panels is the panel I've wanted to do for a long time.

345
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:04,030
Speaker 1: but look we're doing know your creator exactly where we talk about like people who create anime and manga and Studios and directors and composers and all these things.

346
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,730
Speaker 0: We're not really gonna go in-depth in any particular creators.

347
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,267
Speaker 0: The idea is that a lot of you know people out there who are anime fans.

348
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,110
Speaker 0: manga fans.

349
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:16,110
Speaker 0: They don't pay attention to who makes their anime to who makes their manga.

350
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,840
Speaker 0: They couldn't tell you, you know, they could name maybe three anime directors.

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:33,929
Speaker 0: They could name maybe you know, three manga artists Whereas, you know, they could tell you if they'd also like movies or you know American live-action movies or books or they could tell you directs all of them or they could tell you all the actors are.

352
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:34,953
Speaker 0: they could Everything.

353
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,181
Speaker 0: so how come not with the anime and the manga?

354
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,570
Speaker 0: so is to encourage people to pay attention to that.

355
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,349
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a panel sort of telling them who all the big names are.

356
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:48,290
Speaker 1: I mean think of this when we like, you know, we're big in the anime convention stuff and anime podcasting.

357
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:57,970
Speaker 1: But when I first met Daryl Surratt over an anime world order when I was slightly drunk at Katsu Yeah, they're sort of to blame for this thing because you know I was one of those people who didn't pay attention at all.

358
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,817
Speaker 1: I didn't pay attention who made anything.

359
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:02,186
Speaker 1: and then Daryl Surratt comes up to me and he's got.

360
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,390
Speaker 1: he puts a recorder in my face.

361
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:04,769
Speaker 1: He's like, can you name?

362
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,480
Speaker 1: Anyone who directs anime?

363
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:18,100
Speaker 1: I think other than Miyazaki and I was like, uh Ikuhara Tezuka that That's all I would have been able to say back then.

364
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,633
Speaker 0: is those and I might have been able to say oh gee I don't think I had.

365
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,360
Speaker 0: I didn't even know Satoshi khan at that point.

366
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now we've met him.

367
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,429
Speaker 1: I've touched him.

368
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was.

369
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,182
Speaker 1: that was it was a good experience touching Satoshi khan.

370
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,667
Speaker 1: I hope to do it again someday.

371
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:31,610
Speaker 0: was he smooth?

372
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,710
Speaker 1: He was so smooth and deadly.

373
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:52,904
Speaker 1: And the other panel where anime you should see yeah, which is sort of this generic kind of black panel of hey The thing is Scott, you know in the internal geek nights Scott is pissy and down on pretty much every panel we ever do.

374
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,330
Speaker 0: Why what are you talking about?

375
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,806
Speaker 1: He always complains that we shouldn't do that panel and we shouldn't do that panel more than once.

376
00:20:57,826 --> 00:20:58,489
Speaker 1: that panels lame.

377
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,318
Speaker 0: We're talking about the point all.

378
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:06,390
Speaker 0: the only thing I was a about is you know enemy you should see is an okay panel.

379
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,040
Speaker 1: It's an incredibly important panel.

380
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,120
Speaker 1: the

381
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:20,201
Speaker 0: principle behind it is sort of generic and I was also kind of a because You the wanted us to do the gecky a panel again at the New York anime festival Even though he already did the gecky a panel at the New York anime festival,

382
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,290
Speaker 1: even though we're running it basically completely differently.

383
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,515
Speaker 0: It's not completely different.

384
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:23,857
Speaker 1: Also.

385
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,730
Speaker 0: Yes, it's mostly it's it's only a little bit differently.

386
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,990
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is is that It's not every pan.

387
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,750
Speaker 0: All the other panels are awesome and anime you should see is still an okay panel because we're awesome and we can make any panel.

388
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,232
Speaker 0: Awesome.

389
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,898
Speaker 1: I just don't get like panels like that.

390
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,625
Speaker 1: What why is generic a bad thing?

391
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,176
Speaker 0: I didn't say it was a bad thing I just said it was generic.

392
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:48,653
Speaker 1: and a and a it's not at all It is.

393
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,950
Speaker 1: how is it a to talk to people speak any medium any genre of thing?

394
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,730
Speaker 1: Like are into board gaming and you just take give a talk where all right all you nubs you're new into this.

395
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,626
Speaker 1: Here's all the like the important games that no one will ever tell you about it.

396
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:02,510
Speaker 1: You won't find out about it.

397
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,044
Speaker 0: So I guess it's just not a very glamorous panel to be running.

398
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,610
Speaker 1: Oh, so glamour is what you're after.

399
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:08,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, perhaps.

400
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:11,064
Speaker 1: besides I point out that majesty.

401
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:18,748
Speaker 1: perhaps also if you're going for glamour Those are actually the panels that get the most traction are like the game shows and the generically titled panel.

402
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:19,530
Speaker 0: Those are glamorous.

403
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,050
Speaker 1: The game shows how are they more glamorous than this in terms?

404
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,490
Speaker 1: I mean the crowds the same get a gigantic yelling crowd special guests making the game show glamorous.

405
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, getting like Peter Fernandez.

406
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:33,310
Speaker 0: Yes, if they had a special guest that enemy you should see instant majesty.

407
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:39,698
Speaker 0: All right, two weeks after Otakon so Otakon Then the weekend after that.

408

00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:23,170
Speaker 1: I was the one who drove Scott to Novi Michigan.

422
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:24,576
Speaker 0: Probably never gonna be.

423
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:33,390
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be west of the Mississippi for many a year Until recently when I flew out to Arizona to see my mom and I hadn't been west of Chicago.

424
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:39,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I've been east to Israel which I guess is the middle of the east but I've never.

425
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,650
Speaker 0: I've never been farther west then, you know, no by Michigan.

426
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:49,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're actually doing an event at the penny arcade Expo called beyond dungeons and dragons.

427
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:56,207
Speaker 0: We're gonna be talking all about You know all the indie RPGs and the RPGs that are not like D&D and other D&D like our.

428
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:56,347
Speaker 0: and

429
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:11,667
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say one thing Now this if this sounds cool to you because I think this sounds really cool but we're going to begin like the kind of the brief bit that we're gonna introduce this panel with is and I title it affectionately a Brief history of Dungeons & Dragons as told through its character sheet.

430
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:16,160
Speaker 0: Yep Oh They will.

431
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:20,499
Speaker 0: I've already put Non D&D games like throw in a shatter on character sheet.

432
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:23,527
Speaker 1: I've already got all that together that that I'm so proud of.

433
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:26,082
Speaker 1: that little presentation Yep, that little five-minute bit.

434
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,210
Speaker 0: That's a good way to start it off.

435
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:35,499
Speaker 0: But basically that the thesis of this panel is you guys out there, you know, you might like comic books But you know this indie comic books that are way cool, right?

436
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,584

00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:41,184
Speaker 0: Obviously, this is penny arcade Expo You know, there's indie video games like indie PC games.

438
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,290
Speaker 0: They're always way cool, right?

439
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:44,679
Speaker 0: But when it comes to role-playing games, what do you like?

440
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,543
Speaker 0: Dungeons & Dragons?

441

Speaker 1: Crystal City is not a separate city.

452

Speaker 0: Why does it have the word city?

453
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:34,169
Speaker 1: Crystal City is the name of that mall that's connected to it.

Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's the convention news there.

456
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:53,670
Speaker 0: There are some other events We may or may not attend and we are may or may not run an event of a small event of some kind.

457
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:54,912
Speaker 0: It's in the works.

458
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,495
Speaker 0: But for now, that's it.

459
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,116
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

460
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,830
Speaker 1: Well, that was kind of random.

461
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,727
Speaker 1: I guess we'll just do some things in the day and then get on with it.

462
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:09,006
Speaker 0: Yeah Get on with it.

463
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,558
Speaker 0: So, uh, it's all this.

464
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:17,844
Speaker 1: then this is this is one of my reserve things of the day But it's something I've known about forever.

465
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:18,750
Speaker 1: I always saw links to it.

466
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:25,107
Speaker 1: I never really went to and I finally went there the other day and I ended up wasting about two hours on this site.

467
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:36,150
Speaker 1: It's Passive-aggressive and the idea is you know, sometimes someone's so passive-aggressive that they won't Do something about something like I don't know your roommate eats all your food.

468
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,879
Speaker 1: You don't say hey roommate get the fuck out.

469
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:39,823
Speaker 1: or hey roommate.

470
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:41,890
Speaker 1: Stop eating my fucking Cheerios you ass.

471
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:50,348
Speaker 1: Instead you write a little note saying please stop eating my stuff and you stick it where you know They'll see it, you know avoiding confrontation that sort of thing.

472
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:53,910
Speaker 1: Nothing is funnier to me than reading those sorts of notes.

473
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:02,640
Speaker 1: this website is a place where if you see a note like that take a picture of it and put it online for Everyone to enjoy most of those bright fake though.

474
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,550
Speaker 1: No, actually a lot of them are very clearly not fake.

475
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,373
Speaker 0: How could you tell?

476
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:13,097
Speaker 1: because I've the kinds of notes that are on this site are the notes that I've seen Many many a time in the real world.

477
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:13,720
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

478
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,482
Speaker 0: What can I give you?

479
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,446
Speaker 0: some example notes?

480
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:16,610
Speaker 1: I don't have any up here.

481
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,030
Speaker 1: What do you offer me an example note?

482
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,750
Speaker 1: A lot of them are notes that like a company you'll put up like someone stole someone's lunch.

483
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:25,506
Speaker 1: So someone writes a note like to the person stealing the lunches.

484
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:26,210
Speaker 1: blah blah blah.

485
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,019
Speaker 0: Okay, I see you're talking about yeah, okay.

486
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,789
Speaker 1: I could see that or a lot of times a lot most of it.

487
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:38,630
Speaker 1: It's like half People in businesses writing notes because they're afraid of confronting other people at their business.

488
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:43,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other half is college kids who just never learned how to confront people.

489
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:53,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I guess the other 1% you know rounding that's not accounted for are the ultra hilarious Just like crazy ones that have all these follow-ups.

490
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,939
Speaker 0: I mean there have to be fake ones on there.

491
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,290
Speaker 1: right people do a good job of verifying them.

492
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:02,550
Speaker 1: It looks like because a lot of times they'll be follow-up threads and people will like here's what happened the next day.

493
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:03,766
Speaker 1: Here's the response.

494
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:04,030
Speaker 1: note.

495
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,949
Speaker 0: Just be really good at telling a story.

496
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,563
Speaker 1: Okay, it fine.

497
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:10,450
Speaker 1: Maybe one's fake.

498
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,647
Speaker 0: Great, maybe one Is fake.

499
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,214
Speaker 1: Seriously go read this side.

500
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,941
Speaker 1: I get the impression that these are almost all.

501
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:22,419
Speaker 1: I would guess that 90% of these are legitimate rather Legitimate or not.

502
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:25,745
Speaker 0: they're fun, but at the point I'm trying to get at is whether they're fake or not.

503
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:27,553
Speaker 0: if they're funny What what does it matter?

504
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:29,681
Speaker 1: case in point the classic?

505
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,310
Speaker 0: Hey crackhead hey crack, and that's great.

506
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,550
Speaker 0: And was that was the thing of the day was doesn't early thing?

507
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,870
Speaker 1: I'm sure that was the thing of the day.

508
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:40,673
Speaker 0: I don't know if I use this as a thing of day or not and if it's a repeat I don't give a shit.

509
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:44,185
Speaker 0: This is you've probably seen this if you're on the Internet's at all.

510
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:45,649
Speaker 0: It's basically office war.

511
00:28:45,710 --> 00:29:05,490
Speaker 0: now when it comes to things like water balloons or nerf or you know other sorts of non-lethal toy weaponry Everyone from when they're a child to even when you're growing up a little bit you imagine having really elaborate Well adjudicated battles with these things.

512
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,674
Speaker 0: You know I mean like when your kids you always have a water balloon fight But you never have like a real.

513
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:20,061
Speaker 0: you always really want to have like a serious water balloon fight with like shit tons of water balloons and like you have like Bandoliers of water balloons and the whole thing going on.

514
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:25,601
Speaker 0: you actually want people to say you know like have some sort of Rules of winning and losing and there's some appeal to that.

515
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:30,748
Speaker 0: I don't understand what it is, but it's it's a desire I know I've had and I know a lot of other people have also had.

516
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,857
Speaker 0: so Vision a vision.

517
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:40,970
Speaker 1: I have a vision of everyone in the front row crew Agreeing to an arsenal all buying a standard loadout of nerf equipment and then going nuts.

518
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:50,467
Speaker 0: I think tribes do is much better idea, but anyway, you know what we have a better pulling off the former Perhaps I say perhaps a lot today.

519
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,699
Speaker 0: so nerf You know that nerf for a while right?

520
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,164
Speaker 0: I don't know if everyone was.

521
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:01,310
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone listening knows about nerf But nerf basically makes foam toys

522
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:03,621
Speaker 1: I don't think you need to explain most

523
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:13,335
Speaker 0: of that and they're famous for their foam Weapons in addition to their foam footballs mostly the foam weapons and for many years their foam weapons have been Sort of subpar.

524
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:21,843
Speaker 0: because if you know over protection of kids and all that sort of bullshit You know the nerf weapons you could buy in the store were not what they were when we were kids.

525
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:25,969
Speaker 0: the selection is decreased the power And accuracy is decreased.

526
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,660
Speaker 0: The quality of the weapons overall is decreasing me.

527
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,347
Speaker 0: there's no nerf bow and arrow anymore.

528
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,130
Speaker 0: what happened to it?

529
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,290
Speaker 0: You know, meanwhile the original nerf bow and arrow kicked ass like one of the best toys ever made.

530
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:40,524
Speaker 1: I remember they were so hard to get that over Christmas.

531
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:41,930
Speaker 1: My brother got one.

532
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,922
Speaker 0: It's like nerf bow and arrow is like on the Super Soaker level of toy, but I didn't.

533
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:50,795
Speaker 1: I got a knockoff Robin Hood bow and arrow Useless.

534
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,610
Speaker 1: my parents knew it's just what are they gonna do that?

535
00:30:52,911 --> 00:31:01,589
Speaker 1: One of the kids was gonna be disappointed just by don't buy anything and then wait And deny us a nerf bow and arrow.

536
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:03,901
Speaker 0: Well, no is you buy give one.

537
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,590
Speaker 0: you say I'll get another one as soon as I can.

538
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,169
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know long it took for those to be back in stock.

539
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,368
Speaker 0: That's you know, that's what it takes.

540
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:16,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, so nerf, I guess they're attempting to make a comeback which is fine by me.

541
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,490
Speaker 0: And what they've done is they've done something that's actually pretty extraordinary.

542
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:34,742
Speaker 0: Number one someone in nerf must realize what makes nerf awesome because They they realize that people want to have these organized, you know People have this fantasy of organized serious total all-out nerf war.

543
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:44,693
Speaker 0: they realize this fantasy exists and they made a video That sort of works towards fulfilling that fantasy or stoking the fires of that fantasy To.

544
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:51,730
Speaker 0: they have re-upped their equipment it seems because in this video There are many many awesome nerf things.

545
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:59,230
Speaker 0: For example, the nerf sniper rifle something which used to be only made in the homebrew arena is now an official product.

546
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:05,450
Speaker 0: They've got the nerf like electronic minigun with the chain of suction cup arrow.

547
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,377
Speaker 1: I had the old hand crank minigun.

548
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:12,710
Speaker 1: It was the last nerf item I ever got and while it was awesome the Belt feed was prone to jam.

549
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,548
Speaker 0: This is basically like a Maxim machine gun of nerf right and when they pull the thing out, it's like oh man.

550
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:29,424
Speaker 1: and I remember that my the biggest fantasy I had early on as a kid was when I started getting all these nerf guns was I wanted a pistol that I cocked and then fired instead of a kind of bow action.

551
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,270
Speaker 1: and they made that back in the day.

552
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:32,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost right away.

553
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:37,612
Speaker 0: Well, we I had the ones that hold three arrows and you wouldn't conk and fire You.

554
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,241
Speaker 0: just you know, it's sort of like those.

555
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:40,890
Speaker 1: watch out those little black arrow.

556
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,559
Speaker 0: Yeah you know the water guns that work by suction like that.

557
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:46,914
Speaker 0: you'd sort of fill them up and then you pull the two ends close to Each other.

558
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,126
Speaker 0: that's like a shotgun.

559
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:49,654
Speaker 0: almost That's how this worked.

560
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:49,714
Speaker 0: is?

561
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:57,264
Speaker 0: you would pull the front of the gun forward and then pull it back and it would just your own The force of your arm would push the air to shoot the air.

562
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:57,706
Speaker 1: I had that.

563
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:58,570
Speaker 1: it was my sidearm.

564
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,039
Speaker 1: What I also did was I learned is those little black arrows.

565
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,990
Speaker 1: if you threw them like a knife they flew perfectly.

566
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:07,208
Speaker 0: They're really the most aerodynamic arrows, I love those arrows.

567
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:11,460
Speaker 0: anyway You know They've also got like velcro things going on and the whole bit now.

568
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:19,669
Speaker 0: the other thing to nerf has managed to do here with this Video is not only advertise their products stoke the fires of you know, a fantasy that many people have etc.

569
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:27,523
Speaker 0: This is perhaps the first example I've seen of someone Intentionally attempting to make a you know viral video.

570
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:39,007
Speaker 0: That's also an obvious advertisement Because I mean it has to be an advertisement because they're unreleased nerf equipment's in here and the video production quality is very very high and the quantity of equipment could not be had.

571
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:44,879
Speaker 0: and let's nerve for provided it Is that they actually made a good thing.

572
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,730
Speaker 0: it's like this is a good video and they made it on purpose.

573
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:48,916
Speaker 1: Yep, it's any time.

574
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:51,510
Speaker 1: when have you seen there's one other time in my life?

575
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,941
Speaker 1: It was also recently when we were at James and Lisa's wedding.

576
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,330
Speaker 1: There was also Stanley Cup playoff action.

577
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:09,150
Speaker 1: So, you know, we're of course we're watching hockey in the hotel room instead of hanging out because that's what you do Actually, we had a bunch of everyone came to our hotel room We all hung out and then the hotel guy was like you can't all sleep in this room.

578
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,179
Speaker 1: They were like, we're not gonna go away.

579
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:11,944
Speaker 0: I was watching hockey.

580
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:12,748
Speaker 1: your hotel sucks.

581
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,356
Speaker 0: He sure did.

582
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:16,107
Speaker 0: We should have stayed at the motel.

583
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:16,530
Speaker 0: Whatever right?

584
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,552
Speaker 1: I sure did.

585
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:21,446
Speaker 1: All right, and this ad came on and this it's one of the.

586
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:22,710
Speaker 1: this ad was so funny.

587
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,315
Speaker 0: I was a good ad I was.

588
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:29,500
Speaker 1: not only did I watch it and like it and seek it out on the internet to watch Again, but I find it.

589
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:30,244
Speaker 1: I found it.

590
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:31,190
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still on YouTube.

591
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:41,370
Speaker 1: I'll find it again and post a link but it's basically this guy and It's like in the maternity ward and there's all the babies behind the glass and all the parents are there and you know the nursery.

592
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,092
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah everyone's looking.

593
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,889
Speaker 1: and then suddenly he starts banging on the glass and screaming and yelling and just.

594
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,498
Speaker 1: And then he starts pointing at all the other babies.

595
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,945
Speaker 1: he's like you suck you suck you suck.

596
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:57,490
Speaker 1: best baby ever right there best Baby ever you suck you suck.

597
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:10,476
Speaker 0: It was such hockey right there banging on the glass Pointed at everyone in the other team saying you suck you suck you suck as baby and then pointed at the guy in your team And saying oh, yeah, awesome It's funny out.

598
00:35:10,537 --> 00:35:18,650
Speaker 1: sports commercials in general seem to do this like sports commercials Understand the fans of their respective sports better than almost any other advertising I ever see.

599
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:29,770
Speaker 0: Yep, and this is a this is this nerf Viral intentional commercial meme thing actually works and really understands the feeling that us kind of people have for nerve.

600
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,967
Speaker 1: so Scott tomorrow What are you gonna be doing in the morning waking up too goddamn early?

601
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,374
Speaker 1: Yeah Why is that?

602
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:43,172
Speaker 0: because I get one of the stupid iPhones if I don't get one tomorrow And

603
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:53,585
Speaker 1: we need one for our company because we got to test it because pretty much we all want to switch to it And we got to make sure we can do all of all the same things we do with our blackberries with the iPhone the exchange integration and all that.

604
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:58,230
Speaker 1: so We had to draw lots to see who's gonna stand in line and get an iPhone tomorrow.

605
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:08,227
Speaker 0: I mean if that's what you want to test you could have just gotten a first-generation iPhone and upgraded the Software on it, and you'd be the same exact thing.

606
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:14,270
Speaker 1: yeah Basically because they announced all the exchange stuff after the first one came out and we want the newest one anyway.

607
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:17,990
Speaker 0: So I mean of course you want the newest one, but yeah, you know to test exchange.

608
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,539
Speaker 1: There were a few ways around this however.

609
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,900
Speaker 0: This is the most fun way yes, so anyway I'm gonna go wait in line.

610
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,675
Speaker 0: now the question is which line Do I waited?

611
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,786
Speaker 1: I would go to an AT&T store because there are AT&T stores.

612
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:31,790
Speaker 0: there are Apple stores.

613
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,140
Speaker 0: There's multiple of each in Manhattan.

614
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,218
Speaker 0: does even AT&T stores up here in Beacon area Store in Danbury, Connecticut?

615
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:41,840
Speaker 0: I could go to.

616
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,025
Speaker 1: it's obvious if I were you.

617
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:53,189
Speaker 1: what I would have done is long ago taking the day off work and just camped out the Apple the AT&T store up near here because Far fewer people are gonna try to camp that thing out.

618
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:56,319
Speaker 0: Ah, but the steeply supply will also be lower.

619
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:03,910
Speaker 0: for example if I go to the Apple store in the city sure I might wait Two hours, but they probably have a few thousand iPhones in there.

620
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,558
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm gonna get Scott the Apple store.

621
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:10,048
Speaker 1: How many people do you think are already lined up probably right now?

622
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:10,730
Speaker 0: right now?

623
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,577
Speaker 0: I'm it's actually quite surprising.

624
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:21,894
Speaker 0: I just probably less than less than 200 there right now I don't know I. I went to an AT&T store and asked her place and I said How many iPhones you gonna get?

625
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:25,925
Speaker 0: and of course they said we don't know okay, then I said one no no.

626
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:32,710
Speaker 0: then I said um Last time when the first iPhone came out how many people were there in line outside?

627
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:37,770
Speaker 0: And she said oh about 250, and I said how many of those people got iPhones?

628
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,600
Speaker 0: And she said all of them.

629
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:46,130
Speaker 0: so that makes me go Aha, ha ha you see you just have to learn to ask the tricky questions.

630
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,125
Speaker 0: This is why I have a tiny bit of journalism skills.

631
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:49,950
Speaker 0: course not much.

632
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:56,563
Speaker 1: We felt a tiny bit when we were trying to get Sensitive information out of the people for that World of Warcraft miniatures game.

633
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,550
Speaker 1: We were like so how's the game work?

634
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,098
Speaker 1: We can't talk about gameplay so suppose.

635
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:14,190
Speaker 0: I'm playing can't talk about game, but I think they were just much Better at not answering questions, so they actually use judgment whereas this person Just only you know didn't answer the one question.

636
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,260
Speaker 0: They weren't allowed to answer and answered every other question.

637
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,708
Speaker 1: also probably didn't care.

638
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,856
Speaker 0: also Did still knowing people.

639
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,059
Speaker 1: most people actually don't.

640
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,290
Speaker 1: most people probably don't even realize they can go to an AT&T store.

641
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:29,190
Speaker 0: The other thing is that at the AT&T store the people there were actually friendly and knowledgeable.

642
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:29,592
Speaker 0: It was.

643
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:32,810
Speaker 1: it was quite unlike the Apple store where they beat you as you walk in.

644
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:39,255
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying it's like I'm compared to say what you would expect from an average wireless You know store.

645
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:39,999
Speaker 1: can you say this?

646
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,110
Speaker 0: I went to the wireless companies is evil and stupid.

647
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,738
Speaker 1: I went to the Verizon store.

648
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:47,814
Speaker 0: the other I mean like remember how it was in the Sprint store for you Don't?

649
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:50,529
Speaker 1: I could do a whole Monday on Sprint right and so.

650
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:56,694
Speaker 0: So because I'm gonna be waiting in this line tomorrow possibly with my boss also Cuz his trio.

651
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:08,564
Speaker 0: he went swimming with his trio by accident, so now he's thinking about iPhones even though He always complained that didn't have a real keyboard, but once a long time ago He's asking me like text messaging when I get in line.

652
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:14,370
Speaker 1: when I was very drunk I ended up showering with my phone in my pocket, but it didn't hurt it right anyway.

653
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:19,288
Speaker 0: So yeah because of this waiting in line that's gonna happen.

654
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:20,996
Speaker 0: tomorrow We'll talk about the iPhone itself.

655
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:24,670
Speaker 0: you know two Mondays from now when actually I've had a lot of time with it and such.

656
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,683
Speaker 0: But I figured we could do it Thursday on waiting in line.

657
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:33,220
Speaker 0: cuz we've waited in on quite a many line We have the biggest thing you have to know.

658
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:38,460
Speaker 1: we've learned this lesson very very powerfully But we had a chance to meet someone very eminent one.

659
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:46,490
Speaker 0: see I think actually in the episode where we talked about this We discussed waiting in line Which is why I feel like we've done a waiting in line episode before.

660
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:55,484
Speaker 0: But if we haven't done a waiting in line episode if we have done a waiting in line episode before oh well Sorry, but we I gotta wake up early.

661
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:58,590
Speaker 1: We've decided Oh, let's camp out And then this will be awesome.

662
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,537
Speaker 1: And then we kind of both bailed because neither one of us Really wanted to camp out.

663
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:05,894
Speaker 1: and why don't we just wait till morning and we'll take an early ish Training.

664
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,068
Speaker 1: don't have to take the first train in.

665
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:13,967
Speaker 1: yeah I realize we'll get in the way of this awesome thing and we ended up totally failing as a result.

666
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,537
Speaker 0: the thing is we were Pretty close to succeeding.

667
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:18,865
Speaker 1: there was yes, but we didn't want it enough.

668
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,010
Speaker 0: No we didn't want it.

669
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,470
Speaker 0: And that's really when you're waiting in line.

670
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,163
Speaker 0: There's a decision-making process that happens and you have to weigh three things right.

671
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,310
Speaker 0: how badly do you want?

672
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:29,470
Speaker 0: well?

673
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 0: What are you gonna get for waiting in line right?

674
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,569
Speaker 0: How badly do you want that thing that you're waiting in line for?

675
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,169
Speaker 0: Right and then how long do you have to wait in line to get what you want?

676
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:47,196
Speaker 0: Because you know some lines you just wait in them And you're eventually gonna get what you want.

677
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:54,002
Speaker 0: like say if you go to cedar point if you wait in a line to ride a Rollercoaster oh no no no you're going to ride it.

678
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:55,970
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not always true.

679
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, at all didn't?

680
00:40:57,115 --> 00:40:59,103
Speaker 0: they close the park, and then they cut off the line.

681
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:06,884
Speaker 1: now because you see Oftentimes a particular ride for various reasons some routes are more prone to this than others will break down.

682
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:08,628
Speaker 1: ah and what happens?

683
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:08,989
Speaker 1: is this?

684
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,575
Speaker 1: Incredible calculus.

685
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:23,390
Speaker 1: where I'm in line and I see that the line is not moved in a while And I look up and I see some people Abandoning the line as root word spreads that the rides down and people are trying to guess when it is why when you're in a?

686
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,729
Speaker 0: Long line for a ride you spread a rumor that the ride is broken down when it has not here.

687
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,298
Speaker 1: see There's the reason that doesn't work.

688
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:31,490
Speaker 1: is that canny people who go to amusement parks?

689
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:39,841
Speaker 1: You don't pay attention to a rumor that comes from the back of the line And no one in the front of the line has any incentive.

690
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,589
Speaker 0: that's true granted.

691
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:47,127
Speaker 1: ah The real trick is just to cut Because I'll admit this I'm just horrible.

692
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:53,227
Speaker 1: But the majority of people are too passive too passive to actually do anything about it.

693
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,057
Speaker 0: if you cut in front of them Yeah, well here's the thing about cutting.

694
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,324
Speaker 0: It's like you know you cut in front of.

695
00:41:58,364 --> 00:41:59,990
Speaker 0: let's say you cut in front of an asshole.

696
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:04,468
Speaker 0: Right he'll be all like gravel gravel gravel gravel, so you say all right man.

697
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,596
Speaker 0: Just chill Then you just cut.

698
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,070
Speaker 0: you know a little bit in front of that.

699
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,004
Speaker 0: You're not cutting directly in front of the asshole somehow.

700
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,815
Speaker 0: He has no problem with it He can't you know?

701
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:17,756
Speaker 0: even though the effect on him is the same He's still one spot further back in line.

702
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:18,980
Speaker 1: see the thing is secret.

703
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,789
Speaker 1: point actually did something really good when whenever you if they caught Someone cutting in line they did have people who were semi undercover watching for it.

704
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:29,270
Speaker 1: They literally dragged you out of the park with no refund immediately.

705
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a game.

706
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:33,184
Speaker 1: I I watch it happen a lot of course.

707
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:34,328
Speaker 1: I also cut in line, but I was.

708
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:34,529
Speaker 1: well.

709
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,074
Speaker 0: Here's the thing right all right.

710
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:37,198
Speaker 0: well cutting in line.

711
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:44,485
Speaker 0: obviously you want to try to pull off cutting in line if you can But you don't want to cut in line to the point where you have to suffer the consequences.

712
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:47,650
Speaker 1: That's Are we gonna explain how to cut in line?

713
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,273
Speaker 1: It's a very specific process.

714
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:55,030
Speaker 0: I will tell you the best line cutter in the entire universe is my grandmother.

715
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,658
Speaker 1: ah See she has an advantage being old.

716
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,060
Speaker 1: well.

717
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,210
Speaker 0: No no no even when she was not old she would write.

718
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:02,150
Speaker 0: So we're in law she demonstrate.

719
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:13,689
Speaker 0: I know she's used this skill many times in movie theaters and other places, but it was only demonstrated to me and only one Currents that I can actually remember even though I have stories of other times when I wasn't there.

720
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:18,330
Speaker 0: We were at I believe Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York City.

721
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,853
Speaker 0: This is like many years ago perhaps even a decade ago I don't know.

722
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:28,831
Speaker 0: um and as a line and my grandma we weren't in the line right, but the line is sort of going down the Street.

723
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:36,899
Speaker 0: we just sort of standing on the sidewalk and my grandma just strikes up a conversation with this complete stranger in line And I like I don't.

724
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:44,118
Speaker 0: yeah at that time in my life I was not the type to converse with a stranger, but my grandma has no problem Just talking to anybody.

725
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:46,490
Speaker 1: that is in fact the best way to cut it alive.

726
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:56,138
Speaker 0: She just starts talking to the stranger and walking with them and talking and walking to talk and look that we're inside And we didn't have to wait in the line, and I'm like alrighty.

727
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:05,450
Speaker 1: The way I often did it was partly because One of the pastimes in my high school was to skip school and go to cedar point whenever it was warm out.

728
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:14,609
Speaker 1: So a lot of times I'd end up at cedar point like I just kind of cut out of high school and drive down to Cedar point and there'd be a lot of people from my high school there independently of me.

729
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,970
Speaker 1: So this one time the Millennium Force the new when it was the tallest roller coaster in the world they built it.

730
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,355
Speaker 1: It's like this epic thing and I'd been.

731
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:28,181
Speaker 1: I've been looking forward to this since they announced like Intamin was like rollercoasters and all this business.

732
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:33,955
Speaker 1: so we show up and We get into the park like a little bit late And there's a huge line.

733
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:38,630
Speaker 1: huge line not even in the turnstiles yet because the rides don't start right away when the park opens.

734
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:45,030
Speaker 1: So people are lined up, and I see that in the very front of this line is my good friend Adam.

735
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:51,790
Speaker 1: Yeah So uh we I walked by and I've got a huge group of people with me because we all cut class at the same day.

736
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,298
Speaker 1: Kind of random wasn't senior skip day.

737
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,270
Speaker 1: It was just we just all skipped.

738
00:44:56,078 --> 00:45:03,510
Speaker 1: So we're all walking in this big group And if I had tried to just do it by myself because other people were so pumped about it We totally would have gotten busted.

739
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:24,027
Speaker 1: but this giant group with me in it kind of stops next to the line and we all talk and then the line starts walking in and You saw this moment of decision and like three or four smart people including me in this mob that was standing next to the line Took quick action and slipped in in the chaos and everyone else kind of stood there going.

740
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:24,930
Speaker 1: hey, what's going on?

741
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,475
Speaker 1: Hey, where'd you guys go?

742
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:27,740
Speaker 1: But then it was too late.

743
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how's done.

744
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:30,670
Speaker 0: so the thing here right?

745
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,289
Speaker 0: We've discussed how to cut in a line.

746
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:37,930
Speaker 0: How do you what do you do when people are cutting in front of you because you say get the fuck out of line?

747
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:43,270
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you see people cutting way ahead of you you say hey, hey, hey, are you get the hell out?

748
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,394
Speaker 1: You cut exactly like that.

749
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:45,600
Speaker 1: That's how you have to go.

750
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:45,841
Speaker 1: Hey.

751
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:46,122
Speaker 1: Hey.

752
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:46,463
Speaker 1: Hey.

753
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:50,202
Speaker 1: Yep, at least in New York There might be a different way of doing if you West.

754
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:50,705
Speaker 0: you know.

755
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:51,650
Speaker 0: if you do so.

756
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:54,240
Speaker 0: We've said people are very not.

757
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,725
Speaker 0: most people don't want to have.

758
00:45:55,745 --> 00:45:56,990
Speaker 0: you know a confrontation, right?

759
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,750
Speaker 0: So if you you know cut in line, they won't confront you about it.

760
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:09,989
Speaker 0: But at the same time if you confront someone who is trying to cut who is non-confrontational They would rather give up on their cut then confront you.

761
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:17,710
Speaker 1: Also, you can usually call down the threat of something because there's always the external force like in the Nintendo store line.

762
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,790
Speaker 1: If you raised a ruckus about someone cutting Nintendo would have come out and dragged him away.

763
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,563
Speaker 0: It really what it really comes down to is how well the line is enforced.

764
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:31,249
Speaker 0: a very poorly enforced line is pretty much bad news.

765
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:35,578
Speaker 0: that's really what it is a Poorly enforced line.

766
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:44,710
Speaker 0: a line without you know management Is very is pro cutter and a line with lots of management is pro anti cutter.

767
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:54,717
Speaker 0: So if you know a line is gonna have guards or you know official people making sure that everything is legit Then you don't you want to get there early.

768
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:01,986
Speaker 0: if you know a line is gonna be just sort of willy-nilly then Don't worry about when you get there cuz you just cut.

769
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:03,028
Speaker 1: Yep.

770
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:14,070
Speaker 1: Now bonus points if you cut in line and then within a short span of time Prevent someone else from cutting in line by raising a ruckus and no one confronts you about the hypocrisy.

771
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:16,577
Speaker 0: That is a classy move.

772
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,162
Speaker 1: That is a goal in life.

773
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:20,569
Speaker 0: That is that is something you should definitely do.

774
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:24,370
Speaker 1: Uh, of course, one of my favorite things to do in line is to bother other people.

775
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,070
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing about lines.

776
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,452
Speaker 0: It's not.

777
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:27,633
Speaker 0: it's.

778
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:31,290
Speaker 0: the line is not just about achieving what you are there for.

779
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:38,310
Speaker 1: For a lot of people it even though that is the number one thing for a lot of people it is and that's the problem A lot of people if you have to wait in a line somewhere.

780
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,940
Speaker 1: I mean this could be applied generally to any time you're forced to wait for something.

781
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:48,190
Speaker 1: but lines in particular a lot of people one Don't bring any means of entertaining themselves.

782
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,981
Speaker 0: It's definitely something you got to do and thus did.

783
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:57,278
Speaker 1: all the time spent in the line is wasted Yep and to a lot of people Will only see the prize at the end.

784
00:47:57,298 --> 00:48:00,530
Speaker 1: the goal of I'm going to get a thing and this line is my means to it.

785
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:08,479
Speaker 1: But especially with geeky stuff like iPhones or like the Nintendo Store thing or an anime con The line is a self-selected people.

786
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,469
Speaker 1: stop a self-selected set of people.

787
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:14,344
Speaker 0: Yes, you can form you have similar interests.

788
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have a line.

789
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:20,250
Speaker 0: There's almost as line culture this line community that builds and then is dispersed.

790
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,790
Speaker 0: It's like a temporary family and it's it's really something special.

791
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:33,310
Speaker 0: And if you're not gonna take any part in that really of no place waiting in line At least not for a long amount of time, of course watch out because it's very tricky.

792
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:34,819
Speaker 1: So, I mean we were in the line of the Nintendo.

793
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:36,650
Speaker 0: it really depends in who you're in line.

794
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:40,064
Speaker 1: It was pretty much us and the area we like.

795
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:46,840
Speaker 1: there were other cool people our age but all the people in line right near us were Punk kids and they were.

796
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,189
Speaker 1: they were like punk kids that were barely sentience.

797
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:53,807
Speaker 1: Yep, and the conversations that we had with these kids were not shall we say and lightning.

798
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:59,130
Speaker 1: now And I remember we tried to play advance wars with them and that just did not happen.

799
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:05,170
Speaker 0: No, I didn't and there were some cool people near us, but they were mostly quiet and their DS's ran out of batteries.

800
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:08,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one guy who was like, oh man, I love advance wars I'm undefeated.

801
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:12,650
Speaker 1: my group of friends and we were about to play in his battery died immediately.

802
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,534
Speaker 0: Huge taboo.

803
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:18,010
Speaker 0: having any of your devices run out of battery power in a line.

804
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:23,761
Speaker 1: I'll give you the hint if your laptops about to run out of battery Don't be like I shit my battery or don't let it just run out.

805
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:26,050
Speaker 1: just be like I'm done with his laptop.

806
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,370
Speaker 1: I'm gonna relax and kind of shut it down gracefully like nothing's wrong.

807
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:34,070
Speaker 0: Yes, you don't want to let anyone know your batteries ran out because that is taboo.

808
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,579
Speaker 0: That's like like one of the worst things you could do.

809
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,469
Speaker 0: I guess other than stabbing I guess that was awesome.

810
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:47,110
Speaker 1: Of course there's also the danger of it's like anime cons has happened to us where you're in line and The person in front of you may be cool.

811
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:56,579
Speaker 1: You're trying to talk to them But the person in line behind you is one of those people one of those fanboys keeps bothering you and isn't I like Naruto?

812
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,729
Speaker 1: do you like Naruto?

813
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:01,268
Speaker 1: Was talking about the Naruto?

814
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:12,009
Speaker 0: If you encounter those kinds of fanboys out and about it's easy to just run away from them or say see ya What's your I am in order something in order to avoid them?

815
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:18,087
Speaker 0: You would have to like lose your spot in line or find some way to kick them out of line Which good luck with that?

816
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:28,743
Speaker 0: So it really puts you in a predicament and when you get in a line, you really have to decide, you know do you stand there and wait for there to be cool people and then you get in line?

817
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:34,219
Speaker 0: that way your line community is gonna be good or Do you just you know is it?

818
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,070
Speaker 0: you can't wait for the line to get any longer?

819
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,249
Speaker 0: You need to get in now or else you're gonna miss out on whatever it is.

820
00:50:39,672 --> 00:50:41,850
Speaker 1: There's also the issue of do you engage or not?

821
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:52,910
Speaker 1: because if you're in line people will generally leave you alone unless you engage or put yourself in a Kind of body language position where people will look at you and think he wants to be engaged.

822
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:57,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, you know people by default in a line will just not talk not interact.

823
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:04,029
Speaker 0: But as soon as you know someone, you know, try something, you know, then some interacting might happen.

824
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:09,030
Speaker 0: It's like no one will try to interact starts talking right away like whoa, we're in a line.

825
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,120
Speaker 0: Hey guys, what's going on dadada?

826
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,069
Speaker 1: cuz everyone will start paying attention to you.

827
00:51:13,472 --> 00:51:15,610
Speaker 1: You'll get this little kind of crowd around you.

828
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:23,858
Speaker 1: But at the same time if anyone undesirable joins that crowd there is no Safe socially acceptable way to reject them.

829
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:29,390
Speaker 0: and also, you know, if someone doesn't want to interact They're not going to and no one will try to enter.

830
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:36,439
Speaker 0: No one will force them into interacting, you know, like if you just stand there quietly and just mind your own business No one will bother you in a line.

831
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,203
Speaker 0: They'll just ignore you.

832
00:51:37,404 --> 00:51:54,310
Speaker 1: So basically Here's the quickie if someone you don't want to talk to keeps engaging you in a line and you're trying to engage other people Don't you know like be like, oh you suck don't yell at him or anything or don't do anything Active or aggressive because you know what we said, yeah passive-aggressive doesn't really work.

833
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:59,069
Speaker 1: You don't really want to hurt the feelings the person in line behind you because they are only going to bother you.

834
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:13,190
Speaker 0: the rest Yes, and if you do something to get rid of this annoying person in line, you might succeed but you will also Guaranteed make everyone cool in line near you uncomfortable, which is not good Yeah.

835
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:25,460
Speaker 1: so what you do is if they're talking to you you like face them and listen to what they're saying and then Rotate your body about 15 degrees off-axis from them probably to the right.

836
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:42,788
Speaker 1: like if you're facing them kind of have your body your shoulders being 15 degrees away to the right from facing them and still look at them, but don't make direct eye contact and Limit your responses to answers and kind of acknowledgments, but don't like uh-huh.

837
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:43,069
Speaker 0: Yeah

838
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:49,608
Speaker 1: Oh But yeah Gage further and that is pretty much

839
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:49,809
Speaker 0: the

840
00:52:50,450 --> 00:53:02,569
Speaker 1: Safest least harmful way to disengage from one of those people and then after you've been doing that for a while as soon as they Engage anyone else for a moment engage the person you wanted to engage and everything will be nice and neat.

841
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:02,850
Speaker 1: you're done.

842
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:09,543
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can sort of you know when they as you sort of you know Pay less and less attention to them and interact with them less and less.

843
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:15,727
Speaker 0: they might eventually Lash on to someone else and bother them and then you can interact with someone else.

844
00:53:15,808 --> 00:53:18,721
Speaker 1: if you're evil You can force them off on someone.

845
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can make a split.

846
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:21,881
Speaker 0: basically It's like you have a group of four people.

847
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:22,989
Speaker 0: one of them is bad.

848
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:28,410
Speaker 0: Well, you foist the bad one off on to say the fourth one and then you keep the second one and you're all good.

849
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:39,388
Speaker 1: I gotta say though the DS is revolutionized line waiting for nature at least in geeky situations because You're gonna find people to play DS games and there's so many multiplayer DS games.

850
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:43,710
Speaker 0: Yep The iPhone is also gonna be wicked awesome for the line waiting.

851
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:44,622
Speaker 0: I can tell already.

852
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:49,450
Speaker 0: of course It sucks to wait in line for the iPhone which would really helped out while you're in line for itself.

853
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,835
Speaker 1: I just bring your DS.

854
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,570
Speaker 0: I'm bringing the DS laptop, you know, I will go to work right afterwards.

855
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,018
Speaker 0: It's mean the line is right next to my office.

856
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,846
Speaker 0: So, how can I yeah, I gotta I gotta pretty much wait in line Go to work?

857
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:11,323
Speaker 1: Yeah the only reason I'm holding out on the iPhone is because I got to make sure I'm not gonna get it unless I can get My work blackberry and use it as my only like wireless device.

858
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,008
Speaker 0: I don't have work blackberry to worry about.

859
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:13,570
Speaker 0: So here I go.

860
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:16,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I mean I got a curve from work and the curves pretty nice.

861
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:22,085
Speaker 0: Also the App Store which I. well they're good talk about this in a week for Monday Yeah, but anyway, what else about line waiting?

862
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,436
Speaker 1: Can we say well I have a bunch of stories about that time.

863
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:34,750
Speaker 1: me and a bunch of my friends drove this woman insane in line to Cedar Point Like we made her actually like completely freak out and then they actually escorted her out of the line and it wasn't even intentional.

864
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:36,937
Speaker 1: We were dying.

865
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:42,963
Speaker 1: we were being very annoying but It was not like I'm doing this to drive you insane.

866
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,690
Speaker 1: I'm just being annoying because I'm bored.

867
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:47,319
Speaker 0: Well, here here's some general line tips.

868
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,520
Speaker 0: All right, if there are multiple lines Right get in the shorter one.

869
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,770
Speaker 0: now that might seem like an obvious thing, right?

870
00:54:55,151 --> 00:54:56,283
Speaker 0: But it usually isn't.

871
00:54:56,343 --> 00:55:03,078
Speaker 0: for example You might go to an amusement park Right, and there is a water slide.

872
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:10,250
Speaker 0: and like there might be a tower and there might be multiple water slides in the tower But one of the water slides is a much shorter line than the others.

873
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:15,130
Speaker 0: It's probably because that water slide is scarier than the others and people don't want to get on that.

874
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,703
Speaker 0: Oh, it's usually because it's weaker not that from my experience the scarier ones off.

875
00:55:19,743 --> 00:55:26,390
Speaker 1: now from my experience the higher up and faster and Crazier was the longer the line was rarely because now is the Six Flags New England is a tower.

876
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:37,350
Speaker 0: There's two blue slides and then one green slide And if you wanted to go on the green slide You basically just walked up right past everyone and said green slide green slide green slide and went down the green slide.

877
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:41,650
Speaker 1: So I think a better set of tips are the how to make the line interesting.

878
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:45,220
Speaker 1: Those are good too Because the way we drove this woman insane was.

879
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:50,449
Speaker 1: we're in line to see your point and one Get in line with a group of friends and you cannot go wrong.

880
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,957
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You bring your own crew.

881
00:55:53,118 --> 00:56:03,330
Speaker 1: you can't lose because I get when I was a little kid and we get it like I'd be in Family or something for a roller coaster at Cedar Point and the line was always hot and boring and oh my god I just want to ride the ride.

882
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:07,530
Speaker 1: But once I had a car and I started driving down on my own it was me and all my friends.

883
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:15,190
Speaker 1: It was like alright The line is not time wasted because the whole time you're in line your whole group of friends is together.

884
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,355
Speaker 1: Just hang it out.

885
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:19,930
Speaker 1: And then suddenly you're hanging out as interrupted by a roller coaster.

886
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:22,418
Speaker 1: Mmm, so there's all.

887
00:56:22,438 --> 00:56:24,410
Speaker 0: well, there's the line for the front of the roller coaster.

888
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:28,919
Speaker 1: Yes, which is almost always worth it Unless you're a roller coaster freak.

889
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:34,010
Speaker 1: in which case I recommend unless it's a hanging roller coaster You want to sit in the front of the last car?

890
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,261
Speaker 1: That is pretty much the best seat and any non hanging roller coaster.

891
00:56:37,302 --> 00:56:39,650
Speaker 0: Yeah sitting in the back of any car is not so great.

892
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,050
Speaker 1: Well, if you like a rough ride the back the back of the car is fine.

893
00:56:43,231 --> 00:56:49,967
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of the back because the front of the car is kind of Ballasted or balanced by the connection to the car in front of it.

894
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:55,110
Speaker 1: But anyway All we did was I'm standing in line, you know, all these people in high school.

895
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,190
Speaker 1: We're in line for this roller coaster and there's the metal turnstiles.

896
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:05,490
Speaker 1: I just start idly chinking a quarter against it like think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think thing.

897
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,153
Speaker 1: And I keep doing it.

898
00:57:06,796 --> 00:57:17,124
Speaker 1: and then one of my friends starts doing it think to think to think to think to think to think to Think to think and then all of us kind of start doing it And then this woman's like could you guys stop that?

899
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:17,890
Speaker 1: that's really annoying.

900
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:23,129
Speaker 1: We're like, all right, and we you know, we kind of stop But then someone further down the line starts doing it.

901
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:31,981
Speaker 1: Oh, and and then someone else starts doing it and then the whole lines doing it and they won't stop and it just keeps going And keeps going and keeps going.

902
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:32,929
Speaker 0: Did you start doing it again?

903
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

904
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,627
Speaker 1: Okay at that point All right.

905
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:39,179
Speaker 1: After we laugh because we realized what we had wrought.

906
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:49,016
Speaker 1: and then this goes on for a good five minutes and then this unrelated woman who's there with her family, it looks like, just starts screaming at everyone to stop it.

907
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:50,383
Speaker 1: And that just makes it get louder.

908
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,412
Speaker 1: And then it goes crazy and they took her away.

909
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:53,135
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

910
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:56,306
Speaker 1: I felt bad about it, but I totally.

911
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:58,172
Speaker 1: we stopped when someone asked us to.

912
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:04,756
Speaker 1: And it's sad, but it's also hilarious that some other guy was like, oh, man, and started doing it right away.

913
00:58:04,897 --> 00:58:06,526
Speaker 0: Well, that's really that's a very.

914
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:07,912
Speaker 0: it's sort of like doing the wave.

915
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:12,485
Speaker 0: You know, it's a very basic concept of group psychology.

916
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:19,632
Speaker 0: is that the more complex thing you want to get a group to do it, the more people you want to do it, the harder it is.

917
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:25,758
Speaker 0: But if you want to get more people to do something, your best bet is to have many people do a simple thing.

918
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:28,451
Speaker 0: And then it is easier to get a large number of people do it.

919
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:30,380
Speaker 0: For example, you're at a baseball stadium.

920
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,952
Speaker 0: You want to get everyone to do the wave pretty easy.

921
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:36,444
Speaker 0: You want everyone to chant, you know, let's go team.

922
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:37,387
Speaker 0: Pretty easy.

923
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:40,240
Speaker 1: You want everyone to see the X, the X, the I see can't go.

924
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,908
Speaker 1: So that's not going to happen.

925
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,094
Speaker 0: That's not going to happen with it.

926
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:47,114
Speaker 0: You know, as the number of people increases, the harder it is to get them to do something complex.

927
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:52,657
Speaker 0: So if you're looking for, you know, deep, complex conversation, the people next to you are it.

928
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:53,119
Speaker 0: That's it.

929
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,366
Speaker 0: It's as far as you're going to get.

930
00:58:54,587 --> 00:59:05,198
Speaker 0: So if you want to get, say, you know, a little little chant going on, like, ah, phone, ah, you could probably do that with the whole line.

931
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,364
Speaker 1: And it's a lot of fun.

932
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:17,144
Speaker 0: Either one, either one of those activities, either good conversation, the people next to you or your line chance are equally valid and entertaining will become a mini temporary society.

933
00:59:17,706 --> 00:59:22,085
Speaker 0: And if you're the longer it exists, the more indenture that society will become.

934
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:22,306
Speaker 0: Yes.

935
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:31,635
Speaker 1: And especially like in roller coaster lines, like the cool thing was Cedar Point, like there's pretty much at night when the line was like two hours long because, you know, everyone got in line for like one last ride.

936
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:32,580
Speaker 1: And then it's all night long.

937
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:39,557
Speaker 1: They'd have deejays and music and the line was like, you'd get to know a lot of these people in line because the turnstiles keep passing the same people all the time.

938
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,325
Speaker 1: So one, we play a game.

939
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:42,892
Speaker 1: I forget what we used to call it.

940
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,379
Speaker 1: I think we called it pulling the Jesus.

941
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:50,604
Speaker 1: I don't remember why, but basically make sure that you're talking about something really weird.

942
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:52,832
Speaker 1: every time you pass this like one person.

943
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:56,183
Speaker 0: And they'll eventually back and forth line.

944
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:56,464
Speaker 1: Yes.

945
00:59:56,745 --> 00:59:59,172
Speaker 1: So it's like, turned out Jesus was gay.

946
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:02,782
Speaker 1: And then, yeah, I met him the other night.

947
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:06,312
Speaker 1: He was a pirate and then the nukes fell.

948
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,656
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

949
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:08,900
Speaker 1: And just go nuts with it.

950
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:10,464
Speaker 1: Yeah.

951
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:14,802
Speaker 1: The other off is to just completely like bother people, but that's not my bag.

952
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:15,345
Speaker 0: You know what?

953
01:00:15,385 --> 01:00:17,133
Speaker 0: You know, it really gets me about lines.

954
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:26,238
Speaker 0: It's really like to know more about is how when you finally sort of achieve what you're in the line for, you know, you go in, you buy your iPhone or whatever, you ride the roller coaster and then you get

955
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,062
Speaker 1: out of the line,

956
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:34,408
Speaker 0: even though you're still next to the people that were just like your closest line friends, like the whole line.

957
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:35,854
Speaker 0: culture is destroyed.

958
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,422
Speaker 0: It's like completely eliminated.

959
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:42,748
Speaker 1: It's like at the end of Lord of the Flies, when you suddenly wake up, you're like, oh, it's just a bunch of kids, right?

960
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:47,996
Speaker 0: It's like if I got like, as soon as I get that, let's say tomorrow, I make really good friends with the person in front of me, right?

961
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,649
Speaker 0: I go in, I buy the iPhone right next to them.

962
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:52,820
Speaker 0: They they're checking out of the checkout next to me.

963
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:53,906
Speaker 0: I buy an iPhone.

964
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:54,510
Speaker 0: They buy an iPhone.

965
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,836
Speaker 0: We both go out on the street.

966
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:57,966
Speaker 0: It's like we're complete strangers again.

967
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,273
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll get a nod.

968
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:00,096
Speaker 0: That's about it.

969
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:00,819
Speaker 0: And then we're done.

970
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how it is.

971
01:01:02,386 --> 01:01:05,922
Speaker 1: And but within the line, like you can become the king of the line while you're in it.

972
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:08,395
Speaker 1: But then that's gone when you leave the line.

973
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:16,069
Speaker 1: The way to become the king is to be the person that starts the first chain or the first game or the person who instigates a long running game of penis.

974
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,798
Speaker 0: Penis, penis, penis.

975
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,646
Speaker 1: We're not going to play this on the air.

976
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,216
Speaker 0: Some cool kids are playing penis on the train a week or two ago.

977
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,622
Speaker 0: It was good.

978
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,835
Speaker 1: I didn't join in because I feel like I'm a bit beyond that.

979
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:32,675
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I was I had an urge to join in, but also an urge not to join in.

980
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:37,136
Speaker 1: Yes, because it's like on one hand, I ride this train as a businessman and that would be really annoying.

981
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:41,498
Speaker 0: I wanted I wanted some way to show my respect for their game of penis without having to play.

982
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:44,614
Speaker 1: Also, I did not want to engage them because, again, they were also drunk.

983
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:48,350
Speaker 1: And, you know, once you engage someone, it's difficult to disengage.

984
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:48,952
Speaker 0: That's true.

985
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:54,454
Speaker 0: But I wanted to find I wish there was somebody to show my like not of approval for their game.

986
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:59,333
Speaker 0: Like I approve of this penis playing on the train without actually involving myself with that.

987
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:01,162
Speaker 1: Maybe geeks need a symbol, a symbol.

988
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:07,210
Speaker 1: We use some sort of like a gang hand sign that I do not wish to engage with you, but I approve of what you have done.

989
01:02:07,651 --> 01:02:07,952
Speaker 0: Yes.

990
01:02:08,032 --> 01:02:11,586
Speaker 1: Like you're the awesome or maybe something like you for the win.

991
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:12,409
Speaker 1: Let's go like that.

992
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,092
Speaker 0: The shocker.

993
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:15,717
Speaker 1: That's not a shocker.

994
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,406
Speaker 0: Why are you putting up the shocker shocker?

995
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,352
Speaker 1: That is a shocker.

996
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:20,913
Speaker 0: Why?

997
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:22,036
Speaker 0: Why are you giving the shocker?

998
01:02:24,101 --> 01:02:28,473
Speaker 1: You know, as horrible as a shocker is, I like it was a horrible thing.

999
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:39,233
Speaker 1: But the fact that I don't know how it became such a funny thing and not just in our RIT hockey culture, but geek culture, like people make shocker jokes all the time.

1000
01:02:39,313 --> 01:02:39,856
Speaker 1: And I don't know.

1001
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,069
Speaker 0: I don't know why shocker is not just a geek thing.

1002
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,612
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a.

1003
01:02:43,813 --> 01:02:47,110
Speaker 1: it's a joke in general, but it's like a lot of geeks have latched on to it.

1004
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,118
Speaker 1: Shocker jokes hit FARC like crazy to this day.

1005
01:02:50,138 --> 01:02:51,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the shocker.

1006
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:54,991
Speaker 0: Who got anything else to say?

1007
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:57,941
Speaker 0: I'm waiting in line.

1008
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:01,515
Speaker 0: If you want something real bad and the only way to get it is waiting in line.

1009
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:05,475
Speaker 0: If you want it badly enough, you're going to get in line early enough to get it.

1010
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:08,273
Speaker 0: If you don't want it badly enough, you're not going to get in line early enough to get it.

1011
01:03:08,293 --> 01:03:09,902
Speaker 0: You might as well not get in line.

1012
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:11,370
Speaker 1: Bring friends or entertainment.

1013
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,353
Speaker 1: Enjoy the line.

1014
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,403
Speaker 1: Look at the line as an experience to have fun.

1015
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:17,904
Speaker 1: If you're not having fun, you're not in the right kind of line or you're not aligned.

1016
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:18,287
Speaker 0: If you don't.

1017
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:22,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're not a line person, just don't wait in any lines and just, you know, get your iPhone.

1018
01:03:22,468 --> 01:03:29,699
Speaker 1: If you have to lose your grandeur from now, attempt to become the king of the line, knowing that you have effectively engaged everyone in the line.

1019
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,386
Speaker 0: The best trick, right?

1020
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:38,633
Speaker 0: Better than becoming the king of the line is becoming the shadow king of the line in which you are in control of the line.

1021
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:42,150
Speaker 0: You have started the chance and such, but no one actually recognizes you.

1022
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,581
Speaker 0: You don't stand out as the king of the line.

1023
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,007
Speaker 1: That's kind of like playing solitaire.

1024
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,252
Speaker 1: I took over the line.

1025
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:50,827
Speaker 0: You're in control of the line, but you don't stand out.

1026
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,073
Speaker 0: You're just one of the crowd.

1027
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,401
Speaker 0: No one notices you or anything.

1028
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:56,334
Speaker 1: If you have a friend who's in the line somewhere else, there's a good game you can play.

1029
01:03:56,815 --> 01:04:00,326
Speaker 1: Both of you vie to become kings of the line.

1030
01:04:00,346 --> 01:04:02,512
Speaker 1: That's a real good one.

1031
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:10,827
Speaker 0: I stand like a hundred people in, you stand 200 people in, and then I re prearrange like, this is the chance I'm going to try to get started.

1032
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,436
Speaker 0: And this is the chain you were trying to go get started.

1033
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:14,507
Speaker 0: And we see who gets which chance started.

1034
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:20,587
Speaker 0: And then maybe they'd like the line will have some sort of a, um, what's it called?

1035
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:27,990
Speaker 0: It might get a little partisan partisan to be like two kings of two different kingdoms in a war.

1036
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,336
Speaker 1: I keep saying king of the line.

1037
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:30,962
Speaker 1: I guess I should, cause this happens.

1038
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:34,537
Speaker 1: Like king of the line is something very specific.

1039
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:36,303
Speaker 1: Quite you that happens.

1040
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:42,623
Speaker 1: Hey, if I can be anything like Freddie Mercury, but anyway, I'm not going to wear those vests.

1041
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:44,208
Speaker 0: Why not?

1042
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:44,930
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1043
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:45,614
Speaker 1: I don't like that.

1044
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:46,780
Speaker 1: That's not a good style on me.

1045
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,283
Speaker 1: I don't think.

1046
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:54,145
Speaker 0: I think I could wear that yellow vesty thing, but I just have to wear a shirt.

1047
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:56,895
Speaker 1: King of the line is this very specific phenomenon.

1048
01:04:56,916 --> 01:05:00,997
Speaker 1: And you'll know when someone has achieved it because they'll have done something in the whole crowd.

1049
01:05:01,017 --> 01:05:04,979
Speaker 1: Like maybe they yelled something out funny and then the whole crowd, like looked at them and laughed.

1050
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:10,167
Speaker 1: And you see this in sporting events too, like the king of the section where the one guy yells the clever thing.

1051
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:24,550
Speaker 1: And then everyone, like whenever there's a situation for the rest of the line, for everyone who remembers or the rest of the game where someone should yell something out, you'll notice that half the line will look to whoever was the king of the line, expecting them to say something.

1052
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:27,824
Speaker 0: I got one more thing to say about an automatic audience.

1053
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,173
Speaker 0: Here's one more thing to say about lines, right?

1054
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:38,484
Speaker 0: Not only should you bring something to entertain yourself with, if you're looking for action in the line itself, bring social currency with you.

1055
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:39,006
Speaker 1: Yes.

1056
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:41,415
Speaker 0: Costumes are the best social currency in a line.

1057
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:48,549
Speaker 0: For example, if I show up tomorrow, dressed like Steve Jobs with a little turtleneck and jeans, totally going to rock the house with that.

1058
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:49,192
Speaker 0: Someone should do it.

1059
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:50,537
Speaker 0: Another good idea.

1060
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,887
Speaker 0: Show up to a lot, any line.

1061
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:54,432
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what the line is for.

1062
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:55,837
Speaker 0: dressed up like a Jedi.

1063
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:56,680
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

1064
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,810
Speaker 0: Dress up like a Jedi in any line.

1065
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:00,372
Speaker 0: It will work.

1066
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:06,475
Speaker 0: And if it's a Star Wars line, dress up like Star Trek with Spock and some Spock ears will always work.

1067
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:08,361
Speaker 0: Wookiees work in any line.

1068
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:12,975
Speaker 0: Also Mario and Luigi, they work in most lines.

1069
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:16,608
Speaker 1: or just, you know, have the, the clever t-shirt of course.

1070
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:16,829
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1071
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,056
Speaker 0: Clever t-shirt is good.

1072
01:06:18,096 --> 01:06:21,153
Speaker 0: If you, if you're not going for the big costume, I tend to go with the clever t-shirt.

1073
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:25,292
Speaker 0: Typically you want to go with a rare t-shirt, something people haven't seen before.

1074
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:38,034
Speaker 0: You know, if you have the same funny t-shirt as everyone else from, you know, think geek, it's not going to work, but if you get like, you know, a rare shirt, that's sort of from some weird internet site, like a web comic, that's not too popular, then you're going to hit it off pretty well.

1075
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:48,339
Speaker 0: But yeah, get some social currency, bring something with you, usually clothing or a costume or something that will get you some attention or be a good conversation starter.

1076
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,586
Speaker 0: Cause that's the best way to get stuff going on.

1077
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,072
Speaker 1: Also bring a drink.

1078
01:06:52,454 --> 01:06:52,634
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1079
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:53,297
Speaker 0: Drinks are good.

1080
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,179
Speaker 0: Another good example of social currency, especially like a video game line, have a DS from Japan.

1081
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,162
Speaker 0: That's a different color.

1082
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:09,492
Speaker 0: or bring an imported DS game with you or, you know, something along those lines and you'll get some conversations out of that.

1083
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:14,372
Speaker 1: So, for the eye of the line tomorrow, of course you're going to bring that Apple G2.

1084
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:16,158
Speaker 1: Just carry it on your back.

1085
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:18,847
Speaker 0: I bring my G2 with me to get my iPhone.

1086
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:19,730
Speaker 0: No, I'm not.

1087
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,660
Speaker 0: I'm just going to bring my usual shit to work.

1088
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,897
Speaker 0: I have a funny t-shirt and my normal stuff, a digital camera, you know, whatever.

1089
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,868
Speaker 1: If anyone out there listening brings an Apple G2.

1090
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:33,052
Speaker 0: Of course I'm going to be ripping out my super Linux-y laptop right in the middle of all the Mac books.

1091
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:35,282
Speaker 0: That's what I got going on.

1092
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,169
Speaker 1: Alright, this episode went nowhere.

1093
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:37,650
Speaker 1: We're done.

1094
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,651
Speaker 0: We're done.

1095
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:47,599
