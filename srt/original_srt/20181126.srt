1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,866
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 26th.

2
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:11,608
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,853
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,640
Speaker 1: We're talking about the technology of working from home.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,322
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,410
Speaker 0: Rim said he had no opening bits whatsoever.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean so because I convinced my family here comes in opening bit even though.

8
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:30,210
Speaker 0: He said he didn't have it.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,454
Speaker 1: I'm gonna convince her basically.

10
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:43,998
Speaker 1: I've gotten to the point to where my family will celebrate traditional holidays on Non-traditional days such that I can avoid the hassle of traveling on Thanksgiving or Christmas and As a result this Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,089
Speaker 1: We just stayed home and cooked some bib and bop.

12
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:58,028
Speaker 0: So when I got when I got off the train back in New York in Grand Central Walk, it wasn't a very crowded train I was walking back down the platform towards the main Grand Central area like

13
00:00:58,048 --> 00:00:58,349
Speaker 1: you do and

14
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,866
Speaker 0: You know there's all these pillars in the middle of the platform like

15
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:02,207
Speaker 1: there are

16
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:02,549
Speaker 0: you know?

17
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:16,389
Speaker 0: There was a woman leaning with her back against one of the pillars and a friend next to her trying to tell her not to do something and The friend who was leaning on the pillar was really wanting to do something and the other friend was like no don't do this.

18
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:21,293
Speaker 0: It's like put salt in your eyes like what I don't know what and I was like What is this person trying to do?

19
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:25,340
Speaker 0: the woman was attempting to and then succeeded to?

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,690
Speaker 0: Pull down her pants and do some numbers On that pillar and it wasn't one of the pillars far away from the station.

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,030
Speaker 0: They were like one pillar away from the Grand Central.

22
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:42,110
Speaker 1: It is weird how frequently drunk women do that in the city.

23
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,865
Speaker 0: I'm like if you I've seen that just made it to the escalator right.

24
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,090
Speaker 0: there is a bathroom at the bottom.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,773
Speaker 0: You could have made it.

26
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,290
Speaker 0: I saw you made it long enough for your friend to try to stop you.

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:02:03,250
Speaker 1: I saw two inebriated ladies come out of a brunch in Manhattan like a couple months ago and Both of them did something along those lines just right in the middle of the street, and that was that.

28
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:05,918
Speaker 1: I don't know why this happens today.

29
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,076
Speaker 0: I was you know leaning on the subway like you do and you uh Should I did?

30
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:12,887
Speaker 1: I need to be there to convince you not to do something?

31
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:13,189
Speaker 1: No?

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,515
Speaker 0: Because I was carried there there.

33
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:15,775
Speaker 0: these.

34
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:23,281
Speaker 0: uh because I was carrying something right I accidentally pushed the Recessed push in case of emergency button.

35
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,590
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm always afraid I'm gonna push that back.

36
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,381
Speaker 0: It's a recessed button, so it's real hard to push back.

37
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:31,709
Speaker 1: I'm still always afraid like especially on the air train I'm just gonna touch it.

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, despite leaning in that same spot on many trains that I've never accidentally pushed it.

39
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:46,779
Speaker 0: But today, I think is either my umbrella or a corner of a box I was carrying well went into the recess and pressed the button, so I'm just leaning on the Subway not paying attention to anything and suddenly I hear a voice.

40
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,743
Speaker 0: That's like some Sutton Sutton.

41
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:49,906
Speaker 0: What's your emergency?

42
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:53,199
Speaker 0: yeah, and I'm like It like took a few seconds.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,546
Speaker 0: so like delayed it like what.

44
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,955
Speaker 0: yeah I'm like oh, it's me.

45
00:02:57,517 --> 00:03:01,510
Speaker 0: Oh, it's the thing is right here, and I was just like oh, I think I leaned out of accident.

46
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:04,381
Speaker 0: Sorry, and he's like no problem that meanwhile the other day.

47
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:10,963
Speaker 1: I was waiting for the train in Queensborough Plaza and The train wasn't moving and there was some problem in one of the cars.

48
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:19,305
Speaker 1: like someone passed out or something like something went down and The conductor just kept announcing on the PA and the entire station.

49
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:23,719
Speaker 1: police police Come up and assist at the front car like and he kept doing it.

50
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:35,044
Speaker 1: and meanwhile there were like four cops in the station Downstairs doing that like fake bag check thing Like they could clearly hear this and clearly were pretending.

51
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:35,927
Speaker 1: They didn't hear it.

52
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:41,707
Speaker 1: yep That's how they do yep, and I just proceeded to get on an end train and make my way to work.

53
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:47,130
Speaker 1: cuz I don't got Time for that mm-hmm, but I do have time to find a bathroom before I put my pants down.

54
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:56,389
Speaker 1: So So yeah probably not gonna have a show on Wednesday because PAX is Thursday, that's a good reason.

55
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,609
Speaker 1: yeah I got a pack and like get shit together, but more on that in a minute, so it's Monday got some news.

56
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,576
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

57
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:11,847
Speaker 0: so this is something I've been complaining about since Oh 2008. no that ten years later is starting to see some action on right.

58
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:22,510
Speaker 0: so Back in the day when at the iPhone 3g came out And I bought an iPhone on the first day the iPhone 3g was available and the App Store went live Yeah, iPhone one did not have an App Store.

59
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:28,730
Speaker 0: You could not get apps on there other than by the web until the iPhone 3g came out and they added the App Store.

60
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:33,315
Speaker 0: Anyway, so on that day I was like man.

61
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:40,009
Speaker 0: this some bullshit that if I want to make an app for the phone I just bought even though I bought it because of the best phone and I still have iPhone.

62
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:46,677
Speaker 0: It's still some bullshit that if I want to make an app for it I not only need to have a Mac.

63
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:54,682
Speaker 0: you can literally still only develop iOS apps with a machine running OS X. You cannot develop iOS apps using even a machine running iOS.

64
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,107
Speaker 0: whoever heard of a computer.

65
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:57,070
Speaker 0: They can't make apps for itself.

66
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:04,090
Speaker 0: You also can only get it onto the device if you do it through Apple.

67
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:14,270
Speaker 0: Right if you're just beta testing you can use like this test flight thing and some people have used in test flight to do beta Tests on a wider scale, but mostly you need to get it in the App Store where Apple will then take a cut.

68
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:18,270
Speaker 0: They have a monopoly on software that runs on their platform, right?

69
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,964
Speaker 0: Kind of it's kind of sort of the same situation.

70
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:24,264
Speaker 0: or back in the day You had NES cartridges and then you had Tang and Tetris.

71
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:28,767
Speaker 0: Yep, right And you know, it's like oh you got to pay a license fee if you want to be able to sell.

72
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:29,412
Speaker 0: and yes Gotcha.

73
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:30,382
Speaker 1: No, it's interesting.

74
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:35,304
Speaker 1: and it because you know Because one of the things about Apple in the stores that wallets a monopoly on their platform.

75
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,050
Speaker 1: They're not the majority platform.

76
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,158
Speaker 1: Android is way bigger install base.

77
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends on how you measure and what locales.

78
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:48,369
Speaker 0: and yeah, yeah, but Anyway, the point is is there is a lawsuit that's like hey, that's some bullshit.

79
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:53,530
Speaker 0: And that lawsuit is now reaching the most Supreme Court of the land.

80
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,076
Speaker 0: It's like they had.

81
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:58,369
Speaker 0: they spent like an hour today listening to people argue about this.

82
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:00,193
Speaker 0: And I

83
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:01,944
Speaker 1: feel like regardless

84
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:21,129
Speaker 0: of the legal argument Which I know nothing about because I'm not a lawyer The principled argument is I am fully against Apple and I hope they law the judges will say Yes, you must make it so that anyone anywhere is free to create software and put it on to an iOS device.

85
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,016
Speaker 0: if they so Choose fuck you.

86
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,069
Speaker 1: See at least Android has that not that I would ever do it.

87
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:27,974
Speaker 1: There's pretty much any.

88
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:33,642
Speaker 0: that's the thing is like I don't really care if other if I would never almost never Go to a website.

89
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,237
Speaker 0: That's like hey guy Give me some money.

90
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,990
Speaker 0: I'll give you iOS app for you to side load.

91
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,830
Speaker 1: I would only I have exe will give you many things.

92
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:56,892
Speaker 0: I would only do that with the absolute most trustworthy of websites, but like for tonight example of that probably I want to make a software and put it on my phone and I just don't want to buy a. Do that.

93
00:06:57,253 --> 00:07:07,457
Speaker 1: so what's the line between a general-purpose computing device and a specialized one in terms of whether or not you should have an absolute right to Install software on it.

94
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:11,290
Speaker 0: I think it can be simply defined like does the Nintendo switch count?

95
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:14,006
Speaker 0: I think it should.

96
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,473
Speaker 1: Evelyn on the switch, I think we.

97
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,936
Speaker 1: I think a phone should count.

98
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:25,188
Speaker 0: I think we can define it based on The capabilities of the chips that are in there.

99
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:35,779
Speaker 0: right like you know if you've got say a alarm clock The chips in there are not really capable of doing very much if you program them.

100
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:48,180
Speaker 0: If I sell you a refrigerator and in that refrigerator is like an ARM CPU That can run pretty much any fucking code, and there's a screen on your fridge and some buttons all right.

101
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,865
Speaker 1: Here's a. here's a counter example.

102
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:54,400
Speaker 1: What about a smart stove like a range topper an oven where?

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,340
Speaker 0: Messing up the software could blow up your apartment building If you but I mean I could blow up my apartment building just with the knobs on my stove.

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,398
Speaker 0: So it doesn't really make a difference does it right if you allow me to do it via code?

105
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:13,692
Speaker 1: to this day I'm vaguely afraid of blowing up the apartment building with gas Right if there was just happen on the Upper West Side you saw a big explosion.

106
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 0: if there was some sort of regulated Safeguard on you know blowing up yourself with the knobs on the stove right and like for example in the shower.

107
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:36,897
Speaker 0: It's like there's certain laws about the the water flow on the the faucet right yeah for wasting water And it's like aha you can remove the flow limiter, which you really shouldn't which is illegal to do right.

108
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:37,900
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

109
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,600
Speaker 0: Well if you had a computer-controlled shower, you shouldn't be able to unprogram the flow limiter.

110
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:44,704
Speaker 1: Alright so.

111
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:48,100
Speaker 1: but what I would say is that say they like a balloons this lawsuit.

112
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,936
Speaker 1: I don't think they should have to make it easy for you to install stuff.

113
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,688
Speaker 0: They don't have to do anything They just have to allow.

114
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:01,999
Speaker 0: no they just have to make it Possible so that I can go and write some code and install a app.

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,483
Speaker 0: You know should not make it easy in fact because then a bunch of morons will go installing a bunch of shady Exe.

116
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,835
Speaker 0: look look at links and emails yep, then say yes.

117
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,036
Speaker 0: Yes.

118
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:15,613
Speaker 0: Yes when it says Like they already do in Windows right they shouldn't have to make it easy.

119
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,660
Speaker 0: They just need to make it possible.

120
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:22,935
Speaker 1: So in some other news you might have seen this and we'll probably do a show like.

121
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,984
Speaker 1: there's a lot to say here and a lot to process.

122
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:38,529
Speaker 1: so start thinking about the fact that supposedly a Designer baby has been made like the thing that everyone worries about and wonders about for the future of humanity may have been done.

123
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:44,189
Speaker 1: and There's a bunch of ethical considerations that we all need to argue about for the next 20 years.

124
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,440
Speaker 0: I know doesn't seem to care.

125
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,413
Speaker 0: yeah Well, it's like fuck it.

126
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:51,486
Speaker 1: China's government probably cares in a very specific way.

127
00:09:51,566 --> 00:10:00,268
Speaker 1: China like people in China Probably have specific opinions on it China's a much less regulated place in some regards so you can see why that's the kind of place where this might happen.

128
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,159
Speaker 1: first I don't know.

129
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:13,070
Speaker 1: on a high level I'm very conflicted and ambivalent about this kind of thing Because on one hand people have written many sci-fi stories about how this would be like the worst yep.

130
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:17,124
Speaker 0: But I mean when you look at what we've done with vegetables.

131
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:18,408
Speaker 0: You really haven't done too bad.

132
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:20,034
Speaker 1: Yeah We've got some good vegetables.

133
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:23,024
Speaker 1: I can eat like cucumbers and gourds that are not poisonous.

134
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,750
Speaker 1: hmm at least not that poisonous.

135
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,109
Speaker 0: It's like if we make a person that doesn't get diseased.

136
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,113
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

137
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:29,778
Speaker 1: ah but what?

138
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:30,580
Speaker 1: many of the arguments are.

139
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,950
Speaker 1: what if then people start designing their babies towards some contemporary?

140
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,835
Speaker 1: Pop culture beauty standard?

141
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:40,910
Speaker 0: or those babies then will have another pop culture beauty standard that they will impose on their babies.

142
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,030
Speaker 0: Who will then have a different culture and a different beauty standard that they will impose on their babies?

143
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,830
Speaker 1: What if desirable traits are actually linked to less well-known undesirable traits that only manifest later on and we've ruined our gene lines?

144
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,576
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just data.

145
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:55,620
Speaker 0: so they can always bring back.

146
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:57,266
Speaker 0: They can always make Scott Rubins.

147
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker 0: even a thousand years from now They'll have my DNA.

148
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,942
Speaker 1: That's why in Gundam seed the coordinators needed the baseline like human stock to refresh themselves because they basically made themselves sterile over time.

149
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:11,564
Speaker 1: hmm Let's say if it I mean if I did Gundam seeds the example you can always you can.

150
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,682
Speaker 1: new type Gundam in general new types Coordinators just better x-men just better.

151
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,364
Speaker 0: It's like oh, no.

152
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,849
Speaker 0: We made people who aren't fertile enough.

153
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:26,442
Speaker 0: all right We'll try to make some people that are better at being fertile with like you know really big Vagina holes that babies slip out of real easily.

154
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,930
Speaker 0: I don't know what makes someone more fertile.

155
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:33,910
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess what's gonna be interesting here Is that if this can be like a shit ton of sperm look at the size of those nuts?

156
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,690
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess because we can't like debate this in the news part of the show.

157
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:46,510
Speaker 1: But I feel like we're at the point now that this appears to have been really done That and that it could theoretically be done at some scale.

158
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:53,230
Speaker 1: It's time to actually have those debates for serious as opposed to just talking about in the context of anime and dystopian sci-fi.

159
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:58,206
Speaker 0: I think part of the problem also is that you know we have an institute is some sort of world order.

160
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:02,822
Speaker 0: so even if you Know one country decide something other countries just aren't gonna fucking do it.

161
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,930
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so then you narrow the scope.

162
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,325
Speaker 1: What should the United States do about this for example?

163
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,370
Speaker 0: is the problem right?

164
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:16,536
Speaker 0: let's let's say you know one country does it another country doesn't know and Country a has new types and country B. Doesn't?

165
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,364
Speaker 1: well then it's literally returned into the Gundam seed universe.

166
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:27,310
Speaker 0: right, but colony drop happens Unlike the Gundam seed universe where humans somehow managed to put up a good fight against coordinators.

167
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,960
Speaker 1: Well the only reason they do is because there weren't that many coordinators.

168
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:31,887
Speaker 0: well, so they had some coordinators on their side.

169
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:35,422
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, the coordinators will just kick the ass of non coordinators.

170
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:38,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if it gets to like I'll just be smarter better faster.

171
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,186
Speaker 0: What are you gonna?

172
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:39,589
Speaker 0: Do about it?

173
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, you bet right it become arms race if you don't have some sort of way to stop it.

174
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:53,850
Speaker 1: so The one interesting question for Tuesday episodes of geek nights is how does this play into the fairness in sports and doping?

175
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,110
Speaker 1: If I design a human to be like the perfect long-distance runner, I know it doesn't even have a brain.

176
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,906
Speaker 1: It's just a body and you feed it and if you put it on a track.

177
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:04,769
Speaker 1: It'll start running.

178
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,004
Speaker 1: Hmm does that count?

179
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:07,529
Speaker 1: is that okay?

180
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,580
Speaker 0: That may be among the first things they try to do.

181
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,630
Speaker 1: it's just lungs legs and like eight hearts.

182
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,599
Speaker 0: Realistically speaking that may be.

183
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,180
Speaker 0: one of the first things they try to do is to make Athletically superior people that don't need drugs or anything yep.

184
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,790
Speaker 1: I feel like that is what they're gonna do first in general.

185
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:23,607
Speaker 1: We'll see we'll talk about this more.

186
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:30,050
Speaker 1: so Get into the forum and start arguing about this because it's time to actually argue about it when it isn't a theoretical.

187
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,538
Speaker 1: In some other news you might have noticed.

188
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:38,117
Speaker 1: We're not gonna dwell on this too much, but someone posted in the forum Scott's complained about this forever.

189
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,804
Speaker 1: I've talked about it forever.

190
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,190
Speaker 1: We all like we knew this.

191
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:53,930
Speaker 1: I'm right about multiple things again, so basically some library in NPM Was changed ownership to someone who just put fucking malware in it steal bitcoins.

192
00:13:54,632 --> 00:14:00,609
Speaker 1: because this library was used in like Bitcoin payment things and wallets and it totally worked.

193
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,972
Speaker 1: and It looks like a lot of stuff might actually be compromised and this whole story here You can read about.

194
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,758
Speaker 0: they don't hurt people who have coins so fuck them.

195
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also only hurt people using NPM so fuck them.

196
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:15,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I don't like this problem is so widespread.

197
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,750
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do about it.

198
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,365
Speaker 0: It's like this could happen with say like almost any of the other package management systems.

199
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:26,689
Speaker 0: for any of the other You know programming languages or OSes that are out there, right?

200
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,801
Speaker 0: I was like you could slip a nefarious package into Ubuntu apps.

201
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:35,809
Speaker 0: you can open a various package into fucking Any of the Linux distribution thing?

202
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,264
Speaker 0: Big Python has pi pi and you could even done this way back in the day with pearl.

203
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:41,689
Speaker 0: pearl has that like the oldest?

204
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,516
Speaker 0: yes That's one thing pearl has.

205
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:48,620
Speaker 0: they have the oldest best like programming language package manager thing Right at any time.

206
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,130
Speaker 0: anyone could have slipped nefarious things But meanwhile even in the Python one the only thing people have managed to do is put in like misspelled ones.

207
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:02,827
Speaker 0: So if you accidentally go like pip install and you type it wrong You'll install a bad version of a thing instead of the real thing.

208
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,541
Speaker 0: Yeah, right No one's managed to do this kind of attack.

209
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:17,566
Speaker 0: And the other problem is that unlike all Those other thing programming language package managers out there The JavaScript one delivers code to user computers.

210
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:22,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, right The other one does not really well this much.

211
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:33,350
Speaker 1: this is solved Trivially by if you're doing something that matters Regardless of the packaging system you use and you're using any open source components at all.

212
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:41,710
Speaker 1: You need to do code reviews and due diligence And if you don't have the capabilities to do that in-house You should be hiring someone else to make your software for you.

213
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:48,048
Speaker 0: The other thing you need to do is if you're doing making some serious, you know softwares You need to do some sort of.

214
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,486
Speaker 0: There are various like sites that will do this for you and help you out.

215
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:52,190
Speaker 0: You can do it yourself.

216
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:55,910
Speaker 0: You just make some sort of local mirror of the package repository, right?

217
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,669
Speaker 0: So this helps you keep the package repository up in case it goes down.

218
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:00,934
Speaker 0: It helps you.

219
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:12,130
Speaker 1: well, it also means you can take in like means your version 8 of food or whatever And then you can have a QA team when version 9 comes out like vet it and verify it eventually make it available.

220
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:17,259
Speaker 0: Well, you can also create your own Packages and not not have to deploy them publicly.

221
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,970
Speaker 0: you can deploy them to your own private version and then install them.

222
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:32,850
Speaker 0: So you can be like NPM install thing I made and it'll work Even though no one else if anyone else in the world tries to do that It won't work because it's only on your private copy of NPM that yeah that you're running.

223
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:45,010
Speaker 1: I feel like NPM is like the perfect storm for this kind of problem because I feel like there's a lot of people Who don't have sufficient development expertise in-house using it to hack something together and make it work.

224
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:59,580
Speaker 0: I've said this for many moons and I still believe it that the reason node.js and NPM were created is because they were front-end web developers and designers right who didn't want to have to learn Linux or Anything actually programming.

225
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,870
Speaker 0: they wanted to avoid all learning, right?

226
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:09,089
Speaker 0: They already knew JavaScript because they were using it for like making a pop-up window add on your site Right, and they didn't want to have to learn anything new.

227
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,089
Speaker 0: so rather than learn they would rather work and build tools to make it.

228
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:20,897
Speaker 0: so they Use JavaScript for everything and not have to learn another language Which would have taken much less time than building NPM and node.

229
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,402
Speaker 0: and then they made.

230
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:32,398
Speaker 0: they tried to copy all of the infrastructure that all the other languages had and since anyone who was actually any good at programming was Not doing that was already using another language.

231
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, and anyone who knew anything about UNIX was already using UNIX.

232
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:41,950
Speaker 0: They had all the people working on node or people who knew less and they did a really bad shitty job.

233
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:46,910
Speaker 0: And now a whole bunch of other people use it and now it's super popular, but it's still garbage.

234
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:52,710
Speaker 1: I'm very much a fan of having front-end development some sort of mid-tier and then real systems on the back end.

235
00:17:53,593 --> 00:18:06,090
Speaker 0: You know, it's just like hey, you know if your job is to make something look good You know, if you also have the skills to know UNIX stuff, man You are a very skilled person who has skills across a super wide range of things.

236
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,300
Speaker 0: Yep, and that is a rare person.

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:24,450
Speaker 0: yet there are many many people who are quote full stack and are doing everything from design down to sysadmin and Not all of those people actually have deep knowledge of that wide variety of skills and they fuck up one side of the other.

238
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:31,230
Speaker 0: Yep, but now it's one thing A lot of people who know how a lot of UNIX and they're forced to make a website and it's real ugly and awful.

239
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,341
Speaker 0: It's what I do when I make a website.

240
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:39,266
Speaker 1: if you're making like it's real Like a video games not going to steal your bitcoins if you fuck it up.

241
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,329
Speaker 0: I mean cuz I hope not it could.

242
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,463
Speaker 0: yeah I can make a video game with JavaScript true less.

243
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,028
Speaker 0: It's in a web browser or something.

244
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:51,042
Speaker 1: Yeah So and one last news and this is sort of I was.

245
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,329
Speaker 1: I just stumbled upon this recently.

246
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,300
Speaker 1: Apparently there is people like.

247
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,030
Speaker 1: people have perceived a problem.

248
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,065
Speaker 1: You know how concert tickets sell out and there's scalpers and demand.

249
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:04,159
Speaker 1: and like that old story Pax is coming up this weekend.

250
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,706
Speaker 1: And of course packs badges sell out.

251
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:06,450
Speaker 1: same old story.

252
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:15,507
Speaker 1: But people seem to be mad that there are bots doing this same thing for Sneakers and for physical goods,

253
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,372
Speaker 0: okay So and

254
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:19,867
Speaker 1: it's the literal like to the point that lawmakers are looking to

255
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:20,409
Speaker 0: ban it

256
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:26,230
Speaker 1: Like trying to ban the idea of having a bot during retail shopping as opposed to a human.

257
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,230
Speaker 0: You know lawmakers love to go on about capitalism and free market and stuff.

258
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,183
Speaker 0: Why don't the people selling the sneakers jack up the price?

259
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,208
Speaker 0: so this doesn't happen?

260
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,855
Speaker 1: Yeah Like that there is.

261
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:44,144
Speaker 0: I don't think there are arguments to be see when it comes to the tickets Right, there are arguments to be made like hey, I'm putting on a concert here.

262
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,670
Speaker 0: This is art for the people.

263
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:48,470
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be only art for the rich people, right?

264
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,785
Speaker 0: Some people of lower income should be able to have access to but then it's not.

265
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,496
Speaker 1: but then it's on you If you're providing the art.

266
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:55,178
Speaker 1: say a concert.

267
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:55,920
Speaker 0: they do they do.

268
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,850
Speaker 0: they go through great efforts like Broadway shows have lotteries and stuff.

269
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's it.

270
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:02,150
Speaker 1: You control that and do something like a lottery.

271
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,498
Speaker 0: But the point is there arguments to be made about.

272
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,710
Speaker 0: right the prices, you know need to cover a wide range.

273
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,410
Speaker 0: They shouldn't just let the market sort it out.

274
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:16,397
Speaker 0: They should do things to fight against the invisible hand because there is a greater purpose, but for sneakers I don't see any.

275
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,545
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like we're not.

276
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:18,189
Speaker 1: sneakers are art.

277
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,522
Speaker 0: I'm saying though that owning sneakers is not art.

278
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,690
Speaker 0: you can anyone can I can you can see all the sneakers?

279
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,854
Speaker 1: Well, I guess here's the problem.

280
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:34,965
Speaker 1: the problem with sneakers and like it's tickle me Elmo or the things people are mad about here Is that the only reason those things are in limited supply is because of artificial scarcity to begin with.

281
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:35,747
Speaker 0: that's one reason.

282
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,021
Speaker 1: not any sort Of like intrinsic problem.

283
00:20:38,222 --> 00:20:40,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, and They can just make more of them.

284
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,340
Speaker 1: Like you can't make more PAX West.

285
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:45,330
Speaker 1: No, you can't make more buildings just up here in Seattle.

286
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:50,050
Speaker 0: It's also not a you know, a necessity of life and it's purely a luxury good.

287
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:55,570
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with every sneaker caught that's rare costing a bajillion dollars.

288
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:04,561
Speaker 1: But I'm also of the mind that in general like if there's a site like Amazon or whatever that's selling something and Someone else wants to buy that at a retail price and resell it themselves.

289
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,707
Speaker 1: That's just like basic babies.

290
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:07,670
Speaker 1: first arbitrage.

291
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what should happen, you know, but also the person who made the shoe should sell it for more.

292
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:13,148
Speaker 0: So it doesn't happen.

293
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:16,969
Speaker 1: Ah, but if they just sell it for more it does get in a situation where only rich people can afford it.

294
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:18,175
Speaker 0: So it's a sneaker.

295
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,059
Speaker 0: That's perfectly.

296
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,867
Speaker 0: Oh, no only people can afford Ferraris.

297
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:24,804
Speaker 0: Oh, no No, it's like okay, it's the Ferrari of sneakers.

298
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:25,266
Speaker 0: he gives a shit.

299
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:26,030
Speaker 0: that's what's supposed to be.

300
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:26,813
Speaker 1: I guess it just.

301
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:33,420
Speaker 1: it's weird to me that I keep seeing like so many different areas of life All hair is as long as there is another shoe.

302
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,142
Speaker 0: that is not.

303
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:37,314
Speaker 0: if every shoe is zigz for Ferrari of shoes That would be a problem.

304
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:42,210
Speaker 0: The point is yes, you can't buy the newest limited Air Jordan whatever but guess what?

305
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,763
Speaker 0: There's tons of shoes that are way cheap.

306
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,247
Speaker 0: You can buy.

307
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,035
Speaker 0: I would be shoeless.

308
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:54,610
Speaker 1: at what point is this different than someone like going to Walmart and buying all the things Nothing or hiring a bunch of hobos to stand in line and buy all the things for you perfectly fine.

309
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,572
Speaker 1: I feel like every area of life has the same fundamental problem of supply and demand don't always line up and People.

310
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,125
Speaker 0: every area invisible hand is not strong enough.

311
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:09,522
Speaker 0: It's not moving Importantly, I feel like in Areas, they're not lowering.

312
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:10,246
Speaker 0: They're not doing.

313
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:14,940
Speaker 0: they're not moving Prices or supply and demand as they need to.

314
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:25,250
Speaker 1: the people who care and are mad about that thing Literally don't understand that the same problem is everywhere and all their ideas for how to solve it won't work and could never work.

315
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:31,390
Speaker 0: What I the only thing that I simply don't understand right is companies are trying to keep profits like up.

316
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,454
Speaker 0: They're trying to grow right.

317
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:37,090
Speaker 0: if I made suppose Nike why would I keep making all these limited shoes?

318
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,981
Speaker 0: Why not just pretend they're limited?

319
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:41,026
Speaker 0: no one will fucking know.

320
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:41,830
Speaker 1: they'll figure it out.

321
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:47,235
Speaker 0: The bots will figure it out and then make a fuck ton of shoes and charge $500 each forum.

322
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:49,643
Speaker 0: you could figure out doing it over and over.

323
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,909
Speaker 1: just by looking at the supply chain alone You could probably figure out what they were doing.

324
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:57,302
Speaker 0: Okay, so now that all these people we thought I just said limited edition.

325
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:58,044
Speaker 0: I didn't say how many.

326
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,710
Speaker 0: no every shoe is limited edition.

327
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:02,267
Speaker 0: I don't make them forever Right, so, you know what would happen?

328
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:09,044
Speaker 0: All the sneaker collecting kids would all have every shoe because they'd be available.

329
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,328
Speaker 0: they would all spend $500 each.

330
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:12,623
Speaker 0: They'd have nothing to complain about.

331
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:13,714
Speaker 0: everyone got every shoe They wanted.

332
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:21,250
Speaker 1: now that would only work once Because as soon as it's not a limited quantity a lot of people wouldn't be that interested anymore because it's not unique.

333
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:22,938
Speaker 0: I think they'd be just fine.

334
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,582
Speaker 1: I don't know.

335
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:31,450
Speaker 1: I Mean, I think the bigger problem is that companies try must grow forever as opposed to just being a sustainable business.

336
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:35,010
Speaker 1: I'm saying which is why I'm a big fan of like benefit companies and co-ops.

337
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:42,544
Speaker 0: I agree with that but that the point is is I'm saying look if you're gonna stay with the capitalism Which I want to get rid of you're not even doing it, right?

338
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,430
Speaker 0: That's what I'm trying to say.

339
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:47,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would like to get rid of the capitalism, but you're doing it and you're not even doing it.

340
00:23:47,910 --> 00:24:03,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess I don't it as even though I get burned by bots doing arbitrage on things like concert tickets I don't think it's worth legislating because I think the Consequences of trying to legislate that will be more harmful than just that being the state of the free market.

341
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:15,055
Speaker 1: Because frankly if that because if the bots like mess things up too much then the bots bought all the tickets the musician got paid and no one goes to the concert and Then they just do another concert.

342
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 1: It might even increase demand for concert tickets in the long run.

343
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,575
Speaker 0: I think one there.

344
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:35,979
Speaker 0: I think there are other solutions and some of them may be legislative But I just don't think you should employ them in the case of sneakers and you might want to employ them in the case of Concerts, for example, maybe you could have some sort of rule at a concert where it's like, okay If you haven't shown up for the concert

345
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:37,263
Speaker 1: a half

346
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:45,508
Speaker 0: hour before this time Any on any vacant any tickets that haven't been scanned right as of a certain time, but

347
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:46,350
Speaker 1: should you regulate that?

348
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,074
Speaker 1: What if I?

349
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,410
Speaker 1: what if I as a venue don't want to deal with that hassle?

350
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,972
Speaker 0: I think we might should.

351
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:54,224
Speaker 1: we should legislate legislate something that's purely entertainment.

352
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,672
Speaker 1: Not a necessity of life It's the arts.

353
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,200
Speaker 1: you could see the concert online fine.

354
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:02,050
Speaker 0: Are you are you in favor of government funding of the arts?

355
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,777
Speaker 1: I'm in favor of government funding the arts.

356
00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:06,810
Speaker 0: I think legislation for the arts is even less than government funding.

357
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:11,859
Speaker 1: So and now I would say that maybe Regulation would apply to the performance of government funded arts.

358
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:12,481
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

359
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:14,025
Speaker 0: Yeah all arts.

360
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:15,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sneakers are art.

361
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:17,495
Speaker 1: No, yeah, why not?

362
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:18,498
Speaker 1: Why why you?

363
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:19,241
Speaker 0: why are you?

364
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:24,477
Speaker 0: because you don't need to own the sneaker to Concert to experience the music.

365
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:24,879
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.

366
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,630
Speaker 1: It's probably better to experience it with good headphones at home.

367
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,295
Speaker 1: No, it's it probably is.

368
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,358
Speaker 0: it depends on the music.

369
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,421
Speaker 1: Oh, so it depends.

370
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:31,882
Speaker 1: Okay.

371
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,126
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever.

372
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:42,996
Speaker 1: That's not for you to decide anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

373
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:44,059
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

374
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,850
Speaker 0: So there's this guy on YouTube and his channel is called man eating food.

375
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,410
Speaker 0: That's a real good name for a channel and every video is literally just this man eating food.

376
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,499
Speaker 1: Oh, this is so I want to eat this right now.

377
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,625
Speaker 0: earliest videos that he put up He just kind of spills him.

378
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,256
Speaker 1: he's like De-saltory about it.

379
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:05,690
Speaker 0: in the earliest videos he put up He was just doing like eating a thing just like a norm just like a food.

380
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,269
Speaker 0: It would be like man eats cereal or man eats a bagel or whatever, right?

381
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,098
Speaker 0: And it's just like a video of him eating.

382
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:23,890
Speaker 0: and it wasn't like the Korean mukbang kind of thing where you're sort of watching someone eat and sort of getting this like Secondhand pleasure from watching when they're like, oh, they're experiencing.

383
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,884
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's not that right?

384
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,110
Speaker 0: It's literally just this guy.

385
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,733
Speaker 0: He eats a food.

386
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,709
Speaker 0: the video and it's real short, but he puts up a lot of content.

387
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:44,020
Speaker 0: the way He looks up at the camera right more recently He's put up videos where he's been combining foods and it's a lot is a big series of ice cream plus and the ice cream First of all is ample Hills ice cream.

388
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,085
Speaker 0: So ample Hills is a New York ice cream Company, you know store and there's a few of them.

389
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:54,590
Speaker 0: one recently Somewhat recently Oh like in the summer opened in my neighborhood and I had a big long line.

390
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,069
Speaker 0: The line is not there now because it's cold, but it's still open.

391
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:01,283
Speaker 0: And let me tell you it was worth the way in line.

392
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:01,785
Speaker 0: Holy fuck.

393
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:02,890
Speaker 0: That is some awesome ice cream.

394
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,958
Speaker 0: So I noticed that that is the ice cream he has.

395
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,190
Speaker 1: but he found the one way possible to improve that ice cream.

396
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:21,927
Speaker 0: This man in this one particular video that I will point separate as a lift above all his other videos He is doing the most rim thing I have seen someone do.

397
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:22,990
Speaker 0: that is not rim.

398
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,344
Speaker 1: If only he was a skeleton.

399
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:43,406
Speaker 1: while doing this And blowing a trumpet This man takes ice cream and then he puts croutons on the ice cream advanced crackers and then he eats Just the way he like looks like he looks up a little bit right into the camera.

400
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:44,770
Speaker 1: just he's about to take a bite.

401
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:51,629
Speaker 0: This is just one of a series of ice cream plus and I'm sure if his channel will continue and have many other things plus other things.

402
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,657
Speaker 0: Enjoy don't eat croutons with some salad.

403
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:58,365
Speaker 1: I'm going to eat croutons on ice cream tonight.

404
00:27:58,405 --> 00:27:59,549
Speaker 0: Croutons are for a salad.

405
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:00,949
Speaker 1: only I will take a picture of it.

406
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,757
Speaker 1: No, I might.

407
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:03,921
Speaker 1: I might have run out of croutons.

408
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,230
Speaker 1: good, but I think we ate them all last night with the chili.

409
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,800
Speaker 0: Croutons are not for chili.

410
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,130
Speaker 0: They are for salad.

411
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,388
Speaker 1: So to fit in Scott's theme because this video is four hundred and forty one views and 18 likes.

412
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:23,358
Speaker 1: right now I have a video that I found yesterday That has 30 views Two like.

413
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:24,870
Speaker 0: we're trying to see who can get the least viewed.

414
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:31,386
Speaker 1: One of them is my like and it was uploaded a year ago.

415
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:46,881
Speaker 1: this video is Yeah, that's surprising and this dude Basically just shows something interesting that can happen in the old SNES game Gemfire one of rims games.

416
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:48,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a rim game.

417
00:28:49,191 --> 00:29:04,028
Speaker 1: You know those games like the Ko Shibu Sawa games where yet like no, but no Bunga's ambition Nobunaga's ambition or arrow biz you got like a map with a bunch of numbers and you're doing things like calling board meetings and moving numbers around.

418
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:12,650
Speaker 1: So Gemfire is one of those games where you basically like Build armies and have like vassals and families and you're trying to go.

419
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,716
Speaker 0: It looks like a map of Britain.

420
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:17,666
Speaker 1: and yeah, and you have this vaguely British fantasy world.

421
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:18,649
Speaker 1: You're trying to do a thing.

422
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:32,024
Speaker 1: So the game has a really complicated system where you'll have like vassals that are in your family and you can like Steal vassals from other families and like get them to do stuff and like your family will do things.

423
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,930
Speaker 1: and the games actually pretty simple.

424
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,970
Speaker 1: But what this guy shows is something kind of fucking crazy.

425
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,656
Speaker 0: It doesn't look simple.

426
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:41,399
Speaker 0: if you'd like look at it with your eyeballs But if you play it's simpler than it looks like.

427
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:46,650
Speaker 1: I'll do a live stream someday and show you this game is actually way Simple like I can beat it from any standpoint.

428
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,489
Speaker 1: But basically you can only play as like four or five different families in the game.

429
00:29:52,272 --> 00:30:04,961
Speaker 1: But this ridiculously complicated system of vassals really never matters that much Except if you do something weird and the guy does it He basically causes a giant family to lose its last vassal.

430
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:08,150
Speaker 1: Okay, and what happens is crazy.

431
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:13,070
Speaker 1: There are so every family has like a crest and like there's all these people in the game.

432
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,177
Speaker 1: They don't fucking matter at all.

433
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:30,012
Speaker 1: But in this one weird circumstance Every single goddamn territory whoever lives there forms their own goddamn new family Because he did some bullshit in the game that is almost impossible to pull off and the game handles it and makes like 30 new Families.

434
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,119
Speaker 1: every one of them has a unique crest.

435
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,430
Speaker 1: that was in the game waiting for this moment to happen.

436
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,865
Speaker 0: What if you do it twice of the 30 more credits?

437
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:39,870
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

438
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:52,950
Speaker 1: This would be like if you program sieve like sieve five or sieve six so that in this like one in a million Situation where a weird thing happened that could only happen if someone was like really gunning for it and was super obscure.

439
00:30:53,511 --> 00:31:04,004
Speaker 1: If you had put all the crazy information in the game necessary to fully handle this ridiculous situation Like they wouldn't better off just having the game crash then bother with this.

440
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:05,510
Speaker 0: How did this guy know this would happen?

441
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,770
Speaker 0: Uh, they read the code of gemfire in advance.

442
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:11,090
Speaker 0: So do you read a strategy guide or something?

443
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,090
Speaker 0: So strategy guide was written by developers or had tips from developers.

444
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,770
Speaker 1: So as far as it cuz I've played this game and like like I could speedrun this game like not even joking.

445
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:20,815
Speaker 1: Not with like.

446
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,869
Speaker 1: I could even do a little bit of RNG manipulation because I played the game so much.

447
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:38,525
Speaker 1: but basically You don't need to bother with any of that shit to win the game and as best I can tell there was a dedicated community of people in the 90s who were obsessed with the characters in the game and the vassals and like trying to make other families farm and the game.

448
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:42,118
Speaker 1: and this trick just shows that the Accommodated this to the nth degree.

449
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:47,513
Speaker 1: and I'm just kind of shocked and amazed that this works In the moment.

450
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:53,590
Speaker 1: no show on Wednesday because on Thursday, we're going to PAX unplugged the second packs unplugged ever.

451
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's some bad news.

452
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:57,320
Speaker 0: There's awful city of Philadelphia.

453
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,641
Speaker 0: Yep.

454
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,368
Speaker 0: The only reason you should go there packs unplugged.

455
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:06,110
Speaker 1: Yep Philadelphia is filled with some violent people who live as far as I can tell short and brutish lives.

456
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,170
Speaker 1: Gritty might kill you if you show up in Philly.

457
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:13,121
Speaker 1: So beware, but uh PAX unplugged is gonna be awesome.

458
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,609
Speaker 1: It's the tabletop only PAX.

459
00:32:14,952 --> 00:32:17,589
Speaker 1: We are doing two panels on one on Saturday one on Sunday.

460
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:21,181
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're just gonna be playing tabletop because it's tabletop con.

461
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:30,050
Speaker 1: and if you can't see us at PAX unplugged We are also going to be live in San Antonio at PAX South doing a brand new panel.

462
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:42,190
Speaker 0: nostalgia versus game design will be escaping the harsh winter of the Northeast for the Slightly mildish weather of the south and even more crazily just by the mid south.

463
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:44,778
Speaker 1: So by happenstance, it's a brand new panel.

464
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:45,239
Speaker 1: We're doing.

465
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:48,550
Speaker 1: it happens to be about nostalgia in game design.

466
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:49,614
Speaker 1: Oh, it's just like.

467
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:58,027
Speaker 1: that's the one they picked and we're doing the panel on my birthday and It's our birthday packs and it's our 50th packs panel.

468
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:58,549
Speaker 0: you counted them.

469
00:32:58,831 --> 00:32:59,354
Speaker 1: I counted them.

470
00:32:59,374 --> 00:32:59,756
Speaker 1: to be sure.

471
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,210
Speaker 1: I'm doing our 50th packs panel on my birthday.

472
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,125
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe I'll bring a tiny cake and share it with the audience after the panel or something.

473
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:08,550
Speaker 0: you buy your own birthday cake.

474
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:09,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll know.

475
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:09,859
Speaker 1: you know what I'm gonna do.

476
00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:11,510
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bring a tiny birthday cake.

477
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,382
Speaker 0: I should buy you a poison birthday cake.

478
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:14,570
Speaker 0: It was also your last.

479
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:24,276
Speaker 1: I Feel like I'm just gonna eat a fucking piece of cake While we're doing the panel and not share it with anyone in the audience because that's way funnier and it was boys.

480
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:29,989
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, and the booklet book is a space Odyssey.

481
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:33,681
Speaker 1: We'll do the show sometime before the end of the year probably Hopefully.

482
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:35,508
Speaker 0: hopefully I'll definitely have a time to read.

483
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,640
Speaker 0: but you know late December it ain't a long book.

484
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,915
Speaker 1: I feel like I can burn through when I actually start reading it.

485
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:45,219
Speaker 1: I've just been busy Yep, and also we will be at of course magfest.

486
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,220
Speaker 1: Before packs unplugged but but before pack south but after packs unplugged and we're doing a bunch of panels there.

487
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,608
Speaker 1: It's gonna be fucking awesome as always.

488
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:54,774
Speaker 1: It's magfest magfest.

489
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:55,880
Speaker 0: You don't spend your time with us.

490
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,452
Speaker 0: we're only doing that shit to get in for free.

491
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:58,420
Speaker 0: just come to magfest cuz.

492
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:00,867
Speaker 1: The only trouble is so.

493
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,537
Speaker 1: a lot of our panels are only videoed by magfest and not by us.

494
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:05,853
Speaker 0: and You don't give a shit just come to magfest.

495
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:06,679
Speaker 0: You don't need to see us there.

496
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,142
Speaker 0: I don't know.

497
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:08,190
Speaker 1: people seem to like our panels.

498
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,500
Speaker 0: go to magfest to magfest.

499
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,007
Speaker 0: Don't go to magfest to see our go to magfest for both.

500
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:16,358
Speaker 1: No, so I can work from home, but I tend not to.

501
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:24,259
Speaker 1: And part of that I think is just that I live like it's a 10-minute commute Like if the subway is messed up, it might take me 15 minutes to get to work.

502
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,139
Speaker 1: So it's almost easier to work out of my office.

503
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:42,853
Speaker 1: But and I when I think about it in my entire life It's only recently that like I can feasibly work from home and be Like a hundred percent as effective at home as I would be at work like ten years ago Really couldn't like I could not get the access.

504
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,280
Speaker 1: I needed to fully work from home.

505
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:46,764
Speaker 0: Hmm.

506
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:57,200
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really you know, I mean, I feel like most jobs That are office jobs Other than having to talk to someone else in person, right?

507
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,845
Speaker 0: Well, you don't necessarily need to do.

508
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:08,736
Speaker 1: you could do a phone or a video conference or who knows what with the caveat that in Many industries you'll run into old people who don't know how to do that or aren't capable of doing that.

509
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:09,538
Speaker 0: like that problem.

510
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:17,600
Speaker 1: in my life I've worked with people As in past jobs who literally like we're not really capable of dealing with instant messaging.

511
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,759
Speaker 0: They're supposed to be an IT person who helps them.

512
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,315
Speaker 1: No more like they just like they won't respond and won't work that way.

513
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:27,871
Speaker 1: and like unless you call them on the phone They've like won't understand you or listen to you.

514
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:29,400
Speaker 0: Oh that they should be fired.

515
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,169
Speaker 1: I've run into that a lot in my life.

516
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,280
Speaker 0: someone who is more capable should be hired in their place.

517
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, well should being able to use this messenger be a requirement of modern office work.

518
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,608
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, a lot of people would get fired today.

519
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:41,753
Speaker 0: Everyone uses slack.

520
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,520
Speaker 0: now if you can't slack, how do you keep your job?

521
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, you probably fail even if it wasn't a explicit requirement.

522
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:49,979
Speaker 0: if you failed at slacking I think you would lose most jobs.

523
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,426
Speaker 1: I feel like I've had a small company.

524
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:52,350
Speaker 1: that'd be one of my tests.

525
00:35:52,430 --> 00:36:00,080
Speaker 1: like I would just IM you to be like to Like do the last round of the interview and if you couldn't do the interview on IM I feel like you wouldn't be capable

526
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:05,900
Speaker 0: Email you before I hired you and if I could tell by your emails if they said please advise you would not be hired.

527
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,132
Speaker 1: Going forward, please advise dot-dot-dot.

528
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:11,077
Speaker 0: Oh not hiring this one.

529
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,705
Speaker 0: Yep Judge you based on your email.

530
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,874
Speaker 1: Why is there a font in your email?

531
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,078
Speaker 0: You are not going to be hired.

532
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,410
Speaker 1: Yep But I guess what.

533
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,757
Speaker 1: one thing I'm interested in like.

534
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:33,680
Speaker 1: Despite the fact that like technology has made it trivial for any office job to be done remotely Why are almost no people able to or allowed to work from home the majority of their time?

535
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,580
Speaker 1: Why does everyone still go into their office and like play hearts and fuck around on Twitter and excel?

536
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,230
Speaker 1: like why Doesn't everyone just work from home?

537
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,420
Speaker 0: Why don't they give us a million vacation days?

538
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,288
Speaker 0: Why don't they do all sorts of things?

539
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,798
Speaker 0: because his old fuddy duddies still have all the power?

540
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:50,099
Speaker 0: the end?

541
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:51,387
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it's just that.

542
00:36:51,528 --> 00:37:00,900
Speaker 1: I definitely have found that a lot of people Just aren't capable of being productive if they're at home Like you don't trust you're not gonna be any more productive at home than you were at work.

543
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,467
Speaker 0: What's like what do I do when I'm at work?

544
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:03,231
Speaker 0: watch YouTube?

545
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:03,834
Speaker 0: What do I do at home?

546
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 0: watch you see?

547
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:06,429
Speaker 1: I don't know.

548
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,779
Speaker 0: doesn't matter where you keep me I'm gonna do the same thing, but I guess I actually do do work at work.

549
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:34,960
Speaker 1: But I can be mostly effective at home except for the weird situation where being like visible and like walking over and like grabbing people and talking to them or like chance media like literally like bumping into people and Like in the elevator has actually been a big part of how I get work done Mmm, but then again, I've sort of like higher profile role now than I used to have like when I worked at a broker.

550
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:42,609
Speaker 1: I literally did not to need to be in the office at all to do my job because I had a VPN to the office I had like video chat with anyone I needed to.

551
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:50,000
Speaker 1: I had a physical phone plugged into my router that Literally acted like I was in the office with like weird redundancy and all this nonsense.

552
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:51,774
Speaker 0: Hmm, huh?

553
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing to present the show.

554
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 0: I mean, this is your idea.

555
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:57,700
Speaker 0: But I mean, I just don't think it's like a technological thing.

556
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:00,559
Speaker 1: Well, I think the problem is you don't do work.

557
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,345
Speaker 0: Why would I do work?

558
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,635
Speaker 1: Most people do work at work.

559
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:05,840
Speaker 0: What the fuck are you doing?

560
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,188
Speaker 0: Should be doing as little work as humanly.

561
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,015
Speaker 0: every work you do right.

562
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,520
Speaker 0: someone hires you for a job.

563
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,559
Speaker 0: They pay you X dollars, right?

564
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,954
Speaker 0: They're expecting your work that you do to be worth more than X dollars.

565
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:19,600
Speaker 0: Thus they profit by hiring you.

566
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:21,279
Speaker 0: You're getting ripped off when you work.

567
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:26,179
Speaker 0: They're giving you money that is worth less than the work that you are doing that they are taking from you.

568
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:34,940
Speaker 0: Ah, you should be your number one goal at work should be to do as little work as humanly possible So that you could maybe even profit by being in the office.

569
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,940
Speaker 0: So the money you get from them is worth more than the work that you do for them.

570
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,663
Speaker 0: That would be like.

571
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:41,329
Speaker 0: that's like the ultimate goal at work.

572
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,980
Speaker 0: So do as little as possible get as much as possible.

573
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,719
Speaker 1: So I cuz if you do this is why I would never trust you to work for me.

574
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:52,620
Speaker 0: If you work hard, you are just a sucker who is being ripped off, right?

575
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,640
Speaker 0: So whether you work from home or not, if you have balls like me, you'll do the same amount of work.

576
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:10,798
Speaker 0: So it's not about observing me or catching me not doing work because I've never done any work and people don't catch me And they don't see I'm not even trying to hide it and they still don't fire me and I still do enough work where they Say wow, you're doing a great job.

577
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,877
Speaker 1: Let's take the non Scott case.

578
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:19,400
Speaker 1: then Imagine people who do like, you know, the 20 or 30 hours of actual work and the rest of the time.

579
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,281
Speaker 1: They're just like looking at Twitter suck Like.

580
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:27,020
Speaker 1: no, you have regular people at work non tech job even like someone who's at an office and like does the TPS reports?

581
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:28,224
Speaker 0: Okay, quit.

582
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,514
Speaker 0: Why are you doing that's what your life's gonna be TPS reports.

583
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:31,955
Speaker 1: Yep.

584
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,179
Speaker 0: So what a life.

585
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:34,042
Speaker 1: What did.

586
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 1: it's kind of amazing how good the technology is to let that person literally Effectively be in the office if you have a job where there is no special equipment that you need.

587
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:49,353
Speaker 0: For example, maybe you're a printer and you're printing books.

588
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,440
Speaker 0: You need to go to where the giant book printing machine.

589
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,676
Speaker 1: What if we made remote robots where?

590
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:56,497
Speaker 1: cuz me like?

591
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:58,160
Speaker 1: it's not a process you can necessarily automate.

592
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,700
Speaker 1: I had a remote robot arms to control the thing that makes the books in the office.

593
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't.

594
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:04,608
Speaker 0: we don't have those and that's no you don't have those.

595
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:07,662
Speaker 1: What do we have?

596
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:08,264
Speaker 1: the McDonald?

597
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:08,605
Speaker 1: what if you?

598
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:16,218
Speaker 1: what if you imagine a McDonald's where the person who's taking the order is at home on a screen like just wearing a shirt?

599
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:26,076
Speaker 0: if It is a device such as making burgers that can be done by Remote controlled robot then it can also be done by automated robot.

600
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:26,779
Speaker 0: We don't need the person.

601
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:29,272
Speaker 0: No, if it needs to be done.

602
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,620
Speaker 1: No, I would argue that's not true.

603
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,260
Speaker 1: There's a lot of tasks that can be done by a robot where the person is not directly proximate to the actual robot.

604
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:43,127
Speaker 1: Maybe they're in another room So theoretically they could be in another building But the automation is not there.

605
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,495
Speaker 1: like some tasks require a little bit of human discretion.

606
00:40:45,536 --> 00:40:46,499
Speaker 1: It can't be fully automated.

607
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,577
Speaker 1: yet There's a lot of tests that involve a human manipulating an object via machines.

608
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:58,789
Speaker 0: sure I still feel like you know, if your job is say blacksmithing right unless you have your home a forge at home Which you're fucking awesome.

609
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,577
Speaker 0: Then you're great.

610
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,637
Speaker 1: There's a lot of YouTube channels of people at forges.

611
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:07,500
Speaker 0: at home They are but if you don't have a forge at home, you need to go to the forge to go to work, right?

612
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:09,739
Speaker 0: You can't really work from home.

613
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:18,291
Speaker 0: But if your job is office work because we have turned all paper into digital things You can work from home because you don't need some.

614
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:24,000
Speaker 0: you have access to all the same paper digital paper That everyone else has no matter where you are on earth as long as this internet.

615
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:29,904
Speaker 1: I think I've maybe printed four things in the last year of working at my office and those four things for forms I had to sign.

616
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:37,357
Speaker 0: I bought a black and white laser printer When I'm you know moved to New York, maybe even in beacon.

617
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:38,040
Speaker 0: How old is this thing?

618
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,318
Speaker 0: The point is it's pretty much only ever been used to print materials for tabletop games and RPGs.

619
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:52,966
Speaker 1: Yep Use my color laser printer Which I bought because I only print things like maybe once a month to print the things for packs Print things for tabletop games.

620
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:53,287
Speaker 0: Yep.

621
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:56,476
Speaker 1: I'll probably die before this thing runs out of color ink.

622
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:57,419
Speaker 0: It'll dry up.

623
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,704
Speaker 1: Hey, well, it won't dry up.

624
00:41:58,744 --> 00:41:59,406
Speaker 1: It's a laser printer.

625
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:00,390
Speaker 0: It could still dry.

626
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:01,956
Speaker 1: It's it's already dry.

627
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:03,040
Speaker 0: toner can go bad.

628
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,204
Speaker 0: It's not gonna go bad.

629
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:04,987
Speaker 0: It can happen.

630
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,492
Speaker 1: It doesn't really happen.

631
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:07,095
Speaker 1: It happens.

632
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:10,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought a. very well I got an office printer pretty cheap.

633
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:10,809
Speaker 1: Actually.

634
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,500
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good printer, you know, they don't really make shitty ones.

635
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cuz I bought an office printer as opposed to a home like inkjet whatever.

636
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:25,886
Speaker 0: Well, the point is is that there's almost nothing an office person needs to do That requires them to leave their home.

637
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:30,320
Speaker 0: If you have a computer you can do all information related work All right.

638
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:30,781
Speaker 1: So what?

639
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:36,840
Speaker 1: what are the jobs that cannot be in the foreseeable future actually done work from home?

640
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:47,213
Speaker 0: Like for example, well, I mean if you unless you're talking about if you want to you want about the jobs that are like can't be automated because like Pilot can't work from home, but I can.

641
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:50,924
Speaker 1: we already have pilots who work from home Drone pilots.

642
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,940
Speaker 1: they work from an office in Texas flying on the other side of the earth.

643
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,903
Speaker 0: Sure, that totally works.

644
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:56,766
Speaker 0: You can't?

645
00:42:56,786 --> 00:42:58,550
Speaker 0: we don't have a commercial air.

646
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,874
Speaker 1: There's no technological.

647
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,257
Speaker 1: There's no reason why we couldn't.

648
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:01,799
Speaker 0: why don't we?

649
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:06,176
Speaker 1: Pa there's a lot of reasons why that actually seems like a really good idea.

650
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,080
Speaker 0: This is a really good idea.

651
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:07,802
Speaker 1: I think so.

652
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:08,525
Speaker 1: from what I've read.

653
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,572
Speaker 1: the main reasons why are that?

654
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:18,450
Speaker 1: in the event that that system fails You need a pilot to like be physically on the plane to be able to take over manual control Like they could just sleep on the plane though.

655
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,799
Speaker 0: They don't need to yeah, they just sleep in it.

656
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,430
Speaker 0: And there's the thing that like wakes them up.

657
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:22,740
Speaker 0: if that you know, yeah.

658
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:31,603
Speaker 1: But then the argument is if they just sleep on the plane they'll never actually practice the skill of like flying the plane anymore or They'll have to go.

659
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:40,897
Speaker 1: they'll have to like take training classes to remind themselves and keep their skills fresh to be able to Pilot it in the future in case they ever need to pilot it that one time.

660
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:45,139
Speaker 0: There's a problem Yeah, but also there'd just be so much automation so they wouldn't have to know that much.

661
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if the automation fails?

662
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,763
Speaker 0: Don't fuck it up.

663
00:43:50,265 --> 00:43:55,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, but sometimes things happen like the air train over, you know, it's a train It's much less than a plane.

664
00:43:55,487 --> 00:44:00,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if the air train fails it just stops Right and you just get out of it.

665
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,397
Speaker 1: Yes, it doesn't go down doesn't fall off the tracks.

666
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:04,220
Speaker 0: That's true.

667
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:08,037
Speaker 0: But the point is is that automation is already that good, right?

668
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,280
Speaker 0: We just got to wait and then eventually the plane will fly.

669
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then we get to the sci-fi story.

670
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,245
Speaker 1: We have human we have jobs that robots have done for so long that humans don't know how to talk about labor that talk About automation.

671
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:19,577
Speaker 0: you're trying to work from home.

672
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,980
Speaker 1: Here's here's why I think because the technology is there for like almost every office job on earth to be done remotely.

673
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:31,698
Speaker 1: I think the main reason why it's not comes down to two fundamental problems.

674
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,134
Speaker 1: one Many companies don't trust their workers to actually do work if they're at home.

675
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,280
Speaker 0: Why do you hiring?

676
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:39,915
Speaker 0: People if you don't have enough work for them to do?

677
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:49,818
Speaker 1: I Think it's more that the people who are good enough to trust a hundred percent tend to take higher paying jobs elsewhere and move To cities where there's no incentive for them to work from home because their commute so short.

678
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,012
Speaker 0: Mmm, I haven't sent it to work from home.

679
00:44:52,073 --> 00:44:52,718
Speaker 0: You know my commute.

680
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:54,299
Speaker 1: sure I actually am not like it.

681
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,651
Speaker 1: I'd almost just rather go to the office cuz I could get to the house.

682
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:58,380
Speaker 1: I go to Manhattan have lunch somewhere different.

683
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,009
Speaker 0: No, no, why if I go?

684
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:01,880
Speaker 0: if I will have to go to the office, right?

685
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,882
Speaker 0: That means I can't say for example, you know play Zelda Right.

686
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:08,445
Speaker 0: I have to.

687
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:12,020
Speaker 0: my activities when I'm not working are very limited to like YouTube only.

688
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:17,940
Speaker 0: No, also if I go to the office, that means I have to like buy lunch or bring a lunch.

689
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,703
Speaker 0: Sure, it's a pain in the ass.

690
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:19,386
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy lunch.

691
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:21,395
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't bring lunch or make lunch.

692
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:22,239
Speaker 1: I buy lunch every day.

693
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:24,033
Speaker 1: I'm going to deal with the devil today.

694
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:24,960
Speaker 1: I graduated college.

695
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,620
Speaker 1: I will buy a hot lunch every day my entire life.

696
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:29,145
Speaker 1: How much it cost me.

697
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,192
Speaker 1: that is worth more to me than almost anything.

698
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:33,058
Speaker 0: if I stay home I could.

699
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,696
Speaker 0: that time I'm not working can be productively used.

700
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:36,481
Speaker 0: so well I could.

701
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:37,285
Speaker 0: I could make a lot.

702
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:38,048
Speaker 0: I could do laundry.

703
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:43,150
Speaker 0: I can cook in my kitchen that I own Right, I can bake a bread.

704
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,260
Speaker 1: See I actually do do work the entire day.

705
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,420
Speaker 0: I can get so much shit done during the non work time.

706
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:51,142
Speaker 0: I could read a book can't read a book at work Right.

707
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:55,279
Speaker 0: all the stuff that I could do if I work from home that I could not do if I work at the office.

708
00:45:55,644 --> 00:46:02,180
Speaker 1: so what's interesting is Like my work from home situation is such that I can do even all the things that people complain about not being able to do.

709
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:03,906
Speaker 1: Like there's a system.

710
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:08,240
Speaker 1: well, I can type anyone's name and bam instant video chat like right there at their desk.

711
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,105
Speaker 1: Everyone has a webcam.

712
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:11,256
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to not have a webcam.

713
00:46:11,397 --> 00:46:11,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do that.

714
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,109
Speaker 0: We have Google Hangout I get and I we have slack.

715
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:18,125
Speaker 0: I can contact anyone at the whole company As long as they're working.

716
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:23,772
Speaker 1: that we have like an internal system where I could even like make a room and have like ten people Like all automatically like it's all built in.

717
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:24,637
Speaker 0: you have Google Hangout.

718
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:32,880
Speaker 1: It does that Yeah, and like I can literally just be like hey Let's just like let's talk about Overwatch in this private room with video chat while we're dicking around like between things.

719
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:49,800
Speaker 1: I think the other reason why a lot of this doesn't happen is that as soon as a company has everyone working from home That company has no reason to hire really anyone in America or anyone who wants any amount of money to do that job.

720
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:53,659
Speaker 1: They can just literally outsource it to the lowest bidder anywhere on earth.

721
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:55,988
Speaker 1: They should who is capable of doing that job.

722
00:46:56,048 --> 00:47:02,070
Speaker 1: they should which will have the exact same problem as automation and They save so much money on rent.

723
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,826
Speaker 0: They don't have to have a jew that huge is building Yeah, and yet they don't.

724
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:10,940
Speaker 1: and yet companies like Amazon will still put their fucking office in like Queens.

725
00:47:11,202 --> 00:47:13,118
Speaker 0: I don't know why I don't understand it.

726
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,260
Speaker 0: There are new companies for example get lab which is competing with github, but they're not doing poorly, right?

727
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,012
Speaker 0: It's not like there's some you know, like yeah weak-ass thing.

728
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:24,848
Speaker 0: It's like there are a few hundred employees I think 300 something a hundred percent remote.

729
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,780
Speaker 0: everyone in the whole company is remote their work wherever on earth.

730
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:31,933
Speaker 0: they pay you I think according to where you live and not according to see.

731
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:43,879
Speaker 1: that's the key because a lot of a lot of This comes down to the fact that a lot of people who are good enough to do these like high-paying jobs remotely Also want to live in major cities and as a result need a lot of money.

732
00:47:44,302 --> 00:47:46,200
Speaker 0: But if everyone work from home, right?

733
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,880
Speaker 0: So now you have a major city and the major city no longer has office buildings.

734
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:51,506
Speaker 0: It only has.

735
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:55,200
Speaker 0: that wouldn't be nearly enough apartments stores parks and apartment.

736
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,880
Speaker 1: I think if you converted every office office building in Manhattan into apartments our rent wouldn't go down at all.

737
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:03,714
Speaker 0: No But I'm saying is like what would the city be like if there were no office buildings?

738
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:05,060
Speaker 0: it'd be a dense paradise.

739
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:13,283
Speaker 0: Everyone is literally the only people are working on computers that are in their apartments or in Starbucks's or even better We were.

740
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:19,187
Speaker 1: a lot of the offices would probably be replaced with co-working spaces for those few times You do need like a conference room.

741
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,958
Speaker 1: There's like a place where you just rent one out and go for it.

742
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:31,519
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that all the people who do job like the people I work with in my company and just people I work with In general who do your kind of work?

743
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,568
Speaker 1: Engineering as opposed to like what I do.

744
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,759
Speaker 1: They work at home all the time and it totally just works.

745
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:36,703
Speaker 0: I work from home.

746
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:41,500
Speaker 0: They now let me work from home whenever I want and I work from home less than everyone else in my department.

747
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:43,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm like, all right.

748
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,780
Speaker 1: I have a lot of engineers that work from home like three days a week.

749
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:47,125
Speaker 1: They're just as productive.

750
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:47,967
Speaker 1: It's totally fine.

751
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:50,115
Speaker 1: Like working from home in technology.

752
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,680
Speaker 0: I do the same little amount of work.

753
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:58,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you can just enough to keep my job And then be told that I'm doing a great job.

754
00:48:58,595 --> 00:48:59,540
Speaker 1: This is why I like again.

755
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:01,718
Speaker 1: This is why I would never hire you to work for me.

756
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:03,669
Speaker 0: I was doing a great job though.

757
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,739
Speaker 0: You'd be so satisfied with the amount of work I do.

758
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:08,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends cuz the two hours that it's been working.

759
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,055
Speaker 0: I'm super productive and I get all the.

760
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:11,300
Speaker 0: all the tickets are done.

761
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:13,269
Speaker 0: I don't need everything you wanted me to do.

762
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,876
Speaker 1: I don't think you could get all the tickets.

763
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:15,660
Speaker 1: I would open done.

764
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,230

Speaker 0: four of them because I had one for a long time Has been is to give me enough work that I could actually not do it.

768
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:31,519
Speaker 0: They just can't give me enough work because I get it done so fast.

769
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:36,260
Speaker 1: No Well speaking of which I think we finally we killed enough time so we can end the episode.
