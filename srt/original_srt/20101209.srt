1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,149
Speaker 0: It's Thursday December 9th.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,832
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:13,538
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night.

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,631
Speaker 0: This is the year 2000 and y'all.

5
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:25,120
Speaker 0: Tonight on geek nights we discuss the book club book World War Z by Max Brooks.

6
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,366
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:34,452
Speaker 1: Oh You managed not to say that the book sucks in the opening part of the show.

8
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:36,297
Speaker 0: You want to know why I was yawning.

9
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,768
Speaker 1: yeah We got some yawning issues over here.

10
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,592
Speaker 1: are they cleared up now?

11
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,180
Speaker 0: yeah, we got some opening issues, too.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,893
Speaker 0: I think Scott is the perpetrator of the yawning.

13
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:46,260
Speaker 0: I think he started this whole thing.

14
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,750
Speaker 1: It's not you can't blame someone for a yawn.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,196
Speaker 1: That's like blaming someone for pooping.

16
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:50,517
Speaker 1: It's like.

17
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:51,180
Speaker 1: It's natural.

18
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,320
Speaker 0: It's gotta happen much like that Katsu kind of way back.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,060
Speaker 0: I mean we all got sick like everyone in the goddamn world got sick.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,818
Speaker 0: But I do believe that you were the one who got sick first.

21
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:04,279
Speaker 0: Okay, you brought this illness upon the rest of us much like the yawning just now.

22
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:09,578
Speaker 1: yeah You know I mean you could blame someone for getting sick if they did something stupid.

23
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,831
Speaker 1: for example Rub sewage on an open wound and get infected.

24
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:14,212
Speaker 1: right.

25
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:20,039
Speaker 1: or you know sedentary lifestyle Not wipe their ass or swim in the Ganges.

26
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:28,258
Speaker 1: You know I mean there are plenty of ways someone can get themselves drink dirty water get dysentery right unpasteurized milk.

27
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:36,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, go out where all the nasty Malaria mosquitoes are and rub yourself in mosquito food whatever they eat.

28
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,986
Speaker 0: uh blood It's a.

29
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,756
Speaker 1: you know cut yourself so the blood comes out.

30
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:44,720
Speaker 1: so the mosquitoes You know can they smell the blood if you cut yourself?

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,784
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

32
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,130
Speaker 0: I think they smell the co2.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,460
Speaker 1: you're breathing spray some you know mosquito pheromones.

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,720
Speaker 1: They come over to you, and then right you could do all sorts of stuff, but then they fuck your arm instead of eating.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,760
Speaker 1: I don't know.

36
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:58,920
Speaker 1: The point is is that there are a lot of things you can do to purposefully get sick.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,669
Speaker 1: But if someone has not done any of those things and that is the vast overwhelming majority of human beings do not Intentionally do any of those things right.

38
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,580
Speaker 1: so then you can't really blame someone for getting sick.

39
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,700
Speaker 1: It's not something they do on their own.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,752
Speaker 0: I do avoid people who have been exposed to children if the children are sick.

41
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a co-worker.

42
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:24,540
Speaker 1: his kid You know is going to daycare and basically is a germ magnet.

43
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:30,826
Speaker 1: But you know if you're if you are right if you have a kid you kind of want that because that makes a healthier Kid.

44
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,237
Speaker 1: I you know there are studies.

45
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:45,200
Speaker 1: Then they're pretty much Figuring out that most of the allergy type kids who are allergic to everything and get sick all the time later in life are because their Parents didn't let him roll around in the mud when they were smaller, so let him roll in the mud send him to daycare.

46
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,080
Speaker 1: They'll get sick early on they won't get sick later.

47
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean as long as you know as long as they don't get you know the death sickness.

48
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:55,059
Speaker 0: I rarely got sick when I worked at the hospital hanging out with hospital people.

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,280
Speaker 0: well You also got crazy Vaccinated at the hospital only to one or two things and I did get sick a whole bunch right away when I first worked there.

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,512
Speaker 0: Then I stopped getting sick.

51
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:04,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how it works.

52
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:07,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine if you worked at the hospital when you were zero you'd be like invincible.

53
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:10,333
Speaker 0: I mean I was in the hospital when I was zero.

54
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:13,125
Speaker 1: yeah me too Big surprise.

55
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,258
Speaker 0: I went back when I got the really bad flu when I was like two or three ish.

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:28,740
Speaker 0: I went back when my brother was in the hospital when he was there, but much more importantly Scott Warm today, and no it is it is it is quite warm out.

57
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,506
Speaker 1: I thought I was thinking of the joke But then I realized it's not.

58
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:38,765
Speaker 1: it is one of those jokes that all the listeners are gone man's, but I'll be like oh No, what is the joke?

59
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:39,688
Speaker 1: so basically?

60
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,672
Speaker 1: I was like man.

61
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:45,560
Speaker 1: You know what we should totally move somewhere That's way south like the Caribbean.

62
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,520
Speaker 1: You know what you know why live on a bar, you know why we should move there.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,448
Speaker 0: Why should we move there?

64
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,216
Speaker 1: because there's no woman?

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,789
Speaker 0: No cry That wasn't that bad.

66
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,140
Speaker 0: we could have made more inside you know.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,974
Speaker 1: But I figured listeners would be like oh you guys are gay.

68
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:02,080
Speaker 1: you want to move where there's no woman.

69
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,234
Speaker 0: I mean when was the last time we were like?

70
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:07,965
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah Because we haven't been playing NS.

71
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:08,145
Speaker 1: Cuz.

72
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,630
Speaker 1: NS2 is not doing so now.

73
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,072
Speaker 0: It's not.

74
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,296
Speaker 0: or what is the last time?

75
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:14,886
Speaker 0: you held ten somethings Yesterday couldn't hold ten something.

76
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,753
Speaker 0: what ten things did you all her?

77
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,680
Speaker 1: she kisses a variety of flavors.

78
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:24,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, I learned that we can both have and eat ten of those I got have.

79
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,740
Speaker 1: we got a whole bucket, but it's it's emptying quickly at the office.

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,469
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm refilling it not on my dime.

81
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:29,871
Speaker 0: No.

82
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a yawning Thursday show.

83
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:39,958
Speaker 0: It's a book club show and we don't want to kind of taint the book club by doing like 20 minutes of unrelated news because Then kind of lose the timeliness of the book club show.

84
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:44,834
Speaker 1: yeah People who care about the book club fast forward and get to the book get to the book.

85
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,138
Speaker 0: so should we?

86
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:53,400
Speaker 0: here's a point of Order Scott other than saying the year should we do the World War Z first or should we sell the next book?

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:05,420
Speaker 1: I think we should sell the next book first because there might be someone who has not yet read the World War Z doesn't want to Spoil it but might be listening and therefore they won't have to skip ahead and fiddle about in the show.

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,820
Speaker 1: But if you were World War Z first then someone might have to skip around, but I got a spoiler for you.

89
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,643
Speaker 0: Zombies.

90
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:11,607
Speaker 0: they rise up.

91
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,129
Speaker 0: It sucks.

92
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,979
Speaker 1: I think it says that on the cover humans survive in the end.

93
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,220
Speaker 1: I think that's why it's not a zombie.

94
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:26,146
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid when I was pretty young like 96 I got this book.

95
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,359
Speaker 0: I don't even remember how I got it or how I get interested in it.

96
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:41,513
Speaker 0: I don't know if my parents bought it for me, or if I just found it or a physics teacher I don't know, but I picked up Michio Kaku's hyperspace, and I read it and It was amazing and fascinating.

97
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:49,653
Speaker 0: like that was my first knowledge of string theory or hyperspace or Multidimensionalism or anything ever that was realistic.

98
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:55,815
Speaker 1: I mean I sort of knew about Multidimensionalism kind of but I didn't know of anything else, and I never read this book.

99
00:05:55,975 --> 00:06:00,408
Speaker 0: plus when I'm talking like 1995 give or take I mean maybe ish.

100
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:08,960
Speaker 0: did you know about string theory theory and quarks and super symmetry back then probably in 97 and I knew they existed.

101
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:15,212
Speaker 1: So cuz I was yeah second year of high school I definitely definitely knew of those things.

102
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:19,389
Speaker 1: hyper not that I know any more of the Detailed information that I do now.

103
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:28,680
Speaker 0: Michio Kaku is a renowned and important Physicist and kind of like Carl Sagan he goes around promoting science and scientism and people caring about science.

104
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:32,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a professor at CUNY which is very in the city.

105
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,097
Speaker 1: I can probably see it from here.

106
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:41,379
Speaker 0: yep Hyperspace that the actual title is hyperspace colon a scientific odyssey through parallel universes time warps and the 10th.

107
00:06:43,881 --> 00:07:03,985
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess it was made in 1994 so I guess or at least published in 94. so I guess I read it shortly after it came out, but it basically takes all this crazy string theory stuff and Breaks it down into really accessible and understandable chunks that anyone Intelligent can grasp.

108
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,067
Speaker 1: so it's a nonfiction book.

109
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,672
Speaker 0: It's a nonfiction book.

110
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,338
Speaker 0: I much prefer the non fictions over the fictions.

111
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:15,619
Speaker 0: Hey, you're the one who made me read fucking World War Z. you can suck not for you.

112
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely wasn't for me.

113
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,595
Speaker 0: You know what I guess nonfiction isn't for you.

114
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,620
Speaker 1: I like some non fictions.

115
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,187
Speaker 0: The cool thing though harpers.

116
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:26,609
Speaker 1: I don't like.

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,253
Speaker 1: they tend to like.

118
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:35,002
Speaker 0: you know reference non fictions I don't like to read them straight through is in the end the whole last question thing that I like to bring up all the Time.

119
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,340
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, I love this and it also brings up flatland.

120
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,518
Speaker 0: I think I was a lot of action to flatland by hyperspace.

121
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,734
Speaker 1: no flat You know what's good about flatland really tiny this really short book.

122
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,400
Speaker 1: You can read it in like a day.

123
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,487
Speaker 0: I thought you meant the flatland.

124
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:48,910
Speaker 0: worlds like.

125
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,340
Speaker 0: it doesn't say how long I'll be this.

126
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:54,638
Speaker 0: I mean we know Gandalf's penis is seven inches, but we have no idea how big flatland is.

127
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,104
Speaker 1: you know That's you know now.

128
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:56,486
Speaker 1: I can do.

129
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,878
Speaker 1: I could do a whole nonfiction book if it's the shortest flatland.

130
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,704
Speaker 0: Flatland was fiction.

131
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:09,371
Speaker 1: I know I'm just saying if a nonfiction book is the length of the flatland to fiction What was the last nonfiction book you read?

132
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:10,839
Speaker 1: well actually I read two.

133
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:18,324
Speaker 1: There's actually a certain kind of nonfiction that I can read straight through and I've actually read two of these so far in my life The narrative nonfiction.

134
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,074
Speaker 1: yeah the one where it's like you wouldn't know is nonfiction if they didn't say so right?

135
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:27,110
Speaker 1: so there was the star wars or Yeah, I actually forget the title.

136
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,940
Speaker 1: It's like devil in the white city.

137
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,410
Speaker 1: Is that what it's called the Chicago World's Fair?

138
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,368
Speaker 1: one right, and there's also the other one I read which is about one captain kid.

139
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so they're basically it's like.

140
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,059
Speaker 1: those are true stories.

141
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,866
Speaker 1: This is true story.

142
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:41,673
Speaker 1: a captain kid.

143
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,207
Speaker 0: pretty much This is the true story.

144
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,940
Speaker 0: true story of of ten dimensions in hyperspace.

145
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not.

146
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:51,720
Speaker 1: there's not characters in a narrative, and it's not you know excited.

147
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,489
Speaker 0: It's basically the kind of non wait wait wait, so you don't find exciting the Fundamental unifying theories of all reality.

148
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,074

232
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:38,917
Speaker 0: Seriously as a kid when I was young reading hyperspace.

233
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:39,680
Speaker 0: I was enthralled.

234
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:51,780
Speaker 0: I remember once I started reading it I obsessively like skipped most other things in my life to finish it because all I remember thinking just Constantly throughout this whole book was these are the motherfucking secrets of the goddamn universe.

235
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, but shit.

236
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:56,720
Speaker 1: another thing that was like how many of the things in hyperspace are still you know?

237
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,220
Speaker 1: The high-level theoretical physics is changing, you know, it's quiet.

238
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,800
Speaker 1: There's a lot of arguments and debates in that area, you know.

239
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,332
Speaker 1: So it's like is this right or is the other guy right?

240
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:15,037
Speaker 0: or you know, and I don't know Well, what other guy all the other different guys like there's a specific guy to whom you were referring.

241
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,684
Speaker 1: I Just forgot.

242
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:21,339
Speaker 1: I just remembered that there was a guy, you know Something reason I can't remember that.

243
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,100
Speaker 1: It's just like, you know when you got a thing in your brain like oh I remembered there was a guy who had some crazy theory.

244
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:27,927
Speaker 1: Oh, what the hell was that guy.

245
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,095
Speaker 1: and I can't remember those brown guys.

246
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see them all over the place anyway.

247
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:43,813
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day those brown guys by the way are groundhog.

248
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:48,269
Speaker 0: Scott didn't know what they were and one day He's like, you know those those little brown guys.

249
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,238
Speaker 0: They like run away when I walk by the train station.

250
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,999
Speaker 0: We're like Brownhogs, he's like, yeah, I don't think those are groundhogs.

251
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,050
Speaker 0: Those are groundhogs.

252
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,580
Speaker 1: No, what are those guys who come out of the hole in the ground?

253
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:04,600
Speaker 0: There's also like woodchucks beavers and all sorts of little brown guys.

254
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,112
Speaker 1: But I have a feeling those are woodchucks and they were not because they weren't.

255
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,778
Speaker 1: beavers doesn't have a flappy tail, right?

256
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,065
Speaker 1: You know, they didn't.

257
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:17,580
Speaker 1: they didn't come out of the ground in the holes they weren't the prairie dogs.

258
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,755
Speaker 0: Prairie dogs are kind of tan.

259
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,821
Speaker 0: They're not really brown Whatever.

260
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:22,443
Speaker 0: They also don't.

261
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:23,547
Speaker 1: tan is brown.

262
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,339
Speaker 0: They also don't live anywhere near here and they stand up and they're much smaller.

263
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:34,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so our friend Conrad this has become an affectation of his and it wore off rapidly.

264
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:41,220
Speaker 0: I feel like it's a very useful phrase But it caused me to google for some things that I recommend you all looking out.

265
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,313
Speaker 0: For example, Jerry Springer not that good of a show.

266
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,920
Speaker 0: Jerry Springer in India.

267
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:51,365
Speaker 1: Pretty goddamn funny, you know, I gotta say though I mean like I didn't watch.

268
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:55,099
Speaker 1: I haven't even thought about Jerry Springer since the late 90s.

269
00:14:57,161 --> 00:15:03,689
Speaker 1: But one time I was in a bus trip full of you know, full of teenagers and you know High school kids and we were going somewhere.

270
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:06,400
Speaker 1: I forget what the hell we were going was this high school.

271
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:10,095
Speaker 0: Okay, because you were like I was on a bus with a bunch of high school kids.

272
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:17,837
Speaker 1: I was in high school It was a field trip somewhere and they watched Jerry Springer the movie and at the time in that environment.

273
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:18,780
Speaker 1: There was some hilarity.

274
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,916
Speaker 0: But so this this phrase how can she slap?

Speaker 0: It's just.

277
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:38,599
Speaker 0: there's this like game show going on and this woman is yelling at this guy and he is kind of snarky back at her and she slaps him and He not taking that shit just slaps her right back.

278
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,805
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:48,843
Speaker 0: And then he pauses and he looks at her and he has this look on his face Like he cannot believe what just happened and he just starts exclaiming over and over again Okay, she slept.

280
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:50,608
Speaker 1: how can she slap?

281

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,960
Speaker 0: it's just There's something about the way he says it.

303

Speaker 1: Seuss a pretty frequent mashup target.

305
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,640
Speaker 1: and he mashed them which I don't think they've been mashed before.

306
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,705
Speaker 0: You know funnily enough on College Humor today.

307
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:13,196
Speaker 0: There was a children's sci-fi book spoof and it was dr.

00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:16,715
Speaker 0: Who in a dr Seuss style, uh-huh double doctor.

309
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:24,076
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, I'll just I'll just say a couple sentences here and you'll get the idea.

310
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,366

311
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:27,029
Speaker 0: they're pretty good.

312
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,067
Speaker 1: So already this body is old But it's all that I've got.

313
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,157
Speaker 1: when 900 you reach looks so good.

314
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,937
Speaker 1: You will not snap.

315
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,568
Speaker 0: It's a good Yoda - it's very Susean.

316
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:38,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's basically dr.

317
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,416
Speaker 1: Seuss Yoda.

318
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,067
Speaker 1: They got dr Seuss Java the Hut.

Speaker 1: they got dr.

320
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,235
Speaker 1: Seuss Darth Vader.

321
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:44,296
Speaker 1: Dr.

322
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:45,400
Speaker 1: Seuss Wookiee.

323
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:51,819
Speaker 0: You know, it saddens me that just from DDR and karaoke combined Wookiee Wookiee.

324
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, anytime I hear or see a Wookiee my first thought is not I can't make the noise or that.

325
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:02,920
Speaker 0: My first thought is the guy who has that cabinet that sounds like a Wookiee.

326
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,089
Speaker 1: And then did the way to make a Wookiee noise is to think about that.

327
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,180
Speaker 1: No you think about that that door that cabinet door.

328
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

329
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,871
Speaker 0: My second thought is Wookiee.

330
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,100
Speaker 0: Wookiee in the kitchen macho man is on a mission.

331
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,184
Speaker 1: Yep, that's right.

332
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:19,220
Speaker 0: My third thought is actual Wookiee's from real Star Wars the documentary.

333
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,078
Speaker 0: So you picked this book?

334
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,047
Speaker 1: Oh, I did pick this book, right?

335
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:29,238
Speaker 0: So, uh Wow, we're the yawning show is just continuing.

336
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:29,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

337
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:38,168
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the book is World War Z. I think this is a subtitle, but I don't have an oral history of the zombie an oral history.

338
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:38,650
Speaker 1: Is that right?

339
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,761
Speaker 0: I don't want to make fun of it.

340
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,568
Speaker 0: I'm trying not to.

341
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:42,618
Speaker 1: Anyway, I picked this.

342
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:56,555
Speaker 1: I normally right, you know I could tell even before I read it or before I knew anything about it just based on the title I was by Max Brooks who I later learned is actually the son of Mel Brooks, you know of.

343
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:03,690
Speaker 1: you know comedy awesomeness of Blazing Saddles and producers and you know that the real Mel Brooks You know Spaceballs.

344
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:07,245
Speaker 1: His son is Max Brooks, even though that I couldn't.

345
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,230
Speaker 1: I didn't know that until later.

346
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,230
Speaker 1: Anyway, you think this would have been funnier then right so clearly did not inherit the jeans.

347
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:25,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, I knew just from the title of the book right that this was basically one of those books that appeals to nerds With its proper noun ness, right?

348
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:25,791
Speaker 1: It's.

349
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:35,890
Speaker 1: it's like you could take pretty much any you know subject matter that nerds like, you know Be it like Frankenstein's monkey robot pirate ninja zombie, right?

350
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:47,021
Speaker 1: Whatever is in at the given time right and sometimes when you take those think vampires Sometimes when you take those things and mix them all together You can actually do a good job of it, right?

351
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:47,362
Speaker 1: Dr.

352
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,887
Speaker 1: McNinja is the perfect example.

353
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:49,650
Speaker 1: axe cop.

354
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:56,700
Speaker 1: You know also, you know, you can definitely do things that are high quality With this, you know, it's all.

355
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:05,710
Speaker 0: but at the same time for example, dr McNinja has this very pure idea of what would be awesome to a 12 year old and he knows what he's doing.

356
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:12,350
Speaker 1: I'm just saying right so, you know, I knew that World War Z was one of those things, right?

357
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:19,590
Speaker 1: But there was a chance that it was good in the dr McNinja way, but I didn't really expect it, you know to be good.

358
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:31,889
Speaker 1: I expected it to be a lot like cowboys vs aliens which I'm really surprised is becoming a movie because that is the worst comic book that I have bought in like Years, that's one of those comic books where you see it at the show.

359
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,389
Speaker 1: I bought it off of the order form based on the title But that's it.

360
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,684
Speaker 0: The title is all there is seeing the title is the only thing you need to see.

361
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,129
Speaker 0: you've already read the entire comic.

362
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:45,340
Speaker 0: that Concept is the entirety of the idea.

363
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,370
Speaker 1: Yes, so I'm like, okay someone wrote a book about zombies.

364
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,844
Speaker 1: This is gonna be just like those, you know, Pride and Prejudice and zombies.

365
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,730
Speaker 0: I heard those are actually okay.

366
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how good they are because I haven't read them.

367
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,810
Speaker 1: But you know, I assume well, maybe I sort of the book club.

368
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,528
Speaker 1: I categorized World War Z in that same category right as the Pride and Prejudice and zombies and all that.

369
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:17,790
Speaker 1: and I think there's a Lincoln one now, right I put it in that same bucket, you know in my brain of yeah stuff They just you know is basically pandering to nerds without actually being good and being kind of shallow like the IT crowd.

370
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:18,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

371
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:19,297
Speaker 1: I haven't I don't know.

372
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:22,070
Speaker 1: I can't remember this, you know, but there's the you know these sitcoms.

373
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:29,774
Speaker 1: I think there's one or two of them now where it's basically the same as every other sitcom except they just instead of you know Making a joke about.

374
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:35,650
Speaker 1: you know, whatever, you know, they guess the regular sitcoms make jokes about what a regular sitcoms make jokes about.

375
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,456
Speaker 1: I don't know cuz I don't watch them.

376
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,281
Speaker 0: I mean Seinfeld was a sitcom.

377
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:40,364
Speaker 1: That's true.

378
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:42,170
Speaker 1: But Seinfeld made jokes about nothing.

379
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,583
Speaker 0: So replace all the nothing with nerd proper nouns and there you go exactly right.

380
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:52,518
Speaker 1: for example, right Seinfeld has nerdiness But he doesn't come out right out with it.

381
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,710
Speaker 1: He's got Superman in the background just on his desk.

382
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:15,677
Speaker 1: He doesn't actually, you know come out with the Superman and make say oh man, that's like the time and Superman occasionally does anyway anyway, so I figured how well this World War Z book it was recommended if you remember when we interviewed, you know, the Mark from from vanilla.

383
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:16,700
Speaker 1: He said he liked it.

384
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,088
Speaker 0: You know, I don't remember that at all.

385
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:19,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did.

386
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,048
Speaker 1: He suggested it to us.

387
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:29,970
Speaker 1: I was like, alright this book, you know, even if I don't like it cuz I didn't expect to like it But I give anything a chance, you know, and I did have hope that it would be doctor.

388
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,633
Speaker 1: We didn't do whatever.

389
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:34,630
Speaker 0: I went in with low to moderate expectations, but not bottom expectation.

390
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:37,250
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know and it wasn't bottom by any stretch.

391
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,005
Speaker 1: I'll say that now but you know plus I did a similar thing with Locke Lammer.

392
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:54,287
Speaker 1: right Locke Lammer is like, okay I'm gonna pick a book that I don't think a lot of people know about but it was highly recommended And I'm pretty sure is just pandering to nerds But will be you know a a fun wild ride.

393
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:59,330
Speaker 1: so I was like, okay this book I don't know if it's good or bad, but I know that it appeals to the audience.

394
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,516
Speaker 0: I have.

395
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:07,926
Speaker 0: we survived the zombie apocalypse But how many of us are still haunted by that terrible time.

396
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,659
Speaker 0: we have temporarily Defeated the living dead but at what cost?

397
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,133
Speaker 0: told in the haunting and riveting voices of the men and women who witnessed the horror Firsthand.

398
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:20,686
Speaker 0: World War Z is the only record of the plague years.

399
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:31,550
Speaker 0: Yep That little temporarily there that sums up 90% of my problems with World War Z. that he writes in this infuriating.

400
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:37,290
Speaker 0: I'm so clever style and every character has this little like wink and a nod to other stuff constantly.

401
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:39,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get we'll get to that I'll get to that.

402
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:43,330
Speaker 1: but but I picked the book because it would appeal to listeners and get people to read.

403
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:46,047
Speaker 1: You know, and I hope it succeeded in that.

404
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,558
Speaker 1: And I read it Scott.

405
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,843
Speaker 0: So how does it succeed?

406
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:51,430
Speaker 0: All right, we got everyone to read a book.

407
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,520
Speaker 0: Let's say that they really liked it because your zombies whatever.

408
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,668
Speaker 0: All right, so we're like, yeah, you should read books.

409
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,330
Speaker 0: Try this one.

410
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,274
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, I read it.

411
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:11,516
Speaker 1: I liked it and then we shit all over the book that we just told that's fine It's it even if you like if you like it good for you And that me if you're reading and it's not a sports page or a magazine It's a book.

412
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:14,568
Speaker 1: now go and read other books that we also won't like.

413
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:19,570
Speaker 1: that are similar But you will like them and you will be reading so often funny before you came over Aaron see we're hanging out.

414
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,032
Speaker 0: He walks in.

415
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,118
Speaker 0: he sees the book on my desk.

416
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:21,420
Speaker 0: I got it.

417
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:30,720
Speaker 0: I was like, oh World War Z. That's a good book and I was just like Right, so the book right.

418
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,146
Speaker 1: very my opinion.

419
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,270
Speaker 1: it's not terrible.

420
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,476
Speaker 1: It's not like.

421
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,305
Speaker 1: I was in pain reading it.

422
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,954
Speaker 0: a couple of moments though There were.

423
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:38,537
Speaker 1: there were.

424
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,639
Speaker 1: that's the thing right is there are moments of Throughout but I wasn't in.

425
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:44,301
Speaker 1: I wasn't like.

426
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:46,570
Speaker 1: I can't go on, you know, it's so painful.

427
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:53,682
Speaker 1: well, it's just here and there I'd be like and I At the same time I cannot say that it was a page-turner.

428
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:55,830
Speaker 1: I just sort of turned the page out of habit.

429
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,837
Speaker 1: I wasn't like dying to read the next page.

430
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:01,390
Speaker 1: There was nothing pushing me forward, but there was also nothing pushing me back.

431
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:03,189
Speaker 1: It was just a slow walk.

432
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:07,470
Speaker 0: What's interesting to me is that I started World War Z with pretty low expectations.

433
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:15,315
Speaker 0: I mean I went into this thinking this is gonna be pretty bad, but I was pleasantly surprised like the first I don't know 20 or 30 pages.

434
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:17,565
Speaker 0: I was like, this is actually pretty engaging.

435
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,870
Speaker 0: Well, I like pretty well done.

436
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:35,281
Speaker 1: Well, I sort of had a similar thing right and what engaged me about the early part of the book I think was mostly the format because We're no matter what the writing or the plot or anything the the format of the book is not unique But it is rare and sort of interesting and clever right is?

437
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,130
Speaker 1: you know, it's this oral history of the zombie world.

438
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,315
Speaker 1: So basically each chapter is.

439
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,830
Speaker 1: it introduces you to a new character who tells their story.

440
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:49,730
Speaker 1: so it's like a whole bunch of short stories all in the same universe and You never actually get the straight-up story of the universe.

441
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,467
Speaker 1: What you do is you get all these individual people's stories of.

442
00:25:53,788 --> 00:26:06,510
Speaker 1: you know What happened to them in the zombie war and then you add them all together and as you read more and more stories You just learn by osmosis all these, you know things that you get the whole picture of what happened in the zombie war.

443
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,023
Speaker 0: It lets you get away as an author with a couple of things to say.

444
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:13,062
Speaker 0: you've got good vignettes You've got good ideas for like alright, there's a real zombie apocalypse.

445
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:14,790
Speaker 0: What are the interesting bits?

446
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,609
Speaker 0: Well, the last stand of the military is an interesting bit or what the fuck happens in North Korea like all these individual bits.

447
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:28,870
Speaker 0: and Then you can kind of skip the before and the after and every story can be in media res right at the good part.

448
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:30,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also sort of gets away from.

449
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:35,070
Speaker 1: You know the the ridiculous action movie sort of thing, right?

450
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:48,310
Speaker 1: Because when even an action movie all the interesting bits have to involve the main action heroes You have to come up with sort of this ludicrous winding path for him or her to always be in some ridiculously awesome Scene or daddy to heroes that's true.

451
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:54,800
Speaker 1: But or you know, you just thought that both of them always at the right place at the right time Where the big shit is going down.

452
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,949
Speaker 1: and here he doesn't need to do that He can just be like, you know.

453
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,078
Speaker 1: And it actually is a more realistic story.

454
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,910
Speaker 1: that way because there's no one who's always where the action is going.

455
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, he also gets around the fact that you know, it's improbable people would survive by well These are the few people who did.

456
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,510
Speaker 0: these are the people with the crazy stories.

457
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:13,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know in general a zombie story.

458
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:14,483
Speaker 1: everyone needs to die.

459
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:15,948
Speaker 1: No, you know, you're not.

460
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:16,833
Speaker 0: well There's like.

461
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:19,070
Speaker 0: there's two separate genres of zombie story.

462
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,369
Speaker 0: There's the people make it out and people don't make it out and they're like two completely different genres.

463
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,398
Speaker 1: The thing is it's always.

464
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:27,410
Speaker 1: the thing is for me a zombie story.

465
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,395
Speaker 1: They never make it out.

466
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,728
Speaker 1: But what you can do is you can drag it on.

467
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:35,410
Speaker 0: It's all You've seen the original night of the living dead, right?

468
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:37,821
Speaker 1: I think so.

469
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:40,524
Speaker 0: Ah Scott do they make it out?

470
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:43,209
Speaker 0: shouldn't?

471
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,129
Speaker 0: Because that is that I think defines the genre of that movie, which I don't think you've seen.

472
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:49,928
Speaker 1: I don't think you don't know the dead bit of me.

473
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,285
Speaker 0: Dawn of the Dead is very different movie from night of the living dead.

474
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,463
Speaker 0: I like that better Than the movie you've never seen.

475
00:27:56,484 --> 00:28:04,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay But so going into this one All right It's a head like that's a crutch an author can use to really like skip to the meat.

476
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:09,906
Speaker 1: and I was excited about that Because I yeah, cuz even though it's a crush it's still for the for the writer.

477
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:10,810
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt the reader.

478
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,430
Speaker 1: You're getting awesome stuff in every chapters.

479
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:19,429
Speaker 0: I want to have to deal with the hairy turtledove situation where he tells interesting some pretty realistic fiction about.

480
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:23,529
Speaker 0: you know What if the Civil War didn't resolve itself, you know, how would the next hundred years play out?

481
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,522
Speaker 0: But because he tells it as a straight narrative.

482
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:32,470
Speaker 0: He follows these characters I don't care about and he writes these really awkward sex scenes all over the place.

483
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,490
Speaker 1: You gotta come you know, a lot of people come out, you know, look at urasao, right?

484
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,920
Speaker 1: He comes up with a character that in you're like Oh, I don't care about this guy until the next page.

485
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,230
Speaker 1: when you care about them more than anything even try again.

486
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,077
Speaker 0: I mean brado.

487
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, right so People got.

488
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:49,576
Speaker 1: if you're gonna be a writer and you're gonna have characters You need to have that skill.

489
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:53,890
Speaker 1: where you can make someone care about a brand new person You just made up within a couple pages.

490
00:28:54,312 --> 00:29:02,768
Speaker 0: But I mean it was going strong in this because the narrative was good The characters were interesting and then four or five stories in I realized that all the characters sounded the same.

491
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:08,290
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, it's sometimes you know, a character would have an accent or a manner.

492
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:12,750
Speaker 0: It was always forced and affected like it stood out like he's trying to write this guy differently.

493
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:18,977
Speaker 1: yeah, and you know, the other thing was it's like Every character like.

494
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,078
Speaker 1: they didn't have like varying levels of Intelligence, you know, they all.

495
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:30,762
Speaker 1: even if they like you had seen the beginning of a chapter They would you know have this, you know affectation that was unique to the character kind of but then they would.

496
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:34,655
Speaker 1: this character would sort of fall back into explaining things in the same way.

497
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:38,164
Speaker 1: every other character explained things and the way the writer explained.

498
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:44,990
Speaker 0: but coupling that with I think the the Moment when I realized I really didn't like this book like when I went from this is pretty good to this is okay.

499
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,916
Speaker 0: I don't like.

500
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,830
Speaker 0: it was the story about the woman.

501
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:56,426
Speaker 0: I say woman here because I thought it was a man until the end just because the way it was written Who was shot down and like lost out in the wilderness that was actually a later on.

502
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,349
Speaker 1: that one wasn't.

503
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:58,373
Speaker 0: yeah It wasn't that far.

504
00:29:58,474 --> 00:29:59,317
Speaker 1: It was pretty close to.

505
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:00,522
Speaker 1: it was beyond the halfway point.

506
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:01,004
Speaker 0: Was it?

507
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I barely remember.

508
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:07,287
Speaker 0: I just felt like that moment as I forgot the entire time.

509
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:21,875
Speaker 0: It was a woman because of the way it was portrayed it sounded like every other character and most of them were guys and The whole time like well at the end the oh there really wasn't someone you're just crazy Was but

510
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:23,366
Speaker 1: I know but I saw that coming a

511
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:33,640
Speaker 0: mile away Yeah, but it was telegraphed and forced and I realized then that almost all the stories have a sort of Quote-unquote clever wink and a nod like oh, well, here's the.

512
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,345
Speaker 0: here's the bit about this story.

513
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:41,466
Speaker 0: Here's the shtick on this story Here's the gimmick on this story and everyone had a kind of lame gimmick stuck onto it.

514
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:45,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes I mean the thing that bothered me the most right.

515
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:50,218
Speaker 1: we're sort of the forced Nerdisms that showed up around right the otaku.

516
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,805
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the otaku is a huge.

517
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,249
Speaker 1: it is a small example, right?

518
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,040
Speaker 1: When they were talking about the people in the space station, right?

519
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they talked about like, you know, oh, yeah There's little robots who are outside the space.

520
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,370
Speaker 1: you saw all the different parts of the space station, right?

521
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,690
Speaker 1: And he's like, oh, yeah There's the Boba's that fly around with their little and I'm all the made-up acronyms and terms from this world.

522
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:13,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

523
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:14,342
Speaker 1: it's like okay.

524
00:31:14,362 --> 00:31:15,410
Speaker 1: They made a Star Wars joke.

525
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,910
Speaker 1: Obviously the little robots look like Boba Fett because they have little jet packs on them.

526
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:27,450
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, he did that, you know throwing one of those in there, you know It might make sense if the guy in the space station being a nerd I could buy that like you did.

527
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:35,363
Speaker 1: But there were like one or two of those pretty frequently Figured it all out the sandalers the water boys.

528
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:40,481
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like because You know, he threw these references in there and it was just.

529
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:47,223
Speaker 1: they were just so obvious thumb sticking out You know appeals to nerdism and pop culture in there.

530
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:53,589
Speaker 1: It was just like every time he did that I was just like, oh, could you have made that you know less smooth?

531
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,910
Speaker 1: Not not funny and also not timeless.

532
00:31:58,412 --> 00:31:59,295
Speaker 0: Well, he does that too.

533
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:04,673
Speaker 0: a lot of times he'll use a new term and he'll explain what it means or he'll have a weird Footnote about something.

534
00:32:04,693 --> 00:32:05,014
Speaker 0: They're like.

535
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:08,346
Speaker 0: they're like shiro tasms, but not quite on the scale of shiro.

536
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,298
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like that doesn't you know?

537
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:20,461
Speaker 1: if it's supposed to be about zombies It's supposed to be like, you know, there should be some suspense or there should be horror or you know Even you know, there's some gore in here.

538
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,170
Speaker 0: There was basically zero suspense.

539
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:40,704
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, it's actually much too Light-hearted like the people aren't really that upset and the ones that are upset are upset in this just kind of unrealistic and cliched way Like they're like he writes them like alright, this guy's obviously damaged psychologically.

540
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,694
Speaker 0: I mean I'm gonna write him Damaged.

541
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:45,662
Speaker 0: he's the damaged guy.

542
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:49,684
Speaker 0: Maybe see how he pauses all the time See how he looks wistfully off at the sunset.

543
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:50,570
Speaker 0: It just it hurt.

544
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:55,090
Speaker 1: Well, I mean technically speaking right this is supposed to be this one guy this character.

545
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,163
Speaker 1: You never get to know who goes around interviewing all these people.

546
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:14,530
Speaker 1: and these are all the interviews compiled You know that were taken out of his official report because they basically in the introduction It's like oh this guy did a report on the zombie war and they handed it into the government and they made him split it Up into the personal parts and the just straight flat boring government report part.

547
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:23,300
Speaker 1: this is all the parts that were taken out, you know of the non-existent fictional report and That had personal stories all compiled in order.

548
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:28,415
Speaker 1: So this guy that did the interviews right every time He went to interview someone.

549
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,444
Speaker 1: It's sorta was basically the same thing right?

550
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:33,350
Speaker 1: Remember in Gasaraki the guy with no eyes.

551
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like okay.

552
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:38,410
Speaker 1: next chapter He goes into the room and there's the guy with no eyes.

553
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,959
Speaker 1: He tells them about the zombie war engine X chapter.

554
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:47,238
Speaker 1: He goes into the room and there's the person with no eyes And every chapter that's what it was.

555
00:33:47,258 --> 00:34:00,422
Speaker 1: he was going to see the badass guy in Australia Or the badass person in the whatever, you know the badass otaku at his play, you know Right, and you could you could rationalize that that will.

556
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:01,730
Speaker 0: only the badass has survived.

557
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:03,358
Speaker 1: Well, that's true too.

558
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:18,810
Speaker 1: But the point is every you know, it seemed like every chapter It was going to see one of these people and it was like the same scene repeated and repeated Kind of modern like current political situation satire hand-fisted in like little winks and nods.

559
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:23,005
Speaker 0: So like yeah, well when they banned what's it, you know something or legalized?

560
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:23,708
Speaker 0: What's it things?

561
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,521
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah When they were basically he had a huge You know a lot of the stuff he put in.

562
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,389
Speaker 1: there was basically huge social commentary.

563
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:31,774
Speaker 1: That was not smooth at all.

564
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:35,324
Speaker 1: Like the whole thing with the drug to make a comment about.

565
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:39,375
Speaker 1: you know, the pharmaceutical industry Selling a fake medicine.

566
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:42,985
Speaker 0: that really bothered me that character who was so literally like.

567
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,128
Speaker 0: I just did it for the money.

568
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:44,830
Speaker 0: screw everybody.

569
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,826
Speaker 0: It was just so painful to read because it was so poorly done.

570
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:56,117
Speaker 1: Yeah And then oh, you know what else is pretty painful all the whole The whole military efficiency thing.

571
00:34:56,197 --> 00:35:08,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, they went to like great lengths to talk about the guns that don't jam and the shovels that can Kill zombies and the you know, the bodysuits that they can't bite you through and it's like you mean the obvious boring side.

572
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:15,350
Speaker 0: It is definitely one of those worlds where zombies rise up and no one has ever seen a zombie movie.

573
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:15,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean.

574
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,050
Speaker 1: and the scene where they were the US guys.

575
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:21,041
Speaker 1: They get a square and they have infinite ammo.

576
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,145
Speaker 0: now see the square.

577
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,859
Speaker 0: the way he wrote that He must have just read some history books recently or like.

578
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:33,062
Speaker 0: maybe he was like I got to look up what old military formations were like Oh Squares, yeah, that's kind of how they were.

579
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:40,410
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just all the military stuff was really unrealistically kind of painful.

580
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:48,259
Speaker 1: He would have been like, yeah We just invented cyborg and that's another thing right is it?

581
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,604
Speaker 1: sort of felt some points.

582
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:53,798
Speaker 1: it felt like he was talking about a near Future like 10 20 years from now.

583
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,270
Speaker 1: Yep, but a lot of I mean we're making a joke about the water boy.

584
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:07,389
Speaker 0: It's like no one to make a joke about the water by 10 20 years from now now kind of like how Miraculously in Star Trek most of the references to culture on earth is from the 19th and 20th century, right?

585
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,609
Speaker 1: You know, that's why you know, the really good stuff just doesn't you know?

586
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:19,366
Speaker 1: Don't be topical ever and your stuff will last longer and be better, you know, cuz it won't depend It won't you know only be popular for some period of time.

587
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:22,660
Speaker 1: or you know That's what separates a genre from a movement.

588
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,889
Speaker 1: right a movement only sticks around for a little bit.

589
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,198
Speaker 1: But a genre is you know, it's just forever.

590
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:28,402
Speaker 0: Well a movie like Shrek.

591
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:32,035
Speaker 0: That's basically just haha celebrity name Haha celebrity name.

592
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:35,910
Speaker 1: and I think you know, I think definitely what we're seeing now is a zombie movement, right?

593
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:36,596
Speaker 1: I don't think it's.

594
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:38,070
Speaker 1: uh, it's really a genre.

595
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,410
Speaker 1: I mean it is been around since what this, you know the 80s maybe that you know.

596
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:44,522
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you should watch Night of the Living Dead.

597
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 0: See what it should really be like.

598
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:50,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it's really I think it's you know going downhill.

599
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:59,499
Speaker 0: I think the the most egregious example of just the style of writing and what bothered me about it plot-wise Not all the other things is the whole North Korea bit though.

600
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,522
Speaker 1: We don't know.

601
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:01,846
Speaker 0: check this out.

602
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,170
Speaker 0: I thought of something cool.

603
00:37:03,411 --> 00:37:04,800
Speaker 0: We don't know what happened in North Korea.

604
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,544
Speaker 0: They're just gone.

605
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:08,496
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, no one went to find out.

606
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:11,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one would go to find out cuz they'd be landmines.

607
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,437
Speaker 0: Yeah Not gonna fly over.

608
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:15,964
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take a peek.

609
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:17,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously Oh.

610
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:26,782
Speaker 1: and then oh man the stuff about the the boats and The zombies in the water really unrealistic submarine.

611
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, the unrealistic submarine is escape.

612
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,135
Speaker 0: Oh, they came back.

613
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:35,490
Speaker 1: guys China's government the guys with the with the deep-sea diving stuff.

614
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:39,603
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you tried to think of like every remote location, right?

615
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:40,807
Speaker 1: It's like a James Bond movie.

616
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:44,967
Speaker 1: He's got a ski He's got a parachute into the mountain and then ski, right?

617
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:50,010
Speaker 1: And then he's got to drive a car have a boat race, you know, he went down the checklist, right?

618
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,199
Speaker 1: He's got the spay outer space underwater inception of an airplane.

619
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:58,843
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think was there any car such.

620
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:02,515
Speaker 1: I don't think there was a car situation That many cars left.

621
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:04,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had tank situations though.

622
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,210
Speaker 1: Definitely, you know in Humvee situations.

623
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:16,806
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's like he went through every possible environment, you know up in the mountains down on the beach You know every went off the whole checklist but they all kind of felt the same.

624
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:17,990
Speaker 1: it's like a video game, right?

625
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,723
Speaker 1: you got to have the forest level and the city level and the snow.

626
00:38:20,804 --> 00:38:27,730
Speaker 0: also his whole thing about Cuba and how Cuba becomes a world economic power and somehow funds the world war.

627
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:33,977
Speaker 0: Not only is Cuba little but that Geographically where it is.

628
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,648
Speaker 0: There is no way it would have been.

629
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,652
Speaker 1: okay You know what?

630
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,921
Speaker 1: It is a lot like DMZ right.

631
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,090
Speaker 1: you come with something that is never gonna happen.

632
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,420
Speaker 0: What if Manhattan was the line you come up with?

633
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,783
Speaker 1: just some really, you know, quote cool idea That is completely unrealistic on an unfeasible right like Yonkers.

634
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,650
Speaker 0: Why was Yonkers the standoff point?

635
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,112
Speaker 0: Why did?

636
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:53,596
Speaker 1: I don't know.

637
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:55,992
Speaker 1: but but it's just he just like Yonkers I don't know.

638
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:57,938
Speaker 1: but the I mean in DMZ.

639
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:08,175
Speaker 1: they get away with it because DMZ is really about the characters More so and it sort of also has these You know, it's like these shorter Stories about.

640
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:12,375
Speaker 1: you know in a very small environment, you know It's the same character is the.

641
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,930
Speaker 1: you're building on them and learning about them, but this was really more about the world.

642
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:20,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is this is like a world building thing, which I think is why nerds like it, right?

643
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,970
Speaker 1: I mean nerds seem to love you know the world building.

644
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,982
Speaker 1: That's why they love all these like D&D campaign settings, you know so much.

645
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,146
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god.

646
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,896
Speaker 1: It's in that campaign setting Oh my god, this is dark Sun on it.

647
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:35,690
Speaker 1: It's the greatest even though it might be the stupidest story in the universe.

648
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:39,770
Speaker 1: It's in that settings like they get there, you know, I mean there's a place for settings.

649
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:51,730
Speaker 0: I think I the only thing I really agree with you with because I like some Forgotten alums books even though I haven't read I got it alums books since I was in middle school High school early high school.

650
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:55,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but with the world.

651
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,482
Speaker 0: I think nerds are generally obsessed with world building and that sort of thing.

652
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:02,933
Speaker 0: in literature and in video games and everything I'm looking at me.

653
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:10,438
Speaker 0: people play D&D and they're obsessed with the rules of like building your keep and maintaining it and playing that Specifically playing sim keep.

654
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,530
Speaker 1: I think it's more that you know.

655
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,554
Speaker 1: It's like they'll be there.

656
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:17,590
Speaker 0: people get obsessed with like or they are the lore in World of Warcraft.

657
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,770
Speaker 1: Well, I mean think it's like people will read Star Wars novels right and it's because it's not because you know.

658
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:28,170
Speaker 0: I mean some of them are better than others obvious, but they're not reading them because they're paragons of literature unto themselves exactly.

659
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,450
Speaker 1: They're not reading them because they're great novels.

660
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,641
Speaker 1: They're reading them because they get their jollies off of the Star Wars universe.

661
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:46,242
Speaker 1: Like they're hopped up on a particular Fictional setting, you know and that setting is enough to like, you know turn, you know poop into gold for them Whereas me it's like gold is gold and poop is poop, right?

662
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:47,065
Speaker 1: I mean, I like.

663
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:52,170
Speaker 1: I like the Star Wars universe I think but it's like I can tell the difference in gold.

664
00:40:52,810 --> 00:41:03,020
Speaker 0: Lamora books are surprisingly popular is that they combine the here's a cool fantasy world and I'm gonna tell you bits about it as time Goes on with an actually good story and good writing.

665
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,364
Speaker 0: Well adequate writing.

666
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all those together work.

667
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,161
Speaker 1: It's better than World War Z.

668
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:13,230
Speaker 0: World War Z Tells gives me a kind of flat picture of a flat world with flat characters who all sound vaguely the same.

669
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:21,230
Speaker 0: I mean the crazy like nerd otaku hikikomori who somehow saves the day has the same voice as the military general.

670
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:27,905
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of you know, I Mean you could sort of be like wow, they were both hardened by the zombie war.

671
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:35,990
Speaker 0: So now they have a similar voice And his and his treatment of all the different countries was pretty flat and stereotypically almost everyone Japan just killed themselves.

672
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:36,981
Speaker 0: Oh, that's what they did.

673
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,233
Speaker 1: Yeah That's that is.

674
00:41:39,414 --> 00:42:00,560
Speaker 1: one thing is while he traveled the world and showed you stories from all over the place there wasn't a lot of He didn't really take the cultures of the different places into account as much as he took into account the geography You know It's like, you know people around the world would react very differently because they are of different cultures and they have different Outlooks on life, but he really

675
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,330
Speaker 0: he tended to always rely on either.

676
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:07,390
Speaker 0: Yeah The less advanced barbaric cultures were more affected because they couldn't effectively deal with it.

677
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,269
Speaker 0: The dictatorships were very able to deal with it.

678
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:13,202
Speaker 0: The evil governments just killed people to save the day.

679
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:15,130
Speaker 0: the good government's tried not to kill people.

680
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:24,730
Speaker 1: You know, there's no doubt that when I'm pretty sure he when he was writing this book The first thing he started with was a map right, you know, like a like an actual map of the world.

681
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:33,821
Speaker 1: That's definitely how he started writing this book You know, whereas you're supposed to write, you know, I don't know how you're supposed to write cuz I'm not an author But you know, if it's a it's a fictional book that I'm gonna write.

682
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:39,694
Speaker 1: you got to start with the character relationship kind of thing You know where you say, okay, this person's married to this bird, you know That's the.

683
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:50,248
Speaker 1: if you start writing a book that way I feel like that that's gonna result in a book I'm gonna like more than a book where you start writing it by saying, okay Well, the country of hubba-dubba is next to the country of whoop-a-doo, you know.

684
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:55,430
Speaker 0: Well one thing he did like, you know, we keep saying it's ham-fisted, but I was flicking through till I found a good example of it.

685
00:42:55,911 --> 00:43:00,003
Speaker 0: I noticed whenever he needed to affect a character and make them different from other characters.

686
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:05,596
Speaker 0: He tended to just swear a lot mmm, and The whole Cuba thing was crazy.

687
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:06,238
Speaker 0: This is some.

688
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:12,135
Speaker 0: this is just a short quote from one of the characters who basically Yeah, I don't remember a single character's name.

689
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:17,510
Speaker 0: He was in Cuba and he knew Castro when Cuba became a world superpower.

690
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,310
Speaker 1: I actually think I was right because all of these are technically interviews of the character.

691
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:36,290
Speaker 1: You only get the characters name once at the beginning of their chapter Right, so, you know to be like, oh I went in to interview so-and-so and that's the only time that person's name is in the Book, you know, but it doesn't repeat rarely, you know rarely if ever so you don't remember anyone's name.

692
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,298
Speaker 0: But listen, listen carefully.

693
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,310
Speaker 0: see if you can hear the ham that's gonna bounce off your ears.

694
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:44,887
Speaker 0: This is someone who worked under Castro in the new superpower.

695
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:45,550
Speaker 0: That is Cuba.

696
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:52,730
Speaker 0: Can you believe the cajones of that son of a bitch speaking of Castro to not only embrace the country's new democracy?

697
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,438
Speaker 0: But to actually take credit for it?

698
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,690
Speaker 1: who sorry who talks like that genius?

699
00:43:56,954 --> 00:44:05,030
Speaker 0: I mean, right It's basically right to personally preside over the first free elections of Cuba where the last official act was to vote himself out of power.

700
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:10,230
Speaker 0: That is why his legacy is a statue and not a bloodstain against a wall, right?

701
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:13,330
Speaker 1: So first of all, you can tell nobody talks like that, right?

702
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:28,490
Speaker 1: I mean, he's basically writing it as you know, he was you know narrating it, but he had to make this character say it Basically was like oh well this guy has to say well Well, you say the word cajones at the front of it and that it'll sound like that guy saying this thing.

703
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,643
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound like real person dialogue, but there's there's.

704
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:35,174
Speaker 0: the ham didn't even start yet There's only one more.

705
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:39,830
Speaker 0: we have hundreds of political parties and more special interest groups than sands on our beaches.

706
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:41,876
Speaker 0: We have strikes we have riots.

707
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:42,678
Speaker 0: We have protests.

708
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:43,942
Speaker 0: It seems almost every day.

709
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:46,730
Speaker 0: You can see why Shay ducked out right after the revolution.

710
00:44:47,193 --> 00:44:50,310
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier to blow up trains than it is to make them run on time.

711
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:51,674
Speaker 0: What is it that mr.

712
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:52,597
Speaker 0: Churchill used to say?

713
00:44:52,798 --> 00:44:56,350
Speaker 0: democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others laughter?

714
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:03,529
Speaker 1: it Yeah, like if you're gonna write dialogue It has to sounds like a person is talking.

715
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:09,270
Speaker 0: Granted dialogue is from from what every creative person has ever told me who actually does creation as their job.

716
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:11,463
Speaker 0: Dialogue is one of the hardest things to write.

717
00:45:11,563 --> 00:45:12,911
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely Cuz.

718
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:16,510
Speaker 0: it's easy to think what if you play Matt mean imagine someone trying to write our conversation.

719
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:20,285
Speaker 0: We're actually writing down all the words that we're saying like yeah, that's what they would say.

720
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:24,586
Speaker 1: Yeah I think what you know could he could have done?

721
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:28,542
Speaker 1: just you know One thing that what I think would have significantly improved the book an editor.

722
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:30,890
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure there was an editor.

723
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,180
Speaker 1: It was professionally published.

724
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:36,719
Speaker 1: Yeah is This guy who's going around doing the interviews, right?

725
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:45,327
Speaker 1: If instead of just you know, publishing the things that he wrote Give the the new perspective of sort of you know, this guy right.

726
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:54,116
Speaker 1: so show him Traveling to meet the people in the new world and then get you know what this guy's, you know Get something about this character.

727
00:45:54,237 --> 00:46:01,490
Speaker 1: also, you know, you know, he probably goes in to see someone and goes wow I was standing here, you know get what he give me give me what he's thinking right what that was?

728
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,371
Speaker 1: I was in this room with this totally crazy person and I was gonna freaking out right.

729
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:26,870
Speaker 0: what that also would do is now you would have a way cuz right now all that like the Sandler's and the Boba's and all these silly kind of world references to flesh out the world if he had spent if there's one contiguous narrative through the world those things would have at least felt more fitting because you'd have a Consistent narrative of the world as it is after the war instead of jumping all over the place in time and space.

730
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:34,065
Speaker 1: Yeah but if we can follow this one guy we can get his Reactions to all these different characters that he's going to visit and that you know.

731
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:45,710
Speaker 1: get that a little bit Yeah, but I mean it would really I think you know I mean it's like okay we see a person and we hear them talking and we get their story But it's like if we also get how this guy reacts to the story.

732
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:52,490
Speaker 1: It's like oh that was totally you can tell even more so that that was a crazy person or that was a badass person.

733
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:55,309
Speaker 1: It's like oh I felt in awe in the presence of this great general.

734
00:46:55,693 --> 00:47:00,506
Speaker 1: it would make him seem more like a general and less like the same voice as every other character.

735
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:10,088
Speaker 1: and if he was Totally afraid and wanted to get the hell out of there in the crate when he was visiting the crazy otaku It would make him feel more like a crazy otaku even though he wasn't really that crazy, you know.

736
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:14,069
Speaker 1: Then he would with the same voice as every other kid, right?

737
00:47:14,492 --> 00:47:27,714
Speaker 1: So, you know He could show more about these people by showing a person reacting to those people and by making the the author of you know the fictional author of the book in the book a Non character.

738
00:47:28,376 --> 00:47:30,624
Speaker 1: we sort of lost this whole aspect there.

739
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:35,322
Speaker 0: So as down as I'm on the book I mean, it's not a bad but it's not unreadable.

740
00:47:35,362 --> 00:47:39,163
Speaker 1: It's not like oh god the horror It's crystal triangle.

741
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,175
Speaker 0: I mean I said and I said It is the worst book.

742
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:45,564
Speaker 0: I have read in recent like in the last decade or so.

743
00:47:45,605 --> 00:47:47,530
Speaker 1: We don't read that many bad books.

744
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I said cowboys vs.

745
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:55,890
Speaker 1: Aliens is like the worst comic I've read in years because I don't buy really bad or read really really bad comic.

746
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,744
Speaker 0: I mean when I read Locke Lamora, that was one of the worst written books.

747
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:01,270
Speaker 0: I had read in recent memory.

748
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,441
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're reading the second one.

749
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they're Just cuz it's the bottom of my scale.

750
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,105
Speaker 0: doesn't mean that it's that bad.

751
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:08,230
Speaker 0: our scales really high.

752
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is way high but part of it's that you know.

753
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:17,698
Speaker 0: Locke Lamora was written adequately and books like the Prince of Nothing or Kevlar and clay are written excellently.

754
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:21,250
Speaker 0: This is written mediocrely, but it also tells a pretty bland story.

755
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:23,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you gotta have at least one of those things.

756
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:33,490
Speaker 1: But if you're but you know, if you're a nerd who really gets you know Like I said jollies off of worlds, right and or jollies off of the fact that there are zombies.

757
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:41,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want job and you think and you think that things like a bunch of guys standing in a square with infinite ammo Oh, man, it's just such a cool.

758
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:44,099
Speaker 1: You just think it's so cool

759
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,089
Speaker 0: or what happens in Antarctica

760
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:55,770
Speaker 1: And you're just like oh man, that's so cool and you know, I mean like if I was a teenager This would be the awesomest right because all you did when your teenager was thinking about awesome stuff like that.

761
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:57,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, some zombies weren't big back then.

762
00:48:57,857 --> 00:48:58,399
Speaker 1: No, they weren't.

763
00:48:58,419 --> 00:49:03,806
Speaker 1: but I was thinking about other stuff awesome like that, you know, so You know, it was big back then is from the 90s.

764
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,795
Speaker 0: You know action movies.

765
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:08,904
Speaker 0: a bunch of generic Libyan terrorists take over the building.

766
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,630
Speaker 0: Are you a bad enough dude to kick their ass?

767
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,243
Speaker 1: You know, I can I recommend the book to a certain audience?

768
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:16,310
Speaker 1: right the audience that will enjoy it immensely.

769
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:20,804
Speaker 1: But I don't you know put a stamp on it saying ah, this is good.

770
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:23,792
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's not worthy of any Prizes.

771
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:24,815
Speaker 0: this is not a book.

772
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,945
Speaker 0: I would have read to completion were I not forced to buy Scott.

773
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:34,910
Speaker 1: I Would not have read it period if I didn't think that you know, it would get people to read.

774
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:36,799
Speaker 0: I'm curious what you guys thought of it.

775
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:39,110
Speaker 0: I mean it was okay.

776
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:46,039
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that a lot of people you know liked it probably for the reasons that I just said and that I got them to Read and they're reading.

777
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:46,747
Speaker 1: reading is good.

778
00:49:47,432 --> 00:49:53,112
Speaker 1: That was that is the goal is to get people to read but from now on I'm only gonna pick books that I actually Like.

779
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:56,229
Speaker 1: in fact, I'm going to pick my favoritest books of ever.

780
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:59,750
Speaker 1: I'm gonna turn the tables all the other way.

781
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:03,304
Speaker 0: I also can't fault max Brooks at all because this is the next logical step.

782
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:04,770
Speaker 0: I mean, he hasn't written that much.

783
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:10,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, he wrote that zombie survival guide which sold so well plural right to the same audience.

784
00:50:10,712 --> 00:50:13,082
Speaker 1: So now, you know, he could just come out with this.

785
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:14,628
Speaker 1: It was a New York Times bestseller, right?

786
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:18,110
Speaker 1: If you're making money keep it up, dude.

787
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:27,586
Speaker 1: I mean if I was him, I wouldn't change it a bit you wouldn't get me to buy World War Z Sequel, but my world war X is that he becomes a better author.

788
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:28,750
Speaker 0: and you know, I haven't written.

789
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, you only get better with more practice.

790
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,824
Speaker 0: There is no way in my mind that he goes back and looks at the books.

791
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:35,170
Speaker 0: He's like that is perfect?

792
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:36,495
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

793
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:38,843
Speaker 1: But if you're making money, what do you care right?

794
00:50:38,863 --> 00:50:40,028
Speaker 1: I mean plus.

795
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:40,670
Speaker 0: maybe I'll get better.

796
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,514
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll do something else.

797
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:42,760
Speaker 1: dude isn't doing anything.

798
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,805
Speaker 1: He's a published author.

799
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:44,930
Speaker 1: He saw his bestseller.

800
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:47,456
Speaker 1: I doubt he has another job besides writing.

801
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:52,670
Speaker 0: also everyone we talked to who we trust who said this book was good.

802
00:50:53,494 --> 00:51:01,350
Speaker 0: on follow-up They all listen without exception to the audiobook which apparently takes departures from the novel and has really good actors.

803
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,013
Speaker 1: That is true.

804
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:06,590
Speaker 1: We are not audiobook people and you know, people are gonna say audio books are the same as reading.

805
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:13,430
Speaker 1: Well, okay Look if you want to get the story, right you want to know what happened you want to experience the drama or whatever?

806
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,250
Speaker 0: You want Morgan Freeman to read it?

807
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:22,531
Speaker 1: okay, an Audiobook is gonna be the same or possibly even better or maybe a little bit worse depending on the reading than the real book Right.

808
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:25,985
Speaker 1: It's not like watching the movie where you're gonna be missing all this stuff.

809
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:37,338
Speaker 1: You know if you watch Let's see, I don't know Lord of the Rings the movie versus reading the book, right you're Missing you're missing a whole thing.

810
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:39,409
Speaker 1: It's not even the same story really, right?

811
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:47,770
Speaker 1: Well, if you hear an audiobook of Lord of the Rings, that's well read and I'm sure there's plenty of them Right or the radio drama you're gonna get the same story.

812
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:53,395
Speaker 1: There's not like some fact that you don't know, you know all the characters, you know what they did Experience.

813
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:57,850
Speaker 0: now you're beholden to the interpretation of the person reading it in terms of their inflection their tone.

814
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:59,049
Speaker 0: They're true pause

815
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:19,170
Speaker 1: but I mean the real reason that I encourage reading over audiobook is because Reading the physical act of using your eyes to read a word and translate it to an idea in your brain Exercises a different muscle in your brain, right then does the processing audio into words into ideas?

816
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:28,017
Speaker 0: Also listening to an audiobook like even if the audiobook were word-for-word this book, which I don't think it is I don't know if I could listen to.

817
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:28,479
Speaker 0: we'll see.

818
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:31,009
Speaker 1: but I think most audiobooks are word-for-word.

819
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:33,581
Speaker 0: the book Yeah, but I heard that this one took some liberties.

820
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:34,264
Speaker 0: I don't actually know.

821
00:52:34,304 --> 00:52:35,630
Speaker 0: possible because they got big actors.

822
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,966
Speaker 0: You don't get big actors to have them play a perfect part.

823
00:52:38,148 --> 00:52:38,470
Speaker 0: That's true.

824
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:42,267
Speaker 0: I mean what made Star Wars great the fact that Harrison Ford changed the fucking lines.

825
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:52,588
Speaker 1: I know Well played Yes, but I was proud of that.

826
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:59,726
Speaker 0: But like when you read like reading cavalier and clay or the prince I just keep using they're good examples of the prince of nothing or even the count of Monte Cristo.

827
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:08,096
Speaker 0: the Physical words as they are printed on the page the way they are arranged the meter in the flow Can be a beautiful thing.

828
00:53:08,137 --> 00:53:10,629
Speaker 0: like that is an artistry independent of the story.

829
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:19,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean like I was saying the reason I want people to read a book and not the audiobook Even if the audiobook is good is to exercise that muscle in your brain.

830
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,473
Speaker 1: That is it.

831
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:21,718
Speaker 1: that is basically.

832
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,089
Speaker 1: what's the word for when a muscle is atrophied?

833
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,261
Speaker 1: You know, it's atrophied because you're not reading books, right?

834
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:29,445
Speaker 1: I mean reading the internet.

835
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:30,650
Speaker 1: It's not the same muscle.

836
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are studies about this.

837
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:36,490
Speaker 0: I read play a much more cynical role if you want to sound like a smarter person.

838
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:43,090
Speaker 0: Mispronouncing something is more kind of attuned to intelligent people or at least perceptive.

839
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:51,585
Speaker 0: It's perceived to be a trait of more intelligent people than misspelling something Because when you misspell things it implies that you have heard these words but not read them.

840
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,977
Speaker 0: if you mispronounce them It implies that you've read these words, but not heard them.

841
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,770
Speaker 0: Mmm, and the latter definitely has a perception of more intelligence.

842
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:00,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean not true.

843
00:54:00,795 --> 00:54:02,220
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I mean just.

844
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:02,461
Speaker 0: it's.

845
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:04,910
Speaker 0: it's something that you can use that to your advantage.

846
00:54:06,231 --> 00:54:08,098
Speaker 1: Anyway, you should you know reading is important.

847
00:54:08,118 --> 00:54:10,147
Speaker 1: You need to exercise all the muscles.

848
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:10,890
Speaker 1: Okay, she read.

849
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:17,476
Speaker 1: Okay, if you just want to know the story the audiobook does the perfect job, right but Kind of like.

850
00:54:17,496 --> 00:54:18,198
Speaker 0: look at Harry Potter.

851
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,463
Speaker 0: I like the story of Harry Potter.

852
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:21,230
Speaker 0: I cannot read those books, right?

853
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,256
Speaker 1: But if you want can't.

854
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:22,900
Speaker 0: so what I did?

855
00:54:23,282 --> 00:54:23,987
Speaker 0: I read spoilers.

856
00:54:24,148 --> 00:54:32,197
Speaker 1: if you want If you want the skill and the exercise part of your brain, you gotta read the book Even if you know audiobook might be better who knows.

857
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:32,939
Speaker 1: so?

858
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:42,799
Speaker 0: so if you like this and you haven't read any of the other books That we talked about I would recommend of all the books we've suggested in the geek nights book club Reading the lives of Locke Lamora next because it

859
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:45,190
Speaker 1: is the most the most similar of the book club books.

860
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:51,235
Speaker 0: Not that there are that many book club books but the difference is that Locke Lamora and World War Z Do the same kinds of things.

861
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:53,785
Speaker 0: Locke Lamora just does all those things as it like.

862
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:55,170
Speaker 0: the author does them better.

863
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,018
Speaker 1: it's sort of the same category of book.

864
00:54:57,299 --> 00:55:02,269
Speaker 1: that is not serious, but it's fun and enjoyable, you know.

865
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:06,974
Speaker 0: But what you'll be able to do is if you don't if you're like why you're so down in World War Z it was fine.

866
00:55:07,255 --> 00:55:21,570
Speaker 0: read Locke Lamora, which is the same kind of thing and Hopefully by the end of it It'll be obvious to you that is just as a book just as a book ignoring the story is better written That if that style or that like if good writing like that?

867
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,775
Speaker 0: Well, I keep saying good.

868
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:30,767
Speaker 0: if adequate writing like that had been used in World War Z World War Z would have been a much better Book, even if the story were word for word event for event the same.

869
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,638
Speaker 0: Yep I guess it couldn't be word for word the same.

870
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:38,395
Speaker 1: when you can see when you can you know begin to tell what writing is Better than what other writing then you'll.

871
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:44,177
Speaker 1: you'll begin to understand what books are better than what other books or in the very least you can Disagree with us intelligently.

872
00:55:44,197 --> 00:55:47,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the only way that you can do that is by reading a lot.

873
00:55:48,232 --> 00:55:52,609
Speaker 1: You know if you want to argue about books and you're not well read you basically have to shut up.

874
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:55,009
Speaker 1: So I suggest reading now.

875
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:56,173
Speaker 0: I mean consider this.

876
00:55:56,454 --> 00:56:20,678
Speaker 0: I could make the argument that the bland and flat style of World War Z and that all the characters sound the same was Intended to convey the idea that the entire world all these people with different lives different cultures different Geographies because geographies so big we're kind of because of the shared experience of the zombies all became very similar like a world culture spawned Independently of location and was.

877
00:56:20,738 --> 00:56:24,150
Speaker 1: it was a bit of a macross Ian watch many in situation.

878
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:25,829
Speaker 1: There was definitely that message was in there.

879
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:36,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean I could make the argument that the way it was written was intentional Even though we might perceive it as bad if we understand it was intentional to convey that point on multiple levels.

880
00:56:36,189 --> 00:56:40,469
Speaker 0: anyway I can make my skycrawlers a great movie Mamoru.

881
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:48,294
Speaker 0: She was very very boring and slow.

882
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:51,176
Speaker 1: Well, you know that's intentional right?

883
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:55,450
Speaker 1: Yes, the thing is but it was boring, you know that because of the matter, right?

884
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:56,253
Speaker 1: It's mamoru.

885
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:59,467
Speaker 1: She so, you know, he's doing it on purpose because you know the guy.

886
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:00,892
Speaker 1: but Max Brooks We know him.

887
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:07,906
Speaker 1: This is a guy who gets the cheap lulls and the big sales off of a zombie survival guide You know, so you can't.

888
00:57:08,168 --> 00:57:09,073
Speaker 1: you know You have to.

889
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:13,290
Speaker 1: the burden of proof is on you to prove to me that Max Brooks is trying to be clever like that.

890
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:17,004
Speaker 1: But you don't have to do it to say anything to convince me that mamoru.

891
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:19,992
Speaker 1: She was trying to be all snooty Pretend.

892
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:27,229
Speaker 0: so while the quote on the cover from the Dallas Morning News is probably the most topical and literate scares since Orson Welles War of the Worlds.

893
00:57:28,671 --> 00:57:37,548
Speaker 0: But on the back that the onion said something pretty hilarious was an onion AV Club, yeah Okay, they said quote an oversized version of hell.
