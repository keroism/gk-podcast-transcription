1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,360
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,702
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:13,890
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,294
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:20,370
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about the number of players in games.

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,527
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,650
Speaker 1: So I did go into the office today and it's still nice out and also COVID time.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:43,070
Speaker 1: So when that happens, I always bike and I use the city bike because it's easier than going down to the bike room and getting my bike through the security area and taking it up and then get into the office and going through the bike parking area.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,670
Speaker 1: City bike for such a short ride kind of just works.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,550
Speaker 1: But this morning I go down and of course all the bikes are gone in the main dock even though I left early.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,693
Speaker 1: So no trouble.

12
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:56,390
Speaker 1: So I walk around the corner to another dock and there's only two bikes on this dock.

13
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:59,850
Speaker 1: And I look and all the city bikes are gone for some reason in the area.

14
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,138
Speaker 0: So fine.

15
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:05,570
Speaker 1: I go to get one bike and it just like fails.

16
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:07,364
Speaker 1: And now I'm kind of in a hurry.

17
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:07,990
Speaker 1: So crap.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
Speaker 1: So I go get the other bike and it works fine.

19
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,790
Speaker 1: And I start biking and I make it exactly halfway over the bridge.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:24,940
Speaker 1: And then I realize in my haste I left my city bike key in the fucking city bike dock that also has it also has my house key and my Yuba key on it.

21
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:26,879
Speaker 0: Oh no.

22
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:34,260
Speaker 1: So I immediately turn around and I bike as fast as I can on a city bike which thankfully was there.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,587
Speaker 1: It was mostly downhill.

24
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:35,788
Speaker 1: Yep.

25
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,380
Speaker 1: It was just there in the dock.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,619
Speaker 1: And I think if nothing else what saved me was one.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,719
Speaker 0: The dock was empty so no one was going to go to that dock.

28
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:44,105
Speaker 1: That's it.

29
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,980
Speaker 1: There's two things going on here.

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,700
Speaker 1: One wall thing is if you lose something on the street like it's often just gone in New York you just got to live with that.

31
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:58,800
Speaker 1: But generally the etiquette in New York is if you see something on the street that someone probably lost the best bet is to leave it there.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,240
Speaker 1: Because whoever lost it will probably come back trying to find it and cross its path.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,380
Speaker 1: Unless you're like in a venue where there's like a lost and found or security or something.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:07,841
Speaker 0: Yeah.

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,225
Speaker 0: Subway.

36
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,740
Speaker 0: You can take it to the booth on the subway.

37
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,669
Speaker 1: I have taken things to the booth before.

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,839
Speaker 1: I retrieved something from the booth before.

39
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,280
Speaker 1: But if you find something like on the street like I've seen people's keys just like on the street.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,979
Speaker 1: And usually I just leave them there because I figure whoever it is is going to fucking come back like I did.

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,960
Speaker 1: Imagining in their head the pain in the ass of losing your keys.

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,490
Speaker 1: And it was there and it was fine and I biked back to work.

43
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,358
Speaker 1: and that's the most exciting thing that happened to me today.

44
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,789
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

45
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,513
Speaker 1: My biking bit.

46
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:38,599
Speaker 1: Got any gaming news?

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,706
Speaker 0: Gaming news.

48
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,599
Speaker 0: I mean the Metroid game came out.

49
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,200
Speaker 1: But you got the Diana Jones award.

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,642
Speaker 0: Yeah right.

51
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:50,372
Speaker 0: So the Diana Jones award if you don't know about it.

52
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,400
Speaker 0: I think we've talked about it on the show at least once or twice before.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,916
Speaker 0: We had to.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,562
Speaker 0: This award.

55
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,413
Speaker 0: Yeah it's from like 20 years ago.

56
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,620
Speaker 0: I think it's been around.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,720
Speaker 0: And it's basically this award where they constructed it out of like a piece of wood.

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,939
Speaker 0: A burnt copy of an Indiana Jones RPG.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,779
Speaker 0: Like literally burnt set on fire.

60
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:19,900
Speaker 0: And then encased the remains of the burnt RPG in some sort of like acrylic pyramid thing and stuck it on there.

61
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:25,500
Speaker 0: So it looks like some sort of ancient artifact that Indiana Jones would maybe get somewhere.

62
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:32,280
Speaker 0: And they have a committee that's a somewhat secret committee that just nominates.

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,420
Speaker 0: It announces nominees and then at Gen Con it announces a winner.

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,860
Speaker 0: Literally it's just for excellence in gaming annually and the award can go to anything.

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,265
Speaker 0: It can go to a game.

66
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,913
Speaker 0: It can go to a person.

67
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,540
Speaker 0: It can go to a concept.

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,125
Speaker 0: There was the year that actual play won.

69
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,909
Speaker 0: Board Game Geek won it one time.

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 1: And in a way a lot of what they do is like how it's gotten.

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,820
Speaker 1: We did a show a long time ago on award shows and awards and like nomination processes and everything.

72
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,439
Speaker 1: This is more than a decade ago.

73
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:12,280
Speaker 1: And we talked a lot about how if we made one we would just pick a bunch of people who we trust and they just fucking decide.

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,040
Speaker 1: And we don't like do any weird drama or have an academy that just doesn't watch movies.

75
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,005
Speaker 0: Dominion won one time.

76
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:20,950
Speaker 0: Nordic LARP.

77
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,259
Speaker 0: Just the concept of Nordic LARP just won once.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,886
Speaker 1: The 2001 winner was Peter Edkison.

79
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first person.

80
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, CEO of Wizards of the Coast.

81
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,833
Speaker 0: The guy who founded Wizard of Watsi.

82
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, famous person.

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,240
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this year in 2021, the winner was Casey from Nib Card Games.

84
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,740
Speaker 0: If you don't know about Casey, I was first found out about Casey at the first Unplugged.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,367
Speaker 0: I think there was some sort of.

86
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,820
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what the involvement was, but that's right.

87
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,480
Speaker 0: Somehow learned of his existence.

88
00:04:53,081 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 0: He's this dude in Nigeria and basically is like a one man show as far as board games are in Nigeria.

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:00,821
Speaker 0: Right.

90
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:11,840
Speaker 0: You can't imagine most of the board game companies in the world are, you know, especially with the supply chain deal, are not, you know, they're not shipping a thousand copies of ticket to ride to Nigeria.

91
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,925
Speaker 0: Right.

92
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:18,280
Speaker 0: So basically this dude, he, A, publishes board games.

93
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:18,966
Speaker 0: Right.

94
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,219
Speaker 0: Designs board games.

95
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:25,580
Speaker 0: He has a board game cafe store place and he runs a convention.

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,500
Speaker 0: He basically does every board game thing that needs to be done all in Nigeria.

97
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,806
Speaker 0: Right.

98
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:37,960
Speaker 0: Pretty much carrying, you know, Nigerian board games on his back over there.

99
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:43,420
Speaker 0: And the Dana Jones Award recognized his excellence, which is very well deserved.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,080
Speaker 0: I would have also chosen Casey from amongst the nominees.

101
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:49,179
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic choice.

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,199
Speaker 0: I follow Casey on Twitter and he tweets a lot of good stuff.

103
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:54,639
Speaker 0: So that's good.

104
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,079
Speaker 0: The second news is a sadder news.

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,660
Speaker 0: The the Diana Jones Award, unlike say, you know, well, like the Stanley Cup.

106
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaker 1: I was about to say this is our favorite kind of trophy.

107
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,349
Speaker 0: There's just one.

108
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,660
Speaker 0: They don't keep making new ones.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,940
Speaker 0: They don't have more copies of the Indiana Jones RPG to set on fire.

110
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,459
Speaker 1: So we might need to start sourcing some.

111
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:16,945
Speaker 0: Maybe.

112
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:17,916
Speaker 0: I don't know where you get it from.

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,639
Speaker 0: But anyway, so there's just one of them.

114
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:26,119
Speaker 0: And what they would do is they would just sort of if the person who won it was at Gen Con, they'd be like, here you go.

115
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:30,540
Speaker 0: And if the person who won it, you know, wasn't a Gen Con, they'd like mail it to you, whatever.

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,439
Speaker 0: So you basically get to hold on to it for a year.

117
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:34,638
Speaker 0: They just, you know, just like here, hey, go have it.

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, like here.

119
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,839
Speaker 1: Here's here's the Stanley Cup.

120
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,159
Speaker 1: Well, though, with an asterisk that is a little more complicated with the Stanley Cup.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

122
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,100
Speaker 0: So Alex Roberts was the twenty nineteen winner and Alex Roberts had it in Canada.

123
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:56,420
Speaker 0: And the winner in twenty twenty was Black Excellence in Gaming, where they gave the award to like several, like a whole bunch of people all at once.

124
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,799
Speaker 0: So they didn't actually Alex Roberts just held on to the physical object.

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,820
Speaker 0: But at this year, they actually had a Gen Con.

126
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,020
Speaker 0: So there was an attempt to mail the Diana Jones Award.

127
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:14,280
Speaker 0: Alex Roberts went to the Canadian post office and mailed it to one of the, you know, Diana Jones committee people.

128
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,288
Speaker 0: And it did not arrive.

129
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,160
Speaker 0: And there's like no tracking and they don't know where it is.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,679
Speaker 1: It's the way you said that there was an attempt.

131
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,660
Speaker 0: It's probably just gone.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,420
Speaker 1: It's like when we tried to mail that Animal Crossing poster from Australia to our friend.

133
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just gone, which is sad.

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,500
Speaker 0: But, you know, the physical award isn't what matters here.

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,080
Speaker 0: Right.

136
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:42,240
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, they can keep awarding the Diana Jones Award without the Diana Jones Award.

137
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 0: Right.

138
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:52,620
Speaker 1: Though, I would love, I hope that at some point, like a decade from now on Geek Nights, we cover like, hey, somebody found the Diana Jones trophy.

139
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll be some way.

140
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,434
Speaker 0: It's somewhere on Earth.

141
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,280
Speaker 0: It's not like incinerated.

142
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,140
Speaker 1: I highly doubt it is incinerated or crushed or something.

143
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:09,820
Speaker 0: No, but what could happen to it is if it's like really lost in the mail, that eventually the whatever postal service, if it, you know, if they don't deliver it, it might be just trashed or something.

144
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,959
Speaker 1: Or sold off at auction in a lot or something.

145
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,250
Speaker 0: Stolen, you know, someone's just got it.

146
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:17,637
Speaker 0: They know what they knew what it was.

147
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:18,260
Speaker 0: They just got it.

148
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,560
Speaker 1: Some nerd has to make a documentary just about the trophy and like try to track it down and probably fail and make a YouTube video about it.

149
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,380
Speaker 0: It's really hard to find something that's lost in the mail.

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,684
Speaker 1: Yup.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:27,811
Speaker 0: Anyway.

152
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,914
Speaker 1: So, I played the Actraiser Renaissance, the remake.

153
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,078
Speaker 1: I got through most of the film.

154
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,475
Speaker 0: So isn't it just the same as Actraiser 1, only HD?

155
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,760
Speaker 1: Nope.

156
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:44,975
Speaker 1: So I, being the kind of person that I am, and apparently you're the same way, I don't read reviews of games.

157
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:46,920
Speaker 1: I play games myself and I review them.

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,320
Speaker 1: So I did not read anything about the Actraiser remake other than all the stuff around the new soundtrack.

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,185
Speaker 0: I saw the Nintendo Direct really announced it.

160
00:08:55,305 --> 00:09:00,640
Speaker 0: And that looked like it was just an HD remake of the original with also the option to go non-HD.

161
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,361
Speaker 0: Yup.

162
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 1: So I did also that, well, the big news I was focusing on was that because Actraiser on the Super Nintendo had one of the bitchinest scores to like grace the Super Nintendo as a platform.

163
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:15,920
Speaker 1: It was such a good soundtrack.

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:25,120
Speaker 1: And the remake, as we talked about, has a recomposition, like an HD version of that score.

165
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:31,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know, didn't we already talk about Yuzo Koshiro's comments regarding what he did on this?

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,662
Speaker 1: We talked about that.

167
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,367
Speaker 1: So I figured I was going to play it.

168
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:39,340
Speaker 1: And what I expected was I'll play janky old Actraiser, but I'm just going to revive to the soundtrack.

169
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is actually, they added stuff.

170
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:45,592
Speaker 1: This is way different than the original Actraiser.

171
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:49,120
Speaker 1: And honestly, it's just better in every possible way.

172
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,219
Speaker 0: Well, how much money is it?

173
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,543
Speaker 1: It's 30 bucks right now.

174
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,900
Speaker 1: I would say it might be worth 30 bucks if and only if you have never played the original Actraiser ever.

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,719
Speaker 0: I think that's most people.

176
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:18,300
Speaker 1: I think it would be worth your while then to try this game out because despite the fact that the town part is not that great and the platforming is also not that great, there still is a dearth of games that have both the town and the side scroll.

177
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,600
Speaker 0: That's true.

178
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,485
Speaker 1: So what's different?

179
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,450
Speaker 1: I'll talk about what's different.

180
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,279
Speaker 1: Because having played it so far, I'm really enjoying it.

181
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,246
Speaker 1: One, they really, like.

182
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,250
Speaker 1: there's characters now.

183
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,418
Speaker 1: Like the angel is a character with a lot of dialogue.

184
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:30,960
Speaker 1: She's really cute.

185
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,680
Speaker 1: You are this super hot god and they have like anime visual novel looking art for everybody.

186
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:41,830
Speaker 1: They added a bunch of characters who are new, who interact with you and the angel.

187
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:46,000
Speaker 1: And they're also heroes that will move into your towns and can be leveled up.

188
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,479
Speaker 1: There's also tower defense of the towns.

189
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,418
Speaker 0: That sounds fun.

190
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:59,240
Speaker 1: The towns will like get attacked and you got to deal with that shit and you can use your god powers just like you do in the normal game, like drop lightning on them and stuff.

191
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,300
Speaker 1: You can direct your town folks like the heroes where to go fight at doing the tower defense game.

192
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,980
Speaker 1: You're building palisades and forts and things and like how much do you fortify your town?

193
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,160
Speaker 1: If you got a lot of forts, that reduces how much the town produces.

194
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Speaker 1: And beyond that, it just has a ton of quality of life improvements that make the town bit a little more complex, like a little meatier.

195
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,831
Speaker 1: There's a little more to chew on when you're playing it.

196
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,380
Speaker 1: It's not just trivial.

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,307
Speaker 1: Because I thought, "Oh whatever, they added a tower defense.

198
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,089
Speaker 1: This game's so...".

199
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:30,751
Speaker 1: and then I died.

200
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:31,413
Speaker 1: I was like, "Wait, what?

201
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:32,235
Speaker 1: What?

202
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:32,977
Speaker 1: Game over?

203
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:33,820
Speaker 1: What?".

204
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:37,619
Speaker 1: I actually had to try a little bit in the early tower defense part.

205
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:43,340
Speaker 1: So they added all these extra systems to make the town part not just a nothing game.

206
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Speaker 1: Because as much as I love the original Actraiser for being unique, the town part of the original Actraiser is kind of a nothing game.

207
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:56,680
Speaker 1: It feels good when you first start playing, but there's so little there.

208
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,920
Speaker 1: There are so few mechanics that it just pads out playtime before you go back in and do the side scroller.

209
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:10,600
Speaker 1: In terms of the side scroller, it's pretty much the exact same game, right down to the janky controls.

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,470
Speaker 1: But they added a few more combo-y attacks.

211
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,880
Speaker 1: you can do that make it more fun and more like a modern side scroller.

212
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 1: And they added a backdash, like Symphony of the Night style, which actually makes it playable.

213
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:32,278
Speaker 1: Unlike the original side scroller, which honestly, good for its time, not good by 21st century standards.

214
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,123
Speaker 1: So, I don't know.

215
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,246
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying it.

216
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:44,039
Speaker 1: I'm going to give it a full review after I beat it because I don't know if it actually gets a lot harder or if more things come in.

217
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,460
Speaker 1: But so far there have been enough changes to where it is a materially different game.

218
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,380
Speaker 1: So speaking of which, how's that Metroid Dread?

219
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,869
Speaker 1: I have not even started it yet.

220
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:59,770
Speaker 0: I mean, the Metroid Dread is a 2D Metroid game, much like Super Metroid.

221
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:05,070
Speaker 0: It's really good, right, in terms of anything you want from a Metroid game.

222
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,373
Speaker 0: The new stuff is exciting.

223
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:21,930
Speaker 0: The only thing is I think other people who aren't me could, and I totally agree, could say that it's the best Metroid.

224
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,422
Speaker 0: It's even, you know, it's at the Super Metroid level.

225
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,869
Speaker 0: And I could see why they would say that.

226
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,160
Speaker 0: It's just that me personally, and this started a huge discussion today with our friends, right, is.

227
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,850
Speaker 0: I'm not personally a fan of, you know, action video games that are Simon Says-y, right?

228
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:51,150
Speaker 0: So, you know, you look at a lot of popular games these days, like in the action genre, like say like the Bayonetta types or the Souls types, right, where you're like doing these Simon Says fights.

229
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,395
Speaker 0: We're like, oh, the bad guy does this animation.

230
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:59,870
Speaker 0: That means at this timing, you push these buttons to roll out of the way, and then you attack.

231
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,150
Speaker 1: That's kind of how, like even Actraiser is like that.

232
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like you look at say like Breath of the Wild, it's like when you're fighting a Lynel.

233
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,684
Speaker 0: It's like, well, when the Lynel does this attack, you gotta, you know, press A at the right time to counter, right?

234
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,830
Speaker 0: It's like, it's a very Simon Says kind of play, and I feel like I've done a lot of that.

235
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:25,550
Speaker 0: I enjoyed some of it in the past, but these days and for the past several years, I really do not enjoy that, right?

236
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:33,890
Speaker 0: It's like when a game, if a game is entirely that, like just a straight up action game, I just don't play them, even if I might recognize that they're well made.

237
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,292
Speaker 0: And what about how?

238
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:41,289
Speaker 1: most of them, it's Simon Says, but there's multiple patterns you can do that all have this, that will all successfully deal with.

239
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:48,070
Speaker 0: There are a lot of subtle differences between all of the games, yes, and some of them do it better than others.

240
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,526
Speaker 0: You could probably spend days and days and days just talking about that specific, that narrow topic.

241
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,830
Speaker 0: There's so much material there.

242
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,330
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm still working on that panel of just looking at resource loops and threat levels of characters in team based first person shooters.

243
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:05,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Simon Says in video games is huge.

244
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:16,110
Speaker 0: It's so huge, it's actually difficult to imagine, like when you think about games without Simon Says, like, oh, the boss doesn't signal what attack he's going to do.

245
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,990
Speaker 0: It sounds like a bad game, right?

246
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,798
Speaker 1: Honestly, they usually are.

247
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,889
Speaker 1: Usually, boss fights and things like that are not fun.

248
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

249
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:31,850
Speaker 0: But it's just like, you can't think of anything else in between bad game and just, like if I want to play Simon Says, I could play DDR.

250
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,796
Speaker 0: See, I think you're oversimplifying, though.

251
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,080
Speaker 1: It isn't just Simon Says.

252
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,886
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different ways to react to things.

253
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:37,950
Speaker 1: That's just skill.

254
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,389
Speaker 1: Fencing is just Simon Says by that logic.

255
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,744
Speaker 1: Literal real world fencing is just Simon Says by that logic.

256
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:45,890
Speaker 1: You react.

257
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,310
Speaker 0: But a literal real world person doesn't just have like five patterns.

258
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, they kind of do.

259
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,416
Speaker 0: They only have five moves.

260
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:54,240
Speaker 0: They don't have any more.

261
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,430
Speaker 0: They do them exactly the same way each time.

262
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,730
Speaker 1: So what, you just want a harder boss that I feel like you would get even more frustrated with if it just acted like a real thing?

263
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,499
Speaker 0: It's not about the frustration, right?

264
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,850
Speaker 0: It's like I beat all these bosses, no problem.

265
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:11,050
Speaker 0: I just don't enjoy the Simon Says pattern boss combat.

266
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,923
Speaker 1: But what pattern do you want, then?

267
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:13,246
Speaker 1: A fight?

268
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,734
Speaker 0: I don't want a pattern.

269
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:18,050
Speaker 0: I want it to be like I'm playing against a person where there is no pattern.

270
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,890
Speaker 0: Like if you're playing a fighting game and the other person is just a person, who knows what the hell they're going to do.

271
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:32,130
Speaker 1: But almost the entire skill of fighting games is reacting to slight movements and frame timing of the other player to then deal with their combos.

272
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,697
Speaker 0: That aspect of fighting games I don't like.

273
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,810
Speaker 0: But the aspect of the other person is a person.

274
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,869
Speaker 0: And it isn't just a loop that says, "Randomly pick from this list of three

275
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:43,110
Speaker 0: things.".

276
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,390
Speaker 0: Alright, now pick from the same list of three things again.

277
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,710
Speaker 0: And once you've taken enough damage, the list of things you can do expands.

278
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,450
Speaker 0: Now pick from this list of things randomly in a loop.

279
00:16:53,130 --> 00:17:01,430
Speaker 1: So the only difference between what you're describing and a real world fight or a morgue is just how many things are on that random list.

280
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,429
Speaker 1: And there aren't that many, even in real world situations.

281
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:06,601
Speaker 0: Regardless, right?

282
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:07,549
Speaker 0: Metroid, Dread.

283
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:11,349
Speaker 1: I don't think you just don't like playing real time games anymore.

284
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:13,670
Speaker 0: I mean, whatever.

285
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,688
Speaker 0: With bosses of any kind.

286
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:26,569
Speaker 0: We can discuss that later, but the point is, compared to other Metroid games, Metroid Dread really goes harder on the action, you know, Simon Says parts.

287
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,890
Speaker 0: Ooh, that makes me excited, actually.

288
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:35,090
Speaker 0: Alright, it's like, not only are the bosses very action game, right?

289
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,549
Speaker 0: If you like those kind of games, which most people do, I'm the weird one.

290
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:46,090
Speaker 0: You'll love the bosses in Metroid Dread because within that, you know, framework, they are excellent, right?

291
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:56,150
Speaker 0: And not only that, but also, you know, in most Metroid games, the regular old enemies that are just around are like, just sort of decoration.

292
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,802
Speaker 0: They usually don't do much, right?

293
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,890
Speaker 0: You just sort of blow them away or clean them up.

294
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,633
Speaker 1: Actuarizer is like that.

295
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,890
Speaker 1: Actuarizer is basically just get to the boss, now there's a really hard boss fight.

296
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:14,510
Speaker 0: In Metroid Dread, even if you, you know, I guess if you get really powered up, then the bad guys in sort of the early areas become really weak.

297
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,110
Speaker 0: But in some of the areas, the bad guys are like actually, I guess until you get the Screw Attack.

298
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,869
Speaker 0: The Screw Attack really lets you mess everyone up big time.

299
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:33,430
Speaker 0: But before you get the Screw Attack, which is very late, you actually, the bad guys are like, yeah, you have to do like a timed hit on the bad guys to counter them to get more energy out of them.

300
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:39,727
Speaker 0: Or there'll be some challenging regular bad guys who are just walking around trying to get somewhere and this guy gets in your way.

301
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,570
Speaker 0: He's just a normal guy.

302
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,269
Speaker 1: You know, I like that because a similar thing happened in, of all games, Final Fantasy IV.

303
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,850
Speaker 1: Where the regular, like in the American game, they kind of nerfed the regular, like they nerfed the bosses and the regular stuff.

304
00:18:55,231 --> 00:19:02,630
Speaker 1: But in the original game, all the regular fights along the way were kind of moderately challenging puzzles or moderately difficult.

305
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,870
Speaker 1: Separate, very different from a lot of earlier Final Fantasy games.

306
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,630
Speaker 1: Like you couldn't just ignore those like regular old fights along the way.

307
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, if you're not, if you're not me who doesn't like, you know, games, action, video game, right?

308
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:16,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

309
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:26,230
Speaker 0: Then you might, I would, I would not, you know, disagree or I could completely agree with someone saying that like, yeah, this is like the best Metroid game there is.

310
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,608
Speaker 1: You know what I got to do?

311
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,156
Speaker 0: Even me, right?

312
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,930
Speaker 0: I would probably put it second after Super Metroid and I'm, you know.

313
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:38,450
Speaker 1: I was about to say, I got to go back because I have never actually played the Metroid Prime games.

314
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,530
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you know, those are like in a different category.

315
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,111
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

316
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:48,210
Speaker 1: But I got, I have now played them and that's, that's one of my deep, like that's in the backlog near the top.

317
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,669
Speaker 0: You should have played them in college when I did.

318
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was busy.

319
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,170
Speaker 1: So I watched you play them and I was mostly playing Counter-Strike.

320
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,761
Speaker 0: Didn't they put them out for the Switch?

321
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:55,810
Speaker 0: I think you get them on Switch, right?

322
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just, since I got a Switch, I've been busy.

323
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,429
Speaker 1: I haven't even started Metroid Dread yet.

324
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,430
Speaker 1: I'm not the final boss.

325
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,645
Speaker 1: In fact, I bought it and Actraiser at the same time and then Actraiser finished downloading first.

326
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,070
Speaker 1: That's why I started playing Actraiser.

327
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:21,550
Speaker 1: So, in one last gaming adjacent news, so we already said that we're not going to go to Pac South, not irrespective of COVID, but also for political reasons.

328
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:30,430
Speaker 0: Like, Texas has done so many egregious things that, like, we can't even- We were already going to Texas before, but now we're definitely, it's like way over the line.

329
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,223
Speaker 1: Yeah.

330
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,003
Speaker 0: And it's not, it's not a Bugs Bunny situation where it's like, cross this line, I dare you.

331
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,046
Speaker 0: Alright, I'ma cross it.

332
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,529
Speaker 0: It's like, they cross the line, the end.

333
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,152
Speaker 1: Yup.

334
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,427
Speaker 0: So- You're not drawing another line, that's it.

335
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:51,310
Speaker 0: Well, while the state of Texas has crossed several egregious dangers- So far, they can't even see the line if they turn around and look backwards.

336
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,977
Speaker 1: Like, I will not visit Texas under any circumstances.

337
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,420
Speaker 1: Like, full stop.

338
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,146
Speaker 1: If my job told me I had to go there, I would threaten to quit.

339
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,190
Speaker 1: Like, that is how bad this is.

340
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,262
Speaker 0: The fact the earth is round puts Texas in danger of crossing the line twice.

341
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,630
Speaker 0: Just how far they've gone forward.

342
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:18,410
Speaker 1: Somehow, Texas, like, yesterday crossed a line that might actually prevent Pac-South from even being able to happen.

343
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:33,870
Speaker 1: So, the governor of Texas announced that the state has now banned vaccine mandates for any entity that does business in Texas, for both their customers or their employees.

344
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:39,441
Speaker 1: So, the convention center, the Gonzalez-Sell-Whatever Convention Center, cannot require vaccination.

345
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:44,330
Speaker 1: An event in the convention center, like the Penny Arcade Expo, cannot require vaccination.

346
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:55,170
Speaker 0: I guess you could still require it if you're a private non-business, because if you're not a business- Nope, they're covering all private entities.

347
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,078
Speaker 0: Well, you could- your house, right?

348
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,790
Speaker 0: You know, a private place that is not a business.

349
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,290
Speaker 1: But the convention center is not that.

350
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,644
Speaker 0: No, the convention center is not that.

351
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:07,189
Speaker 0: That is correct.

352
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,790
Speaker 1: And considering that, you know, the PAX West happened, we weren't there, but they required a vaccine or a recent COVID test.

353
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:21,470
Speaker 1: We know that Unplugged, coming up, which we won't be at either, has gone further and is requiring absolutely vaccinations and you can't come.

354
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,112
Speaker 0: So- Wait, wait, hold on.

355
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:27,030
Speaker 0: I just want to- this is going to be silly, but I can't not say it, right?

356
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:42,210
Speaker 0: What if there is an industrial facility in Texas where masks are needed for, you know, because this poison gas or something like that, are they not allowed- No, this only blocks vaccination mandates.

357
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:43,769
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

358
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,846
Speaker 1: Now, there are other state rules that say that nobody has to comply with mask mandates, too.

359
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,110
Speaker 1: That's a whole other line.

360
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,003
Speaker 0: If I have a mask mandate for a non-COVID reason, can I enforce it in Texas?

361
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,430
Speaker 0: Or can people come in and breathe poison gas and die?

362
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:00,637
Speaker 1: I believe the latter based on my reading of all this news.

363
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:02,482
Speaker 1: Like, for real.

364
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:04,145
Speaker 1: It is ridiculous.

365
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:10,430
Speaker 0: But this one- We should open up a poison gas factory in Texas and hire shitty people.

366
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:25,030
Speaker 1: But considering that PAX Unplugged requires vaccination to attend, which, while we're not going to be there as geek nights, like as attendees playing games or anything like that, it's still, like, I applaud that compared to lesser measures, if they're going to happen at all.

367
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,590
Speaker 1: I can't imagine they would rescind their vaccine requirement just to continue to do a PAX in Texas.

368
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:32,936
Speaker 0: I don't know.

369
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:33,829
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

370
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,835
Speaker 1: So, I hope against hope.

371
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:40,970
Speaker 1: there is never again a PAX South in Texas unless Texas becomes a, I don't know, a safe state to visit.

372
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:44,659
Speaker 1: And at this point, we need to start helping people move out.

373
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:48,170
Speaker 1: Like, if anyone wants to move out, we almost need a refugee program to, like, pay people.

374
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,170
Speaker 0: No, we need people to move in to vote.

375
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can't say that someone has to move to such a dangerous place to be able to fix that place.

376
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,550
Speaker 0: You gotta privilege people who can vote properly.

377
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,949
Speaker 1: Do you want to move to Texas?

378
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:08,570
Speaker 0: If enough people who were as privileged as I am, who were going to vote and we went together, I would go if it was going to work.

379
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we could get enough people to commit to that.

380
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,270
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not going to just, you know, just go do it on my own and then say, "Hey guys, follow me," because no one's going to follow me.

381
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:36,030
Speaker 1: In fact, there's other stuff going on right now where, like, banks can't hire employees there and a bunch of big banks can't even, like, they have said they won't underwrite bonds for the state of Texas anymore because Texas also passed a bunch of laws saying it is illegal to not service the gun industry and a bunch of banks don't want to underwrite, like, gun shit.

382
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:37,894
Speaker 0: Okay.

383
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:38,539
Speaker 0: Banks are those?

384
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,130
Speaker 0: because I want to be a customer of those banks.

385
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,409
Speaker 1: Goldman Sachs just said, "Well, we're not going to underwrite any bonds in Texas because...".

386
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,090
Speaker 0: Well, I can't get a checking account at Goldman Sachs, can I?

387
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:53,790
Speaker 0: I mean, if you can get a credit card from Goldman Sachs, the Apple credit card, I don't think you can get a checking account there.

388
00:24:54,432 --> 00:25:02,010
Speaker 1: I cannot envision a world where the Penny Arcade Expo goes back on their vaccine mandate for Texas.

389
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:08,190
Speaker 1: So I predict there will be no PacSouth in January, or if there is a PacSouth, it will not be in Texas.

390
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,405
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

391
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,209
Speaker 1: So check this out.

392
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:27,010
Speaker 1: You ever been on a boat or a ship and there's these big white canisters hanging kind of off the side with a bunch of ropes tied to them?

393
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:31,169
Speaker 0: I've seen those on boats, but I've never been on a boat big enough to have them.

394
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:36,409
Speaker 1: Oh, actually, the Seastrick Ferry to Sandy Hook has them.

395
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,170
Speaker 0: If it has it, I didn't see them on there.

396
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,010
Speaker 1: Yep, they're on the side because whenever I'm on a boat like that, I like looking at them because they're neat and they're complicated.

397
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:47,665
Speaker 1: And what they are are life preservation vessels.

398
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:48,630
Speaker 1: They're basically lifeboats.

399
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,030
Speaker 1: But you might wonder how those things get deployed.

400
00:25:53,451 --> 00:26:02,270
Speaker 1: My Thing of the Day is a sped up video, 36 seconds long, that shows what one of those canisters does if you activate it.

401
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,170
Speaker 1: And all I'm going to say is it is so much more impressive and complicated than you are possibly imagining.

402
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:19,170
Speaker 1: They basically just throw that thing down into the water and magically there is a lifeboat with a cover and a slide and everything just there.

403
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,550
Speaker 1: Like, magically out of nowhere like a Transformer.

404
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,709
Speaker 0: Well, it's better than what Titanic had.

405
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:24,812
Speaker 1: Nothing?

406
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:27,343
Speaker 1: Are you sure you had lifeboats?

407
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:28,810
Speaker 1: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

408
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:30,409
Speaker 0: They had some lifeboats.

409
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,715
Speaker 1: They did have a few lifeboats.

410
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,266
Speaker 1: Half of them were on the wrong side of the boat and couldn't be used.

411
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:35,050
Speaker 1: Anyway.

412
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,350
Speaker 0: And they were the kind, I'm pretty sure, with pulleys that you had to lower down, right?

413
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,830
Speaker 1: Yep, they were just literal small boats that had to be lowered down carefully.

414
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,589
Speaker 0: There are still boats that I've seen that still have that kind.

415
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is like what a modern lifeboat actually looks like on a real ship.

416
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,955
Speaker 0: Alright, cool.

417
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,385
Speaker 0: Hope you never have to use one of these in a non-training context.

418
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,330
Speaker 1: I was about to say, unless you're being trained or doing it for funsies.

419
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

420
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,813
Speaker 0: Oh, thing of the day.

421
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:12,700
Speaker 0: So, my biological sister, I don't know, some people might be finding this out, is semi-famous?

422
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,480
Speaker 0: I don't know what counts as famous these days, right?

423
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,240
Speaker 1: There was a brief period when Geek Nights was more famous than her because she didn't do anything yet because she was younger than us.

424
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,160
Speaker 1: And then she became famous.

425
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,085
Speaker 0: Yeah.

426
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,149
Speaker 0: Some level of fame.

427
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:28,000
Speaker 0: Definitely higher than our level of fame by a significant amount.

428
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Speaker 0: But she worked at Buzzfeed making videos, being in videos, and whatnot.

429
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,183
Speaker 0: She doesn't work there anymore.

430
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,471
Speaker 0: She's doing her own thing, I guess.

431
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,357
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on out there in California.

432
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:38,080
Speaker 0: That place is crazy.

433
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:45,488
Speaker 0: But she started a Patreon as of yesterday, maybe?

434
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:47,971
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

435
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:54,660
Speaker 0: You can go and check out her arts if you enjoy them and give her money so that she never comes asking me for money.

436
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,507
Speaker 0: I don't think she has money problems.

437
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,574
Speaker 0: She can still afford to live in California.

438
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,480
Speaker 0: I think she's doing okay.

439
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:06,113
Speaker 0: But, you know, when you're on your own, sometimes things don't work out.

440
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,720
Speaker 0: Who knows what's going to be years down the line.

441
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,242
Speaker 1: Her art's cool, too.

442
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:18,560
Speaker 1: If I had to describe it without describing it, it is adjacent to topics discussed in Neon Genesis Evangelion.

443
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,108
Speaker 0: I like the illustration she does.

444
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:25,160
Speaker 0: that reminds me of Eternity from Marvel Comics.

445
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:31,809
Speaker 0: It'll be something all colorful, some colorful cartoon land, but then there's like a spaceman.

446
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:38,580
Speaker 0: A shape of a human-ish shape, but it's just outer space inside of that shape.

447
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,453
Speaker 1: Stylized and psychedelic.

448
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:42,680
Speaker 1: Interesting art.

449
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, so she does a lot of stuff over there.

450
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:51,638
Speaker 0: If you're giving gig nights money, Jesus Christ, go give Sarah Rubin $5 a month.

451
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,959
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the gig nights Patreon is giving five of its dollars to Sarah.

452
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,059
Speaker 0: Oh, you can do that?

453
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:04,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so the way Patreon works, my Patreon is also gig nights.

454
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:12,460
Speaker 0: But if you sign up for someone else's Patreon, it will take money that someone else gave to gig nights and give it to the someone else?

455
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:13,167
Speaker 1: It will.

456
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,059
Speaker 1: It'll take from that.

457
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,377
Speaker 0: It won't charge your credit card every month because I don't have a Patreon that I'm taking money in.

458
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:20,360
Speaker 0: I'm only giving money out.

459
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,747
Speaker 0: So it's charging my credit card every month.

460
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:23,489
Speaker 0: Here's your statement.

461
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:26,720
Speaker 0: Yours takes that money from the listener.

462
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:31,460
Speaker 1: So you could go direct to the source here if you like this art.

463
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:43,940
Speaker 0: So I think if that's the case, if RIM patronizing another Patreon simply redistributes the listeners wealth, you should sign up for so many Patreons.

464
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,480
Speaker 0: Eventually, it evens out to nothing because you don't need the money, right?

465
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,686
Speaker 1: I actually should have a Patreon game.

466
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:57,178
Speaker 1: The problem is all the Patreons I subscribe to, I never even go to any of their content anymore.

467
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:57,659
Speaker 1: I'm too busy.

468
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:07,480
Speaker 0: Oh, see, every morning on my iPad, I open a Patreon app and I scroll through and I see because it's not too many that are posting content that regularly.

469
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:13,780
Speaker 1: A guaranteed video has paused multiple times because they could not provide the guarantee that much.

470
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:22,540
Speaker 0: Most of the people are not posting stuff that frequently, so it's really just a few comics-y things that are really posting a lot of stuff in there.

471
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,417
Speaker 0: And a lot of people also might be posting frequently, but I'm sticking to the $1 tier.

472
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,825
Speaker 0: You have to go to $5 to get actual lots of content.

473
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:43,980
Speaker 1: Sometimes some people I'm a patron of primarily because I want to support their activism specifically, or like the thing that they're doing even if I'm not a fan of that thing personally.

474
00:30:44,300 --> 00:31:01,220
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I think I am a fan of the thing or the person or the thing the person makes or both, but even if I was getting that feed of all that stuff, it's like I don't like the stuff that much that I needed to consume it daily or weekly even.

475
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,689
Speaker 1: Well, there are marginalized streamers I support, but it's not that I don't watch marginalized streamers.

476
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,533
Speaker 1: It's that I don't watch any streamers.

477
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:12,780
Speaker 1: I don't watch streamers at all, ever, except AGD2.

478
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:29,060
Speaker 0: For example, my recent thing of the day, the Cracking the Cryptic, the Sudoku people, if you sign up for their Patreon, you get extra puzzles and extra videos and it's like, "Whoa, dudes, you put up two YouTube videos a day plus more.

479
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:32,144
Speaker 0: That's already way more Sudoku than I ever

480
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:32,464
Speaker 0: need.".

481
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,711
Speaker 0: Unless that was my primary geekery, I would not need all that stuff.

482
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:44,120
Speaker 0: If I'm going to Patreon you, I'm going to do it at the lowest level because I'm not actually going to consume that much content.

483
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,340
Speaker 0: I would have to sacrifice something else I care about much more because I don't have that time.

484
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:55,494
Speaker 1: So, anyway, in the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, which I slowed down.

485
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,260
Speaker 1: I haven't read any since the last Geek Nights because of business.

486
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,215
Speaker 0: Well, I got held up by Metroids.

487
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,600
Speaker 0: Yep, so we both got away with it a little bit.

488
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,137
Speaker 0: I'm going to dispose of the Metroids today or tomorrow, I believe.

489
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,665
Speaker 1: And the weather's getting chillier.

490
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:11,272
Speaker 1: It's the time of the year when I can go sit in the park.

491
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,620
Speaker 1: It's a little too cold to do a bike ride, but I'll just sit there and read.

492
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,840
Speaker 1: Anyway, Genji continues to do his thing, but I haven't read it in a week.

493
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,739
Speaker 0: He continues to say the same thing every time?

494
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, because, I mean, can you spoil the tale of Genji?

495
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:32,840
Speaker 0: I think that the statute of limitations is over for the first novel ever written by human beings ever.

496
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:40,900
Speaker 1: Also, I dare anyone listening to this podcast, even if I said a specific spoiler about a specific character, to remember which character that was when you encountered them in the book.

497
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:42,444
Speaker 1: Unless it's Genji.

498
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,720
Speaker 1: Or maybe Genji's best friend, that guy.

499
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,083
Speaker 0: Alright, also meta moment.

500
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:55,880
Speaker 0: So, there is/was a Geek Nights newsletter that at times has been sent frequently and at times has been sent infrequently.

501
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,541
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

502
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:02,894
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't like people to praise him or anything we do, but he writes it all.

503
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:04,017
Speaker 1: I don't have anything to do with it.

504
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,140
Speaker 1: It's always been fantastic.

505
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Speaker 0: It's free, unlike Rim, who's charging you for extra work, right?

506
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:19,892
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights newsletter was run using a free web service called Tiny Letter, which is basically MailChimp's free mode.

507
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,034
Speaker 0: They have it off to the side.

508
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,696
Speaker 0: They don't think they update it or anything.

509
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:23,777
Speaker 0: It's just been there for years.

510
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,380
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they haven't shut it down.

511
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:31,333
Speaker 0: So, it still exists over there, but I kind of felt uncomfortable with that platform.

512
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,697
Speaker 0: Like, are they just going to delete this?

513
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,120
Speaker 0: Like, what's, you know, right?

514
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:46,478
Speaker 0: So, I went through all the trouble of making a new email template, and I set up a whole new email sending system, all the computer parts and everything, and it seems to work.

515
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:47,240
Speaker 0: I just tested it.

516
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:55,050
Speaker 0: The only issue I think that might exist is that if you use a weird email reader, the emails might look weird.

517
00:33:55,691 --> 00:34:01,920
Speaker 0: So, I copied over all the subscribers, a few hundred of them, right, from the old system to the new system.

518
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,588
Speaker 0: So, if you're already subscribed, don't worry.

519
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,816
Speaker 0: You're just going to get an email whenever I send one.

520
00:34:06,856 --> 00:34:07,760
Speaker 0: I got to write one first.

521
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,051
Speaker 0: And if you're not already subscribed, well, we have a new URL, which I haven't typed anywhere yet.

522
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,632
Speaker 0: So, you're just going to have to listen.

523
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,636
Speaker 0: It's newsletters.frontrowcrew.com.

524
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,199
Speaker 0: Or is it newsletter.frontrowcrew.com?

525
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:22,520
Speaker 0: Hold on.

526
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,703
Speaker 1: Careful.

527
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:25,980
Speaker 1: One of those might go somewhere bad somehow.

528
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,108
Speaker 0: It's newsletter.frontrowcrew.com/subscription/form.

529
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:36,552
Speaker 1: All I can think of is tomorrow.org/blog.

530
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,659
Speaker 0: Yeah.

531
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:38,960
Speaker 0: Okay.

532
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:42,447
Speaker 0: If you put a trailing slash after the form, it's not going to work.

533
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:46,876
Speaker 0: So, that's just because I'm using some open source software.

534
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:47,717
Speaker 0: That's just how it works.

535
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,920
Speaker 0: It's not my fault.

536
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,043
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

537
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:58,080
Speaker 0: If you go there, you can subscribe to the Geek Nights newsletter and you'll receive it whenever I eventually send it.

538
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:09,880
Speaker 0: And also, I'm going to find some way to collect the old ones, back them up, back up the new ones, and I'm going to create some sort of more easily browsable archive.

539
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:20,040
Speaker 0: Because otherwise, the only way to browse the archive will be to like find the email that you saved or click the like view on web link at the bottom of the email or something like that.

540
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:30,140
Speaker 0: And I guess the privacy conscious people out there would probably like to know that since I'm hosting this ourselves, you know, there isn't going to be any privacy tracking nonsense.

541
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:40,740
Speaker 0: And also, in the new version of frontrowcrew.com, which is partially underway, I'm basically decided I'm just going to remove all the Google Analytics and all that.

542
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,985
Speaker 0: Just removing all that shit.

543
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:42,789
Speaker 0: We don't need it.

544
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,553
Speaker 0: We don't look at it.

545
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,060
Speaker 0: Why should I bother you with that?

546
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,480
Speaker 1: I barely even look at like the analytics I get from our YouTube channel.

547
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

548
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,886
Speaker 0: So, I'm just going to remove all that nonsense.

549
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:55,220
Speaker 0: We're just going to serve up, you know, a normal quality web page when we get around to it.

550
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

551
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:56,019
Speaker 0: You know what?

552
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:57,766
Speaker 1: It's like the old days.

553
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:00,600
Speaker 1: Here's a website and there's content on this website.

554
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,349
Speaker 0: We're going to make us a motherfucking website.

556
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:05,940
Speaker 0: So, look forward to that.

557
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:20,220
Speaker 0: And if you know anyone who is really good at web design and HTML CSS parts that could make a motherfucking website that doesn't have a lot of bullshit JavaScript on it, mostly just really good at CSS is what we need.

558
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:26,092
Speaker 0: And let me know because it took me like a long ass time just to make one email template.

559
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:28,760
Speaker 0: If I have to make the whole website, it's going to be tough.

560
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,309
Speaker 1: And before you ask, yes, we'll pay.

561
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,560
Speaker 1: We pay real money when someone works for us.

562
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:33,761
Speaker 0: Yeah.

563
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:36,380
Speaker 0: That Patreon money before it goes to some other patrons.

564
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

565
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,629
Speaker 1: What it actually goes to is like, well, like the new geek guys logos.

566
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:40,752
Speaker 1: We hired a designer.

567
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,337
Speaker 1: We paid them market rates.

568
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:43,440
Speaker 1: That's how we brawl.

569
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:54,660
Speaker 1: Like, we're not going to, if you actually are skilled and you can't talk to Scott and it works out and you make our website for us, you'll be making money comparable to the going like contract rates for that kind of development.

570
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:57,542
Speaker 1: All right.

571
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:59,086
Speaker 1: So we're riffing here.

572
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:05,800
Speaker 1: This is a topic that we might do a panel on in the future.

573
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,501
Speaker 1: Right.

574
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:08,003
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, right?

575
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 0: So this is something that we've talked about in the past somewhat frequently, but always tangentially combined with other topics, not as the topic itself.

576
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,441
Speaker 0: Right.

577
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,806
Speaker 0: So it sort of feels like something we've done, but we haven't.

578
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:26,340
Speaker 0: Secondly, it's something I see people not understand on the Internet with great frequency.

579
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,600
Speaker 1: People don't understand something on the Internet?

580
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,341
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:32,960
Speaker 0: Looking at you, board game Reddit, you know, number one.

582
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,809
Speaker 1: Ah, board game Reddit, where the most common post is, "Why is this game

583
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,210
Speaker 1: broken?".

584
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,656
Speaker 1: And the first response is, "Because you're not playing it right.

585
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:40,699
Speaker 1: Here's the rule that you got

586
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:40,980
Speaker 1: wrong.".

587
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:41,872
Speaker 1: Yeah.

588
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,320
Speaker 1: Anyway.

589
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,335
Speaker 0: Well, those are just the ones I share with Rym the most.

590
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:46,140
Speaker 0: But anyway.

591
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

592
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:50,773
Speaker 1: No, I saw a discourse the other day on whether or not there is skill in poker.

593
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,140
Speaker 1: This was months ago and it was just like, what?

594
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,120
Speaker 1: Like, like, but the- There's a lot of luck, but yes.

595
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:07,160
Speaker 1: But that's the kind of conversation that is usually like the discourse almost hurts understanding if you try to interact with people online about it.

596
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:08,181
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:08,582
Speaker 0: Anyway.

598
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,266
Speaker 0: And three, right?

599
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:17,074
Speaker 0: The great game developer publisher, Amabelle Holland from Hollenspiel, right?

600
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,536
Speaker 0: Who make a lot of great games.

601
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:21,000
Speaker 0: You should check them out if you haven't already.

602
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:26,771
Speaker 0: They tweeted recently and the tweet was something like there are one player ga-.

603
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,560
Speaker 0: I forget the exact words of the tweet and I haven't been able to find the tweet again because searching Twitter sucks.

604
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:36,239
Speaker 0: There's no easy way to like search tweets that I have liked or anything like that.

605
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:46,017
Speaker 0: But anyway, the tweet was something along the lines of there are one player games, two player games, and there are three plus player games, right?

606
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,640
Speaker 0: There's three different kinds of games.

607
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:53,714
Speaker 0: And they were like, wow, you see, you know, people publish games that are like, yeah, for one to six players.

608
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,760
Speaker 0: And it's like, wow, you made three different games.

609
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

610
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,140
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, what's going on there?

611
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:06,850
Speaker 1: And we've talked about this, like you said, a lot, especially in those panels on like how to win at games or heuristics or any of that stuff.

612
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:11,797
Speaker 1: Like we this is always like under like the baseline of a lot of what we talk about.

613
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,760
Speaker 1: So maybe this can be its own topic.

614
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:14,521
Speaker 0: All right.

615
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:17,647
Speaker 0: So for the people who don't understand, let's break it down.

616
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,769
Speaker 0: So you got.

617
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:25,080
Speaker 0: first of all, you got to divide games into winnable games, the ortho games, as we have borrowed the term.

618
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,340
Speaker 1: Yep.

619
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,282
Speaker 1: And ortho games.

620
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:36,740
Speaker 1: Let's see if I remember the definition of the game where there is a set of players and agreed upon set of rules and a method by which to rank the players at the conclusion of the game.

621
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:37,922
Speaker 0: Yep.

622
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 0: So it's a. it's a game of winning and losing.

623
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,190
Speaker 1: You can win.

624
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,040
Speaker 1: You can lose.

625
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,488
Speaker 0: Any other kind of game that's not about winning and losing.

626
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,310
Speaker 0: Right.

627
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,120
Speaker 0: So is in another category entirely and is not that pertinent to this conversation.

628
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,065
Speaker 0: So that's playing game.

629
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:59,419
Speaker 0: Dungeons and Dragons, you know, anything else you want to apply the word game to.

630
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:00,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:02,267
Speaker 0: Not a competition of winning and losing.

632
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:03,150
Speaker 0: Doesn't?

633
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,293
Speaker 0: we're not talking about those.

634
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:05,937
Speaker 0: We're only talking about the winning and losing game.

635
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:06,720
Speaker 0: So number two.

636
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,126
Speaker 0: OK, so you've got a winning and losing game.

637
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:09,908
Speaker 0: Right.

638
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:10,850
Speaker 0: And there are.

639
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,240
Speaker 0: I guess rim wants to talk about the special case where there are zero players.

640
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,961
Speaker 0: I don't think that's worth.

641
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:27,960
Speaker 1: So the Wikipedia page, which has had a lot of recent updates and I did not make these updates, actually has a lot of academic citations about the three classes of zero player ortho games.

642
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,420
Speaker 0: OK.

643
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,102
Speaker 1: There is.

644
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:32,827
Speaker 1: what's interesting is this gets into other things we've talked about.

645
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:39,880
Speaker 1: The three categories that are widely considered to be zero player games are one games of pure chance, which.

646
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,244
Speaker 0: Candyland.

647
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you could consider Candyland to be a zero player game.

648
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,749
Speaker 1: Bunko, Snakes and Ladders, Bingo, Roulette.

649
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,596
Speaker 0: You just find out who wins.

650
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:49,098
Speaker 0: That's true.

651
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:49,159
Speaker 0: OK.

652
00:40:50,080 --> 00:41:00,360
Speaker 1: But arguably, if we're talking about games that are ortho games as play, then me and Scott playing one of those games, we're still playing a game with ranking and winners and losers.

653
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,850
Speaker 1: It's just we can't impact the outcome.

654
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,140
Speaker 1: So it's arguable whether or not we're a player with agency.

655
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:11,128
Speaker 1: Number two is interesting because this covers a lot of other games.

656
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:19,220
Speaker 1: I don't know how to engage with this, but there's a lot of academic citations, games that are determined by their initial states.

657
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:26,080
Speaker 1: A game that evolves as determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans is considered a zero player game.

658
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,128
Speaker 1: Conway's Game of Life, Progress Quest, et cetera.

659
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:33,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, I talk about those.

660
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,080
Speaker 1: I don't think why I agree.

661
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,329
Speaker 1: Pure chance is an interesting situation.

662
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,639
Speaker 1: determined by initial state is a lot muddier and I don't think it's worth engaging with.

663
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,690
Speaker 0: That's not something that's not a winning, losing ortho game.

664
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,778
Speaker 0: Conway's, you know, win and lose at Conway's Game of Life.

665
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, but players can be ranked.

666
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:51,693
Speaker 0: There are.

667
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,599
Speaker 0: well, can you be ranked at Conway's Game of Life?

668
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,060
Speaker 1: There are.

669
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,080
Speaker 1: I've seen meta rules for Conway's Game of Life to like have multiple colors or multiple boards and see which one evolves and whatever.

670
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,385
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's not your main.

671
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:05,579
Speaker 1: The third category is the one we were just talking about before the show.

672
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:17,420
Speaker 1: AI versus AI games, where all human players have been replaced by AIs, arguably have zero players and the game is more of just an experience watching it play out.

673
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:26,080
Speaker 0: Right, so if you have AlphaGo play against AlphaGo at Go and you just see who, which one of the two computers wins, right?

674
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,393
Speaker 0: It's like you could consider the computers to be players, whatever.

675
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think, you know, whatever.

676
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,565
Speaker 1: And we're not talking about games that are not ortho games.

677
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:44,660
Speaker 1: So arguably it doesn't matter if that's a zero player game because I as a player playing the game cannot win or lose because if I play the game it's no longer a zero player game.

678
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:49,060
Speaker 1: So it's moot and I think we've covered zero player games sufficiently.

679
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,647
Speaker 0: All that is is basically, that's equivalent like running a simulation, right?

680
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:55,372
Speaker 0: So imagine if I ran a weather simulation, right?

681
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:59,480
Speaker 0: It's just going to simulate the weather in a local area, you know, maybe try to predict it.

682
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,909
Speaker 0: And I arbitrarily decide beforehand, thunderstorm is winning and bright and sunny means losing.

683
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,373
Speaker 0: It's like that, so what?

684
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:13,100
Speaker 0: You've made an arbitrary distinction just so that you can classify it as a game instead of a simulation.

685
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:21,440
Speaker 1: I think zero player matters a lot more for non-ortho games, which are, that's such a broad wide topic that we're only going to touch on the idea of a non-ortho game briefly.

686
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,485
Speaker 0: Okay, so ortho game with one player, right?

687
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,007
Speaker 0: We're talking a solo game.

688
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:27,870
Speaker 0: People need to understand this.

689
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:34,360
Speaker 0: All solo ortho games are actually just puzzles, right?

690
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,546
Speaker 0: It's sitting there with a Sudoku and trying to find the answer to the Sudoku.

691
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:47,936
Speaker 0: is the only difference between that and say, playing pandemic by yourself?

692
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:51,140
Speaker 0: is that pandemic has hidden information in it, right?

693
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,265
Speaker 0: So you don't, it's not just like an automatically solved puzzle?

694
00:43:54,385 --> 00:44:02,960
Speaker 1: Arguably no single player game can be by definition an ortho game because you must be able to rank the players.

695
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:06,989
Speaker 0: You're ranking yourself as either win or lose the game.

696
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,874
Speaker 0: The opponent doesn't get a rank.

697
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:10,619
Speaker 0: You rank yourself either yes or no.

698
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,040
Speaker 1: It's a pass.

699
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, but ortho games don't say against, they literally say rank the players.

700
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:17,280
Speaker 1: So the player one always has the same rank.

701
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,008
Speaker 0: Regardless of whether it's an ortho game or not, all solo games are puzzles.

702
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:28,380
Speaker 0: Doing the crossword puzzle is effectively the same as playing one favorite board game's solo mode.

703
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, playing like the one player variant is increasingly popular.

704
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:41,820
Speaker 1: I think our point would stand that a board game that says one plus players, the one player version is just a different game that uses the same components.

705
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:49,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you can play, you know, what's a good example of something here?

706
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:55,051
Speaker 1: I mean all the interesting one player game examples I have are not really ortho games.

707
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:57,075
Speaker 1: Like Hades, it's an experience.

708
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,040
Speaker 1: It's an interactive entertainment for one.

709
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:05,400
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even consider Hades to be an ortho game because you're not ranking players against each other.

710
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,940
Speaker 0: Right, well consider this.

711
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,605
Speaker 1: And winning this is a variable scale.

712
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:10,728
Speaker 1: Did you beat the game?

713
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:11,851
Speaker 1: Did you beat all the side quests?

714
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:12,753
Speaker 1: Did you unlock everything?

715
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:13,595
Speaker 1: Did you 100% it?

716
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:15,900
Speaker 1: It's almost not even a relevant conversation.

717
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:19,205
Speaker 0: Right, well you have chess, which is a two player game normally.

718
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:23,112
Speaker 0: But one player chess would be chess puzzles, literally.

719
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 0: You're using the same pieces as chess and the same rules as chess.

720
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,540
Speaker 0: And being good at one player chess puzzles might help you get better at two player chess.

721
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,200
Speaker 1: That's a good point.

722
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:53,420
Speaker 0: But playing one player chess, just here's a board, you know, find the checkmate or whatever, right, in one move, you know, that puzzle, is that activity in and of itself is an entirely different game from two player chess.

723
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:01,460
Speaker 0: Although it shares many, you know, similar rules within it, a puzzle is not the same thing as playing against another person.

724
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,070
Speaker 0: There are two different categories, right, so that's just how it is.

725
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:14,380
Speaker 0: So when people are out there saying like, "Oh, I want a solo mode for this game," right, say you're playing Ticket to Ride.

726
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, what you're saying is, "I want a different game that uses the same

727
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:17,940
Speaker 1: components.".

728
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want a different game, exactly.

729
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,600
Speaker 0: And it's fundamentally not the same thing.

730
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,700
Speaker 0: It's a different activity.

731
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:34,180
Speaker 1: Even more interesting, some tabletop games add like mechanical AIs that will serve the role of a player and follow rules.

732
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,680
Speaker 1: But even then, those things act in a way that is not the same as a real player in most cases.

733
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:44,394
Speaker 1: And if it is the same as a real player, it's just a very simplistic human opponent.

734
00:46:44,474 --> 00:46:46,500
Speaker 1: It's really a two player game and one of them is an AI.

735
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:47,322
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:50,069
Speaker 0: Well, that goes back to what I was saying about one player pandemic, right?

737
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,600
Speaker 0: The difference being is like, yeah, there's two kinds of one player puzzles.

738
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,632
Speaker 0: There's ones with perfect information and ones without perfect.

739
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:59,379
Speaker 0: I mean, there's more categories than that.

740
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:13,700
Speaker 0: But the biggest difference is the puzzles that are perfect information, like a Sudoku, and the puzzles with the hidden information, like, you know, pandemic by yourself, because there's a deck of cards that's face down.

741
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,794
Speaker 0: You don't know what order they're in, or you might not even know the contents of that deck, right?

742
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:19,440
Speaker 0: So that would be even more hidden information.

743
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,431
Speaker 0: And the way you approach those puzzles is completely different, you know, but procedurally.

744
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:31,680
Speaker 0: So if you like one kind of puzzle, you might not like the other kind, but they are still both puzzles.

745
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:36,940
Speaker 0: It's a puzzle solving exercise, not a gaming, ortho gaming exercise either way.

746
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:47,120
Speaker 1: Two player is honestly the most interesting space to me because two player games or two team games or races, we'll get into that.

747
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, when we say players, we mean sides, right?

748
00:47:50,384 --> 00:48:00,780
Speaker 0: So even if there are like, you know, if you and all of your friends gather around a table and on the table is Klondike Solitaire, and you're all trying to play Klondike together, right?

749
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,689
Speaker 0: Like, oh, you're trying to help spot the right move.

750
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,337
Speaker 0: That's still a one player game.

751
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:05,040
Speaker 0: That's still a puzzle.

752
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,590
Speaker 1: That's why code games can take N players.

753
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,655
Speaker 1: Like how many people can you fit around that table?

754
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:12,320
Speaker 1: Because there's two teams.

755
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:13,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,807
Speaker 0: Or, you know, you can ask for help.

757
00:48:15,887 --> 00:48:20,660
Speaker 0: You know, your whole family can sit around a crossword puzzle and try to solve it together or a word search, right?

758
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,085
Speaker 0: Or just playing pandemic by the rules.

759
00:48:24,185 --> 00:48:25,127
Speaker 0: Is that a co-op game?

760
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:27,591
Speaker 0: No, that's a one player game pandemic, right?

761
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:32,260
Speaker 0: And many co-op games are one player games in disguise, right?

762
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:36,069
Speaker 0: They say they're co-op, but actually they're just puzzles hidden information.

763
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:40,300
Speaker 0: Some of them have a trainer mechanic thing, which makes them slightly different.

764
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:44,120
Speaker 1: I almost said bad in most cases, but we've talked about that before.

765
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,710
Speaker 0: And that's why you get the phenomenon known as quarterbacking because you're playing a puzzle.

766
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:54,160
Speaker 0: And obviously if you're solving a puzzle, whoever is the best at solving a puzzle, right?

767
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,748
Speaker 0: The person who knows the most trivia is going to do the most work on the crossword puzzle.

768
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:03,260
Speaker 0: And the other is someone, if a child is there who doesn't know a lot of stuff, they're not going to be able to help that much.

769
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:11,898
Speaker 0: So if you're playing pandemic, which is effectively the same exact activity as five people working on a crossword puzzle together, then it's, it doesn't matter.

770
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,060
Speaker 0: It's not the rules fault.

771
00:49:13,441 --> 00:49:14,663
Speaker 0: It's not the player's fault.

772
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:18,669
Speaker 0: Stop blaming the other people for the fact that the game has a quarterbacking problem.

773
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:24,860
Speaker 0: The game's fault is that it's a one player puzzle trying to pass itself off as a co-op activity.

774
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:33,460
Speaker 0: Co-op, you know, the, the quarterbacking thing is only natural, just like it would be natural with a crossword puzzle because the same activity, right?

775
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:40,096
Speaker 0: But if you play Hanabi, right, which we've talked about a lot, that's not a single player puzzle, right?

776
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:41,620
Speaker 0: That's actually a multiplayer game.

777
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,019
Speaker 1: So also Hanabi doesn't really work with two players.

778
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:47,798
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

779
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,921
Speaker 1: Yep.

780
00:49:48,962 --> 00:49:59,280
Speaker 1: So two player games are so unique and interesting that we did an entire podcast about two player games in 2019 specifically, which I'll link to.

781
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,605
Speaker 0: Two player game is the purest form of game, right?

782
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:07,116
Speaker 0: If you, it's not a puzzle, you're actually competing against another human being or human beings, right?

783
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:08,540
Speaker 0: If it's teams or something.

784
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,600
Speaker 0: But unlike the three plus player games that we're going to talk about next, there's no politics and there's no vote who wins.

785
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:21,431
Speaker 1: I can't like sabotage Scott to let Joey Jojo win.

786
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,273
Speaker 1: There's only Scott.

787
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,997
Speaker 1: I'm always trying to sabotage Scott.

788
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,020
Speaker 1: He's the only person.

789
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,864
Speaker 0: It's two people, right?

790
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:27,666
Speaker 0: Two sides.

791
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:30,334
Speaker 0: And each side says, I'm trying to make me win.

792
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,460
Speaker 0: And the other side says, well, I'm trying to make me win.

793
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:51,220
Speaker 0: And you just test your skills at whatever the game is, whatever skill the game is testing, whether that's fighting in a boxing ring or, you know, running fast or, you know, being good at math or being good at memory or being good with your fingers in a fighting game or being good with your fingers in an RTS.

794
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:55,407
Speaker 1: There's no possibility of king making.

795
00:50:55,627 --> 00:51:00,596
Speaker 1: There's no possibility of a poor player making a weird move that like messes you up.

796
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:03,180
Speaker 1: You're just you're playing against one entity.

797
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:12,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, you know, there could be luck involved, but other than luck that could be in there, it's who, which of the two sides is best, right?

798
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,743
Speaker 0: It's a you're measuring.

799
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:22,380
Speaker 0: It's a true measurement, as true as you're going to have of who of the two sides in the game was better and or luckier at that thing.

800
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:26,720
Speaker 0: At this moment, you get and you get an answer unless there was cheating or something.

801
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,542
Speaker 1: These are some of the asterisk.

802
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:34,430
Speaker 1: These are some of the only games that can have what I would consider formal matchmaking.

803
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:41,740
Speaker 1: that is guaranteed over time with a sufficient quantity of players to accurately rank the real skill of those players.

804
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:58,220
Speaker 1: These are also games that can devolve into nothing games, broken or solved games very easily or devolve to the point to where the skill that's being tested in the end between two advanced players is radically different from what is being tested among novice players.

805
00:51:59,061 --> 00:51:59,181
Speaker 0: Yep.

806
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:08,100
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think the point you made originally is that like, yeah, this is pretty much the only valid category for competitive games, right?

807
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:16,979
Speaker 0: If you want to have a competitive game where you actually put some sort of value on the winning and losing, you're not just declaring a winner or a loser for fun, right?

808
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:23,460
Speaker 0: Because you're playing games, you actually want to like award a trophy or a prize prize money, right?

809
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:32,160
Speaker 0: Or, you know, make someone's entire career based on being good at this game or make important decisions based on the result of the game.

810
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:34,970
Speaker 0: It has to be a two player competitive game.

811
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,355
Speaker 0: It can't be any other kind.

812
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:37,520
Speaker 0: It can't be a one player.

813
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,988
Speaker 0: It can't be like you solve the puzzle, right?

814
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:41,172
Speaker 0: It's like, what?

815
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:42,396
Speaker 0: Who cares, right?

816
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,520
Speaker 0: Many people solve the puzzle.

817
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,373
Speaker 0: But as soon as you say, oh, well, see, I have two people and see who solved the puzzle faster.

818
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,940
Speaker 0: Oh, well, now we got something, right?

819
00:52:51,522 --> 00:52:53,434
Speaker 0: It's no longer can you solve it.

820
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:54,300
Speaker 0: It's who is faster.

821
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,260
Speaker 1: Now, an interesting sidebar, all games that are non interactive, meaning players cannot affect each other.

822
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:06,220
Speaker 1: They're effectively races that are independent, like a 5K run, for example.

823
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,310
Speaker 1: I can't like shove the person in the lane next to me over.

824
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then they stop the race and I probably go to jail.

825
00:53:13,662 --> 00:53:19,075
Speaker 1: So basically those games, it literally does not matter how many players they are.

826
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:20,980
Speaker 1: They're the same experience either way.

827
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,300
Speaker 0: But as long as they're not one, if you run a 5K by yourself.

828
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:30,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could compete against myself, I guess, but that's not really previous time.

829
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:31,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,648
Speaker 1: So in fact, you know what we do in the episode.

831
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:38,120
Speaker 1: we did, I'm going to read the description from it on two player games, because here's what we said.

832
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,943
Speaker 1: It's not on gig nights.

833
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:43,760
Speaker 1: We consider the unique nature of two player games in a non solitaire, non race game.

834
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,740
Speaker 1: One, two, three, four plus players are radically different experiences.

835
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,260
Speaker 1: Two player games are in a unique and fascinating space.

836
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:55,520
Speaker 1: They devolve into chess, tic-tac-toe or rock, paper, scissors in most tabletop games.

837
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,008
Speaker 1: Three player games are political.

838
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,700
Speaker 1: Four player games are basically the same.

839
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,113
Speaker 1: But two, two is a class of its own.

840
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:02,520
Speaker 1: That's the description for that episode.

841
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Speaker 0: And that's exactly right, because when you have a race, right, you can have any number of players in a race and have it be a valid competition where no one can affect anyone else.

842
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,687
Speaker 0: Everyone is doing a solo activity, right?

843
00:54:14,948 --> 00:54:19,960
Speaker 0: But you're measuring how well everyone did the solo activity against each other.

844
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:27,380
Speaker 0: So everyone ran fast by themselves and then we'll look and see who ran the fastest and that's the winner, right?

845
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,488
Speaker 0: Everyone will do a Sudoku by themselves.

846
00:54:29,508 --> 00:54:32,360
Speaker 0: Whoever solved it the fastest is the winner, right?

847
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:34,412
Speaker 0: The number of players there doesn't matter.

848
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:35,540
Speaker 0: It's a race.

849
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,660
Speaker 1: So imagine a two player race that is interactive, like a foot race where Scott and I are running.

850
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:49,880
Speaker 0: Two player is the only way that you can avoid having a race and have interaction with the other player.

851
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,971
Speaker 0: You actually interact with the other person.

852
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,420
Speaker 0: You hinder them, they hinder you.

853
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:02,340
Speaker 0: You are in each other's space doing things to each other, but you've maintained the value of the competition, you know, the purity of the competition.

854
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,860
Speaker 1: So if Scott and I are having a foot race, just the two of us, and it's interactive, if he trips me, well, he wins most likely.

855
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:18,640
Speaker 1: But in a three player race, if Scott trips me, our slow friend, Joey Jojo is going to win the race, possibly.

856
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:19,621
Speaker 0: Yep.

857
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:27,000
Speaker 0: So yeah, the three plus player games, any game that is three or more players, doesn't matter how many, it could be a million.

858
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,901
Speaker 0: It could be two.

859
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:28,943
Speaker 0: It can't be two.

860
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:31,126
Speaker 0: It could be four, right?

861
00:55:31,186 --> 00:55:40,820
Speaker 0: Any game with three or more players or sides, if there is any way for the players to interact with each other at all, right?

862
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:44,629
Speaker 0: Which could be, you know, direct interaction.

863
00:55:44,649 --> 00:55:45,391
Speaker 0: That's obvious.

864
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:49,320
Speaker 0: Like, oh, you can just play a card that says so and so loses 10 points.

865
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,741
Speaker 0: Yeah.

866
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,689
Speaker 0: Um, you know, but it could be very indirect.

867
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,840
Speaker 0: Like, oh, there's a board with, you know, 10 meeples on it.

868
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:00,931
Speaker 0: And on your turn, you take a meeple from the everyone's taking from the same board.

869
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:04,320
Speaker 0: It's like you're barely interacting with each other, but you're still interacting.

870
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:12,800
Speaker 0: You might choose to take the meeple that helps someone else more than the meeple that helps you the most because it'll hurt them for you to take that meeple.

871
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,483
Speaker 0: And you're sort of indirectly affecting them.

872
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:29,360
Speaker 0: If there's any shared resource, any way for the players actions to have any effect on the other players actions in any way, and there are three or more players, you are playing a political game to some extent.

873
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:31,328
Speaker 0: Some games are more political than others.

874
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,420
Speaker 0: Some games are nothing but political, like diplomacy.

875
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:51,260
Speaker 1: But in the end, if you play a three plus player game of any kind, it will either devolve into a perfectly solved solution where if everyone plays equally, you can predict the winner from the beginning, or it will literally just come down to the politics of the interactions.

876
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,680
Speaker 1: Meaning, well, I hurt Scott a little bit and heared me a little bit, so someone else wins.

877
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:57,781
Speaker 0: Yep.

878
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:17,480
Speaker 0: Now there are cases where the interaction amount, like the amount you can interact is limited by the rules and skill does matter such that someone who is very good can still just win, even if everyone else is trying to gang up on them intentionally, just because they're that much better than the other players.

879
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:21,845
Speaker 0: A good example might be something like PUBG, right?

880
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:33,620
Speaker 0: If someone's just really good at PUBG, they could probably win and be the chicken dinner against 99 Scrubs, even if all the Scrubs were just hunting that one person specifically and not shooting each other.

881
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:42,720
Speaker 1: I have played in Counter-Strike gun games back in the day where everyone knows there's this one motherfucker who is better than everyone else, and everyone tries to gang up on them and it just doesn't matter.

882
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that is possible.

883
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:51,693
Speaker 1: But if everyone is maximally skilled, then skill no longer matters for those people.

884
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:56,260
Speaker 1: Politics is all that matters, unless the game is solvable at that level.

885
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

886
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:03,952
Speaker 0: So all three plus player games have this political element, if there's interaction, whether you like it or not.

887
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:06,597
Speaker 0: And this is where the board game Reddit.

888
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:08,560
Speaker 0: people come into play, right?

889
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:17,494
Speaker 0: You see people and they're playing something that's highly political, like Root or Tigris and Euphrates or something like that, right?

890
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:21,280
Speaker 0: And they're coming in with their two-player nonsense, right?

891
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,597
Speaker 0: And they're like, "How many players do I

892
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:22,699
Speaker 0: need?".

893
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,217
Speaker 1: They're mad that Root is unfair, or "My friend made a bad mistake with the birds and now the cats ran away with the game and that sucks.

894
00:58:29,357 --> 00:58:29,758
Speaker 1: I should have

895
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:29,979
Speaker 1: won.".

896
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,064
Speaker 0: It's like, that is the game.

897
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:35,873
Speaker 0: At three plus players, that is what the game is supposed to be.

898
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:37,357
Speaker 0: That's what it's designed to be.

899
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:38,680
Speaker 0: It's a political game intentionally.

900
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:45,540
Speaker 1: If you don't like the fact that the interactions of the players determine who wins, you don't like games with more than two players.

901
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,039
Speaker 0: Unless they're just races.

902
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,618
Speaker 0: Yep.

903
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,167
Speaker 0: So they do.

904
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:55,320
Speaker 0: let you in the rulebook play two-player Root.

905
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,196
Speaker 1: It's not fun.

906
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,045
Speaker 0: That is A, a bad game, in my opinion, and B, a completely different game.

907
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:10,153
Speaker 0: It is in no way resembles three plus player Root, except in only these surface details of like, "Yeah, these are the actions you can take on the board and

908
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:10,393
Speaker 0: such.".

909
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:23,013
Speaker 0: It's just like a resource-gaining game as opposed to a political game.

910
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,840
Speaker 0: What it takes to win at that game is unrelated.

911
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,386
Speaker 0: I don't even know why they offer it.

912
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,836
Speaker 0: It's like two completely different games with the same box.

913
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:31,900
Speaker 0: Why is it there?

914
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:39,360
Speaker 1: While I could say, and I think you'd agree, there is no formal difference between three and any number larger than three.

915
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,860
Speaker 1: There's no formal differences between any of those games at this point.

916
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:51,080
Speaker 1: But there are soft or informal patterns that we've definitely seen with certain player counts.

917
00:59:51,240 --> 01:00:16,220
Speaker 1: For example, four- and five-player games tend to be very similar to each other, but three-player games very commonly have a very specific pattern where two of the players will get ahead, one of the players falls behind, the player who fell behind is effectively eliminated from the game very early, and the game becomes effectively a two-player game, possibly with the spoiler kingmaker just hanging out in the background.

918
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's only three players.

919
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:21,220
Speaker 0: You don't have a lot of political options.

920
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:36,760
Speaker 0: And therefore, no matter what the game is, if you have a three-player political game, only after the early game, only two people are really just going to have a chance to win, no matter how well you design that game.

921
01:00:37,687 --> 01:00:39,260
Speaker 0: Can I think of any examples?

922
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,382
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

923
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:47,099
Speaker 1: If Scott plays a board game with the listeners who aren't crazy about games like we are, like a game Scott's good at.

924
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,002
Speaker 1: So it's Scott and two other listeners.

925
01:00:50,944 --> 01:01:04,221
Speaker 1: If they believe that Scott is better than them at games, it is in their best interest to both attack Scott early to make sure he is effectively eliminated to increase their chances of winning to 50%.

926
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:08,749
Speaker 1: It is almost impossible to avoid that situation in a three-player game mechanically.

927
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:15,960
Speaker 1: Three-player games that don't have this pattern of interaction and aren't races are shockingly rare.

928
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,680
Speaker 0: I think the only other pattern would be just one person runs away with it.

929
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,440
Speaker 1: Yep, which I have also seen in some three-player games.

930
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:33,660
Speaker 0: But for three people to all be in with a good chance of winning towards the end of a three-player game is very unlikely.

931
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:49,760
Speaker 1: Even in high skill, like a three-player Tigris and Euphrates, even with three people who are extremely high skill and possibly even equal in skill to each other, one player is going to, either by chance or by minor politics, be set behind a little bit.

932
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:55,200
Speaker 1: And there's like this negative inverse snowball once you're off the board where you can't get back on the board.

933
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might even be playing like an 18xx, which is like, you know, probably one of the best three-player type games on a board.

934
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:02,700
Speaker 0: that's a pro, right?

935
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,040
Speaker 0: And it's like, you might be getting late in the game and everyone's like money is pretty close, right?

936
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:15,960
Speaker 0: And it feels like, yeah, this is really close to three players, but really that small difference, whoever, someone is in third place.

937
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,124
Speaker 1: The second to last operating round.

938
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:19,246
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm only behind by $80.

939
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:21,129
Speaker 1: The third to last, the next operating round.

940
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:21,670
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm behind by $3,000.

941
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:22,492
Speaker 1: Next operating round.

942
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:27,540
Speaker 1: Now I'm behind by $6,000.

943
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:34,770
Speaker 0: It's just, it feels like you have three players who are in the game, which makes, which keeps the fun level up.

944
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:38,255
Speaker 0: But the reality is that two players ran away with the game.

945
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:41,700
Speaker 0: You just didn't tell because the numbers didn't separate that.

946
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,540
Speaker 1: I wonder if I just use some sort of logarithmic or pseudo logarithmic function to look at our value in these games instead of the real number, if that would give me a better sense.

947
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

948
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:52,799
Speaker 0: Probably.

949
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,017
Speaker 0: Depends on which one though.

950
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:09,300
Speaker 1: So, but one thing I would say is that the problem that causes one player to fall behind or one player to steamroll ahead in three-player games, they're both actually just symptoms of the same underlying problem and it really just depends on the politics at the table.

951
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:11,644
Speaker 1: One player running ahead usually happens.

952
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:17,674
Speaker 1: Imagine me and Scott and Joey Jojo Shabbat who are playing a game and Joey Jojo knows that me and Scott are both good at the game.

953
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,320
Speaker 1: Scott and I tend to fuck each other up to the point that Joey Jojo wins.

954
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,365
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, because if you're good, you have no choice.

955
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,810
Speaker 0: You know, one of the other players is also good.

956
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,393
Speaker 0: You have no choice but to attack them.

957
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:33,100
Speaker 0: But let's say you got a three-player game with three strong players, right?

958
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:51,397
Speaker 0: You're still going to be looking at the board and since the game has an interactive political element, right, you're going to calculate at some point, whatever the game is, there'll be some action you can take and you'll recognize, say like Carcassonne, taking points away from someone else is

959
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:51,878
Speaker 1: as

960
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,719
Speaker 0: good as giving points to yourself.

961
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,340
Speaker 0: They're equal.

962
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,666
Speaker 0: So there's going to be a move that you're going to see.

963
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,652
Speaker 0: that will be negative points for someone, right?

964
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:01,795
Speaker 0: Maybe you block someone.

965
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:04,540
Speaker 0: Maybe Rym's working on a castle and I block it, right?

966
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,732
Speaker 0: Well, now it's me and the other person are now ahead and Rym is back.

967
01:04:10,073 --> 01:04:10,655
Speaker 0: It's just natural.

968
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:12,020
Speaker 0: It's just going to happen.

969
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:16,060
Speaker 1: My specific strategy I've used for decades...

970
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:17,639
Speaker 0: Pretend you're losing.

971
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:23,312
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I do use psychological tricks, but let's assume I'm playing against you where that shit doesn't work.

972
01:04:23,512 --> 01:04:25,878
Speaker 1: Like, people where they can see right through me.

973
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:26,800
Speaker 1: In that case...

974
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,709
Speaker 0: Rym's like, "Oh, I'm done.

975
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:28,557
Speaker 0: I can't win this

976
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:28,758
Speaker 0: now.".

977
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,621
Speaker 0: Ah, fuck this game.

978
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:33,008
Speaker 1: Ah, look at me winning.

979
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,114
Speaker 1: That works so well against people who don't know me.

980
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:36,755
Speaker 1: It's kind of funny.

981
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:39,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, it used to work on all of you, but you figured me out.

982
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:41,503
Speaker 1: So, say I can't pull that shit.

983
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:52,820
Speaker 1: Then my strategy is actually, in most 3-player games, I wait until some other player has taken an action that harms a player on the board who is not me.

984
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,067
Speaker 1: Once that happens, I double down on destroying whoever they hurt a little.

985
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:00,491
Speaker 1: Dog pile on.

986
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:01,873
Speaker 1: Remember the Omega-Thon?

987
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:06,660
Speaker 1: They were playing, like, boom blocks and the first player attacked Green just randomly.

988
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,990
Speaker 1: The second player looked around, laughed, and attacked Green.

989
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,376
Speaker 1: The third player was like, "Oh, well, Green goes

990
01:05:13,396 --> 01:05:13,657
Speaker 1: fourth.".

991
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,060
Speaker 1: Attackin' Green!

992
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:17,843
Speaker 1: So, Green was basically out of the game.

993
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:20,448
Speaker 1: The first player comes around again, they attack Blue.

994
01:05:21,069 --> 01:05:26,480
Speaker 1: Blue was the second player, so Blue attacked them, and the third player actually won the game as a result.

995
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:40,640
Speaker 0: So, the thing to remember here is that all 3+ player games that aren't races have a political element and are therefore inherently different from a 2-player game.

996
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,489
Speaker 0: You cannot go into such a game expecting to win because you were the best.

997
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:50,377
Speaker 0: You could play the best and lose because people might vote for you to lose, and it's a vote-who-wins game.

998
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:51,680
Speaker 0: That is what the game is.

999
01:05:52,123 --> 01:05:54,280
Speaker 0: If you don't like that, don't play those games.

1000
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:00,980
Speaker 1: Even better, the skill of being good at a game like that involves trying to manage the politics.

1001
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,519
Speaker 0: Yes, indeed.

1002
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,561
Speaker 1: Like, for real.

1003
01:06:04,102 --> 01:06:05,024
Speaker 1: Best with your friends.

1004
01:06:05,806 --> 01:06:06,808
Speaker 1: Act like you're losing.

1005
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:07,810
Speaker 1: Psychology.

1006
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,600
Speaker 1: Do things in-game to protect you from politics if that is an option in the particular game you're playing.

1007
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:21,660
Speaker 0: One final note, because I mentioned PUBG before, is that when N becomes large, nothing fundamentally changes.

1008
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:39,040
Speaker 0: As Rym said before, the principles mathematically are the same, but there is a soft difference with very large numbers of players, like a PUBG, in that you're only really able to directly interact with people who are near you.

1009
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:43,500
Speaker 0: You can't interact with everyone in the game.

1010
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,007
Speaker 1: I'm stuck in a firefight with the eight people who landed kind of near me.

1011
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:50,092
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Scott's on the other side of the island.

1012
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:53,940
Speaker 1: It might be all the shitty people are on the other side of the island, and I'm just boned.

1013
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,301
Speaker 1: Right.

1014
01:06:54,882 --> 01:07:02,540
Speaker 0: So, even though it is fundamentally a vote-who-wins game, think about something like Tetris 99 on the Switch, right?

1015
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, you are choosing who to attack.

1016
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:08,918
Speaker 0: There is a vote-who-wins element there that ultimately determines a lot.

1017
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:12,940
Speaker 1: More players dilutes the effect of politics.

1018
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,021
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1019
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:17,747
Speaker 0: It dilutes the effect of politics until the latest stages of the game.

1020
01:07:18,328 --> 01:07:25,520
Speaker 0: Therefore, it ends up being not entirely a race, but more, it goes back to being a race, right?

1021
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:35,780
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, if you play Tetris 99, at the end of the game, you're going to be left with, usually, most of the time, the people who are the best at Tetris, as if you had a Tetris race.

1022
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:40,250
Speaker 0: And then, amongst those people, they will have some sort of competition.

1023
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:44,280
Speaker 0: that is a combination of Tetris skill and politics together.

1024
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:56,460
Speaker 0: The other thing that happens- The politics are still present in the early game, but they're so weak, because there's so many players, you know, and- You almost have to bring enough skill to the table to be able to play the politics game at the end.

1025
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,926
Speaker 0: Like, if someone sucked at Tetris, they're just really bad at it.

1026
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:08,740
Speaker 0: Even if all 98 other players voted for that person to win and didn't attack them, they would probably just die on their own, right?

1027
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:15,349
Speaker 0: And even if someone was amazing at Tetris, and all 98 other players voted to take them out, right?

1028
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:22,500
Speaker 0: You can't coordinate that kind of attack, but if you could, you still might not take them out unless some of the other 98 players were good enough.

1029
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:27,540
Speaker 0: Because that player is so good, they'll just be able to clear if the attack isn't strong enough.

1030
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:34,033
Speaker 1: The other thing going on with larger player counts, and again, this is all informal patterns, not formal patterns.

1031
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:35,617
Speaker 1: They're not hard distinctions.

1032
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,207
Speaker 1: Is that the more players there are, the more likely it is.

1033
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:44,840
Speaker 1: there is a broader gradient of player skill, which leads to dynamics.

1034
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:53,120
Speaker 1: Like, in a three-player game, it's unlikely that I will be able to, like, farm the actions of the worst player to better myself in a meaningful way.

1035
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,048
Speaker 1: But if there's 100 players, there's probably 10 bad players.

1036
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:01,399
Speaker 1: I can go, like, in a deathmatch with 100 players, like a Quake deathmatch that somehow has 100 players.

1037
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:14,640
Speaker 1: My skill, the skill in a deathmatch with 100 players, like Quake 1, would be to find bad players and kill them as quickly as possible, and just let good players kill you so you can get back to killing bad players.

1038
01:09:15,103 --> 01:09:16,654
Speaker 1: Like, dynamics can be different.

1039
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:17,439
Speaker 0: Local equilibrium can happen.

1040
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,386
Speaker 0: A lot of that depends on the specific rules of the game, right?

1041
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:24,256
Speaker 0: Something like PUBG, where when you kill someone, you get their stuff, right?

1042
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,660
Speaker 0: That matters a lot, right?

1043
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,529
Speaker 0: Something like Quake, where you instantly respawn, so dying is not that big a deal, right?

1044
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,720
Speaker 0: Chasing someone for a minute and not getting any frags would be worse than just dying.

1045
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,568
Speaker 1: But here's what I'd say.

1046
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:49,979
Speaker 0: Small player counts-- But another game where you can't really farm people so much, where there's no benefit to attacking weak players, that doesn't give you a benefit for that, well, then that goes away.

1047
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:50,421
Speaker 1: Yep.

1048
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,423
Speaker 1: So think of it this way.

1049
01:09:51,783 --> 01:10:00,020
Speaker 1: Small player counts, generally, the actual specifics of the game don't matter that much.

1050
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,480
Speaker 1: That pattern we talked about comes through almost no matter what the mechanics are in a 3-player game.

1051
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:16,920
Speaker 1: But in a 10-player game versus a 20-player game, there's more nuanced or complex patterns that can emerge that rely more heavily on the specifics of those individual games.

1052
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:21,520
Speaker 1: It's a lot harder to generalize about play patterns with higher player counts.

1053
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:33,640
Speaker 1: And we've already gone over an hour, so there's no way we can even begin to talk about player counts in non-Ortho games, which I think there is a topic there, but that's another hour.

1054
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:41,757
Speaker 0: The point is, stop complaining or saying wrong things when it comes to, "Oh, this game has a 1-player version, 2-player version, 3-player

1055
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:42,038
Speaker 0: version.".

1056
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,279
Speaker 1: Those are three different games.

1057
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:52,220
Speaker 0: That those are three different games, and that there are inherent properties of those games that you have to accept, whether you like them or not.

1058
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:59,419
Speaker 0: So if you don't like them, recognize that and just don't play them instead of saying something wrong like, "I don't like root because it's

1059
01:10:59,479 --> 01:10:59,960
Speaker 0: politics.".

1060
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,431
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, don't play root.

1061
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:04,500
Speaker 1: Go play chess or Eitan or something.

1062
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:06,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, just don't play that then.

1063
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:10,495
Speaker 0: Don't come ask, "How do I play root

1064
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:10,979
Speaker 0: solo?".

1065
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:19,620
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm sure you could take some of the rules of root and make a puzzle out of them, but that's not playing root.

1066
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,959
Speaker 0: Playing root is a political activity.

1067
01:11:21,482 --> 01:11:21,548
Speaker 1: Yep.

1068
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,359
Speaker 0: You need three or more people.

1069
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,627
Speaker 1: Or to play against AIs, but guess what?

1070
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:28,860
Speaker 1: The AIs, even if it's random, they'll be randomly political.

1071
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also it's a puzzle.

1072
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,514
Speaker 0: It just looks like a book.

1073
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:32,856
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1074
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:41,060
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1075
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:46,200
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1076
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,600
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1077
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,520
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1078
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,280
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1080
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,100
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1081
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:10,220
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1082
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:41,380
Speaker 1: And a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1083
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:45,480
Speaker 1: So yeah, Bike Nights happens as often as it happens.

1084
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,060
Speaker 1: We'll probably do another episode on non-Ortho games on this topic.

1085
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:50,978
Speaker 1: I think we can make a panel out of it.

1086
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:54,100
Speaker 1: But anyway, for now, I'll tell you a secret.

1087
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,020
Speaker 1: There's a tiny chance I might show up at PAX Unplugged without Scott.

1088
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:58,766
Speaker 1: Not to attend.

1089
01:12:58,826 --> 01:13:00,480
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not going to be there playing games or anything.

1090
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,640
Speaker 1: But I might roll in just to do a panel or two and then peace out.

1091
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,339
Speaker 1: So stay tuned on that.

1092
01:13:05,884 --> 01:13:07,539
Speaker 1: I don't know how Scott's even going to feel about that.

1093
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,914
Speaker 1: And he never listens to the show, so he won't know.

1094
01:13:09,975 --> 01:13:10,619
Speaker 1: Only you will know.

1095
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:12,280
Speaker 1: We'll see if it even happens.

1096
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:38,098
Speaker 1: But anyway, for now, I leave you with... [beatboxing].
