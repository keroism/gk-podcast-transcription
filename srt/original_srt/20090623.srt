1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,973
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 23rd.

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:12,774
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:13,374
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:14,776
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nodz.

5
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:15,177
Speaker 1: Tonight...

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,788
Speaker 1: So this weekend was a burning weekend.

8
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:34,875
Speaker 1: We got the crew together, played our burning wheel.

9
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:44,517
Speaker 1: We finally dropped that long-running Epic Roman politics campaign to play something more birthed in burning wheel as opposed to originally birthed in D&D.

10
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:46,987
Speaker 1: I think it worked really well.

11
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a pretty good game going on.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,260
Speaker 0: I just I wish I wasn't so humid and I didn't get a headache and sort of pass out.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,505
Speaker 1: I felt so bad for Scott.

14
00:00:55,525 --> 00:01:01,168
Speaker 1: The game was going strong and he was being all spidery and then about halfway through he kind of laid down and never got that guy.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,293
Speaker 0: It's like I was like I was.

16
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:03,939
Speaker 0: I was like I don't want to lay down.

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:05,025
Speaker 0: I shouldn't lay down.

18
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,860
Speaker 0: I know laying down is like you know the bad move.

19
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,768
Speaker 0: But it was just so bleh and Alex.

20
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:13,737
Speaker 0: I know he has that really powerful air conditioner.

21
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:14,540
Speaker 0: That would have worked.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,585
Speaker 0: He just didn't want to put it in.

23
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:17,051
Speaker 1: You know he never uses that thing.

24
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:17,413
Speaker 1: I'm surprised.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:21,491
Speaker 0: The thing is so so Ridiculously powerful and has so many BTUs.

26
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,380
Speaker 0: It would have been fun, but he didn't use it.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:33,103
Speaker 0: And so you know not even just because of the heat I was feeling bleh earlier, and it was just compounding my bleh, but I had probably the best duel of wits I've ever had.

28
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:34,167
Speaker 1: I used ugly truth.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,372
Speaker 1: I'm proud of that.

30
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:36,959
Speaker 0: Oh you duel of wits Jess, right?

31
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:37,986
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I remember that.

32
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:38,954
Speaker 1: That was pretty epic.

33
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:39,600
Speaker 0: That was alright.

34
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:48,554
Speaker 1: But you know after the game the next day we're hanging out with the crew like we always do and you know people leave at different times and half the crew had left and half the crew was still around.

35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:53,540
Speaker 1: and Kate and Adam, well Adam, takes the dogs outside for a walk.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, you forgot about what happened over the weekend because I was like I got something to talk about and you were like alright I got nothing.

37
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:01,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew there was something.

38
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,375
Speaker 0: I just couldn't forget what it was.

39
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:07,856
Speaker 1: So Adam's out there And he yells from the outside downstairs down from the deck.

40
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:12,107
Speaker 1: Hey, Rim Somebody left an alligator skull down here.

41
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:15,838
Speaker 1: No, I think it's an entire alligator head.

42
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:16,580
Speaker 0: What?

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,985
Speaker 1: You gotta come see this.

44
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:19,773
Speaker 0: First of all, we're not in Florida.

45
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,898
Speaker 0: So this makes no sense.

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:32,399
Speaker 1: Second I'm expecting to see like a deer skull or a stick shaped vaguely like an alligator head or I don't know Just a piece of garbage, but I walk out there and I see this thing.

47
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,574
Speaker 1: So I what we go up to it and he's like that's an alligator skull.

48
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,622
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't know I don't know.

49
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,345
Speaker 1: So he grabs a stick.

50
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,027
Speaker 1: He flips it over.

51
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,894
Speaker 1: It's a fucking alligator head.

52
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:43,868
Speaker 0: It's not even just the skull It's like the full head.

53
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:44,874
Speaker 0: It's got an eyeball.

54
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,785
Speaker 0: It's got teeth It's got skin.

55
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,835
Speaker 0: It's got all sorts of business going on.

56
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,291
Speaker 0: It's a full on Alligators head like cut off right behind the eyes.

57
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,057
Speaker 1: It was definitely real too.

58
00:02:55,399 --> 00:03:00,716
Speaker 1: Absolutely It was taxidermy because it had a glass eye, but that was definitely a real alligator.

59
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:01,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was clearly.

60
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,964
Speaker 0: yeah It's like it was so weird.

61
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,149
Speaker 0: It was like, okay.

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:12,191
Speaker 0: There's no way that this is actually a Alligator that died back here because it's not Florida But it was taxidermy.

63
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:17,400
Speaker 0: alligator head made its way into our backyard And it wasn't like we couldn't find the rest of the alligator.

64
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:24,040
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is the head was cut off like sawed off cleanly and the spine and everything was still in there like the spa.

65
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:30,920
Speaker 1: Oh my god, it was pretty nasty, but it was sawed clean off and the head was facing forward from this old wooden fence.

66
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:38,548
Speaker 1: So we all kind of climb up onto the fence and look over not really expecting an alligator body But kind of expecting one.

67
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:40,737
Speaker 0: but there was not an alligator body over there.

68
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 1: We looked around.

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,972
Speaker 1: I went back there later and there's no alligator body.

70
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,780
Speaker 0: It's like how did it get back there?

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,680
Speaker 0: It's like our backyard is basically not existed and no one goes back.

72
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,520
Speaker 1: No one goes there had to have been there for the entirety of the years that we've been living here.

73
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,319
Speaker 0: There is no way it was there for the entirety of the year.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,809
Speaker 1: But then how would have gotten there?

75
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,079
Speaker 1: who would have put it there?

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,480
Speaker 0: There's no knowing how it got there.

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,920
Speaker 0: But regardless there is an alligator head that was in the backyard and we throw it out and I have a pictures of it.

78
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,220
Speaker 1: The neighbor lady comes out and she's like, what are you guys all looking at?

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,396
Speaker 1: And we're like, there's an alligator head behind the house and she's like, I don't know anything about that.

80
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,634
Speaker 0: I Think she put it there.

81
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,623
Speaker 0: She's covered it up.

82
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,713
Speaker 1: The fact that it was cut off so cleanly.

83
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,563
Speaker 0: It was very strange Of course.

84
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:30,960
Speaker 1: the my second thought after that's an alligator head.

85
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:35,154
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my third thought because my second thought was it has a glass eye.

86
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,177
Speaker 1: the third thought was Draco Litch.

87
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:39,498
Speaker 0: What?

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,764
Speaker 1: Maybe arch Litch?

89
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:42,226
Speaker 0: my.

90
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,993
Speaker 0: my thought was how the fuck did it get there?

91
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,599
Speaker 0: And I still don't know and I probably never will.

92
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,458
Speaker 1: So that was our weekend burning wheel and an alligator head.

93
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:55,429
Speaker 1: We took some pictures of it.

94
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,499
Speaker 1: we'll put them online at some point just to prove it.

95
00:04:57,901 --> 00:04:59,666
Speaker 1: No one would believe us unless we had pictures.

96
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:00,790
Speaker 0: picture didn't happen.

97
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:01,552
Speaker 1: Yep.

98
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:02,475
Speaker 1: Well, we've got pics.

99
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,218
Speaker 1: it happened.

100
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:03,860
Speaker 0: That's right.

101
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:05,375
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

102
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,411
Speaker 0: Alright video games, let's see Hmm.

103
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:10,920
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

104
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,895
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, I want to say that I thought it was that a real pause.

105
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,300
Speaker 1: or did you actually forget what you were?

106
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,012
Speaker 1: Going to say I didn't forget anything.

107
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:18,557
Speaker 1: Okay?

108
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:25,357
Speaker 0: Okay So I system shock 2 is an old game that I know that I never played until now.

109
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,407
Speaker 1: you and our waters boys And I think are playing it up.

110
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it's got co-op, right?

111
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,890
Speaker 0: it's like whoa, this old FPS is co-op and that's kind of.

112
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:38,128
Speaker 0: what I'm dying for is some cop FPS and the thing is it's mostly a RPG FPS more than a cop FPS.

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,453
Speaker 0: but playing it.

114
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,540
Speaker 0: It's like I played Bioshock first.

115
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:52,130
Speaker 0: So now playing System Shock 2 it's like oh wow Bioshock was a lot more like System Shock 2 than I realized Which you know makes sense, but you know, I didn't under.

116
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:55,139
Speaker 0: I didn't know the connections because I hadn't played both of them.

117
00:05:55,921 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaker 0: But if you haven't played the System Shock 2 it'll run on pretty much almost any computer that's modern.

118
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,373
Speaker 0: So and you're not gonna be able to buy it legitimately.

119
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 0: just get it off the Internet's for free.

120
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,224
Speaker 0: it's not difficult.

121
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:11,012
Speaker 0: and if you can play it co-op.

122
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:16,559
Speaker 0: and the interesting thing about playing a co-op right is that The game doesn't give you any more stuff.

123
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:24,820
Speaker 0: So it's like you have to divide the ammo between you know All the people playing evenly which kind of or you can hoard it all if you're a asshole.

124
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,145
Speaker 0: So it kind of sucks in that regard.

125
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:32,060
Speaker 0: but in terms of you get these upgrade modules as you complete quests and such.

126
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,980
Speaker 0: So you everyone upgrades a whole shit ton.

127
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:39,720
Speaker 0: So you it's like you're wicked powerful because normally it's like if you're playing the one-player game.

128
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:44,393
Speaker 0: You'd have to concentrate on say psychic powers or hacking or military skills.

129
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:45,576
Speaker 0: We're playing.

130
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:48,209
Speaker 0: I got all the military skills He's got all the hacking skills.

131
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:54,053
Speaker 0: So it's like hey we We're maxing it out here and it's it's pretty good.

132
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're almost done, you know, whatever.

133
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:06,359
Speaker 0: Also this Friday I think if not late Thursday Blood Bowl is coming out for the PC.

134
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,626
Speaker 0: Now here's the story behind this blood bowl.

135
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:13,740
Speaker 0: way back in the day games workshop the makers of Warhammer made a game called blood bowl.

136
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,847
Speaker 0: And blood bowl, it's football.

137
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,295
Speaker 0: It's a football game, but you kill people.

138
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:19,780
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like football Warhammer.

139
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:26,000
Speaker 0: But it was cool because it was like you get all the good of a miniatures Warhammer type game without the collecting miss.

140
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,426
Speaker 0: You just buy this one box.

141
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,575
Speaker 0: it has blood bowl in it and that's it.

142
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,576
Speaker 0: and it was you know But you get it's it's Warhammer like gaming.

143
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:38,850
Speaker 0: So This they made a warhead a blood bowl video game back in the 90s.

144
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 0: That was all DOS styling, but then another company Unofficially and illegitimately made a game called chaos league right and they got in trouble.

145
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,289
Speaker 0: They were I got they.

146
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,234
Speaker 0: you can't don't do that.

147
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:57,702
Speaker 0: But then Unlike every other stupid company in the world They made nice.

148
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:08,084
Speaker 0: and now the people who made chaos league or obviously blood bowl fans are making the official blood bowl game and it's coming out for the PC on Friday and Not it's all.

149
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:18,978
Speaker 0: in addition to being you know, having the turn-based blood bowl gameplay It also has a real-time blood bowl gameplay that I assume is more like Madden ish kind of game.

150
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:21,509
Speaker 0: I don't know The trailer is not really.

151
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,519
Speaker 0: the video trailer is not really helping me out here.

152
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:29,657
Speaker 0: They're also coming out with DS and PSP blood bowls that are a lot like the original board game.

153
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,575
Speaker 0: So You know the game is kind of expensive to buy the board version.

154
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:35,600
Speaker 0: It's like $75.

155
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,889
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to find.

156
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,559
Speaker 0: Oh, no, you can just buy it online easily.

157
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:43,870
Speaker 1: I don't know at least in person because I remember at our IT You just go to the games workshop store in the city.

158
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,739
Speaker 1: They got true remember at our IT They had like three sets of it at our wag.

159
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,272
Speaker 0: Well millennium had like three sets and they were always just sitting there.

160
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:50,835
Speaker 0: No one bought it.

161
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:54,587
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway You got to go to a gaming store to get.

162
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,034
Speaker 0: you're not gonna find it anywhere else.

163
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,280
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be a Toys R Us.

164
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's for sure.

165
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,267
Speaker 0: But the video game is $50.

166
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:09,033
Speaker 0: So if you think of it, that's sort of a steal Especially since you're getting the you know The board game and another game and all these graphics and on such and such.

167
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:18,110
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna be on steam though Just sort of like bleh, but it is gonna be you know, downloadable Somehow through whatever frickin service they're using.

168
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:22,628
Speaker 0: I think my strategy is I'm gonna wait like a few days You know wait probably till the next week.

169
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:32,896
Speaker 0: see how people receive the game See if they like it or not And you know if there's enough people playing it so that I can actually you know Get the game on against people often enough.

170
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:33,540
Speaker 0: then I'll buy it.

171
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:42,745
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'll wait until it's much less expensive or I'll just get the DS one, you know and just play that with the local Multiplayer against people.

172
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:43,487
Speaker 1: we'll see.

173
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,273
Speaker 1: I mean the DS more and more.

174
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,922
Speaker 1: the DS just can't have the complex kind of games I want.

175
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,906
Speaker 0: well, it's it's basically.

176
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,091
Speaker 0: I looked at the screenshots.

177
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:52,100
Speaker 0: The DS one's not gonna be out for a lot longer.

178
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:58,960
Speaker 0: It's not coming out on Friday But the DS one it looks like it's just blood Bowl just like the board game only on the DS.

179
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:01,639
Speaker 0: So yeah, can't really go wrong.

180
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:06,740
Speaker 1: I've only actually played blood Bowl the board game once and I didn't even play it all the way through.

181
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically the way it works.

182
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,771
Speaker 0: is you have?

183
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:24,837
Speaker 0: the basic rules are like this right you have so many players right, but only 11 can be on the field at once because football and Every turn each guy can perform an action and the actions are like move block kill.

184
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:29,280
Speaker 0: You know block is is fight, you know pass chart, right?

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:45,100
Speaker 0: But then there are certain special actions right and on your turn You can only do one special action with one dude, you know, so, you know It's like everyone on your whole team does one of the normal actions and one guy can do a special action.

186
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,905
Speaker 0: It could be any guy.

187
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:50,139
Speaker 0: so you can have like this guy do the special action or that guy It's not like only the quarterback can do the special action.

188
00:10:50,641 --> 00:11:06,680
Speaker 0: But and you basically you just do this every turn, you know, and then there's some dice and some other charts and things You know like if you and like, you know, if you move and if you move near enemies They can try to trip you and all this sort of stuff, you know, but that's that's how the game is played.

189
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:08,272
Speaker 0: so it's you know, it's pretty good.

190
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:12,813
Speaker 0: as far as a Miniature turn-based strategy games go plus football.

191
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:21,489
Speaker 1: but speaking of games that are coming out We didn't talk about this as much as I would have expected because it kind of it got Announced when we weren't really doing video game shows.

192
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:28,405
Speaker 1: We were kind of in this in-between period for various reasons, but NS2 is actually coming for real.

193
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,528
Speaker 1: pre-orders were announced a while ago.

194
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:40,070
Speaker 1: You can go right now spend money pre-order and All I know is that I look to see if we had talked about this as a noobs.

195
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:51,230
Speaker 1: I didn't remember and I saw that the last time we noted that we talked about natural selection Was in 2006 when NS2 announced that they might have dynamic infestation.

196
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,843
Speaker 0: So we're gonna have to go over this whole thing again, basically natural selection.

197
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,830
Speaker 0: one is an awesome half-life mod.

198
00:11:57,171 --> 00:12:01,410
Speaker 0: That's an RTS and an FPS at the same time and we don't need to explain that we did.

199
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:02,718
Speaker 1: I just finished the explanation.

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,865
Speaker 1: We did all show on it.

201
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:11,411
Speaker 1: NS2 is Pretty much the only game I've been looking forward to since Team Fortress 2.

202
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, and especially since Team Fortress 2 was up, right?

203
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:20,422
Speaker 1: Team Fortress 2 was awesome up until the moment I took my first step as a player in the game.

204
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:25,623
Speaker 1: Yeah at that moment I was vaguely disappointed and I became extremely disappointed.

205
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,989
Speaker 0: Team Fortress 2 is like wow.

206
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,435
Speaker 0: to me It's like the game itself.

207
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:35,520
Speaker 0: the gameplay poop complete poop, but many humorous things result, you know Like Leroy Jenkins and you know meet the whoever.

208
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:42,201
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is oh my god meet the spy was pretty damn good It was better than the everything since meet the heavy.

209
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,625
Speaker 0: Oh, I like the engineer one.

210
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,467
Speaker 1: It was okay.

211
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:52,050
Speaker 1: Anyway, but NS2 is Probably going to be the most important FPS to come out since the re-release of Quake 3.

212
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,769
Speaker 0: Yes, not only is NS2 first of all outside its own engine, right?

213
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,249
Speaker 0: It's not using the half-life engine or the source entry or anything.

214
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,144
Speaker 0: Secondly, the system requirements are really low.

215
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:09,296
Speaker 1: So everyone can play Number three, I mean seriously 1.2 gigahertz processor 200.

216
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:18,815
Speaker 0: you might be able to play it in a netbook if you got a GPU 256 megabytes of RAM DirectX 9 a mouse a keyboard Okay, internet access.

217
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:22,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna be super moddable with Lua.

218
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,762
Speaker 0: if you don't know what Lua is It's basically a scripting language.

219
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,569
Speaker 0: That's mad easy.

220
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,749
Speaker 0: So you people get me modding the fuck out of this game.

221
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:32,182
Speaker 1: Well more importantly the team behind it these people.

222
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:37,560
Speaker 1: we're not gonna not the whole not to tell the whole story here But NS1 was a game that had a niche.

223
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,290
Speaker 1: It wasn't super popular outside of people who got it.

224
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,954
Speaker 1: it has a very small community that is extremely dedicated much like Not quake arena.

225
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:52,268
Speaker 1: quicker in is basically dead like mega TF or weapons factory or tribes to now There's these little groups of people that play it and no one else does.

226
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,990
Speaker 1: But the people who made NS get it.

227
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,849
Speaker 1: They understand what it is to make a unique and different and amazing game more so than other people I have seen.

228
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:13,779
Speaker 1: Natural selection is one of the greatest games ever made and NS2 Even if it is even if they deliver on less than half of what they claim to deliver on It's still gonna be the best FPS ever.

229
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,072
Speaker 1: probably looks like it at least the best AC.

230
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:22,110
Speaker 1: well, not even asymmetric because I think it'll be the best versus FPS ever made quite possibly.

231
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:28,123
Speaker 0: I mean I can't counter-strike and tribes two are up there But I can't put it in the same categories like half-life.

232
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,570
Speaker 1: single-player is a totally different thing.

233
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but I mean some of the changes that I heard about are you know, they're doing?

234
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,083
Speaker 0: look You know, first of all, all the graphics are updated right?

235
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:40,230
Speaker 1: They look real good If the teaser trailer is to be believed.

236
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, they're doing a lot.

237
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,527
Speaker 0: First of all, the alien is gonna have a commander which is good and bad sort of I kind of see.

238
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,715
Speaker 1: at one hand I think that's crap.

239
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:56,370
Speaker 1: I liked the hive mine, you know asymmetric whatever but at the same time I've really trust these guys judgment?

240
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:02,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, also like the ono stomp is gonna disable structures and such temporarily.

241
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,305
Speaker 0: So we could like stomp on the IP and the IP will stop spinning.

242
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:08,650
Speaker 0: apparently the new IP spins.

243
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:10,655
Speaker 1: Basically, what I think they're doing is they?

244
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:16,931
Speaker 1: they they were really ambitious with ns1 and they basically pushed half-life 1 as far as they Could.

245
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:23,070
Speaker 1: yeah and all the stuff they didn't do they wanted to do they just do that the game they'd already reached the limit.

246
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,968
Speaker 1: I mean babblers never worked.

247
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,110
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean basically like you know These guys are great at taking a small amount of resources and pushing them to the max.

248
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,530
Speaker 0: I mean their half-life 1 mod looks as good as a lot of hat better than half-life 2 mods that are out there.

249
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,375
Speaker 0: it's so good, but so the You know, they're.

250
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:47,180
Speaker 0: that's why that has such low system requirements because they have the skills to be able to push You know really hard and make it really awesome.

251
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,910
Speaker 0: But also they're not eating lots of you know, fancy shit.

252
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,943
Speaker 1: They're not like taking the original game and just like going crazy.

253
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:57,015
Speaker 1: now that they have resources and they're doing it on their own And all this stuff there.

254
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:04,125
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell they're basically doing all the things That they wanted to do originally but couldn't just due to limitations of technology.

255
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're also the.

256
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,050
Speaker 0: The infestation is going to spread.

257
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,822
Speaker 0: I don't know how it will spread but it's gonna spread in some way.

258
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:16,890
Speaker 0: and then you can use flamethrowers You know to push it back well, or you can close bulkheads to sort of just seal it back.

259
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,770
Speaker 1: Well, one thing about NS that made it great was that it was primarily an area control game.

260
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,650
Speaker 1: But area control was either siege points choke points or resource towers.

261
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:31,290
Speaker 1: But now with this infestation area control takes on a much more visceral feeling.

262
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:36,836
Speaker 0: It's a lot more zerg ish on the bad guys on the alien side Not bad guys.

263
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,665
Speaker 0: You could be the aliens then it'd be the good guys.

264
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,699
Speaker 1: They Know the natural selection team unknown worlds.

265
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:51,337
Speaker 1: They they breached this balance between atmosphere aka realism and gameplay That I've never seen anyone ever come close to.

266
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:58,618
Speaker 1: games usually decide between being atmospheric and immersive or being a good Straight up, you know competitive game.

267
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, like very quick is really good game It's it's you know game play is all about.

268
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,970
Speaker 0: there's no atmosphere atmosphere in quake.

269
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,861
Speaker 0: It barely feels like you know, but say half-life.

270
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,750
Speaker 0: well half-life has good gameplay, but not multiplayer.

271
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:14,050
Speaker 0: Why?

272
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:19,429
Speaker 1: yes counter-strike did a pretty good job of giving up some of the realism to make the game playable and fun.

273
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:25,270
Speaker 1: Action quake was not in any way realistic and had very little atmosphere, but it was real fun.

274
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:31,970
Speaker 1: Yep, but NS2 they never sacrificed gameplay for style or vice-versa, but they max both of them out.

275
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:33,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

276
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:37,009
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm really gonna make a concerted effort to make mods of NS2.

277
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,487
Speaker 0: I've never really done the mods big time but NS2 we're gonna mod that shit.

278
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,053
Speaker 0: first mod Babblers.

279
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,077
Speaker 0: first mod bat.

280
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,301
Speaker 0: we're gonna do all the obvious.

281
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,509
Speaker 0: mods gorge no animation jump.

282
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:54,178
Speaker 0: You know classic mode gorge race combat gorge race Babblers.

283
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,779
Speaker 1: Oh I can love babblers.

284
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:01,010
Speaker 1: But anyway, just you know, be aware We don't advertise or anything on geek nights.

285
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:06,637
Speaker 1: But you can pre-order NS2 and you can either spend $20 or twice as much as that.

286
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,463
Speaker 1: and you don't get anything different.

287
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,448
Speaker 1: if you spend more other than that You held these people out and you get black armor.

288
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,898
Speaker 1: It's actually beta and the alpha.

289
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually sort of quite needed to pay the $40.

290
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,990
Speaker 0: if we're gonna mod it We're gonna need to get in as early as possible.

291
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:27,827
Speaker 0: But also it's interesting to see that the vast majority of the pre-orders got that they didn't say how.

292
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:32,883
Speaker 0: I didn't see how many there Were but they said the vast majority percentage wise of pre-orders were the $40.

293
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:33,305
Speaker 1: think about it.

294
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,750
Speaker 1: who is pre-ordering this game?

295
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:41,090
Speaker 1: But the existing NS community is in my opinion the closest knit online gaming community left.

296
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:48,894
Speaker 0: Really the survival of the game though depends on the long tail of people buying the $20 version You know after its release.

297
00:18:48,914 --> 00:19:05,047
Speaker 1: but even if only all the current NS2 play NS1 players buy it and then unknown worlds goes out Of business the game exists and these people will play NS for the rest of their lives Probably like it and you might scoff at that, but I really yeah.

298
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:16,349
Speaker 1: But I got one more announcement because it is a Tuesday and unlike other conventions we do that every day.

299
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:20,317
Speaker 1: Thank God This convention is a lot more gamey.

313
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,043
Speaker 1: We are doing like 11 panels.

00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:01,930
Speaker 1: Just me and Scott.

315
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:13,590
Speaker 1: Also, we have the front row crew doing a whole bunch of panels like a burning wheel character burning workshop Geekology geek research independent game development all this sort of stuff.

316
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:23,316
Speaker 1: We have also got Luke Crane the guy who did burning wheel and all that and Jared Sorensen The guy who did action castle and all that Inspectors.

320
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:51,180
Speaker 0: So even if Kinetic on is no good, right and I don't know how it's gonna be I have no you know, cuz Kinetic on has been sort of iffy.

321
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,954
Speaker 0: the thing is a. even though Kinetic on is iffy I'm not gonna lie.

322
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,984
Speaker 0: the board game area.

323
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,433
Speaker 0: There is always 100% awesome.

324
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:07,033
Speaker 1: They should just make that a convention in and of itself that accounts tabletop gaming is better than most tabletop gaming conventions I've been to.

325
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,462
Speaker 0: and two there's a whole panel room.

326
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,550
Speaker 0: That is we it's just us.

327
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,292
Speaker 0: So if you're a fan of us, you're listening to us Obviously.

328
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:24,810
Speaker 0: you can be safe in that room and the tabletop gaming area for the whole convention all three days And it'll be worth your while to go to Kinetic on and it'll also make us look really good.

329
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, you come just for us and no other reason.

330
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:34,069
Speaker 1: plus I will say this We have gone to Kinetic on for several years and we have never failed to have a very good time.

331
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:41,088
Speaker 1: We're always a little bit leery ahead of time because the con always kind of Puts it real close to the wire in terms of being ready to run.

332
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's always fun when we're there.

333
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:51,955
Speaker 1: and this year The you can think of this basically as the test run of what we're going to be doing in all the bigger Conventions in years to come.

334
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:52,497
Speaker 0: Yeah.

335
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,908
Speaker 0: Also, you might see us pass out from doing 11 panels.

336
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:10,230
Speaker 1: So things of the day I have something very little here very very minor.

337
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,355
Speaker 1: It's not terribly important.

338
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,022
Speaker 1: But remember Mortal Kombat.

339
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,970
Speaker 1: It was a. it wasn't a good game.

340
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,510
Speaker 1: No one can claim it was actually a good game with a straight face.

341
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:18,912
Speaker 1: It was not.

342
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:22,165
Speaker 0: a Mortal Kombat 2 was not well terrible fighting.

343
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:25,657
Speaker 1: It was a good, you know It was not an objectively good game.

344
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:30,191
Speaker 1: It was an okay fighting game, but I had Street Fighter 2.

345
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,681
Speaker 0: Well, it was a different kind of fighting game from Street Fighter 2.

346
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:32,882
Speaker 0: Yes.

347
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,769
Speaker 1: It was a memorize the combos game.

348
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:36,194
Speaker 0: What game isn't?

349
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:39,665
Speaker 1: it was memorize the arbitrary annoying counterintuitive.

350
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:44,797
Speaker 1: not that fun combos game It was.

351
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,710
Speaker 1: it was also the jump up and backwards while kicking most of the time game.

352
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,696
Speaker 0: Yeah that was a very important maneuver.

353
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:55,372
Speaker 0: the cross up kick but jump over a guy and then kick him in the back of the head to Start your combo.

354
00:22:55,413 --> 00:23:04,943
Speaker 1: Yep or jump backwards while kicking hopefully disrupting their attempt to jump forward around you and kick Yep, and also you can beat the single-player by just using the trip.

355
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:10,042
Speaker 0: move over and over and over again except you can like two Characters you can beat the majority of people in arcades.

356
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,610
Speaker 1: Do you hear that arcades?

357
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,550
Speaker 1: I played these games in an arc.

358
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,351
Speaker 0: This is pretty much the last triumph of the arcade was Street Fighter 2 turbo and Mortal Kombat 2.

359
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:24,590
Speaker 0: People were lining up in arcades to play these games and then the home versions came out and then the arcade died.

360
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,577
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 3 was like the last Arcade game.

361
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,285
Speaker 1: it went up like that was.

362
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:35,746
Speaker 1: I went to an arcade There was Mortal Kombat 3 then all the arcades shut down like within a month and that was it.

363
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:45,010
Speaker 1: Yep But Mortal Kombat was important primarily because it was bloody and gory for the time and it set a lot of precedents.

364
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:52,545
Speaker 1: It was the first time video games Really really really shook up pop culture and there was a lot of reaction.

365
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,949
Speaker 0: a video game should got pop culture But they didn't shake it up because of violence.

366
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:05,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they'd shaken it up for other reasons but finally they shook it up because of violence in a way that even the Like the slowest reporters figured out.

367
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,126
Speaker 1: Yep, but other than that.

368
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:12,862
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't a great game But they used models to make the game.

369
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:14,910
Speaker 1: the game, you know was motion capture and model.

370
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:19,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Street Fighter has always been you know hand-drawn art to make all the characters and such.

371
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:36,603
Speaker 0: but in Mortal Kombat 2 They used motion capture and photography and stop-motion, you know Even though it was low resolution It looked really good sort of the same way that Donkey Kong Country looked really good because the you know the way they generated all the sprites for all the characters and animations and such.

372
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:47,964
Speaker 1: but I have a picture for you of How they did that and it is both interesting and a little bit disappointing To see this totally ghetto but totally the same kind of way.

373
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:48,987
Speaker 1: I would do that sort of thing.

374
00:24:49,007 --> 00:25:00,673
Speaker 1: set up Yeah bonus points for the desk lamp taped to the candy tin that is self held up by two books And it's Goro.

375
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:01,916
Speaker 1: you get to see Goro.

376
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:02,879
Speaker 0: he has four arms.

377
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,328
Speaker 1: I hated him so I also have four arms do you?

378
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,439
Speaker 1: yeah All right.

379
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,070
Speaker 1: What do you have for me?

380
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,657
Speaker 0: So this is a video game.

381
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:14,464
Speaker 0: I can't if you can read this page.

382
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:15,890
Speaker 0: It's a Japanese language page.

383
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,345
Speaker 0: I sort of hovered over all the links looking for a download.

384
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,110
Speaker 0: I couldn't find one.

385
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,217
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's downloadable.

386
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:20,902
Speaker 0: I don't know what the deal.

387
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,010
Speaker 0: is it even real?

388
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:26,903
Speaker 0: I think it's real But I don't know how to play it or get it or what it runs on.

389
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:34,766
Speaker 0: but the game is called Symphony of the blood and I don't know why it's called Symphony of the blood as I would say aka blood symphony.

390
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:39,455
Speaker 0: what the game is right is a doujin game.

391
00:25:40,117 --> 00:26:00,916
Speaker 0: it is a Tezuka doujin game a Tezuka doujin fighting game in which there is a slew of Tezuka characters Which you can select and then play a sort of guilty gears looking kind of fighting game with so blackjack versus princess knight versus daddy First Unico.

392
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:02,281
Speaker 0: I don't see Astro boy in there.

Speaker 0: all you need.

400
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:17,210
Speaker 0: the thing of the day is just all these images in this website.

401
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:22,427
Speaker 0: it's this is a game that I want to play just because of the awesome novelty of it.

402
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,462
Speaker 0: and Yeah, that's that's about it.

403
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:32,140
Speaker 1: so Remember that sound I?

404
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,183
Speaker 0: Not until we just I just reminded me myself of it like a few minutes ago.

405
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,910
Speaker 1: that brought back a flood of memories.

406
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:44,868
Speaker 1: Green wizard needs food badly, but red warrior shot the food.

407
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:45,470
Speaker 0: you asshole.

408
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,370
Speaker 1: I remember playing gauntlet a lot.

409
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:49,795
Speaker 0: You couldn't play to win could you?

410
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,281
Speaker 0: you always said you just play to be an asshole.

411
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:57,349
Speaker 1: we we played it on the emulator At RIT or actually I think we played it on a real NES a bunch of times, too.

412
00:26:57,671 --> 00:27:01,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we had that NES that I won that gamecube version also.

413
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did, but I also had that NES that I won at Ohio con all right.

414
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,010
Speaker 0: That's why we had extra NES.

415
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:11,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had two NES as a result, but gauntlet was not a good game.

416
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:14,764
Speaker 0: Well let's talk about what gauntlet is before we talk about why it's.

417
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,230
Speaker 1: does anyone not know what gauntlet is?

418
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,330
Speaker 1: Do we really need to start every video game show about a game?

419
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,678
Speaker 1: That's more than like two years old.

420
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:21,101
Speaker 1: being like.

421
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:25,968
Speaker 1: this was a game Where you like you know Mario Brothers you walk from left to right to left.

422
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:26,913
Speaker 0: well I mean all.

423
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:28,240
Speaker 0: it was really something different.

424
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,913
Speaker 0: I mean back in the day you'd go to the arcade Just rogue.

425
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,938
Speaker 1: only it was like it was real time.

426
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,162
Speaker 0: rogue was real time.

427
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:37,432
Speaker 1: It was more real time I Guess.

428
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:41,250
Speaker 0: I think the only difference between gauntlet and rogue really is that it was less.

429
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,823
Speaker 0: it was less complex than rogue you had.

430
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:56,070
Speaker 0: you could have multiplayer and You everyone shot things you know in sort of in an action RPG Zelda kind of way Whereas in rogue you went up to next to a bad guy and pushed fight fight fight.

431
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,016
Speaker 1: Well, you can do that too.

432
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:57,862
Speaker 1: You can walk up to enemies.

433
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:58,929
Speaker 1: Just push on them to kill him.

434
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:00,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it wasn't.

435
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:02,159
Speaker 0: it wasn't you know cycle.

436
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,950
Speaker 0: You know like rogue wasn't exactly turn-based, but it was sort of cycles.

437
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:15,421
Speaker 0: It's like you know to be fight fight fight whereas in discrete units whereas in gauntlet It would be basically the cycles were constantly rolling around.

438
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:20,609
Speaker 0: you know even if you're just standing still you would just take all shit ton Of damage, I just I remember renting gauntlet.

439
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,176
Speaker 1: Fairly, I never bought gauntlet one But I'd rent it every now and then.

440
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:32,810
Speaker 1: you know every weekend my parents be like you can run one video game And I would sometimes rent the same game more than once because if you rented the wrong game you were fucked for the weekend.

441
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:36,529
Speaker 1: Yep, I rented some bad games in my time.

442
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:40,504
Speaker 1: Oh, it sucks, but gauntlet was gauntlet one at least.

443
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:48,908
Speaker 1: I remember renting it and Being fascinated with it, but at the same time Hating it say I only ever played gauntlet really in the arcades right.

444
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:58,066
Speaker 0: so gauntlet one in the arcade was something special back in its day because first of all Four people could play it at once and this was before Ninja Turtles or x-men or the Simpsons right.

445
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,269
Speaker 0: so that was a big deal.

446
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:03,042
Speaker 0: Second of all it had actual voice coming out of the machine.

447
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:04,928
Speaker 0: it would say things which is a big deal.

448
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:11,608
Speaker 0: right I mean Sinistar said things, but you know it's like very few machines had that ability to talk to.

449
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:12,594
Speaker 1: you see I never.

450
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,210
Speaker 1: gauntlet was always in the arcade.

451
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:17,750
Speaker 1: I never played it because all I could always think was I got gauntlet at home.

452
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,775
Speaker 1: It's the same stupid game.

453
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,950
Speaker 0: see I was I had was had gauntlet in the arcade before gauntlet at home.

454
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:24,782
Speaker 0: So gauntlet was at home also at home.

455
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:25,907
Speaker 0: You didn't have a four score.

456
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:30,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did Shit and remember that was gauntlet - I didn't know I didn't know anyone with the four score.

457
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,853
Speaker 1: one gauntlet one did not have the Four player at home.

458
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:37,510
Speaker 1: see there you go and - it was much shittier gauntlet - was the best that game got on the NES.

459
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:39,919
Speaker 1: But gauntlet - I had the four score.

460
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:41,786
Speaker 1: I would often play it with four people.

461
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:44,973
Speaker 0: the thing I liked about gauntlet one You know.

462
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:50,299
Speaker 0: I think the reason I played it all the arcade was sort of like the the dungeon Explory aspect of it.

463
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,446
Speaker 0: you know it's like that the sort of maze action And I always I always seem to like maze action for some reason.

464
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,043
Speaker 1: you know it was weird As a kid when I didn't really understand how this stuff worked.

465
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:10,459
Speaker 1: I remember playing gauntlet and thinking that The maps were so poorly put together and so glitchy and so crappy That I didn't feel like I was exploring anything.

466
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,149
Speaker 1: I felt like it was a race against the game glitching me to death.

467
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:15,517
Speaker 0: That's sort of true.

468
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:22,390
Speaker 1: the arcade was a little less glitch than the NES Especially gauntlet 2 where as far as I could tell you get five or six levels in and then it would just be random.

469
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,602
Speaker 0: Bullshit it was random.

470
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,390
Speaker 0: We just looked that up.

471
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, but eventually you hit a level where there's just like you just couldn't win.

472
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,774
Speaker 1: I just beat like I'd start and there's walls around me and no secrets And then I would die.

473
00:30:32,854 --> 00:30:34,240
Speaker 0: well the thing the thing about gauntlet.

474
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:43,333
Speaker 0: right the reason it was primarily an arcade game is because Basically you had health and as you played even if you didn't fight any bad guys You just stood still.

475
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:48,250
Speaker 0: your health was constantly going down, and you could put in quarters to make your health go up.

476
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,850
Speaker 0: It was the ultimate quarter munching designed game.

477
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:57,080
Speaker 0: It's like if you're playing Zelda and your hearts always went down And you can make him go up by putting in a quarter.

478
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:00,737
Speaker 0: the only other way to make him go up was by touching food But there was always a risk.

479
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,165
Speaker 0: the food would get shot.

480
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:13,872
Speaker 1: of course that Aspect of it was what made it great at home and in the arcade because you'd play for a while And you know you'd be trying to succeed, but eventually you'd get to that point where Even

481
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:24,410
Speaker 0: if you're playing perfectly and killing all the bad guys and getting all the treasures There's not enough food to just as to keep you alive And it takes time to play it and your health goes down.

482
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,896
Speaker 0: But eventually you're gonna die.

483
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:28,810
Speaker 1: eventually warrior takes the food that wizard needed to survive.

484
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:35,350
Speaker 1: So wizard doesn't save warrior from death and then warrior pushes wizard into the next three deaths.

485
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:36,901
Speaker 1: Then wizard dies.

486
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:37,969
Speaker 1: then warrior dies.

487
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like rim.

488
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:41,985
Speaker 0: It's if you don't try to win.

489
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:42,769
Speaker 0: That's what happens.

490
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,064
Speaker 1: Well the thing is Scott always wanted to play the wizard the wussy-ass wizard

491
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:53,182
Speaker 0: because the wizard had could shoot And if the wizard used the magic he cleared out a lot more bad guys, but

492
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:58,415
Speaker 1: the warrior was so strong and while he was slower Warrior could always push the wizard.

493
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,445
Speaker 1: so we'd play for like a half hour at RIT.

494
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:02,047
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

495
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,030
Speaker 0: that was bullshit, right?

496
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,877
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

497
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,209
Speaker 0: The warrior is strong.

498
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,636
Speaker 0: He's always strong.

499
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:07,077
Speaker 0: right?

500
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,210
Speaker 0: you have the Wizards net the Warriors never in a bad situation.

501
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,990
Speaker 1: The the wizard can be in a bad situation.

502
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:18,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the wizard has this magic that's wicked powerful and is the only way to get rid of death if he shows up.

503
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:28,170
Speaker 0: but if The Grim Reaper, I'm sorry, but if the you only can cast a magic spell if you have a potion wasn't it?

504
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:29,479
Speaker 1: I thought it was just called death.

505
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:30,547
Speaker 0: I don't know.

506
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:36,010
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter I'm pretty sure it was called but if you get the potion well it was called it and death was called death.

507
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,528
Speaker 0: Yes, if you use up all your potions the wizard is completely useless because he's now just sort of.

508
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,993
Speaker 0: you know Does that magic?

509
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:47,490
Speaker 0: so if death shows up and you don't have any potions you did it to run away?

510
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,740
Speaker 1: I just remember this one time Scott and I were playing.

511
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,490
Speaker 1: no one else wanted to play because I had a four score.

512
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,117
Speaker 1: I haven't brought it to RIT.

513
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,483
Speaker 1: We just didn't really use it.

514
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,427
Speaker 0: I don't remember seeing it.

515
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:56,150
Speaker 1: It was there.

516
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,495
Speaker 1: I've got it around the house somewhere.

517
00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:58,237
Speaker 0: I've never seen it.

518
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:00,344
Speaker 1: I owned every four score game.

519
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:01,950
Speaker 0: I've never seen this four score.

520
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:05,810
Speaker 1: Anyway, they were almost all terrible except for the racing game.

521
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,530
Speaker 1: Yep, but you know we were playing for like a half hour 20.

522
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,235
Speaker 1: I forget exactly how.

523
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,730
Speaker 0: the four score for the original Gameboy.

524
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:20,530
Speaker 1: No, I remember I never knew anyone when I was young who was cool who owned a Gameboy other than me one time.

525
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,273
Speaker 1: Everyone owned.

526
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:29,848
Speaker 0: one time when I was on a field trip in elementary school Someone had the Gameboy four player and they're playing that f1 game.

527
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,750
Speaker 1: See I was desperate.

528
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:36,646
Speaker 1: I was desperate for most of my childhood to find anyone cool.

529
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:53,804
Speaker 1: and by cool I define that as anyone who owned either a combination of a Gameboy and hunt for the red October and the link cable or Crystal warriors a game gear and the link cable because those games both had awesome Multiplayer that I never in my life was able to play.

530
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,675
Speaker 0: not once not eat Your brother get another one.

531
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:59,864
Speaker 1: and then we had one Gameboy and one game gear.

532
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,830
Speaker 0: in my household get another Gameboy.

533
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:03,038
Speaker 1: We didn't have money.

534
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,869
Speaker 1: I was I was in like middle school.

535
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,946
Speaker 0: You could have gotten two game boys instead of the game gear.

536
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:08,815
Speaker 1: now We wanted the game gear more.

537
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:12,850
Speaker 1: we got the game boy later two game gears then now because we couldn't afford two game gears.

538
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,438
Speaker 1: Anyway, plus we had all right.

539
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,248
Speaker 1: I did not realize that hunt for the red October would exist.

540
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:25,330
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, but at one point we're walking and Scott's behind me and this death is chasing us.

541
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,538
Speaker 1: we don't have any potions and I'm like he.

542
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:34,483
Speaker 1: Scott's like go go go, but I'm slower than him and He starts to go around me to leave me to my fate with death.

543
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:35,626
Speaker 1: and I realized wait a minute.

544
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:38,010
Speaker 1: Wait a minute I'm a warrior.

545
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:45,083
Speaker 1: so I stood in the middle wouldn't let him get past me and Waited for death sweet death to eat itself on Scott.

546
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:46,889
Speaker 0: and then we continued and there was nowhere to run.

547
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:51,710
Speaker 1: And then for the next five minutes I proceeded to push Scott into every death we came across.

548
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, for some reason the warrior can push the wizard and the wizard can't push back.

549
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,685
Speaker 0: So if there wasn't like a place to run away to I really had no choice.

550
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:04,120
Speaker 0: and where I went and if I didn't have Any magic death would always come and get me.

551
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,190
Speaker 1: the game was basically green wizard needs food badly.

552
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,576
Speaker 1: Red warrior shot the food.

553
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:09,762
Speaker 1: red warrior shot the food.

554
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:11,350
Speaker 1: green wizard is about to die.

555
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,329
Speaker 1: Red warrior shot the food.

556
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,735
Speaker 0: You Couldn't play to win could you?

557
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:19,481
Speaker 1: ah, there's no way to win.

558
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,424
Speaker 1: that game goes on forever.

559
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,467
Speaker 1: It goes on forever.

560
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,816
Speaker 0: Yes, the other gauntlets are beautiful.

561
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:24,719
Speaker 1: call it one.

562
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,888
Speaker 1: You can actually beat go online.

563
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:31,360
Speaker 1: Look on YouTube You'll see what it ends with and let me tell you that is not worth it.

564
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:32,303
Speaker 1: Good God.

565
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:41,250
Speaker 0: No, but actually in the arcade When you know later on think there was a gauntlet legends in the arcade was actually a 3d gauntlet game.

566
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,545
Speaker 0: The game was itself wasn't 3d.

567
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,054
Speaker 0: It's still played 2d But 3d graphics.

568
00:35:45,094 --> 00:35:52,070
Speaker 1: that game had all the character model all the lack of fun of the original gauntlet But without any of the charm and with added complexity.

569
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:55,986
Speaker 0: Well, it was weird cuz like I played in the arcade and for some reason it was fun.

570
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:56,869
Speaker 0: then, you know.

571
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,909
Speaker 0: And the thing was in the arcade you could save your game.

572
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:04,990
Speaker 0: So I saved my game on the local arcade machine and I would go back and I would play it every once in a while.

573
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:05,969
Speaker 0: There would up my guy.

574
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:08,010
Speaker 0: I remember this was level up and stuff.

575
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,854
Speaker 1: That was before.

576
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:12,770
Speaker 1: games like initial D were really available where you had like cards or something you could save.

577
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, this you just put in your initials and it loaded up a game.

578
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:17,284
Speaker 1: a bunch of game.

579
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:18,909
Speaker 1: police 9-1-1 had that dude, isn't it?

580
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,113
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

581
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,239
Speaker 1: maybe that was later though.

582
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,529
Speaker 1: But anyway, I Forgot where I was going with now.

583
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,170
Speaker 0: So then we got this gauntlet legends the same game for the n64 and that had four controllers.

584
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,737
Speaker 0: so me and my brother and two friends.

585
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:34,149
Speaker 0: we'd always play that and it was like wicked fun.

586
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:42,846
Speaker 0: and Then so when I got the GameCube at RIT, I bought gauntlet, you know The next gauntlet for the GameCube and for some reason it wasn't fun anymore.

587
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:43,689
Speaker 0: No one wanted to play it.

588
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:45,669
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was.

589
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,748
Speaker 0: You wanted to play it with people cuz I remembered having such good times with it in high school on the on the n64.

590
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,730
Speaker 0: So I figured well, I'll have the same good times in the GameCube.

591
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,674
Speaker 1: Well, I remember you were like.

592
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:56,137
Speaker 1: I got it.

593
00:36:56,177 --> 00:37:06,053
Speaker 1: I was like, okay and we sat down to play it and five minutes later I realized that all I was doing was holding right and a at the same time and occasionally I would hold up an Robotron controls.

594
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,945
Speaker 0: so you're shooting with one stick and moving with the other.

595
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,170
Speaker 1: didn't matter at all.

596
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:11,701
Speaker 1: You basically just walked in shot.

597
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:12,385
Speaker 1: There was no puzzle.

598
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:12,909
Speaker 1: There was nothing.

599
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:13,832
Speaker 0: Oh, there were.

600
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:14,514
Speaker 0: there were puzzles.

601
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:15,056
Speaker 0: at least.

602
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:22,182
Speaker 1: the original gauntlet was so crappy just due to the limitations of the technology that you forgave It for the fact that it was basically not a game.

603
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:29,950
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah now I sort of realized, you know the badness of gauntlet and it's hard to play it now.

604
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:37,236
Speaker 1: I was into the arcade game though for a little while at RIT because when we first got to RIT I remember they they had a night.

605
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,220
Speaker 1: the arcade was free.

606
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:47,453
Speaker 1: You could go in swipe your card and get infinite tokens Mmm, so I got infinite tokens and I. we kept playing gauntlet and I saved my game and I was leveling up and doing all that stuff.

607
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:56,498
Speaker 1: and one day like a week later I went into the arcade and I swept my card and I saw that it had debited money from my flex account And I was like what?

608
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,530
Speaker 1: and I went up to the guy and he's like, why did this take money from me?

609
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,018
Speaker 1: He was like you thought free play would last forever.

610
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I never played gauntlet again.

611
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:11,320
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it was basically worth zero to me Words, but if it's zero you'll play.

612
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,983
Speaker 0: of course.

613
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:12,948
Speaker 1: that was that not anymore.

614
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:17,470
Speaker 1: back then I would remember RIT was the time in our lives when we had infinite free time, but no money.

615
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,110
Speaker 1: Yeah now I have infinite money, but no free time.

616
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:30,550
Speaker 0: It's strange now that I'm beginning to see like the connection between games like rogue net hack Right gauntlet and Diablo and they're all sort of like these similar games.

617
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:42,309
Speaker 0: It's all about there's a dungeon you're exploring the dungeon right and you're simultaneously fighting the bad guys and that's real and getting treasure and that's and the sort of amazed to it.

618
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:49,470
Speaker 0: and It's weird because it's like, you know, you think the D&D based game is more like the MMO style, right?

619
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:58,619
Speaker 0: But it's strange how the D&D the fundamentals of D&D sort of diverged into like these sort of different Gameplay types in the video game area.

620
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,870
Speaker 1: Well, I mean remember the Dungeons & Dragons arcade game.

621
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,549
Speaker 0: Well, that was just a side scroll and beat him up.

622
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had some elements of D&D.

623
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,270
Speaker 1: that game was actually for its time kind of awesome.

624
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,638
Speaker 0: Yes, it was an alright game.

625
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,409
Speaker 0: You had some decisions to make of where to go.

626
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,536
Speaker 0: Yeah you had lots of items you could use.

627
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:17,988
Speaker 0: you could turn on dead infinity times and it was awesome.

628
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:26,319
Speaker 0: and you could Get secret doors if you have opened them up and it required some modicum of teamwork Some You had to set the troll on fire.

629
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:28,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't a great game, but it was better than gauntlet.

630
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was at least really entertaining.

631
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,588
Speaker 0: I remember playing that one at the movie theater a lot.

632
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,138
Speaker 1: Yep I remember oh my god.

633
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:46,025
Speaker 1: after a science Olympiad competition Yeah I was in like seventh grade and we stopped at this pizza joint on the way home the whole team and they had the D&D Machine the it was the cocktail cabinet version.

634
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,275
Speaker 0: Oh, wow I've never seen such a thing.

635
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:52,670
Speaker 1: so us kids stayed there for two hours to the chagrin of our parents who wouldn't you know?

636
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,261
Speaker 1: We could they couldn't make us leave and we took turns and we were almost at the end of the game and Someone I ran out of money.

637
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,248
Speaker 1: I won't say who?

638
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:08,969
Speaker 1: Someone it was me bumped into the power cable That was actually barely plugged in but none of us noticed the whole time.

639
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,785
Speaker 1: It's how I was playing and I kind of bumped into with my foot and it fell out and the game stopped.

640
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:18,128
Speaker 1: and there was this silence followed by a cry that I've never heard since.

641
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,760
Speaker 0: That's a good start.

642
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:21,630
Speaker 1: No one knew it was me.

643
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,270
Speaker 0: I never fessed up, you know, that would be a lot worse if it was a gauntlet game.

644
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,923
Speaker 0: We're like level 200 something.

645
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:32,526
Speaker 1: Oh my god Man, there's that YouTube video of a perfect score run of gauntlet 2.

646
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:43,423
Speaker 1: Wow I watched the end of part 23 of Mmm, I also found a question someone asked online of does gauntlet 2 end?

647
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,108
Speaker 1: and no one answered it.

648
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:51,990
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, I don't know gauntlet is strange and that it has some things that like were invented in gauntlet that were really good.

649
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:54,460
Speaker 0: I mean like the bad guys spigot.

650
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:56,690
Speaker 0: they sort of invented that in gauntlet.

651
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:01,151
Speaker 1: Yep, and the game just for you know for a young kid in that era of game It was.

652
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:05,289
Speaker 1: it was a game that could only exist in the form it did in the era that it did.

653
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:13,310
Speaker 1: but at the same time games that are Fundamentally the same but just have basically they add a bunch of fluff on top of what is basically just gauntlet.

654
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:19,556
Speaker 0: Can't tell you how many times a new game comes out and I'm like, oh that's just gauntlet You know, it is like.

655
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:20,239
Speaker 1: it's not even like.

656
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,726
Speaker 1: oh you're just saying that it's just like.

657
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,781
Speaker 0: the only difference I mean Diablo and gauntlet.

658
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:24,770
Speaker 0: is that Diablo?

659
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,077
Speaker 0: Doesn't have the robotron control style.

660
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:32,269
Speaker 0: It has the click on the bad guy a whole bunch of times control style.

661
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:33,655
Speaker 0: That's really the only difference.

662
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:36,146
Speaker 1: gauntlet 4 even had going to town and buy shit.

663
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:47,852
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but gauntlet also had a little bit of that four swords element Especially gauntlet 2 because every now and then a level would start and it would say things like your shots hurt the other players Wink wink.

664
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:53,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like if a power-up was there only one person could get it plus the brilliance of it.

665
00:41:54,193 --> 00:42:03,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was sort of like this really unpolished, you know, I mean Basically, you know, there's the new Mario game coming out for the the Wii that they're all pushing now, right?

666
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,309
Speaker 0: That's gonna that they promoted big at e3 for Mario's.

667
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:12,434
Speaker 0: They're talking all about you know, the competitive cooperative where you're cooperating to beat the game But you're also competing.

668
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:16,330
Speaker 0: now see which of you is better than the other never mind the fact that Nintendo.

669
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:22,870
Speaker 0: They're acting like they just invented it But even though they invented it with four swords and crystal chronicles and crystal chronicles, right?

670
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,288
Speaker 0: And well crystal chronicles didn't really have the competitive part.

671
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:31,466
Speaker 1: Yes Cooperative it had the competitive part in that everyone had their goal their secret goal.

672
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:32,109
Speaker 0: All right.

673
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:32,470
Speaker 0: You're right.

674
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and you got items based on that at the end of every mission.

675
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know gauntlet sort of had that only unpolished, you know.

676
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:49,030
Speaker 0: in that, you know You were cooperating to beat the game but you're competing, you know yet score first of all who got the high score and You wanted to get more food.

677
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,409
Speaker 0: You wanted to take food away from other people's that you know You would live longer and have to pay less quarters and death would come.

678
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did.

679
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,735
Speaker 1: if you didn't have potions Someone was getting it.

680
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:05,630
Speaker 0: Someone was taking one for you want that to be someone else and not you And if someone else is gonna grab the food shoot that food.

681
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:11,310
Speaker 0: You don't want them to eat the food because then they're basically getting free money in terms of quarters.

682
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:14,716
Speaker 0: Exactly.

683
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:18,932
Speaker 0: and that's you know, what gauntlet was about Wasn't I?

684
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:19,995
Speaker 1: just I don't know.

685
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:26,562
Speaker 1: the game is really at the core of a lot of popular games today and I That you know, it's not like.

686
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:27,430
Speaker 1: I've realized this now.

687
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:36,460
Speaker 1: I've always realized this but the reason I'm so disillusioned with a lot of gaming today And the reason I look at a lot of new games and like I play five minutes I'm immediately done with them.

688
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:42,830
Speaker 1: Just can't enjoy them at all Is that almost every game that comes out is at its core identical to a game?

689
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,162
Speaker 1: I already played the fullness of when I was like 11.

690
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:48,070
Speaker 0: Yep, and gauntlet is off in that game.

691
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:54,446
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean just try to name some of the games that are basically gauntlet World of Warcraft.

692
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:59,440
Speaker 1: Oh No World of Warcraft is beyond that World of Warcraft.

693
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely mud, you know, it's sort of like, you know They're all these sort of things that evolved from the D&D based video.

694
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:10,090
Speaker 1: Look muds were stateful gauntlet was stateless.

695
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:11,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, the muds.

696
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:11,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mud.

697
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:16,503
Speaker 0: you had the mud Jenner you had the mud Genre, you had the gauntlet genre.

698
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:22,710
Speaker 0: you had the sort of Dungeon master gold box kind of genre in another direction, you know.

699
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:30,219
Speaker 0: They're all these sort of different kinds of play styles that came out of the D&D Idea and gauntlet is just one of those.

700
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:30,299
Speaker 0: Yep.

701
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,967
Speaker 1: I don't know.

702
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:32,650
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

703
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:36,790
Speaker 1: I don't know what else I can say about gauntlet other than green wizard shot the food.

704
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:40,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, that voice was so awesome when I was a kid coming out of my NES.

705
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,150
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like even though the game is bad that voice is still famous.

706
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,557
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's like you think about it.

707
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:54,219
Speaker 0: back in the day so few games had digitized voice and those that did Anything that the digitized voice said became famous.

708
00:44:54,299 --> 00:45:00,775
Speaker 0: I mean everything sinistar said is fun run run run Castle to stay alive.

709
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:06,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean job red commander any video game from that era that talked because so few of them talked.

710
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,917
Speaker 0: Everything it said became like a famous quote.

711
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:17,050
Speaker 1: I remember when I buy now video games like full voice acting and I Remember when I bought tie fighter.

712
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:28,149
Speaker 1: I didn't even have x-wing but it was the first like big iron Computer game that I bought as opposed to pirated Yeah, and I also didn't have a working sound card for a long time up until that point.

713
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:32,924
Speaker 1: So I got tie fighter and that MIDI of star wars starts playing.

714
00:45:33,305 --> 00:45:35,439
Speaker 1: I'm thinking like yeah, this is awesome This is awesome.

715
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,069
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

716
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:46,449
Speaker 1: And then Darth Vader looks at me and says signal vice admiral thon thron to have his tie squadron sent immediately And I was like, oh my god, it talked.

717
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:51,087
Speaker 1: That game talking was like the biggest thing ever.

718
00:45:51,147 --> 00:46:02,520
Speaker 1: and now You know one thing I can say to the voice acting and a lot of early games was a lot better than the voice acting now Tie fighter sounded exactly like people in Star Wars.

719
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:07,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying I'm talking about things like wing commander Which is bad acting period yeah.

720
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:08,139
Speaker 1: Yeah.

721
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,650
