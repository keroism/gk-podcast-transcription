1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,149
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 3rd, 2019.

2
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:10,330
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:12,920
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, back from a long hiatus.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,820
Speaker 1: We are talking about the remake of The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,438
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:28,980
Speaker 1: So in true fashion, we always have hiatus around this time of year.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,420
Speaker 1: But we had a longer hiatus than usual because I had that two week trip to Asia that I hadn't actually planned for.

9
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:40,900
Speaker 1: Usually when I had the old job way back, I flew around a lot, but I kind of picked when I traveled.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,820
Speaker 1: So I tended to avoid doing those kinds of trips at the same time as our usual Geek Nights holiday hiatus.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,680
Speaker 1: So I basically disappeared for two weeks, and then we've got a bunch of conventions.

12
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:54,839
Speaker 1: We're not going to do a show on Thursday because we're going to be at PAX.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,900
Speaker 0: Save it for the meta moment.

14
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:58,229
Speaker 1: No, meta moment.

15
00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,419
Speaker 1: We'll talk about what we're doing at PAX.

16
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:03,680
Speaker 1: But we're back after almost, but not quite a month.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,100
Speaker 1: So we're going to blow all our opening bits and all the anecdotes and forget everything after that.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,516
Speaker 0: I mean, we've already forgotten all the ones because we had another PAX time hiatus.

19
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,810
Speaker 0: And we came back from it.

20
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:16,898
Speaker 0: We're like, "Yeah, I haven't done a show in a

21
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:17,099
Speaker 0: while.".

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,237
Speaker 0: We forgot all this stuff.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,040
Speaker 0: We're going to blow our load and forget everything, and all that stuff has already been forgotten.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,960
Speaker 1: If I eat a good sandwich over the weekend, that's what I talk about on the next Monday's show.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Speaker 1: But if I take a month off, I might fall in a volcano.

26
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:33,920
Speaker 0: I don't remember that sandwich.

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,855
Speaker 1: Escape some terrorists, and then eat a sandwich.

28
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:37,620
Speaker 1: that's pretty good.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,600
Speaker 1: And then when I do the show, the sandwich is the last thing I did.

30
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,579
Speaker 1: So that's what I'm going to remember.

31
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:46,251
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's good to be back.

32
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,219
Speaker 1: I miss doing this.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Speaker 1: And I was way too tired and lazy to do it on the trip.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,700
Speaker 1: So I guess the only notable anecdote from my trip is I actually went to two places I've never been before.

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,702
Speaker 0: Shocking.

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,988
Speaker 0: This is a giant world.

37
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,620
Speaker 0: I feel like it's pretty easy to go to two places you haven't been before.

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when it's work sending you to places, especially in global finance, there's a short list of places that someone like me needs to go on a regular basis.

39
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:12,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly cities.

40
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:14,440
Speaker 0: You're not going to be going to the woods.

41
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,539
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of finance in the woods.

42
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:17,580
Speaker 1: I've been to London.

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,920
Speaker 0: You're only going to go to cities, and not every major city even has a stock market.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,820
Speaker 0: So you're only going to go to places with markets and financial companies.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are only 88 exchanges in all of Asia.

46
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,300
Speaker 1: There aren't that many exchanges.

47
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:40,039
Speaker 0: Right, so you look around the world, even if you go to some place that has a ton of countries and a ton of big cities, the big exchanges are all here, here, and here.

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,139
Speaker 0: All the financial companies put themselves in these few cities, and all those other big cities might be focusing on other industries, and I don't need to go there.

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also when I used to go to Australia all the time, I'd mostly go to Sydney.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:03:00,100
Speaker 1: I had no excuse to go to Melbourne, but this time I got to go to Melbourne too, which was nostalgic, because I ate dinner where I could actually see the PAX building, and I was thinking back to those old...

51
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,140
Speaker 0: It's the PAX building?

52
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:01,538
Speaker 0: Yeah.

53
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,400
Speaker 0: It's the Melbourne Convention Center.

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,440
Speaker 1: I've never been in that building except for PAX, and I will never go to that building except for PAX, I suspect.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,140
Speaker 1: But I got to go to the Philippines, where I've never been to before, and I had a few days to just fuck around in Manila.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,117
Speaker 0: Which Philippines was it?

57
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:16,357
Speaker 1: Manila.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,118
Speaker 0: The main one.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one.

60
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:18,558
Speaker 0: The main one.

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,090
Speaker 1: But Manila was pretty interesting.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,280
Speaker 0: It was a thriller.

63
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,568
Speaker 1: There's a thing there.

64
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:28,020
Speaker 1: The problem with Manila is it's so dense, like denser than New York.

65
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,739
Speaker 1: So many people live there.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Speaker 1: The downtown is really like a normal city, but the commute... Take the LA commute in terms of just cars and traffic in Nightmareland.

67
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,199
Speaker 1: Make it literally four to ten times worse.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,094
Speaker 0: Why aren't people just walking?

69
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:45,660
Speaker 0: if it's so small?

70
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:47,010
Speaker 1: Because it's not.

71
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,719
Speaker 1: It's actually huge.

72
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:48,330
Speaker 0: Okay.

73
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,820
Speaker 1: It's dense and sprawling.

74
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:52,680
Speaker 1: It's a huge city.

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,899
Speaker 0: Doesn't sound like if it's dense, I should be really close to work.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,560
Speaker 1: No, imagine if Manhattan were like ten times bigger space-wise, but just as dense as Manhattan.

77
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:01,840
Speaker 1: It's nuts.

78
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,320
Speaker 1: So my hotel was like four miles away out of like Makata or Makati.

79
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,060
Speaker 1: I have terrible Filipino pronunciation.

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
Speaker 0: You mean Tagalog?

81
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:14,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

82
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,520
Speaker 0: Isn't that the language?

83
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would take me maybe like 15 minutes to like ride in a cab or like take a jeepney or something.

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,695
Speaker 1: Except during rush hour when it took like an hour or two, maybe three.

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,100
Speaker 1: So I literally like one day after work, I was like fuck this.

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,679
Speaker 1: So I just went to a restaurant for like two hours and I came out and traffic had not changed at all.

87
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:44,060
Speaker 1: And Bangkok is the other place I've never been to Thailand.

88
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,040
Speaker 1: I avoided insulting the king.

89
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,979
Speaker 1: Looks like they have a new king.

90
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:51,560
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about Thailand, but the one thing I can say is...

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,340
Speaker 0: The things I know about Thailand are a mixed bag.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,300
Speaker 0: I know some really positive things about Thailand and some really negative things.

93
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,619
Speaker 1: There's also, depending on where you go in Thailand, there are very...

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,758
Speaker 0: A lot of unknown things.

95
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,759
Speaker 1: Very different situations going on.

96
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:04,497
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are.

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,540
Speaker 1: But I only got a couple days in Bangkok and unfortunately I was with some coworkers who basically hate food as far as I can tell.

98
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,168
Speaker 0: But isn't Thailand like?

99
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,340
Speaker 0: the number one thing that I would go there for is the street food?

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I wanted was the food.

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,780
Speaker 0: The street food in Thailand is famous.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I wanted was that food.

103
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:33,520
Speaker 1: Now on one hand, I was told by all the security people and everyone that that street food is great, but you better be up to date on all the hepatitis shots or you will get hepatitis.

104
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:33,999
Speaker 0: I got 'em.

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,177
Speaker 1: Yep, I got 'em too.

106
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,340
Speaker 0: Are people in Thailand getting hepatitis?

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, hepatitis is like crazy endemic and it's mostly food.

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 0: You ship them some hepatitis vaccines.

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,560
Speaker 1: Well, not all hepatitis have vaccines.

110
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:45,850
Speaker 0: Oh.

111
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,160
Speaker 1: And it's a real danger in Bangkok.

112
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,500
Speaker 0: Alright, I'll stick to the hot foods.

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:50,831
Speaker 1: Yep.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,300
Speaker 1: Also, even though it's a really modern, normal city, you can't drink the water there either.

115
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,360
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of places you can drink the water.

116
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:56,694
Speaker 0: I know.

117
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,838
Speaker 0: That's why I live in New York.

118
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,431
Speaker 1: Yep.

119
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,980
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not even super much a fan of the water too far upstate New York.

120
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,320
Speaker 0: I mean, even New Jersey, you can't drink that shit.

121
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:18,960
Speaker 1: Yep, but the other thing was I was in Singapore, but I've been to Singapore a ton of times, like eight or nine times, but I'd never been there over a weekend where I could just fuck around, and I was just there.

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,100
Speaker 0: Well, you don't want to fuck around too much.

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, fuck around in the fun way.

124
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,160
Speaker 1: I wasn't spitting gum or smuggling drugs or anything.

125
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,229
Speaker 1: But I went to a whole bunch of cool places.

126
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,559
Speaker 1: I'd never been, and I even went to Universal Studios there because it was near- They even have one?

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really small.

128
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:34,998
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

129
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,256
Speaker 0: I was like, "How many of those are

130
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:36,399
Speaker 0: there?".

131
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,159
Speaker 1: So the best part about Universal Studios- No one's there.

132
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,240
Speaker 0: In Singapore- You're all alone.

133
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,040
Speaker 1: You can just enjoy- Is that they have a New Yorkland.

134
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,360
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

135
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,680
Speaker 0: What was the New Yorkland like?

136
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:49,680
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

137
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,040
Speaker 1: I've got to even pull up these photos.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 1: I'll make this my thing of the day instead.

139
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 1: It is like a grimy New York.

140
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,760
Speaker 1: They've got a fake New York Public Library.

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
Speaker 1: They've got a fake Empire State Building.

142
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,759
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,018
Speaker 0: We should make a fake Singapore.

144
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,380
Speaker 1: It's got all these really complicated no parking signs everywhere.

145
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:09,260
Speaker 1: It is absolutely amazing to see this place.

146
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,037
Speaker 0: How accurate was it?

147
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,860
Speaker 1: Actually, really accurate for my sensibilities.

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,339
Speaker 0: Was it made by someone who saw a movie of New York, or was it made by someone who had been in New York?

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,760
Speaker 1: So they got just all over, there's just these grubby- That looks like old New York.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,779
Speaker 1: It is old New York.

151
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,820
Speaker 1: Grubby parking signs.

152
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,440
Speaker 1: They got the New York Public Library and the Lions.

153
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,200
Speaker 1: It's a smaller scale, but it's pretty accurate.

154
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,359
Speaker 1: Empire State Building facade, signs and stuff.

155
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:36,390
Speaker 0: There's a roof on it, but- Yeah.

156
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,460
Speaker 1: Well, the roof is not a real roof.

157
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,180
Speaker 1: That's just a sunshade because you'll die otherwise.

158
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,112
Speaker 1: It was like 100 degrees.

159
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:53,660
Speaker 1: The only weird thing was the entertainment in New York land is like mid-80s hip hop and breakdancing.

160
00:07:55,801 --> 00:08:01,700
Speaker 1: So that is the musical act in New York land, but otherwise the setting is just very New York.

161
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:02,460
Speaker 0: Okay.

162
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,160
Speaker 1: So that was interesting.

163
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,519
Speaker 1: And of course I went mountain biking again and I only injured myself minorly.

164
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:09,218
Speaker 0: Only minorly.

165
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I took two- My coworkers today were like, "Let's go on a ski

166
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:12,960
Speaker 0: trip.".

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,369
Speaker 0: I'm like,

168
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,594
Speaker 0: "Nope.".

169
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:13,982
Speaker 1: Why?

170
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:14,958
Speaker 1: Skiing's way safe.

171
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

172
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,900
Speaker 1: Compared to mountain biking.

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,900
Speaker 0: It's also, not only is it unsafe, it is cold and wet, which is even worse than being unsafe.

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, so for the first time in my life I was defeated by heat.

175
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,060
Speaker 1: It was 99 degrees when I was mountain biking.

176
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,597
Speaker 0: That sounds good.

177
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:32,799
Speaker 1: So I was biking hard uphill significantly over a very rough terrain.

178
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:34,849
Speaker 1: It was like 100% humidity.

179
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,840
Speaker 1: My body ran out of water despite drinking infinite amounts of water and- You need some salt.

180
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had all my kit.

181
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,740
Speaker 1: I was good on that front, but I was unable to complete the second half of the course at speed because it was too hot for me to continue exerting myself without taking long breaks.

182
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 0: Your problem is exerting yourself instead of chilling.

183
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:57,420
Speaker 1: You can't chill on a mountain bike trail.

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,000
Speaker 1: Chilling on a mountain bike trail is a recipe for flipping over your handlebars.

185
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:02,079
Speaker 0: Just go nice and slow.

186
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:02,349
Speaker 0: Nope.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Speaker 1: You've got to get above a certain minimum speed over rough terrain or you're going to have a bad time.

188
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,819
Speaker 0: Alright, well then don't do that.

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,899
Speaker 1: Or do it because it's awesome.

190
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,558
Speaker 0: Stay on roads.

191
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,418
Speaker 0: Nice and safe.

192
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,229
Speaker 1: Yeah?

193
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:12,919
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm back.

194
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,920
Speaker 0: Go back to New York land.

195
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,620
Speaker 1: The worst thing though was I was in this whole trip all over the world.

196
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,020
Speaker 1: There was like 100 degrees everywhere.

197
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 1: I finally fly back home and I get to JFK and- Yeah, I didn't bring a coat or anything.

198
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,100
Speaker 1: And when I left New York, I wasn't that cold yet.

199
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,480
Speaker 1: So I get off the plane, carry on the whole way.

200
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:33,960
Speaker 1: I'm like right through customs.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,480
Speaker 1: I walk straight for that taxi line because it's way early in the morning and the air train would have taken like almost two hours.

202
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,940
Speaker 1: And I walk outside and it's cold.

203
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,910
Speaker 1: And I instinctually said, "Oh

204
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:45,756
Speaker 1: fuck!"

205
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,219
Speaker 1: Like flinched a little bit.

206
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,700
Speaker 1: And this dude was standing there.

207
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,679
Speaker 1: I think he was a cabbie or something just like hanging out.

208
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:54,879
Speaker 1: And he looks at me and he just starts laughing.

209
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,499
Speaker 0: I forget who it was.

210
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,380
Speaker 0: There was a famous story of a basketball player.

211
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,360
Speaker 0: I think they were from... What country were they from?

212
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,698
Speaker 0: I forget.

213
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,573
Speaker 0: But they came to play in the U.S.

214
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:08,318
Speaker 0: Right?

215
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,694
Speaker 0: You know they did from some country.

216
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,520
Speaker 0: So I think it was Africa.

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,799
Speaker 0: They came over and they were like, "Oh yeah, there's a few

218
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:17,000
Speaker 0: colleges.".

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Speaker 0: Because they were coming over to play college basketball.

220
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,759
Speaker 0: They were like, "Here's a few colleges to choose from.

221
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:21,731
Speaker 0: You can go to St.

222
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:22,359
Speaker 0: John's.

223
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,637
Speaker 0: We'll take you to somewhere maybe... I forget.

224
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,540
Speaker 0: I think it might have been Kentucky or something.

225
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,162
Speaker 0: And

226
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:27,454
Speaker 0: Houston.".

227
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,377
Speaker 0: And the guy was like, "I think you'll like Houston,

228
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:29,559
Speaker 0: right?".

229
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,040
Speaker 0: Alright.

230
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,897
Speaker 0: Guy gets off.

231
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,600
Speaker 0: You know, this kid is going to go to play college basketball.

232
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,518
Speaker 0: Gets off the plane in New York.

233
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,478
Speaker 0: Feels a cold breeze.

234
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,220
Speaker 0: Turns right around and says, "I want to change my flight.

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,663
Speaker 0: Take me to

236
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:41,946
Speaker 0: Houston.".

237
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:49,499
Speaker 1: So there is a ton of gaming news and we skipped most of it.

238
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:54,200
Speaker 1: I'm sure some of the things that we're not going to talk about will come back when there's further news.

239
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,960
Speaker 0: Seems like most of the stuff that happened since we podcasted was like Pokemon related.

240
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,799
Speaker 0: Which I'm playing somewhat.

241
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might be just the over-representation of Pokemon on my social media feeds though.

242
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:05,660
Speaker 1: And among our friend groups.

243
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,020
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the game right now.

244
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Speaker 0: I think also like Shenmue 3 came out.

245
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:09,939
Speaker 0: Don't care.

246
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,205
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,260
Speaker 0: And what other games are hot right now?

248
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,960
Speaker 0: There was a Half-Life prequel VR whatever.

249
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,957
Speaker 1: I'm pretty into that.

250
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:18,519
Speaker 1: I'm excited about that.

251
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:20,178
Speaker 0: I don't know any other games that came out.

252
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,900
Speaker 1: Because we're planning to do some VR development.

253
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,880
Speaker 0: Someone screaming and yelling some important game.

254
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:25,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever kid.

255
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:28,320
Speaker 1: We picked up, we have an Oculus Quest now.

256
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,560
Speaker 1: The one that's completely wireless.

257
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,319
Speaker 0: How many do you need?

258
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 0: Like every model?

259
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,839
Speaker 1: Well, because that one's way easier to use.

260
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 1: And now they added the thing where you can plug it with a long USB-C cable into a gaming computer.

261
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,100
Speaker 1: And it'll just look better and work better.

262
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:44,980
Speaker 1: But you can run it completely independently.

263
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,519
Speaker 1: Like run it outside, do whatever you want.

264
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:52,920
Speaker 1: And because that's the actual consumer tech, that's what we want to use to gear experiences and experiment toward.

265
00:11:53,401 --> 00:12:01,380
Speaker 1: And I might sell my Rift or I might just use the Rift as the second headset for more advanced sideloading nonsense.

266
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:05,659
Speaker 1: But I'm not going to upgrade the Rift to the S. There's really no reason to do that.

267
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,660
Speaker 1: And I think it'll be a few years before there's a real upgrade that is actually expanded or extended market friendly.

268
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:17,340
Speaker 1: Because the Valve VR is way too expensive.

269
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,440
Speaker 1: And even though it's very high quality, that is not something normal people will have at any point.

270
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:23,719
Speaker 1: So you got some news?

271
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:25,580
Speaker 0: We do have some news.

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,080
Speaker 0: So on Steam, they've had for a while, Steam Stream.

273
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,280
Speaker 0: I forget what it's actually, the real name of it is called.

274
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,560
Speaker 0: Steam Remote Play maybe?

275
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 1: That's where like, I have a computer in this room.

276
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,780
Speaker 0: Right, you have your computer, your desktop computer that is very powerful.

277
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:38,008
Speaker 0: Yep.

278
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,450
Speaker 0: Right?

279
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,099
Speaker 0: And you install games on it.

280
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:45,020
Speaker 0: And it has a GPU and it can run games at high resolution in full frames and everything.

281
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,280
Speaker 0: But you want to play your game somewhere else.

282
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,620
Speaker 0: Maybe you want to play your game on your phone or your tablet or some, you know, your friend's house.

283
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,935
Speaker 1: Or just your HTPC in the other room that you didn't spend $3,000 on.

284
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Speaker 0: Right, you want to play the game in a different location, but you don't want to buy another GPU.

285
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,380
Speaker 0: Or you want to play it on a device that doesn't run the game, right?

286
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 0: So the way it works is a lot like the way Google Stadia works.

287
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,160
Speaker 0: The game will open on your computer.

288
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,119
Speaker 0: It will run in a window.

289
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,202
Speaker 0: The get.

290
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:15,239
Speaker 0: your computer will then capture the video from that window.

291
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,660
Speaker 0: Stream that video to your location or your other device, wherever it is, on the network.

292
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,360
Speaker 0: And then it will stream your computer inputs back to your computer and send them into the game.

293
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,889
Speaker 0: There will be some latencies.

294
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,500
Speaker 0: You don't want to play a fighting game this way.

295
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's funny is I'm looking at this screen right now about Remote Play.

296
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,880
Speaker 1: And they actually show Towerfall Ascension as one of the games.

297
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:47,620
Speaker 1: But yet, in my experience, Towerfall Ascension, when we tried to use Teamstream to play it at multiple parties, the lag prevented skill from being a factor.

298
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,618
Speaker 0: Well, it depends if you're on a LAN or if you're going over the internet.

299
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,952
Speaker 1: That might have just been Scott's terrible network.

300
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,060
Speaker 1: Not this Scott, other Scott.

301
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,000
Speaker 0: It also depends on the players, right?

302
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,460
Speaker 0: I think most people playing, you're going to notice latency, right?

303
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,180
Speaker 0: Being all pro, but I think most people won't notice or care, right?

304
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,287
Speaker 0: But yeah, so that's a thing.

305
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,711
Speaker 0: They added a new feature.

306
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:13,040
Speaker 0: that's kind of a big deal, but I wonder how many people will use it, which is called Remote Play Together.

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:21,559
Speaker 0: And what this does is, let's say I'm sitting on my computer and I want to play a game, and that game has local co-op, right?

308
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,108
Speaker 0: It doesn't have any internet play.

309
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,697
Speaker 0: It only has local co-op play, like couch co-op.

310
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,468
Speaker 0: Or couch competitive, right?

311
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:33,496
Speaker 0: It could be like a dive kick.

312
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,640
Speaker 0: I want to play some dive kick.

313
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:37,870
Speaker 0: Does dive kick even have internet play?

314
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,292
Speaker 0: I don't know.

315
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:38,996
Speaker 0: Pretend it doesn't.

316
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:39,740
Speaker 0: In case it does.

317
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,240
Speaker 0: And my friend, though, lives somewhere else, right?

318
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,900
Speaker 0: And we want to play this dive kick.

319
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,367
Speaker 0: So now what a way it works is.

320
00:14:46,467 --> 00:15:03,179
Speaker 0: I play the game, looking at my screen with my controller, but it also captures my screen, streams the screen to my friend, and streams my friend's inputs back, so my friend is doing the stream remote play, but I'm doing the local play at the same time.

321
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:06,819
Speaker 0: And it's only running on my computer or my friend's computer, right?

322
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:14,500
Speaker 0: So you're doing a local co-op, but you're doing it over the internet using that same exact remote play mechanism.

323
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,300
Speaker 0: So this is a great feature, and I'm sure it works, right?

324
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,220
Speaker 0: The problem is I've been on the lookout for couch co-op games.

325
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,599
Speaker 1: They're in shorter supply than they used to be.

326
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,120
Speaker 0: There are not a lot of couch co-op games.

327
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,280
Speaker 1: Well, I would say most of the couch co-op games...

328
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,180
Speaker 0: There aren't even a lot of couch competitive games.

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,539
Speaker 1: Or couch competitive games I want to play like this are actually just NES and SNES ROMs.

330
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:52,560
Speaker 0: Right, because the NES, SNES, Genesis, GameCube especially, they had several controller ports, and developers made lots of games to use several controller ports.

331
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,332
Speaker 0: You turn on Mario Brothers.

332
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,480
Speaker 0: This is one player, two player.

333
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,820
Speaker 0: Even though you're taking turns, it's still a two controller deal.

334
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,380
Speaker 0: Even Duck Hunt is a two controller deal, right?

335
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,920
Speaker 0: People felt like when they made a Nintendo game, they had to have one player, two player.

336
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
Speaker 0: But now, people mostly just make a one player game or an internet multiplayer game.

337
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:14,279
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of local multiplayer games that you need this feature for.

338
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:19,651
Speaker 1: I feel like in the Steam library, it's games that came out between 2006 and 2012-ish.

339
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:28,120
Speaker 1: That was when there were a lot more of these kinds of games, because that's just what people were making.

340
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:34,239
Speaker 0: At least now, if you have one of those games you want to play and you don't have friends, like maybe Trine or something, there's a few Trines, right?

341
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:39,140
Speaker 0: Now you can play it over the internet, which is also good, because now you can do a stream.

342
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,040
Speaker 0: You can do this plus a Twitch stream at the same time.

343
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:48,940
Speaker 0: Watch me, the Twitch streamer, and my friend, the Twitch streamer, play this local co-op game, but my Twitch streamer friend lives far away.

344
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:54,320
Speaker 0: You can do that setup now, which is great, but there's just not enough games, I think, that need the setup.

345
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,758
Speaker 0: Please develop more games with local co-op.

346
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:08,520
Speaker 1: We've talked about this at length over the 15 or so years of doing Geek Nights, about those heady days of the GameCube era coupled with us happening to be in college during the GameCube era.

347
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:21,199
Speaker 0: But also, I think, from the perspective of a game developer, developing network shit is hard, and takes a lot of development time and effort, and sucks ass, which is why if you are going to make a game with some local multiplayer...

348
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, skip making your...

349
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,099
Speaker 0: Local multiplayer is much easier to develop, much less resource-intensive, much less difficult for developers.

350
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,220
Speaker 0: So if you've got a game, I think this might encourage developers, please add local multiplayer.

351
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,139
Speaker 0: You will get the internet multiplayer for free.

352
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,520
Speaker 1: Well, only for people using Steam for your game.

353
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Speaker 1: If you release this game on multiple platforms, or you've got, like, Switch players...

354
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Speaker 0: Right, so release your game on fucking Steam, right?

355
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:45,929
Speaker 0: I know.

356
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,369
Speaker 0: Come on.

357
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:48,057
Speaker 0: Do it.

358
00:17:48,720 --> 00:18:05,540
Speaker 1: So in some other news, Baba Is You actually has always had a level editor, but it's something that, like, Mega Nerds, it's not a hard hack, but you had to, like, fuck with some Lua files and, like, make things happen to get access to the level editor.

359
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,413
Speaker 1: And that's how people were making a lot of crazy.

360
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:14,320
Speaker 1: Baba Is You mods, but Baba Is You, much like Mario Maker, is getting an official level editor.

361
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,520
Speaker 1: There's no date given yet, but it's going to come out in 2020.

362
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,120
Speaker 1: On one hand, I think this is going to be amazing, because I think we're going to see some amazing, crazy crap.

363
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:24,739
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:33,180
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, like with Mario Maker, I'm not going to try to make anything, because nothing I make would even come close to what we're going to see on the internet within a week.

365
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:39,900
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's one of those things where there are people who dedicate their time to it as, like, it's their thing.

366
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,267
Speaker 0: Yeah.

367
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:40,942
Speaker 0: Right?

368
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,499
Speaker 0: And I'm only shallow into it.

369
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,920
Speaker 0: I didn't even beat all the puzzles in the default game.

370
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:54,440
Speaker 1: Well, it's tricky, too, because as soon as I think I have a clever with Mario Maker, like, you think you have a clever idea, you go online, a thousand people have done that idea to a level of polish you could never approach.

371
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,640
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with doing a thing just because someone else has already done it, even if they've already done it better.

372
00:18:58,923 --> 00:18:59,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

373
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,040
Speaker 0: You can do it anyway.

374
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it might not feel like it's worth the effort to polish.

375
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,620
Speaker 0: I mean, if that's your line, because if that's your rule, I'm not going to do anything if someone else has already done it and better, you're not going to do anything ever.

376
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,655
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's more-.

377
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,560
Speaker 0: Why are we making this podcast, this better podcast?

378
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:27,780
Speaker 1: Now, there's a difference between if you want to do something as, like, you want to experience the craft of doing it, but usually when it came to level editors, like, before the internet, if you told me as a kid, like, I could make Mario levels or something,

379
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:28,642
Speaker 0: the only

380
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:35,340
Speaker 1: reason I wanted level editors was because I wanted to make cool, interesting things that didn't exist so me and other people could play them.

381
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:44,120
Speaker 1: I wasn't actually interested in the mechanics of level design, but now someone else will have already made the experience and I can just go play that experience.

382
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,160
Speaker 0: You can still be the guy who plays and beats all the custom levels.

383
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,078
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and that I'm into.

384
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,720
Speaker 0: It's still a thing.

385
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,639
Speaker 1: I play way more Mario Maker than I make.

386
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:51,380
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

387
00:19:51,560 --> 00:20:04,320
Speaker 1: I'm still, like, I'm working on one that has the feel of a certain level from Mario 2, but it's taken me a while because level design in that type of space that feels right and good and tight is not easy.

388
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,252
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

389
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,458
Speaker 0: I think that's the reason they made these games.

390
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:07,900
Speaker 1: Yep.

391
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,735
Speaker 1: So I really look forward to seeing what people do with the Baba.

392
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,760
Speaker 1: Is You Baba Maker.

393
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:22,360
Speaker 1: And in some last funny news, you might remember a long time ago, there was a humble little controller called the Valve Steam Controller.

394
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,479
Speaker 0: So much Valve news today.

395
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:27,740
Speaker 1: The news is that Valve ran out of Steam Controllers.

396
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,380
Speaker 0: Finally.

397
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,939
Speaker 1: I guess they discounted the price.

398
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,820
Speaker 0: Well, I think what happened is they made a bunch of them and then...

399
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,639
Speaker 1: People like us bought them to try them out.

400
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,427
Speaker 0: It was pretty cheap.

401
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,779
Speaker 0: I bought one to try it out.

402
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,639
Speaker 1: It was kind of bad.

403
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:43,236
Speaker 0: It had some good parts and some bad parts, but in the end of the day, it wasn't really good enough to use.

404
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:44,440
Speaker 0: I ended up getting rid of it.

405
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,199
Speaker 1: The only game I used it for, like, I wanted to... Yeah, I was about to say, I used it for Rocket League and nothing else.

406
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,572
Speaker 1: Yep.

407
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,380
Speaker 1: Because it had, the only innovation it had that was good, for me, were those two little pedal buttons on the left and right on the inside.

408
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:57,798
Speaker 1: Yep.

409
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,936
Speaker 1: I used those to juke left and right in Rocket League.

410
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:00,420
Speaker 1: It felt great.

411
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:00,825
Speaker 0: Yep.

412
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:01,200
Speaker 0: Anyway.

413
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,080
Speaker 1: But, like, the buttons weren't comfortable, the stick was in a weird place, the pad didn't work that well.

414
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,667
Speaker 1: There was no D-pad, really.

415
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:11,840
Speaker 1: Like, it was a problem controller that didn't actually work very well.

416
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,825
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't a problem.

417
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:13,931
Speaker 0: It just wasn't good enough.

418
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:15,420
Speaker 0: It wasn't better than any other controller.

419
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,600
Speaker 1: It was not better than the four Xbox controllers I already had.

420
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,300
Speaker 0: But it was super inexpensive, and I guess if you didn't have any controller, right?

421
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,356
Speaker 0: It's like, I guess it's slightly less than trivial to use another kind of controller on a PC.

422
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:28,878
Speaker 0: I don't know.

423
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:29,720
Speaker 0: Anyway.

424
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:32,520
Speaker 1: I also, in the early days, ran into problems.

425
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,280
Speaker 0: But the price was, they kept lowering the price so much and they stopped making them, right?

426
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:41,980
Speaker 0: They just kept lowering the price and lowering the price until it's like, well, might as well get one even if I don't need it.

427
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,518
Speaker 0: Five bucks, whatever, for a whole game controller.

428
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:44,760
Speaker 0: Okay.

429
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,151
Speaker 0: Yeah.

430
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,760
Speaker 0: And they finally sold out and there aren't any more and they're not going to make any more because they're not any good.

431
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,421
Speaker 1: Yep.

432
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:57,140
Speaker 1: Even better, a lot of people tried to buy them and apparently they messed up their stock and they actually had way less than they thought.

433
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,080
Speaker 1: So a whole bunch of people just got their orders cancelled.

434
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I can tell you that actually I recently had too many controllers of different kinds and I tried to consult.

435
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,220
Speaker 1: I have two Oculus controllers, I have four Xbox wireless controllers, the old ones that were actually made for the PC.

436
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Speaker 1: Connected to an official dongle that they don't sell anymore.

437
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,919
Speaker 0: I consolidated all my controllers and what I got was I kept all legacy controllers that I need for old things, like NES controller, SN8, right?

438
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,160
Speaker 0: Those.

439
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you do.

440
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:35,360
Speaker 0: But in terms of controllers for PC and Switch and modern things, I bought the 8BitDo SN30 Plus Pro, which is basically the ultimate controller of ultimateness.

441
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,568
Speaker 0: It has every single feature except HD rumble.

442
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,974
Speaker 0: It's regular rumble, but not HD rumble.

443
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,140
Speaker 0: And you can use it with the Switch, the PC.

444
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:44,799
Speaker 1: But Scott, my HD rumble.

445
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,052
Speaker 0: You can use it with literally everything.

446
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:51,720
Speaker 1: The only other- How will I know if Luigi is nervous versus pensive when I'm playing Luigi's Mansion?

447
00:22:51,800 --> 00:23:07,020
Speaker 0: The only other negative aspect of this controller besides that is that you cannot turn on, it's actually a problem not with this controller specifically, but with any third party controller whatsoever, is that you cannot wake the Switch from sleep mode with it.

448
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,580
Speaker 0: So you have to go over to your Switch, push power.

449
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,460
Speaker 0: Ooh.

450
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,247
Speaker 0: There is no third party controller that can wake the Switch.

451
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:18,100
Speaker 0: Only official Joy-Cons and Switch controllers can do it for some reason.

452
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,780
Speaker 1: I don't like that because- That's a Nintendo thing.

453
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,039
Speaker 1: The way I use my Switch when it's in the dock is I'm sitting on the couch- You sit on the couch and you push the button.

454
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, I push the button, that wakes up the Switch.

455
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:32,580
Speaker 1: The Switch, because my TV is not that old, automatically wakes up the TV and sets it to the Switch input.

456
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a thing.

457
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:44,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, so uh- But yeah, so if you want to use this controller, the only thing is you have to go and push the power button on the Switch, or never make your Switch go to sleep, if they can do that.

458
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:47,340
Speaker 0: And then go sit down and turn the controller on.

459
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:51,360
Speaker 1: I guess the other thing is I have two Pro controllers, and the Pro controller is really good.

460
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,460
Speaker 0: But yeah, this controller will work with like iOS, Android, PCs, PS4s, Switches, literally every fucking thing.

461
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,737
Speaker 1: I feel like I'll get that controller for like, my uh, HDPC.

462
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,080
Speaker 0: I have two of them, and I got rid of every other controller I could because they replaced almost every other controller possible.

463
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,579
Speaker 1: Not bad.

464
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:09,818
Speaker 0: Uh, so there you go.

465
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,370
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day, what do you got?

466
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:23,206
Speaker 0: So, uh, let's say you live in Canada, and you gotta, you live in Canada, you gotta play hockey.

467
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,350
Speaker 0: It's hockey time.

468
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,589
Speaker 1: Like, I think there's a law.

469
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a law.

470
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:28,818
Speaker 0: If you're not playing ice hockey, you at least gotta skate.

471
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:33,030
Speaker 0: But what if you live in Canada in a place, and that place doesn't have a pond?

472
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:40,190
Speaker 0: Or if there's a rink, but the rink is like, you know, you gotta buy ice time there, there's other Canadians playing hockey there, you can't get in the rink, right?

473
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,910
Speaker 0: You just want to go outside and skate, you know, a little quick skate right outside the house.

474
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,110
Speaker 1: Yep, we'd go skate at uh, ponds, or we'd go to rinks.

475
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:54,649
Speaker 0: Right, so apparently they have a thing called Puddle Rink, which is literally just, they shovel the snow out of an area that's- I've never seen one of these!

476
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:02,610
Speaker 0: They just shovel the snow out of an area, spray water, and it's, you know, take care of it, you know, do sort of like a handheld manual Zamboni-ing.

477
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,490
Speaker 1: It's not a great service, it looks kind of mushy, but I'd take it.

478
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,976
Speaker 0: It's not like amazing, but it's like, yeah, it's like they make a little tiny rink.

479
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:18,874
Speaker 0: so people can, who live in the neighborhood, can walk over, do a little skate, do a little whatever, you know, people with old hockey equipment, which there's tons of, you know, leave it out there and like a little thing.

480
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:25,670
Speaker 0: so, you know, grab a stick, you know, skate around a little circle, you know, shuffle puck, whatever, go back inside.

481
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:35,870
Speaker 0: And there's usually an old man in the neighborhood who wakes up at the crack acid dawn, sprays water on it, shovels it, you know, takes care of the old, yeah, tries to make it level because the land isn't going to be level.

482
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,480
Speaker 0: They're going to level it off over time, you know, just take care of it.

483
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,430
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you know, it's not the kind of thing that works if there's no maintenance, right?

484
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:46,563
Speaker 0: It's not like you, if you had a real Zamboni, you would take up half the rink.

485
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:48,470
Speaker 0: That's not going to work either.

486
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,621
Speaker 1: It looks like it's very soothing to make too.

487
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,410
Speaker 1: Like it looks like it would be fun to be the person to make it.

488
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,359
Speaker 0: Here's a video about a dude who maintains a little puddle rink.

489
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:58,301
Speaker 0: He shows you how to do it.

490
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,426
Speaker 0: He tells you the story of how it works.

491
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,390
Speaker 0: There's tons of these things apparently around Canada.

492
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:08,390
Speaker 0: And if you live in a neighborhood somewhere that's got a little room and it's cold enough, maybe like Minnesota or something.

493
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:09,353
Speaker 0: Yeah.

494
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:11,278
Speaker 0: Maybe, you know, talk to the neighbors.

495
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,066
Speaker 0: Maybe you can be that guy who wakes up at 5 a.m.

496
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,410
Speaker 0: every day and sprays the puddle rink.

497
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,494
Speaker 1: Top YouTube comment.

498
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:17,819
Speaker 1: Me, never goes outside.

499
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,450
Speaker 1: Also me, goes outside to make a hockey rink.

500
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,281
Speaker 1: So I saw a video the other day.

501
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,567
Speaker 1: I tweeted about it.

502
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,090
Speaker 1: People commiserated.

503
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,053
Speaker 0: Title of video.

504
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:29,099
Speaker 0: You are old.

505
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,045
Speaker 0: Haha.

506
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:30,970
Speaker 0: The end.

507
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:31,512
Speaker 0: Yep.

508
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:36,770
Speaker 1: But I never had one hit me like right in the mean bean machine like this one did.

509
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,202
Speaker 0: I mean, it's about the same as all the other ones.

510
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:40,410
Speaker 1: This one hit me right in the old.

511
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,482
Speaker 0: It's about the same as the ones that are like, "Oh yeah, Pokémon.

512
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:44,567
Speaker 0: It's like 20 years old,

513
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:44,968
Speaker 0: bitch.".

514
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:52,949
Speaker 1: No, I guess the difference is that the, "Oh hey, X is Y years old," is a much more like, "Yes, because of the progression of time

515
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:53,169
Speaker 1: thing.".

516
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,666
Speaker 1: But when it's framed more as, "What did people do before

517
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:58,148
Speaker 1: X?"

518
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:04,530
Speaker 1: That feels like there's more of a mystery and it reminds me of the fact that younger people actually don't know.

519
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,613
Speaker 1: They look at this shit.

520
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:09,970
Speaker 1: the way I look at, I'm trying to think of what's old enough, the way I look at 10 base 2 internet.

521
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:11,959
Speaker 1: Like, "Wow, you live with that?

522
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:12,040
Speaker 1: Ooh.".

523
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:17,866
Speaker 1: So the video was called, "What did we use before

524
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:18,409
Speaker 1: USB?".

525
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:25,229
Speaker 1: And the thumbnail was like a serial port, a parallel port, and a joystick port, and some PS2 ports.

526
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,818
Speaker 0: Well, that was what we used immediately before USB.

527
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,990
Speaker 0: That wasn't what we used before then, and before then, and before then.

528
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,590
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you had an IBM, if you had a PC and not a Mac.

529
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:35,355
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that.

530
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,169
Speaker 1: Look at those ISA ports right there.

531
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,563
Speaker 0: If you had a PC, not a Mac, right?

532
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,509
Speaker 0: Macs used other things.

533
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,650
Speaker 0: And it was the late 90s and USB had just been invented around like '98 or something.

534
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, Windows 95 did not work with USB.

535
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,652
Speaker 0: No, you had to.

536
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:53,059
Speaker 0: actually, there was Windows 98.

537
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,590
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it was Windows, no, actually Windows 95 did not have support for USB.

538
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,967
Speaker 0: But then, Windows 98, and there was a second release of Windows 95 that was like Windows 95B.

539
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,689
Speaker 1: Which I never got.

540
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:04,315
Speaker 0: I had it.

541
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,570
Speaker 0: I actually have the CD-ROM for it.

542
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,798
Speaker 1: Because I never got 98.

543
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,610
Speaker 1: I skipped to 2000 on a brand new computer.

544
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,040
Speaker 0: I have both, I have 95B and 98 and 2000.

545
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,222
Speaker 0: Anyway.

546
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,973
Speaker 1: I went, I had Windows 311.

547
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:21,150
Speaker 0: So the point is, is that not until Windows 95B, so I assume 96 or 97 is when consumer computers started having USB.

548
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,033
Speaker 0: And that was USB 1.0.

549
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,783
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand how, like USB 1.0 was so slow.

550
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,668
Speaker 0: I had a USB 1.0 three button mouse bitches.

551
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,890
Speaker 0: But that computer still had PS2 port, serial port, games port, parallel port.

552
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,430
Speaker 1: Yup, my scanner plugged into the SCSI port because I had a SCSI card.

553
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,850
Speaker 0: SCSI was like the special elite connector.

554
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:46,910
Speaker 1: Yup, but the SCSI card was plugged into an ISA slot.

555
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,452
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

556
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,010
Speaker 0: I had PCI slots.

557
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:50,809
Speaker 1: I mean, I had two PCI.

558
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:57,290
Speaker 0: The point is, if you had a computer in the early to mid 90s that was an IBM computer, you had these, it was a PC.

559
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,510
Speaker 0: It could have been, it might have been IBM, but in Compaq or HP or Gateway or whatever the hell.

560
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,390
Speaker 0: These are the connectors it had before USB was a thing.

561
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,210
Speaker 0: And even when USB was a thing, they still had these connectors.

562
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,007
Speaker 0: Computers with exclusive USB.

563
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,990
Speaker 0: Do they even still, I don't even think there are computers with exclusive USB.

564
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:18,630
Speaker 0: My newest computer I think has all USBs and a PS2 port still, a combo one.

565
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,290
Speaker 0: Yup, mine has two PS2 ports.

566
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,950
Speaker 0: And some HDMI's and like an external SATA and some other connectors.

567
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,748
Speaker 1: Ah, eSATA, that didn't really take off.

568
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:27,467
Speaker 0: No.

569
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,890
Speaker 1: Cables couldn't be long enough.

570
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,969
Speaker 0: But yeah, these are the connectors that existed then.

571
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,690
Speaker 1: So this video will explain what the world of computing was like during the formative years of us using computers.

572
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:38,128
Speaker 0: Yup.

573
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:46,990
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, we will not do any more shows this week because we will be at PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

574
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,020
Speaker 1: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

575
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,289
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited about this.

576
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:57,450
Speaker 1: Thus starting the era of the PAX's because we're going to go right from PAX Unplugged to MAGFest.

577
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,986
Speaker 1: And then right from MAGFest, very little gap at any point along the way, to PAX South.

578
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,810
Speaker 1: And then PAX East is actually really early this year.

579
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,210
Speaker 1: So PAX East is right on the tails of PAX South.

580
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,589
Speaker 0: Yup, we're going to Unplugged, MAGFest South, wait, wait, East, ah.

581
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:13,501
Speaker 1: Yup, ah.

582
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:16,329
Speaker 0: Once we get past East, it's going to be like ah.

583
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:16,904
Speaker 1: Yup.

584
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:22,569
Speaker 1: I do know what panels we're doing at PAX South, but we got to talk about PAX Unplugged first.

585
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,550
Speaker 0: So PAX Unplugged is literally a few days from the release of this podcast.

586
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:27,648
Speaker 0: What are the actual dates?

587
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:31,188
Speaker 1: It is Friday the 6th through Sunday the 8th.

588
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,890
Speaker 0: It is in the shithole city of Philadelphia.

589
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,488
Speaker 0: But at least it's a PAX.

590
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,049
Speaker 0: You'll survive, I guess.

591
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,429
Speaker 0: Come down and play some games.

592
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:43,309
Speaker 0: Watch out for Eagles fans.

593
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,430
Speaker 1: It is, I think PAX Unplugged is my second favorite PAX.

594
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,330
Speaker 1: I like West the most for just a lot of reasons.

595
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,590
Speaker 0: Unplugged feels a lot like South, only without video games.

596
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,670
Speaker 1: But the best part about Unplugged is that 95% of what I do at PAX is at PAX Unplugged.

597
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,000
Speaker 0: Yup.

598
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:06,669
Speaker 0: I think for a lot of video game people, PAX Unplugged would feel like a lesser PAX.

599
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,930
Speaker 0: But for someone who mostly tabletops at PAX, it feels like a full PAX.

600
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,864
Speaker 0: I'm like, what's missing?

601
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:12,230
Speaker 0: Nothing?

602
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,730
Speaker 1: I do often want to get a group of us to go into the console free play room to play like Old Smash or something.

603
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,827
Speaker 1: But no one's ever up for it.

604
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,869
Speaker 0: We could just do that at our house.

605
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:22,239
Speaker 1: Can we?

606
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:22,970
Speaker 1: Will that happen?

607
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,550
Speaker 0: It's easier to do than play board games at our house.

608
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,410
Speaker 1: True, true.

609
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,130
Speaker 1: But we don't have that crew.

610
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:33,230
Speaker 1: Anyway, we will be doing on Friday, Learn and Play, three short but essential games.

611
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,530
Speaker 0: Alright, and we're going to teach you how to play, hopefully we'll have as long as the panel.

612
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:38,130
Speaker 0: Two hours.

613
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,410
Speaker 0: I hope we fit it in two hours.

614
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,370
Speaker 1: I think we'll fit it in two hours.

615
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:47,910
Speaker 0: We're going to teach you how to play Cockroach Poker, Wizard, and I'm going to pronounce it incorrectly.

616
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,809
Speaker 1: Gon-Shane Clever, Gon-Shone Clever.

617
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,190
Speaker 0: Gon-Shane Clever, Gon-Shone, German people, help me out.

618
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,870
Speaker 0: How do I spell the O with two dots on top?

619
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,350
Speaker 1: That's very clever.

620
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:56,869
Speaker 0: Yes, that's very clever.

621
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,664
Speaker 0: The roll and write dice game is basically super Yahtzee.

622
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:00,610
Speaker 0: Yahtzee on crack.

623
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,550
Speaker 0: We're going to teach you how to play all three games, one at a time.

624
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,610
Speaker 0: So it's going to be learn, play, learn, play, learn, play.

625
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,990
Speaker 1: It's going to be a really good time.

626
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,690
Speaker 0: So you can even show up late and just learn one of the later games.

627
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:17,190
Speaker 1: And because these are not games that PAX has in the library, we're bringing the games ourselves to run this thing.

628
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,429
Speaker 1: So that means we can just take this to other conventions that may want to have a learn and play room, but don't have the logistics of PAX.

629
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,750
Speaker 1: And we can just run this at any con that will give us a room of tables.

630
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:31,170
Speaker 1: I feel like we should bust this out at a future magfest.

631
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,806
Speaker 0: I mean, South did a little bit of learn and play, right?

632
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,390
Speaker 0: But no one came.

633
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,250
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're continuing with that.

634
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,250
Speaker 1: I hope they continue with it.

635
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,090
Speaker 0: I do hope they are, but we'll see.

636
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:42,296
Speaker 1: And then on Sunday at 3 p.m.

637
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:47,630
Speaker 1: in the Leviathan Theater, we are doing a panel affectionately titled Take Your Fucking Turn.

638
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,228
Speaker 0: That's right.

639
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,629
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited about this one because I had an idea.

640
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,030
Speaker 1: When Scott and I came over to the panel, usually we'd have a concept.

641
00:32:57,271 --> 00:32:58,864
Speaker 1: Scott was like, "I want to talk about how games hurt

642
00:32:58,905 --> 00:32:59,167
Speaker 1: people.".

643
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:05,390
Speaker 1: And then we have a pretty good idea of what we're going to talk about and what the flow would be and what are the important points.

644
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,889
Speaker 1: Loot boxes are evil.

645
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,706
Speaker 1: Games don't make people serial killers, but they do make them gambling.

646
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:11,370
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.

647
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,130
Speaker 1: And then we do the research and usually we find out we were pretty right.

648
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,969
Speaker 1: We learn a few things along the way.

649
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:23,230
Speaker 1: Some of the ideas we had about some of our panels, like the Real Armor Games panel, were updated by the data that Scott gathered.

650
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:30,570
Speaker 1: But with this one, it's basically part one, why do games take so long, and fun economy.

651
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,089
Speaker 1: Part two, the mechanics of that.

652
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,648
Speaker 1: Part three, how to be like us and play a four-hour game in 40 minutes.

653
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:42,879
Speaker 1: And the panel wrote itself.

654
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,990
Speaker 1: The slides just spewed out because it was exactly something.

655
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,209
Speaker 1: We've talked about this so much.

656
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:54,450
Speaker 0: Well, you also took, it didn't help that a good chunk of the slides you have ripped off from our other panel about how to win at games.

657
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,370
Speaker 0: Because it just so happens that a lot of the ways to win are also the ways to play fast.

658
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:58,712
Speaker 1: Yup.

659
00:33:59,059 --> 00:33:59,590
Speaker 1: Heuristics.

660
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,290
Speaker 0: Coincidence.

661
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,234
Speaker 1: But here's the difference.

662
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,649
Speaker 1: Instead of getting deep into heuristic, heuristic, heuristic.

663
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,644
Speaker 0: I think you should shorten some of those slides.

664
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:06,209
Speaker 0: We don't need them all.

665
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:09,330
Speaker 1: I think some of those slides are like 10 seconds.

666
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,929
Speaker 1: Because the message there is just don't be our friend Scott and calculate everything in acquire.

667
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,603
Speaker 1: Just do a soft calculation like that one A is bigger than B, not.

668
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,748
Speaker 1: A is 17 cubes and B is 15 cubes.

669
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,850
Speaker 1: Like it's that kind of advice.

670
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,429
Speaker 1: But I'm really excited about this one.

671
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:31,630
Speaker 1: And I'm going to post a thing announcing our panel for PacSouth.

672
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,730
Speaker 1: And all that stuff is coming.

673
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:35,275
Speaker 1: The book club book is The Tale of Genji.

674
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:39,909
Speaker 1: I feel like we're going to read enough of it over the holidays to at least do a part one.

675
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's how it's got to be.

676
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,409
Speaker 0: It was, you know, I knew quite a bit about it when I chose it, but I did not understand its length.

677
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,077
Speaker 1: Well, I did.

678
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:51,449
Speaker 1: And I could have warned you.

679
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,469
Speaker 1: But instead of reading The Tale of Genji a lot on my trip when I had a lot of downtime.

680
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,289
Speaker 0: Like you said you would.

681
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,470
Speaker 1: I ended up mostly beating Link's Awakening.

682
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,233
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

683
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:01,689
Speaker 0: Well, that's good because we'll talk about that right now.

684
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,497
Speaker 1: So Link's Awakening.

685
00:35:03,557 --> 00:35:04,140
Speaker 1: Let's go back.

686
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,305
Speaker 1: Let's go back to a heady year.

687
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,291
Speaker 1: 1993.

688
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,870
Speaker 0: Well, the Super Nintendo was already out for a while.

689
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:17,310
Speaker 0: And so I actually didn't learn the history of Link's Awakening until recently, even though I played Link's Awakening in 1993.

690
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not.

691
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know you didn't.

692
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:23,204
Speaker 0: So what happened was is Link to the Past had come out.

693
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:27,870
Speaker 1: In 1991.

694
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,310
Speaker 0: That's right.

695
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:29,809
Speaker 1: We got it on release day.

696
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:34,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, the developers on that game, I think one of, there's a YouTube video about this.

697
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,163
Speaker 0: Maybe you can find it and link it.

698
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:36,609
Speaker 0: I've seen it.

699
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,890
Speaker 1: I've seen, I haven't watched it, but I saw.

700
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,672
Speaker 0: I watched it.

701
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:42,930
Speaker 0: maybe like, I think someone posted the video maybe a few months ago.

702
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,670
Speaker 0: And that's when I learned the story of, the backstory of Link's Awakening.

703
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,209
Speaker 1: But it began as a port.

704
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:56,570
Speaker 0: Right, one of the developers on Link's to the Past was like trying to make, you know, Link's Awakening for the Game Boy.

705
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:57,808
Speaker 1: Now, you have to step back.

706
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,930
Speaker 0: The black and white, or the green and white Game Boy, from Super Nintendo to Game Boy.

707
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to step back and think about how utterly insane that is.

708
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,870
Speaker 0: People don't realize that, like, you think Super Nintendo, like whoa, yeah, the Game Boy was contemporary to the Super Nintendo.

709
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,609
Speaker 0: That's the technology level you had in the early 90s.

710
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,009
Speaker 1: Yup, and the Game Boy was pushing it.

711
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:16,481
Speaker 0: Yup.

712
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:22,290
Speaker 0: Like, I would go to the doctor's office, the dentist's office, or orthodontist, and they'd have a Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo.

713
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,050
Speaker 0: But then when you sat down to get worked on, they gave you Game Boy.

714
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:27,525
Speaker 1: What kind of bougie orthodontist did you go to?

715
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,310
Speaker 1: I had nothing.

716
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:29,430
Speaker 0: Oh, that sucks.

717
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:38,250
Speaker 0: Our orthodontist even had like a fancy, he lived in like a mansion, and had fancy parties at his house that like all the patients, like literally every patient would come and it was like a field day.

718
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:41,349
Speaker 1: I can say that I've never been to the house of my orthodontists.

719
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:43,170
Speaker 1: Either of them.

720
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:48,370
Speaker 0: We did an egg toss, and I threw an egg, and it broke, and Ricky Cohen got hives because he was allergic to egg.

721
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:50,450
Speaker 1: Fuck you, Ricky Cohen.

722
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,366
Speaker 0: Even though we came close to winning that egg toss.

723
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:54,650
Speaker 0: Anyway.

724
00:36:57,011 --> 00:37:11,430
Speaker 0: So, they were secretly working on this game, right, for the Game Boy, and the game, you know, was kind of off the rails and quirky and nutso, but eventually, you know, this one guy was working on it, the other Nintendo developers saw what they were doing, and he was like, "Whoa, what's

725
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:11,650
Speaker 0: that?".

726
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,730
Speaker 0: And they kept, they were basically, it was like their secret project at night to make fancy Zelda for Game Boy.

727
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,060
Speaker 0: Yup.

728
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:22,248
Speaker 0: And then eventually, the wind broke, and they were like, "Alright, we'll let you do

729
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:22,368
Speaker 0: it.".

730
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:31,850
Speaker 0: And this completely nut job, like, you know, sort of bottom-up grassroots Zelda game was released for the Game Boy.

731
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:39,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I gotta, 'cause I'm gonna read a line from Wikipedia, I'd heard this before, but uh, so the director of the game was Takashi Tezuka.

732
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,267
Speaker 0: That's the guy.

733
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:52,850
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna read this from Wikipedia, the majority of the Link to the Past team reassembled for Link's Awakening, comma, and Tezuka wanted the game world to feel like the television series Twin Peaks.

734
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:53,360
Speaker 0: Yup.

735
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:55,889
Speaker 1: So they set it in a dream.

736
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:56,623
Speaker 0: Yup.

737
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:58,270
Speaker 1: And they made it weird.

738
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,390
Speaker 0: That's why it's called Link's Awakening.

739
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:13,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game is literally, Link is asleep in a dream world, and there's like, there's a lot of kami, like Mario's in it, Chain Chomps are in it, there's all this like- There's Goombas, there's Boo the Ghost, there's all this like- There's side-scrolling sections.

740
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all sorts of completely nutty, batshit stuff in this game.

741
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,890
Speaker 1: You're gonna find an animal village, it's just animals.

742
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,570
Speaker 1: Right, it's like- You talk to this one rabbit, it's like, you might wonder, like, if there's some magic, like, why can rabbits talk?

743
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:27,867
Speaker 0: The plot- Don't ask me.

744
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:37,630
Speaker 0: This game is in this giant egg in the middle of the island that you're trapped on, and you wanna wake, you know, your goal is to wake, to crack the egg and wake the Wind Fish who lives in the egg.

745
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,869
Speaker 1: Break the world's shell.

746
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:39,349
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,670
Speaker 1: For the sake of revolution.

748
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,949
Speaker 0: Because you're in the Wind Fish's dream right now.

749
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:52,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember, this takes place- And everyone in the dream is telling you you're in the dream, and the bosses in the dungeons don't want you to get the instruments, they're all guarding instruments.

750
00:38:53,292 --> 00:39:00,329
Speaker 0: Because if you get all the instruments, you can play music that's loud enough, I guess, to wake the Wind Fish up, and which means- They'll all die.

751
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,449
Speaker 0: They'll all cease to exist, because this whole world is just the dream of the Wind Fish that you're in.

752
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:14,710
Speaker 0: But you go ahead and wake the Wind Fish, which sends Link back to the real world of Hyrule, where he's stranded, floating in the ocean, because his boat crashed.

753
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:27,870
Speaker 1: It basically takes place, like, right after other Zelda games, like, you beat Ganon- But yeah, basically, someone- After Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past.

754
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,690
Speaker 0: Okay, but yeah, Link is on a boat, he fucking crashes, he has some sort of fever dream, and then he wakes up.

755
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:34,377
Speaker 1: Yup.

756
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,685
Speaker 0: Still crashed on a boat.

757
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:43,808
Speaker 1: In a weary world, but it has none of the- like, it has a lot of item tropes, but the story does not have a, like, Zelda trope.

758
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:44,650
Speaker 1: There's no Master Sword.

759
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,610
Speaker 0: No, but it's cool how the story matches what's going on in the game, right?

760
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:51,867
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

761
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,910
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, it's the same way that Mario 2 does, even though Mario 2 is, like, a different reason.

762
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,290
Speaker 1: Whoa, look, Link to the Past and Mario 2, also just dreams.

763
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,685
Speaker 0: Right, it's like Mario 2, it's sort of like, okay, this is completely nothing like Mario, how do we explain it?

764
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:07,410
Speaker 0: Ah, Mario is having a dream.

765
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,397
Speaker 0: Well, here, it's like intent- it wasn't like.

766
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,950
Speaker 0: they took another game and put, you know, Mario on it, right?

767
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:19,209
Speaker 0: It was like, ah, we'll actually make this game, it's completely nutjob, it's nothing like Zelda, look at all this crazy stuff in it.

768
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:22,779
Speaker 0: Right, but the story is that it's a dream on purpose, right?

769
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:26,350
Speaker 0: It's like an integrated, not a deus ex machina dream at the end.

770
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,370
Speaker 1: Now, sort of an interesting aside, as Scott alluded to before, and I mentioned repeatedly- You didn't play this game.

771
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,790
Speaker 1: Until the remake, I had never actually played Link's Awakening.

772
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,744
Speaker 0: No, I was like, every time, it was like, "Ray, you haven't played Link's Awakening, what the fuck?

773
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:40,688
Speaker 0: What the fuck,

774
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:41,069
Speaker 0: seriously?".

775
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,250
Speaker 1: Part of the reason for that was that I had the game Gear, primarily, and my brother had the Game Boy.

776
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:45,923
Speaker 1: Yeah.

777
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,330
Speaker 0: We had the Game Boy, like- I played it on the Game Boy, I played it on the Game Boy Color.

778
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,130
Speaker 1: Yep, I never had a Game Boy Color, because around- I played it on the Game Boy Color, and it came out.

779
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:55,450
Speaker 0: So,

780
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,790
Speaker 1: when

781
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,451
Speaker 0: I was a kid,

782
00:40:56,731 --> 00:41:17,130
Speaker 1: I had stupid kid brain, so I played a bunch of Super Nintendo games, I'd played Link to the Past, I saw Link's Awakening was coming out, I saw screens from it, I read about it in Nintendo Power, and I saw it just looked like a knockoff of Link to the Past, which I had already played, and because it was on the Game Boy, I assumed it was just gonna be worse than Link to the Past.

783
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,010
Speaker 0: Very wrong.

784
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,517
Speaker 1: But also, it was 1993.

785
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:24,290
Speaker 1: That was when I took a hard pivot away from console gaming into PC gaming.

786
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:33,320
Speaker 1: So, that was basically the era when I stopped playing console games, and I didn't pick up a portable Nintendo console again until the Game Boy advanced.

787
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:42,330
Speaker 0: When I was doing the hard PC games, I was simultaneously doing the hard handheld games, because, you know, the console games were a lot of monies.

788
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,959
Speaker 0: Yeah.

789
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:43,650
Speaker 0: Right?

790
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,310
Speaker 1: And I could pirate PC games.

791
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:47,694
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

792
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:52,730
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, the job I had, I could go to GameStop and buy plenty of Game Boy games, right?

793
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,108
Speaker 0: Yup.

794
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,022
Speaker 0: And I could bring my Game Boy to school, I'd play those games a lot.

795
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:56,725
Speaker 0: Anyway.

796
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,170
Speaker 1: So, fast forward.

797
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:03,929
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was, when Game Boy Color came out- Oh, yeah, yeah, that's some good context.

798
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:18,650
Speaker 0: They re-released this game as Link's Awakening DX, and what they did is, people don't know, the Game Boy Color was a Game Boy that could play original Game Boy games, and then it would sort of color them the same way the Super Game Boy did.

799
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:29,810
Speaker 0: If you don't know about the Super Game Boy, that was a Super Nintendo cartridge that you would put a Game Boy game in, and it would play the Game Boy game on your Super Nintendo on the TV, and add some color to it.

800
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:33,330
Speaker 1: I rented that from Blockbuster a few times, but I never owned one.

801
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:35,310
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I knew someone who owned one.

802
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,729
Speaker 1: 'Cause I had a lot of Game Boy games.

803
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:49,570
Speaker 0: So, you, the Game Boy, so Link's Awakening DX was a cartridge that you could play, a DX cartridge was a cartridge you could play in an old school Game Boy or Game Boy Pocket, and it would be black and white.

804
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,434
Speaker 1: Now give 'em a, this is 1998.

805
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,118
Speaker 1: This is much later.

806
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:02,150
Speaker 0: But if you play it in a Game Boy Color, it would be quite colorized more than a Super Game Boy would colorize it.

807
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:05,843
Speaker 0: And then they had other games that were Game Boy Color games.

808
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:07,770
Speaker 0: You could only play them in a Game Boy Color.

809
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:08,870
Speaker 1: And they just had color.

810
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,896
Speaker 0: You could not play them in a Game Boy or Game Boy Pocket.

811
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:13,600
Speaker 0: They just had color.

812
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:18,030
Speaker 0: Not as good as GBA, but pretty good color for the time, right?

813
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:27,390
Speaker 0: So this, they re-released a lot of the classic Game Boy games on DX cartridges for people with Game Boy Colors to encourage them to go and buy those.

814
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:33,150
Speaker 0: I actually didn't buy it because I had played it already, but I knew the deal, and I think I played someone else's maybe.

815
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:39,710
Speaker 0: They basically not only colorized the game, they added a dungeon to the game called the Color Dungeon.

816
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,710
Speaker 1: You had to be able to see color to beat that dungeon.

817
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,623
Speaker 0: And if you couldn't see color, you couldn't really do that dungeon.

818
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:47,710
Speaker 0: It was like they made color a game mechanic.

819
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,563
Speaker 1: Like those skeletons wouldn't even let you in if you were on a regular Game Boy.

820
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:51,689
Speaker 1: They'd just be like, "This isn't for

821
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:51,849
Speaker 1: you.".

822
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,753
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

823
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:54,782
Speaker 0: They made a special thing for that.

824
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:56,770
Speaker 0: And that was pretty cool.

825
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:05,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what happened these times is people who didn't have Game Boys back in the day have not played this game.

826
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,609
Speaker 0: It's been out of print inaccessible to only nerds for quite a long time.

827
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:16,430
Speaker 1: But in the day, what I didn't notice, because Nintendo powers that every game is 11 out of 10 perfect must-buy.

828
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,170
Speaker 1: But the rest of the world also said that about Link's Awakening.

829
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:26,670
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say it's better than Link to the Past, but it's on the same level as Link to the Past.

830
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,955
Speaker 0: It's basically amazing.

831
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:28,437
Speaker 0: They fit.

832
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,807
Speaker 0: You think, "Oh, it's a little Game Boy Zelda game.

833
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:31,028
Speaker 0: It'd be

834
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:31,370
Speaker 0: tiny.".

835
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,230
Speaker 0: It's like, "No, it's a full seven, eight dungeon Zelda

836
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,330
Speaker 0: game.".

837
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,095
Speaker 1: The world is huge.

838
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,764
Speaker 1: There's a lot of puzzles.

839
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:42,470
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things to find.

840
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:47,590
Speaker 0: Well, the world is sort of huge, but a lot of space is taken up by the raft game and the overworld.

841
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,553
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'll put it this way.

842
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:54,770
Speaker 1: The world feels huge because there are a lot of tunnels and caves and dungeons and things.

843
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,010
Speaker 1: So that even though the world is actually physically smaller than another Zelda game, it is very dense.

844
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also the dungeons got a lot going on.

845
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:03,650
Speaker 0: They're not like baby nothing dungeons.

846
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the dungeons are actually pretty hard.

847
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:11,790
Speaker 1: The one where you got to walk on top of the orange-blue blocks, that's probably the hardest dungeon in the game.

848
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,189
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they re-released this game on the Switch, but they don't just re-release it so everyone can play it.

849
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,690
Speaker 0: They do a badass HD remake.

850
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,050
Speaker 1: It is so beautiful.

851
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:31,250
Speaker 0: The HD remake, they basically kept all the original character of the game, all the quirkiness and the puzzles and the items.

852
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:42,571
Speaker 0: The art style exactly matches the mood of the original, but the only real change from the original game that's meaningful is that the aspect ratio is 16 by 9.

853
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:47,145
Speaker 0: It's basically the exact same game, almost like 99%.

854
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,030
Speaker 0: Square by square, enemy by enemy.

855
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,113
Speaker 0: The enemies behave the same.

856
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:51,558
Speaker 0: The weapons are in the same place.

857
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:54,528
Speaker 0: The controls are almost identical, right?

858
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:58,123
Speaker 0: The trading puzzle is exactly the same.

859
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,610
Speaker 0: The bosses are the same.

860
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,310
Speaker 1: Because you have more buttons, you can actually have more things equipped at the same time effectively.

861
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,458
Speaker 0: That was actually a unique thing about Link's Awakening.

862
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,870
Speaker 0: You could unequip sword and shield and put whatever you wanted on A and B on the Game Boy.

863
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,017
Speaker 1: I got feather and wizard staff.

864
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:18,126
Speaker 0: But now you got more buttons, so you pretty much always have sword and shield and you can add more.

865
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:19,150
Speaker 0: It's a little better.

866
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,449
Speaker 1: Didn't have to equip the pegasus boots.

867
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:25,894
Speaker 0: But other than that, it is the same game.

868
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:36,110
Speaker 0: There is no reason to play another version of Link's Awakening now that this just better version exists with just better graphics and sound because it is still the same thing.

869
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:43,810
Speaker 1: I do like how when you beat the game, it plays the full song at the end, but then it segues into the original Game Boy music a couple times.

870
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,343
Speaker 0: But yeah.

871
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:49,650
Speaker 0: Really, it just stopped on the back story.

872
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,350
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on here.

873
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,770
Speaker 0: It's almost like Mario All-Stars where it's the same game, right?

874
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:05,650
Speaker 0: Mario All-Stars versus Mario 1, 2, and 3 wasn't a lot of time, so it wasn't as much of an improvement.

875
00:47:08,112 --> 00:47:14,910
Speaker 0: To go from a Game Boy game to a Switch game is such a dramatic improvement in terms of technology.

876
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,184
Speaker 0: But then to make the same exact game...

877
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:22,010
Speaker 1: It shows the strength of the core game design of Link's Awakening.

878
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:28,408
Speaker 0: It shows how good a game the original was that you can literally not change a damn thing and get away with selling it as a $60 Switch game.

879
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:40,750
Speaker 1: Well, there are some ways where I think it is better than A Link to the Past in the sense that A Link to the Past has many areas that are just difficult to get through because you'll take a lot of damage and you have to fight well to get through them.

880
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:42,876
Speaker 1: There's a lot less of that in this game.

881
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:46,450
Speaker 1: This game is more about solving fairly complex puzzles.

882
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,749
Speaker 0: There's definitely a little more puzzle action.

883
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:50,717
Speaker 1: I'm not saying A Link to the Past doesn't have that.

884
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:54,550
Speaker 1: I'm saying this is more focused on that and the combat kind of takes a back burner.

885
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:01,689
Speaker 1: The other thing is that A Link to the Past does have a lot of places in the game where there really isn't anything going on.

886
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:04,790
Speaker 1: Like there's between other places or journeys.

887
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:13,307
Speaker 1: But in Link's Awakening, it almost does what Breath of the Wild did where there's some secret on every fucking square of the game.

888
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,510
Speaker 1: There's some secret there.

889
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:18,759
Speaker 0: Like I said, it was the Game Boy, so the overworld is smaller, right?

890
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,670
Speaker 0: So they really had to cram everything in real tight but still fit a lot of stuff.

891
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:33,010
Speaker 0: So the secret seashells, those are in the original game, but I think they added... Dampy's Dungeon is the only new thing on the Switch version.

892
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:34,389
Speaker 1: I did not interact with that at all.

893
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,373
Speaker 0: I did a little bit.

894
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:41,490
Speaker 0: What it does is basically you go there and you can make your own dungeons by taking rooms.

895
00:48:42,193 --> 00:48:45,030
Speaker 0: You basically acquire rooms, like an inventory of rooms.

896
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:49,890
Speaker 0: And then you can design dungeons by piecing whatever rooms together as long as they fit.

897
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:52,870
Speaker 0: And you can design your own dungeons by combining rooms.

898
00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:01,709
Speaker 0: And it's kind of cute and fun, but it's not good enough to be... Like if they made Zelda Maker where you make a Zelda dungeon square by square.

899
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,885
Speaker 1: I would fuck with that a lot.

900
00:49:03,451 --> 00:49:04,675
Speaker 0: Right, that would be the shit.

901
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:08,689
Speaker 0: But making a Zelda dungeon room by room is not as exciting.

902
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:15,550
Speaker 1: In fact, I immediately think I would use the Link to the Past rules... Not Link to the Past, I would use the Link's Awakening rules with the feather.

903
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:18,350
Speaker 1: And I would make a dungeon that was basically StarTropics.

904
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:19,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, go for it.

905
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:20,681
Speaker 1: Well, I can't.

906
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:21,210
Speaker 1: It doesn't exist.

907
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:26,670
Speaker 0: I mean, you could use actual programming and just make a Zelda-like game.

908
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,558
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I could.

909
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:28,670
Speaker 1: I don't care that much.

910
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,750
Speaker 0: You could make a StarTropics mod.

911
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:35,350
Speaker 1: But I guess it's interesting that this game is so good and in a lot of ways was ahead of its time.

912
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:48,090
Speaker 1: And in a lot of ways, because I used to always have this feeling that a Link to the Past after that... Like Ocarina of Time is also an important pivotal Zelda game.

913
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:50,549
Speaker 1: But a lot of the other Zelda games I didn't enjoy that much.

914
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:56,530
Speaker 1: And it felt like there was a... While there were a lot of high points, there was a downward slope until Breath of the Wild.

915
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:04,950
Speaker 0: Well, in terms of 2D Zelda games, I think they sort of lost... You could see Minish Cap trying... Minish Cap had nothing going on, though.

916
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:10,690
Speaker 0: It was trying to be... I guess after this came Ages and Seasons, but those were made by Capcom.

917
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:13,205
Speaker 0: And those are good, but they...

918
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:14,289
Speaker 1: They're not great.

919
00:50:14,552 --> 00:50:14,869
Speaker 0: They're great.

920
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,270
Speaker 1: I only played... Seasons was the one that was mostly puzzly.

921
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,270
Speaker 0: No, Ages was puzzly.

922
00:50:21,914 --> 00:50:23,210
Speaker 0: Seasons was more fighty.

923
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,030
Speaker 1: I didn't play Seasons.

924
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,121
Speaker 0: They still both had puzzly and fighty in them, but... Anyway.

925
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,790
Speaker 0: But yeah, I wish someone would remake those and make them easier to play.

926
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,770
Speaker 0: Because who the hell can connect the two Game Boys together these days, right?

927
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:44,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this showed that after Link to the Past, they could still make different enough to be fun 2D Zeldas without turning them all into Minish Cap.

928
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:51,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the 2D Zeldas that came later that weren't made by Capcom, where your Minish Cap, that train one that was garbage...

929
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,100
Speaker 1: Oh god, I did not even finish the train one.

930
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,650
Speaker 0: I gave up on it about a third of the way through.

931
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,910
Speaker 0: There was one, a DS one that was okay.

932
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,589
Speaker 1: I'm losing track of which one's which.

933
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,728
Speaker 0: The one that was Wind Waker-y on the DS.

934
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:02,750
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that was okay.

935
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,590
Speaker 1: The train one was just so bad.

936
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,719
Speaker 0: The train was the worst one.

937
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:06,849
Speaker 0: That might be the worst Zelda there is.

938
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,649
Speaker 1: Like, I think it was worse than Minish Cap.

939
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:09,529
Speaker 0: I didn't finish it.

940
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:11,010
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely worse than Minish Cap.

941
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,650
Speaker 1: Because while Minish Cap was bad, it was also so easy that it was pretty short.

942
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,550
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, no, the train one was definitely worse than Minish Cap, no question.

943
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:17,817
Speaker 1: Yeah.

944
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:19,429
Speaker 0: Um, you know.

945
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:25,930
Speaker 1: But, uh, if you were like me, and... Or you're just young enough to where, like, you never encountered a Game Boy.

946
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,942
Speaker 1: Like, this is a must-buy game.

947
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:30,430
Speaker 1: Just treat it like a brand new Zelda game.

948
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:31,206
Speaker 1: Just treat it like...

949
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:32,824
Speaker 0: It's like, you think all that money.

950
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:33,470
Speaker 0: It's like, actually...

951
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,096
Speaker 1: It is a triple-A.

952
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:37,090
Speaker 1: I would treat this as a triple-A game today.

953
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,569
Speaker 1: Just like any other triple-A.

954
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:42,309
Speaker 1: And, uh, I enjoyed the shit out of it.

955
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:49,650
Speaker 0: And the best thing is that, especially as an older person, right, this is the kind of game where you can play once and be done with it.

956
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,730
Speaker 0: And you don't need to keep going and do anything else.

957
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,542
Speaker 1: I did not get all the seashells.

958
00:51:53,562 --> 00:51:54,650
Speaker 1: I got the 40 necessary.

959
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,150
Speaker 0: You just want to get 40 secret seashells to upgrade your sword.

960
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,414
Speaker 1: But I'm very proud of myself.

961
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:02,790
Speaker 1: I found them all entirely within the context of the game.

962
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,250
Speaker 1: I didn't read any guide, any fact, anything.

963
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:09,870
Speaker 1: I treated it like an old NES or Game Boy game back when I was a kid.

964
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,169
Speaker 1: I didn't look up shit.

965
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,729
Speaker 0: I mean, I got a lot of them by memory, you know.

966
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:17,564
Speaker 0: But, yeah, I just, you know.

967
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:18,790
Speaker 0: I don't got time for that.

968
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:24,370
Speaker 1: Well, I figured, because a good design mechanic is, early on, seashells are just a mystery.

969
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,350
Speaker 1: You've got to be like, "Well, that looks like a weird bush that's by itself and surrounded by a circle of things.

970
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:30,262
Speaker 1: I will cut it.

971
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:30,607
Speaker 1: Oh, look, a

972
00:52:30,627 --> 00:52:30,830
Speaker 1: seashell.".

973
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:36,450
Speaker 1: But then when you get the bow-wow, if you have bow-wow with you, he'll run and show you where to dig.

974
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,010
Speaker 1: But once you give him up, you don't have him anymore.

975
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:39,989
Speaker 0: You can get him with your back.

976
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never tried.

977
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:47,070
Speaker 1: Because then they give you this tuning fork that will just ding whenever there's one on the screen.

978
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:54,868
Speaker 1: And that is great, because then it's more of a puzzle of, "All right, what on this screen could possibly be the

979
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:55,630
Speaker 1: seashell?".

980
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, jump in that hole.

981
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,070
Speaker 1: Yep, throw a bomb in that hole.

982
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:00,300
Speaker 0: Oh, it's up on that roof?

983
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,269
Speaker 0: How the hell do I get up there?

984
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,210
Speaker 0: I guess I've got to go in every cave in the area.

985
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:07,130
Speaker 1: There doesn't seem like there's anything on the screen.

986
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:10,370
Speaker 1: Maybe there's an item I don't have yet, like the shovel.

987
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,277
Speaker 1: But I had a lot of fun with it.

988
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:15,970
Speaker 1: I only died two or three times.

989
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,038
Speaker 0: I only died early.

990
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,250
Speaker 0: Once you get some hearts, you're good.

991
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,344
Speaker 1: But I died early because I kept trying to damage boost past shit.

992
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,329
Speaker 1: I should have just waited for.

993
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,830
Speaker 1: And I succeeded about half the time.

994
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:26,710
Speaker 1: Like the Dreaming Shrine.

995
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,250
Speaker 0: Once you get some hearts, and especially if you get the defense armor.

996
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,017
Speaker 1: Which I did not.

997
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:32,969
Speaker 1: I got the attack armor.

998
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:33,505
Speaker 0: Okay.

999
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:37,030
Speaker 1: Because I figured, I never get hit by anything anyway.

1000
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,310
Speaker 0: Defense, because I figured the enemies don't have a lot of HP.

1001
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,159
Speaker 0: So the extra sword doesn't help you.

1002
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,049
Speaker 0: Plus, you can get upgraded sword from seashells.

1003
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,190
Speaker 1: They do stack though, so the final fight if you have both.

1004
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:48,950
Speaker 0: Is like two hits.

1005
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:54,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, every phase of the thing that the sword can use the sword on is basically like a 2/8 kill.

1006
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean it's not that much of a kill if you just do a spin attack.

1007
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if you got two bottles.

1008
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,570
Speaker 0: And if you got the shield, you can't really.

1009
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,330
Speaker 1: And Crazy Tracy's rubbed your secret medicine all over your naked body.

1010
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:07,350
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, you definitely do not need bottles if you got the armor.

1011
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,561
Speaker 1: Are there three bottles?

1012
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:09,108
Speaker 1: I only found two.

1013
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,650
Speaker 1: And there was an empty spot in my inventory.

1014
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,548
Speaker 0: I think there might be, but I also only had two.

1015
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,030
Speaker 1: Because, well part of it, I did get the one at the bottom fishing.

1016
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,190
Speaker 1: But I otherwise was not willing to engage with the fishing beyond the bare minimum.

1017
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:23,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a mini, the fishing minigame and the crane game minigame.

1018
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,690
Speaker 0: I only did the minimum necessary.

1019
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,145
Speaker 0: Yup.

1020
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,470
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I think I did like the maximum on both of them.

1021
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,270
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I think, is that fishing game is actually pretty sophisticated?

1022
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, it's got something on it.

1023
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,814
Speaker 0: The Game Boy game?

1024
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:37,730
Speaker 1: You could have sold that as its own game and people would have paid for it.

1025
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:38,150
Speaker 1: Probably.

1026
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,706
Speaker 1: That is the state of Game Boy games in the early 90s.

1027
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, you know, this is like a passion project made at night.

1028
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,130
Speaker 0: They went all in, that's why it's so awesome.

1029
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:47,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the sheer variety.

1030
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:51,670
Speaker 0: It only took 20, 25 plus years to get around to.

1031
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,766
Speaker 1: The other thing is like the Minish Cap tried to be funny, but like it wasn't.

1032
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:00,510
Speaker 1: Link's Awakening, honestly, there are many, like it is legitimately funny.

1033
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,250
Speaker 0: And also, those jokes that you're laughing at are unchanged.

1034
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:04,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the crazy thing.

1035
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:08,003
Speaker 0: Those aren't like updated jokes for the times.

1036
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:09,590
Speaker 0: Those are the same exact dialogues.

1037
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:14,189
Speaker 1: I think my favorite part is the dude who's like, "Man, they don't fucking make roosters like they used

1038
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:14,330
Speaker 1: to.".

1039
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:19,210
Speaker 1: And then you give him a rooster and what he does with that rooster is just A plus.

1040
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:24,687
Speaker 1: Or the dude who's like, "Yeah, just so you know, later on, I'm going to be lost in the mountains.

1041
00:55:24,807 --> 00:55:25,249
Speaker 1: Be ready for

1042
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:25,449
Speaker 1: that.".

1043
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:31,289
Speaker 1: And sure enough, like hours and hours later, you're in the mountains and you see this dude and he's just like lost out there.

1044
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:38,130
Speaker 1: So yeah, seriously, like this is a must play game of 2019.

1045
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:47,471
Speaker 1: Like this is one of the best games to come out in 2019, even though it also came out in 1993 and 1998.

1046
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:48,620
Speaker 0: '93 or '98, different time units.

1047
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:57,540
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1048
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,660
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1049
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:08,080
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1050
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,000
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1051
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,740
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1053
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,580
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1054
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,700
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1055
00:56:30,271 --> 00:56:40,350
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights, now that we are back from our nearly month-long hiatus, are still loading as I try to navigate and log back into Patreon.

1056
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,303
Speaker 1: This is taking longer than expected.

1057
00:56:42,364 --> 00:56:42,889
Speaker 1: Here we go!

1058
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:00,041
Speaker 1: (Reading).

1059
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:20,510
Speaker 1: I give it a 50/50 shot, and if we do a show on Monday, since we're coming back from PAX Sunday night pretty late, and we might be a little bit wrecked, and there is another PAX coming up pretty soon afterward.

1060
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:21,552
Speaker 1: But we'll see.

1061
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:34,010
Speaker 1: Expect still continuing hiatus and delays on shows and skipped content, but we will resume by mid-January at the latest with our usual gusto.

1062
00:57:34,490 --> 00:59:09,792
Speaker 1: You'll also see some YouTube videos coming out along the way, but for now, I leave you with... (Singing) (Singing) (Singing) (Singing) (Singing) (Singing) (Singing).
