1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,617
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday March 5th.

2
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:13,640
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,908
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:19,706
Speaker 1: We talk about graveyard Kitaro.

5
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,338
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:31,186
Speaker 1: I'm sure many of you noticed the lack of a show last night.

7
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:34,188
Speaker 0: I Wonder why that was?

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,384
Speaker 1: Well that our fault or perhaps did something happen.

9
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:43,030
Speaker 1: stay tuned tomorrow And we'll tell the story of what exactly we were doing last night.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,105
Speaker 0: Oh good, so we can just ignore that and I'll talk about something else right now.

11
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,672
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know I had a good day though.

12
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:59,216
Speaker 1: I mean we had a good dinner last night all things considering, but today at work I was you know we're dealing with a vendor and vendors often take you out to lunch, so Instead of going to my normal lunch.

13
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:10,654
Speaker 1: It's somewhat one of those like euro cafe or whatevers or limerage pizza We went to the capital grill, and I had some steak and let me tell you that was one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life.

14
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,124
Speaker 0: She got a lowercase grill far superior.

15
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:14,992
Speaker 1: the thing is though the steak was amazing It was.

16
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,150
Speaker 1: it was simple to smaller, but it tastes better.

17
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:29,689
Speaker 1: It was like this sirloin something But all they seasoned it with was salt pepper and a whole bunch of sugar And then they beat it with that and then they seared the outside black, but the inside was watching them.

18
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,360
Speaker 1: Well, they told me what they were gonna do and then they did it.

19
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,273
Speaker 0: uh-huh they could have been doing some secret stuff in that Kitchen.

20
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:37,049
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was pretty simple.

21
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:56,558
Speaker 1: But the thing is the steak was pretty good like that was a really damn good steak, but we also ordered some mashed potatoes and This might sound weird, but those were far away by perhaps an order of magnitude the best goddamn mashed potatoes I've ever eaten in my entire life.

22
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,690
Speaker 1: I doubt that I'll ever eat mashed potatoes that good again.

23
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,798
Speaker 0: What if you just go back there?

24
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,310
Speaker 1: I don't know if they could replicate it.

25
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,174
Speaker 1: They were too good.

26
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:03,978
Speaker 1: It was.

27
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,385
Speaker 1: it was really kind of crazy.

28
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:11,537
Speaker 0: The chef was like god damn I was off and like yeah But yeah, I can't feel too bad though.

29
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,245
Speaker 0: I had a rocky road cheesecake today.

30
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,810
Speaker 1: Oh a cheesecake.

31
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:17,990
Speaker 0: rocky road cheesecake.

32
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:22,984
Speaker 1: The thing is you but you didn't get to that I got was so sitting there right one this place.

33
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:32,570
Speaker 1: when you walk in now I think this is a little silly But they have these little boxes like cages on the wall And there's names on them and each box is a little bit of stuff.

34
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:38,563
Speaker 1: And if you're someone who eats at a place like this often You get a box and you keep your personal wine collection in there.

35
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:42,698
Speaker 1: some people have like books and stuff in there But I just found that silly.

36
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:58,106
Speaker 1: but our table, you know, we're trying to talk and we're enjoying our food but directly across from us is a gigantic is a gigantic portrait of the most Glowering angry bald bull looking motherfucker I've ever seen.

37
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:58,608
Speaker 0: ball ball.

38
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:00,794
Speaker 1: You look kind of like bald bull.

39
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:11,450
Speaker 1: imagine this like eight foot tall portrait original oil painting of bald Bull, you got a bald bull sticker and like put it up there staring at you angrily.

40
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,399
Speaker 1: And the thing is I kept looking at.

41
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,775
Speaker 1: I was trying to like lean over and read maybe Who it was.

42
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,570
Speaker 1: so I could look him up because all the everything else was kind of happy.

43
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,510
Speaker 1: There was big smile in pictures, but this one portrait and no we're walking out and I didn't say anything about it.

44
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,958
Speaker 1: You know, it's a business lunch or whatever.

45
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:34,328
Speaker 1: and my boss leans in and he says So, uh, that was quite an interesting portrait that was glowering at us the whole time.

46
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:34,729
Speaker 1: Wasn't it?

47
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,719
Speaker 0: He did if you would have said something about bald bull.

48
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,710
Speaker 1: Oh, that would have been like times 10, but still yeah.

49
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,747
Speaker 0: No, another interesting thing that happened to me today in addition to my rocky road cheesecake.

50
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:48,749
Speaker 0: It's doo-doo.

51
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,918
Speaker 0: No, no, not any doo-doo.

52
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:56,602
Speaker 0: No was when I was in the train coming home I was pretty tired and I was playing some Phoenix Wright 4.

53
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:00,316
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's not Phoenix Wright 4 It's Apollo justice one, but you know what?

54
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:03,627
Speaker 0: I mean ace attorney for whatever gakuten saiban.

55
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,394
Speaker 0: for there you go Take that one, right?

56
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,640
Speaker 0: So I'm playing it.

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,834
Speaker 0: I'm on episode three already, right and I got so tired I like dropped it into my lap Again.

58
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,015
Speaker 1: But maybe that tired.

59
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:24,338
Speaker 0: but in addition there was a guy sitting next to me on the train and I you know He's a businessman.

60
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:25,449
Speaker 0: He's got a pile of papers.

61
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:29,589
Speaker 0: So I you know, I look take my eyes and I glance over at his papers.

62
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:30,853
Speaker 1: Thank you.

63
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,318
Speaker 0: Well, he was a lawyer.

64
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,522
Speaker 0: I could tell from his papers.

65
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:36,070
Speaker 0: Definitely a lawyer some sort of patenting lawyer.

66
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:37,622
Speaker 0: He had a patent there.

67
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:43,305
Speaker 0: He was looking at The patent was from Yahoo, I think and I don't know.

68
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:44,870
Speaker 0: I couldn't read what the patent was about.

69
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:59,969
Speaker 0: I'm sure it was a bullshit software patent because you know, all software patents are bullshit pretty much and in this patent was The entire Like because like at first he was just like, you know the cover page and whatever, right?

70
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,250
Speaker 0: but then after you know I look I played Phoenix Wright again, and then I look back and he was reading the RFC for FTP.

71
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,794
Speaker 1: Huh?

72
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:12,934
Speaker 0: The entire RFC for FTP was pasted I guess for reference.

73
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:18,110
Speaker 0: within this patent as in the patent must have involved FTP some.

74
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:23,196
Speaker 0: So they put the entire RFC in there I've and he was reading it.

75
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,444
Speaker 1: I've never read the RFC for FTP.

76
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:26,106
Speaker 1: I've read other are.

77
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,333
Speaker 0: if she was reading me He was.

78
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:34,910
Speaker 0: he wasn't reading every word of it But he was definitely reading that RFC which implied to me that he didn't know what FTP was.

79
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,894
Speaker 0: These were some.

80
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:45,245
Speaker 1: probably there's a good chance that maybe that was actually someone else had recommended that perhaps this RFC Was prior art that invalidated the patent or so.

81
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:50,109
Speaker 0: I could have been something I don't know but that I was glancing over at a guy and that's you know.

82
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,554
Speaker 1: Plus I've read RFCs before and the thing is it's funny But the only are.

83
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:02,581
Speaker 1: I read RFCs a lot in college at university where I had to know these things But now that I'm in the real world even in enterprise IT.

84
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,990
Speaker 1: I don't need to read RFCs.

85
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,436
Speaker 1: There's nothing in an RFC.

86
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:09,047
Speaker 0: I need you know when you need to read an RFC.

87
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:09,730
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what I read.

88
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:10,796
Speaker 1: I read white papers.

89
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:11,962
Speaker 1: Yeah white papers.

90
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:13,369
Speaker 1: Tell me what I need to know RFCs.

91
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,270
Speaker 1: Tell me things that I don't care about, you know.

92
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:19,290
Speaker 0: You know when you read an RFC when you want to make a see that that's when you read.

93
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,476
Speaker 0: C is for cookies.

94
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:24,620
Speaker 0: good enough for me.

95
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:28,478
Speaker 1: Anyway, since it's anime manga comics day I got a quick news here.

96
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,467
Speaker 0: Cookie starts with C.

97
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:30,433
Speaker 1: Just cuz.

98
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:33,590
Speaker 1: we've talked about this a lot and came up in the late show at Katsucon.

99
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,108
Speaker 1: This comes up a lot now.

100
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:43,343
Speaker 1: But you know the anime industry is having some trouble and there's a lot of blame going around a lot of this blame going toward people downloading fan subs instead of buying anime.

101
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:56,409
Speaker 1: and I Want to make it very clear because I don't want to talk about this a lot that In at no point whenever I talk about any of this stuff Am I ever trying to be an apologist for people who download fan subs or illegally pirate or whatever?

102
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:05,277
Speaker 1: But at the same time I don't think that the anime industry would be doing much better if they somehow Eliminated all the piracy in the world.

103
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of this.

104
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:08,330
Speaker 1: they're blaming these people.

105
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:21,070
Speaker 1: But those people may be wrong in a lot of ways But at the same time those people are not the cause of the industry's problems, but all that aside There's an interesting little blurb here on the animators Network.

106
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:22,857
Speaker 1: Here's a quote.

107
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:25,129
Speaker 1: I'll read the quote then I'll explain who said it and why.

108
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:38,990
Speaker 1: perhaps if so many fans weren't getting their anime from illegal file sharing sites or unlicensed streaming sites We might have expanded our UK catalog more quickly as it stands now.

109
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,670
Speaker 1: However, we have a better shot at growing our business with lace than maintaining an overseas branch.

110
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:56,557
Speaker 1: Yes, it turns out that John Ledford who is pretty much mr ATV who is that the CEO of a TV films is going to wear lace Instead of distributing anime in the UK.

111
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,540
Speaker 1: you heard it here first.

112
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:01,070
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm sure that will sell lots of anime.

113
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:02,624
Speaker 1: That'll sell lots of something.

114
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,065
Speaker 1: now Lace, you know that was kind of a lame joke.

115
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,590
Speaker 1: lace refers to a company that will.

116
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:14,990
Speaker 1: Looks like they're going to kind of outsource their distribution or whatever to the UK to this other company.

117
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 1: Okay, no one really cares.

118
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:29,890
Speaker 1: so I'm not gonna really go into it further, but It's starting to bother me that the anime industry and I'm seeing more and more of these kind of Semi-official off-the-cuff statements pretty much directly blaming piracy for the state of the anime industry.

119
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:38,450
Speaker 1: maybe it has more to do with the fact that They're really marketing a lot of anime at the people who are the least likely to have the money to buy the anime.

120
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:44,490
Speaker 1: They're marketing the shows that are the least likely to be bought on DVD and are more likely to be watched on TV.

121
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,690
Speaker 1: But oh, they're not on TV in the US because we don't have that sort of model over here.

122
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,716
Speaker 0: And they're on Adult Swim, right?

123
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,037
Speaker 0: Look at this.

124
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:58,519
Speaker 0: They they show kids shows on Adult Swim, right and So who likes the shows?

125
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,424
Speaker 0: Well kids.

126
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:06,210
Speaker 0: kids are watching Adult Swim Of course kids without money kids without money kids you don't need and they try to the episode of Naruto again.

127
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,297
Speaker 1: So they're not gonna buy the DVD.

128
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:12,449
Speaker 0: and then they bring a bunch of other shows out on DVD Which are for kids and they try to sell them to kids who have no money.

129
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,959
Speaker 0: Maybe you should take a look over at that HBO where they have Adult shows and adults have money.

130
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:34,190
Speaker 1: There's also the problem that I'm sell them to adults of course, the anime industry is very secretive here, but there is definitely a lot of evidence that the majority of the money is made in merchandising and If you go to anime conventions nowadays, well, they pretty much always.

131
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,044
Speaker 1: 90% of the merchandise is for those shows that have the same problems as before.

132
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:50,629
Speaker 1: it's for like three or four shows But in addition a lot of it is really kind of classless kitschy Crappy little crap tchotchkes that I don't know.

133
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:54,810
Speaker 1: I'm willing to spend 40 bucks on an old Leiji Matsumoto movie poster.

134
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:59,600
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to spend four dollars on a PVC poorly made of a character from a show.

135
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,061
Speaker 1: I don't like.

136
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,793
Speaker 1: yeah, pretty much I Show about this.

137
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,027
Speaker 1: we've talked about this before, but I'll talk about it again.

138
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:22,683
Speaker 1: I'm sure Even if this is right, this is true And you know you're losing money, and you're not able to expand because of people downloading fan subs and such Snarky comments like that are not the professional way to go about this.

139
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,390
Speaker 0: No not really really.

140
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,315
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know.

141
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:38,294
Speaker 1: if you're a businessman you should I don't know have a press release with some sort of formal statement Like a professional businessman and not like some schmuck I Just don't like.

142
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:38,636

Speaker 0: I don't remember exactly when.

154
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:20,470

155
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,484
Speaker 0: There's like a hundred plus novels in this series about the leopard-headed king in his kingdom and whatnot.

Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do a kind of more thorough review at some point.

165
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:58,547
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest manga ever, but it's a good manga, and it's a fantasy manga.

166
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,390
Speaker 0: There's not too many of them.

167
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:07,610
Speaker 0: it's a somewhat serious fantasy manga and More than anything it really makes me want to read the goo in saga itself.

168
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:11,039
Speaker 1: You know because hear that vertical translated bring it out.

169
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:11,440

Speaker 0: they brought out five or something volumes of the goo in saga.

171
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:17,037

Speaker 0: It's fine.

175
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,721

00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:28,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know right, but anyway so Vertical.

178
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:42,806

Speaker 0: We'll say anything about it I can't?

185
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,345
Speaker 1: we have like the worst industry relations in the world.

186
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,074
Speaker 0: well cuz pretty much You know we won't.

187
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:15,210
Speaker 0: we refuse to sell out, and I feel like it would be dishonest.

188
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:28,010
Speaker 0: You know at least if I'm not gonna sell out right I'm gonna make it clear to the person sending me free stuff that I am not giving them any Guarantees of a good review of any review at all of anything right you know.

189
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,296
Speaker 0: But I did say we might.

190
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:34,738
Speaker 0: if they send us free stuff at the very least We'll give it away as a prize right?

191
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,650
Speaker 0: so I of course already buy every manga vertical publishes.

192
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,235
Speaker 0: No, I'll probably continue to do so.

193
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:44,650
Speaker 0: so I have here the entire three volumes of this manga.

194
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,914
Speaker 0: It's the whole manga.

195
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,540
Speaker 0: there are only three volumes of it.

196
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,530
Speaker 0: volume three is the final volume, and I have all three.

197
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:54,620
Speaker 0: They sent him to me So we got to give them away to somebody.

198
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,544
Speaker 0: huh now.

199
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:56,910
Speaker 1: We've done come now.

200
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,990
Speaker 1: I was thinking fast, and I've just got decided that by and large contests on podcasts are largely worthless.

201
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,159
Speaker 1: They're usually not that entertaining.

202
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,425
Speaker 1: They're usually kind of laying.

203
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:11,441
Speaker 1: they always end up with some sort of Boring raffle with the drumroll at the end.

204
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:15,418
Speaker 0: yeah, so I was thinking well We just keep these things and then we'll give them away.

205
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:20,419
Speaker 0: and like a convention or something right you know cuz we can give away For like the anime match game or something like that.

206
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:25,725
Speaker 1: I don't know yeah, but the thing is after katsu-kan We've actually got some time before the next convention.

207
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:30,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like oh, it's a great I'll just do that, but then there aren't any more conventions for a very long time.

208
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,030
Speaker 0: There's many many months going by so these books are to realize precious space in our house.

209
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:39,050
Speaker 1: I've saying that means that I'm gonna wake up tomorrow.

210
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:42,370
Speaker 1: It's gonna be August and we have three conventions in four weeks.

211
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,431
Speaker 0: Awesome.

212
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:43,813
Speaker 0: Yes.

213
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,519
Speaker 0: We do have three conventions is four weeks.

214
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:46,643
Speaker 1: You know any conventions.

215
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:46,924
Speaker 1: We're gonna.

00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,048
Speaker 1: Have one summer comes do.

217
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:50,475
Speaker 1: Why do we do this?

218
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:51,219
Speaker 0: so anyway?

219
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,870
Speaker 0: We need to think of some way to get rid to give these away?

220
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:55,778
Speaker 0: What do you what do you think rim?

221
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,090
Speaker 1: ah we could have a contest to come up with the way to give them away?

222
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,254
Speaker 0: No, that's too lame.

223
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:01,164
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna keep it simple.

224
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,350
Speaker 0: right now.

225
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,036

Speaker 0: I should mail you these manga for free now.

229
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:21,081
Speaker 0: Keep in mind most people Entering the contest we have on podcasts.

230
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,630
Speaker 0: Do not follow the directions.

231
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:24,935
Speaker 1: I'll say this now.

232
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:28,530
Speaker 1: Dave and Joel actually wow I haven't listened to them in a while actually yeah.

233
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, they're actually their latest episode was high quality.

234
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,706
Speaker 1: Oh really see it wasn't any matter of.

235
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,733
Speaker 1: not low quality It's a matter of.

236
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:45,450
Speaker 0: I haven't had headphones since I sent my headphones back to get repaired now But their latest episode was well above their average the the one about like the wolf cannon or whatever.

237
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,504
Speaker 1: It's pretty high quality wolf cannon.

238
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:53,285
Speaker 1: Yeah Something like that, but I remember they talked about when they had a contest before that.

239
00:15:53,666 --> 00:16:05,924
Speaker 1: whenever you enter a contest And there's rules They're always the people who break the rules on purpose because there's the chance that the people being judges look and say wow That guy had the balls to break the rules plus one.

240
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:06,024
Speaker 1: well.

241
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:13,752
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you right now at geek nights Their disclaimer is times infinity for us if you break the rules you're not gonna win no matter how cool You are.

242
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:24,350
Speaker 0: yeah, if you send in the best reason ever for why I should mail you these manga But it's like one poorly spelled Unpunctuated sentence you ain't getting shit in fact.

243
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,629
Speaker 0: I'll just be rate you on the show and call you out sure you want him to say why they want the manga.

244
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,409
Speaker 1: maybe should Get him to write some sort of literary like a treatise on I don't know Tezuka, and then we can publish that.

245
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,443
Speaker 0: no I think we'll just keep it simple something people don't have to research for.

246
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:37,825
Speaker 1: I don't know.

247
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:49,056
Speaker 0: I like the high bar yeah, but anyway you have to write an Essay and it which means it should be long enough to where me and rim would consider Okay, that's an essay and not just a paragraph.

248
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,963
Speaker 1: you need at least the middle school equivalent which is five.

249
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:56,510
Speaker 1: introductory paragraph body paragraph body paragraph body paragraph.

250
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:57,453
Speaker 1: Conclusion.

251
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,736
Speaker 1: I want a thesis statement.

252
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,785
Speaker 1: a lot of people say you should start with a global statement.

253
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:08,837
Speaker 0: if there are any any at Spelling or punctuation errors that are egregious You automatically lose.

254
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,867
Speaker 0: you have no chance to survive.

255
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:14,116
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna say this style counts.

256
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:20,117
Speaker 1: I gotta I gotta get this out here because I'm a student of the lively art of writing School of writing.

257
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:21,810
Speaker 1: if you don't know what that is it's a book.

258
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,920
Speaker 1: I Demand that you buy it and read it and learn how to write from it.

259
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,116
Speaker 1: however if you decide to start your essay with a Global statement and narrow in on a thesis.

260
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:30,803
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tear your essay up as in.

261
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:37,030
Speaker 1: I'm gonna print it out and then tear it up Alright, so Basically think about this.

262
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:50,757
Speaker 0: This is a really easy contest when you get right down to it because your reason for wanting these manga Will only come into play if you and someone else both Follow all the rules of the contest.

263
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:57,249
Speaker 0: if you make a submission that doesn't break the rules and satisfies us You will probably win.

264
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,237
Speaker 0: It's really easy.

265
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:02,510
Speaker 0: Just follow the rules and win pretty much guaranteed.

266
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:11,661
Speaker 0: If not enough people submit entries and or all of the entries are bad Then I'll just hold on to these or I don't know what I'll do, but yes.

267
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,324
Speaker 1: We I'm gonna.

268
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:16,255

00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,807
Speaker 0: I can't give away the prize.

271
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:23,723
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah Well, I guess it's like if you had a raffle and nobody bought a ticket.

272
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,736
Speaker 0: You don't give the car away To nobody.

273
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:28,342
Speaker 0: well you give it to yourself.

274
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know you give it away.

275
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:38,164
Speaker 1: You give it away to Joey Jojo Shabbatou from Clifton and That just means you don't give it away, and then you auction the same car off next year.

276
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:41,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway Yeah, so that's that's the deal.

277
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,770
Speaker 0: I'll repeat this probably next week and maybe the week after.

278
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:49,107
Speaker 0: The deadline is pretty much When I feel like it.

279
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,938
Speaker 1: So yeah pretty much the sooner the better.

280
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,750
Speaker 1: cuz if a good one comes in we're gonna end the contest right then maybe maybe.

281
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,255
Speaker 1: And now.

282
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,679
Speaker 1: well I got it one last time.

283
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,444
Speaker 0: we got email to eat nights at front row.

284
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:02,066
Speaker 0: crew calm.

285
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:09,682
Speaker 0: the subject should be something like goo and saga Contest or manga contest or vertical manga giveaway or anything like.

286
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:19,570
Speaker 1: and seriously again a big shout out to all the people at vertical listening right now because One you know it's not a shill because we kind of sing the praises of them all the time regardless.

287
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:27,848
Speaker 0: That's probably why they like us because you know if you don't believe us go way back and listen to like some episodes about like Apollo's song and stuff.

288
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:35,666
Speaker 1: well Yeah, you know if there was a podcast where all they did was periodically say man geek nights is so awesome I'd probably really like that podcast.

289
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:42,929
Speaker 0: yeah But go back and listen like the Apollo song episode and you'll see we were shilling them before they sent us free shit.

290
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:48,663
Speaker 0: the free Shit has absolutely no Influential effect on our liking of them or the things they make.

291
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:51,415
Speaker 1: but I got some real news here And this is kind of.

292
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,430
Speaker 1: this is important news actual news.

293
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,018
Speaker 1: I have a lot to say about this, but luckily it won't take long because well I have a lot to say regarding it.

294
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:15,779
Speaker 1: the actual news story here is pretty simple But we were at katsu kana recently and as you may be aware Scott and I are our kind of epic panelists in that If you look at a list of the numbers of panels events like guest appearances and whatever we've done at conventions It's kind of frightening.

295
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:31,750
Speaker 1: We did like six things at katsu kana and Every convention kind of handles panels differently, and I'd always been of the mind for pretty much as long as I've been going that Otakon Should by all rights have far and away the best panels from fans of any convention.

296
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:33,635
Speaker 1: They have the biggest pool to draw from.

297
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:39,110
Speaker 1: they're like this mega epic gigantic amazing convention, and they've had good panels.

298
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,441
Speaker 1: There's always good panels at Otakon.

299
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:46,750
Speaker 0: Well go to any convention There's good panels, but he much the Otakon never quite seemed to reach their full potential.

300
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, you would think that you know Otakon so big so awesome.

301
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,550
Speaker 0: every panel should like completely blow your mind, right?

302
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,132
Speaker 0: Right because they don't have any.

303
00:20:55,373 --> 00:21:05,895
Speaker 0: you know they actually have less panels in quantity than some other conventions because you know they dev You know they don't go over all the overnight You know and stuff like that.

304
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:11,930
Speaker 0: so they have just as many panels as say katsu kana or kinetic on or something like that.

305
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,550
Speaker 0: But they have a much bigger pool of people.

306
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,622
Speaker 0: Shouldn't and a bigger money and bigger everything.

307
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:18,105
Speaker 0: shouldn't?

308
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:28,661
Speaker 0: the panels be better You know in aggregate than the panels at other conventions, and they were a little bit kind of yeah, but at the same time Remember our our start in paneling.

309
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:35,610
Speaker 1: well our second start our first start was at a convention I shall not name because that was the convention with the midget prostitutes worst convention ever.

310
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,699
Speaker 1: But the second anime counter.

311
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:41,391
Speaker 1: we ever went to Otakon 2002.

312
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:45,710
Speaker 1: We went to the anime club summit found that the people who were supposed to run it weren't there.

313
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,087
Speaker 1: So we pretended to be them and ran the goddamn panel.

314
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:51,430
Speaker 1: yep Yeah, that was professional.

315
00:21:51,490 --> 00:22:01,064
Speaker 1: But last year there's kind of a shake-up in the Otakon panels department and the people who took over did kind of an awesome job Of fixing everything and as best as could be expected from anybody.

316
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:07,216
Speaker 1: now of course after Otakon I gave them a kind of long Semi tirade of.

317
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:17,450
Speaker 1: here's how you could make panels a billion times better at Otakon now Not only if they implemented in some form pretty much everything I suggested though I'll bet they came up with a lot of this on their own.

318
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:32,166
Speaker 1: I'm not going to claim that I am the reason for all this by any stretch but they actually went beyond and thought of things that I never would have thought of and Panels at Otakon 2008 are pretty much guaranteed to be the best panels Otakon has ever had.

319
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,014
Speaker 1: they have completely redone this Pretty much.

320
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:43,643
Speaker 1: if you were stupid you will be unable to put forth a panel or even be considered Because I'm gonna break down the rules here.

321
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:44,890
Speaker 1: first off.

322
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,212
Speaker 1: They have an official form.

323
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:51,191
Speaker 1: you have to fill out to get a panel at Otakon now in this form is Amazing.

324
00:22:51,211 --> 00:23:03,798
Speaker 1: you gotta give your real name your real address your email address the names and addresses and contact info of every other panelist the name of your panel a 100 word or less description of your panel?

325
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,765
Speaker 1: is it an 18 plus panel?

326
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,250
Speaker 1: is it an industry panel?

327
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,799
Speaker 1: Have you ever presented this panel before?

328
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,450
Speaker 1: yes at a previous Otakon yes at some other pack convention?

329
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:18,009
Speaker 1: No, but I have been a panelist before.

330
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:25,164
Speaker 1: If you have or you say you have You have to give the names of the conventions and the names of the panels.

331
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,670
Speaker 1: they can check and make sure you're not lying.

332
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:37,090
Speaker 1: You have to write a short paragraph of why this panel should be accepted You have to state all the equipment and technical stuff you need and you have to numerate pretty much everything about this panel.

333
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,257
Speaker 1: That's the first step.

334
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:47,452
Speaker 1: that is the lowest barrier to entry right there And that is asking more than pretty much any anime con has ever asked before Mm-hmm.

335
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:51,906
Speaker 1: now in addition to that a lot of cons give you free badges for doing panels.

336
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,881
Speaker 1: never con has done it differently Some kinds of kind of lacks.

337
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:56,250
Speaker 1: I remember one con.

338
00:23:56,311 --> 00:24:06,795
Speaker 1: I won't name it cuz I like this kind of lot But we I pretty much walked in on Friday to the ops area and said yeah, I'm a guest Can I have my badge?

339
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,525
Speaker 1: and they handed me a blank guest badge and a marker?

340
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:10,790
Speaker 0: Oh?

341
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I and part of me thoughts.

342
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,870
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and I need badges for my roadies.

343
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:20,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like nine of them isn't poor kids?

344
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:23,430
Speaker 0: when you're going to convention is time to volunteer right?

345
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:29,370
Speaker 0: Confidently just walk into ops and say I get well grab a go to reg.

346
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,978
Speaker 0: Just take a program right.

347
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,772
Speaker 0: look for the name of a guest who doesn't have their picture in the program Name.

348
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:38,417
Speaker 0: that is the same gender as yourself.

349
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:39,059
Speaker 1: You know what.

350
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:42,310
Speaker 0: go to con ops and say I'm so and so I need a badge.

351
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:55,243
Speaker 1: When you walk out with confidence and see what happens when you walk up to the to the ops and you walk up to the person sitting there and you say Hi, my name is Greg Ayers, and I'm here to be a guest at the fact.

352
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,869
Speaker 1: They're going to beat you.

353
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:00,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had to pick someone who's picked like a webcomic.

354
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,829
Speaker 0: They won't know what the webcomic guess looks like.

355
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,525
Speaker 0: yeah The thing is I'll say you got to be really key can't be like nerdy.

356
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:10,303
Speaker 0: you got to be like yeah I'm so and so come looking for how do I get my badge?

357
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:11,429
Speaker 1: see the thing is I?

358
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:16,010
Speaker 1: Also, have a sneaking suspicion because I've seen people attempt this sort of thing before.

359
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,500
Speaker 1: It's almost like the staff at most.

360
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,970
Speaker 1: cons can sniff out if you're legitimate or not.

361
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,576
Speaker 1: Regardless of how you act I could.

362
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:24,886
Speaker 0: I could probably get a badge at any con.

363
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:25,829
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

364
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:29,279
Speaker 0: Any anime convention in the United States?

365
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:32,870
Speaker 0: I think I could get a badge for free without having just showing up.

366
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:36,965
Speaker 1: I think Otacon would take the most work, and they're probably anime.

367
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:39,254
Speaker 0: expo might be a little difficult But any other ones?

368
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:40,198
Speaker 1: now you know what.

369
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,990
Speaker 1: there's one exception to that the New York anime festival.

370
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,682
Speaker 1: You cannot get a fake badge to that car.

371
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:47,866
Speaker 0: I guess not.

372
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:48,970
Speaker 1: I didn't really try.

373
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,570
Speaker 1: But actually a non kind of showed up out of the blue to come to the con with us.

374
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,437
Speaker 1: He wasn't like a guest or anything.

375
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,708
Speaker 1: He just came to like chill with us.

376
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:00,870
Speaker 1: So uh we're walking up, and we have our like guest badges and a nonth is with us.

377
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:03,341
Speaker 1: So I pull my usual art.

378
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:14,310
Speaker 1: enough carry this thing for us And you're our roadie, and we're walking in and there's this big guy standing at the escalator And he looks at my badge, and it says guest and he looks at Scott's badge.

379
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,083
Speaker 1: It says guess and he looks at the nonth who is buried under a heavy thing.

380
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:20,786
Speaker 1: He's carrying and the guy says well Where's your badge?

381
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:24,181
Speaker 1: Yeah, I held up my bad guest badge and say hey.

382
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:24,664
Speaker 1: He's our roadie.

383
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:25,528
Speaker 1: He's just carrying our stuff in.

384
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:26,030
Speaker 1: where's his badge?

385
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:27,793
Speaker 1: He's he's like.

386
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:28,437
Speaker 1: Where's this badge?

387
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:31,170
Speaker 1: god damn it, so we had to go get him a badge.

388
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:34,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but yeah, I don't try to scam badges from cons.

389
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:42,874
Speaker 1: unless it's the con that shall might not be named, but anyway Uh Otacon now base don't try to do it like for evil But try to do it.

390
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,120
Speaker 0: just see what happens for funny.

391
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,608
Speaker 1: if you actually there's

392
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:46,110
Speaker 0: a difference

393
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:58,384
Speaker 1: I'll say this if you actually get a free badge doing that I Would recommend that pretty much right after they give it to you tell them what you did and hand the badge back Cuz there's a small chance that they'll laugh and then give you a free badge.

394
00:26:58,705 --> 00:26:59,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good move.

395
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,560
Speaker 0: But anyway also, they'll go oh shit, and they won't.

396
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:05,070
Speaker 0: then a real guest will come in and say where's my badge.

397
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,466
Speaker 0: They're like need to see some ID.

398
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:09,994
Speaker 0: Be like it's.

399
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:13,325
Speaker 0: it's like the guy who flew over from Japan ultra-famous.

400
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:14,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a kirakami.

401
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:18,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, he says where he says where's my badge.

402
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,649
Speaker 0: They'll be like need to see some ID.

403
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:29,504
Speaker 0: be like Oh Rims thing of the day reference my it's coming.

404
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:30,226
Speaker 1: It's coming.

405
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:33,616
Speaker 1: He'll kick you apart, but All right real briefly.

406
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:41,890
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into the rest of this, but the final issue Here is that they're not gonna give you a free badge just because you get a panel at Otacon.

407
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:56,894
Speaker 1: they will give you a free badge before the con if you have presented at Otacon before and They have an indication from whatever, you know past performance commentary emails that you actually Ran a good panel.

408
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:57,959
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

409
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,450
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you do not get a free badge.

410
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:11,270
Speaker 1: However, if you run a really good panel, you will be given a refund after the convention If you do not show up to run your panel or you run a bad panel.

411
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,180
Speaker 1: They do not say this outright, but it is heavily implied.

412
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:17,230
Speaker 1: You will probably be blacklisted forever.

413
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't say anything like that But that is my can imagine.

414
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:37,253
Speaker 0: why would they be asking all these sorts of information and tracking it if they weren't gonna do Something like that or at least keep the option available I'm sure like if they really needed a panel and you would run one before and you know, you know They'd be like, all right.

415
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:47,312
Speaker 1: We'll throw them in it like, you know crack it on Sunday or something, but so pretty much Otacon my hat is off to you because this is such a good system like is it one?

416
00:28:47,713 --> 00:29:07,570
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be very interested at the quality of the panels but also at the variety of the panels because I Have a suspicion that certain kinds of panels that pretty much anyone who would run them would do a bad job And I think that the kinds of panels that people who are good at running panels are interested in will start to dominate the convention.

417
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:13,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I mean I've already submitted God like seven panels and I've got about nine more.

418
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:15,970
Speaker 1: as soon as I get the rest I'm not running seven panels.

419
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:22,245
Speaker 1: You know, I wouldn't be too opposed to running events all day Friday and Saturday at Otacon.

420
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:24,110
Speaker 0: However, however, that's not gonna happen.

421
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:31,207
Speaker 0: I here's how only if there are other people's depends like I could just be sit down only if I did not have to run anything on Sunday.

422
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,037
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but things are they.

423
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:45,623
Speaker 1: this is a good system because it's gonna also encourage like new people can still try to do panels You can still kind of break in but you have to be at least a little bit professional And if you do a good job you get rewarded.

424
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,012
Speaker 1: if you a bad job You're done.

425
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:56,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll let them sort of have this cycle going of new people who are potentially good come in They try to run a panel if they do a good job.

426
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:56,705
Speaker 0: Hooray.

427
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:57,670
Speaker 0: We have a new good pen.

428
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:12,098
Speaker 1: I think this is also going to lead to panel dynasties which could be really good because if there's someone out there who runs an awesome freaking panel and Every year they run a different awesome freaking panel You don't you get free.

429
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:23,890
Speaker 1: that's like the best thing that can happen to a con Especially if they get the reputation like oh every year at Otacon on Saturday night They show the violent movie or they have that guy that does that panel about that thing.

430
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:46,119
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the Why you gotta be doing that, all right, you know giving it away every now and then when I get bored I just type Hokuto no can into YouTube and watch a couple of head explode ease and I was doing this the other day.

431
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,098
Speaker 1: cuz Scott and I were talking about it kind of out of the blue and We watch one video.

432
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,490
Speaker 1: It's him versus the colonel, which I I like this.

433
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:02,101
Speaker 1: I like that clip mostly because of the absolutely piss-poor animation but There was one of those related links in YouTube and I clicked on it.

434
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:04,350
Speaker 0: related links on YouTube is the best thing ever.

435
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:08,047
Speaker 0: That's I gotta say and I had never seen this fight before.

436
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:14,530
Speaker 1: however Before you watch my thing of the day I would recommend that if you can you try to watch the second episode of Hokuto.

437
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:14,951
Speaker 1: No, can.

438
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:16,255
Speaker 0: yes, I watched.

439
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:18,642
Speaker 0: if you watch the second episode of Hokuto no can.

440
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,110
Speaker 0: let me explain what happens in the first episode.

441
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:22,890
Speaker 0: He beats the bad guy by doing what?

442
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:38,610
Speaker 0: Right in the second episode what he does is he puts his thumbs into the bad guys temples And he says after I pull my thumbs that well after I pull my thumbs out You will die seven seconds later, and then there's fucking digital timers.

443
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:49,310
Speaker 0: He pulls his thumbs out a digital timer appears on the screen and counts down By tenths of a second from seven down to zero and when it hits zero dudes head explodes.

444
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:53,747
Speaker 1: So after you even if you don't watch that at least you know what happened.

445
00:31:53,767 --> 00:32:07,336
Speaker 1: because in this video Ken Shiro is doing something and this guy is pissed at him, which is off in the plot of a Hokuto no can episode and This guy comes at him like I'll get you How dare you turn your back on me?

446
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:10,550
Speaker 1: and Ken Shiro does the thing that I love it when characters do in any show?

447
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,284
Speaker 1: Where they turn around on someone like that, but they don't hit him or anything.

448
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:16,053
Speaker 1: they just look at him like well He does.

449
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:18,750
Speaker 0: he sort of hits him like no no no not even paying attention.

450
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,486
Speaker 1: Well after that when yeah, I'll get you.

451
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,115
Speaker 1: yeah He's about to get him.

452
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,630
Speaker 1: and then Ken just turns around and just looks at him like what are you gonna?

453
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:31,230
Speaker 1: Do and the guys like oh shit, and then and Ken's like go ahead.

454
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,315
Speaker 1: So he does the same thing that Dut-dut to the temples.

455
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:40,840
Speaker 0: he puts his thumbs in Ken Shiro's temples like he's gonna kill him, and then he says You're already dead.

456
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:54,230
Speaker 1: He says it but Watch this because I did not expect what was going to happen and of all the possible things that could have happened This was by far the most epic thing and the funniest thing that could have happened.

457
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,835
Speaker 0: This is all the Hokuto.

458
00:32:55,855 --> 00:33:01,598
Speaker 0: no Ken you need to see because this is pretty much the highest point in the show that there could possibly be.

459
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:04,156
Speaker 0: this is This is actually.

460
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:06,729
Speaker 0: I would consider this a high point of anime comedy.

461
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,256
Speaker 1: Then it seems like a lot of the high points of anime comedy or unintentional.

462
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:13,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

463
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:24,123
Speaker 0: it could have been intentionally funny I Think the when he says the oh more whatever How many seconds will I die in ten ten seconds all right?

464
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,566
Speaker 0: I'll count it down for you.

465
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:26,829
Speaker 1: kind of answers like oh ten.

466
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like all right.

467
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:29,661
Speaker 0: Well.

468
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:30,928
Speaker 0: Let's count it down shall we?

469
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,336
Speaker 1: I should watch it again.

470
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:36,100
Speaker 1: In fact.

471
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,828
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch it while Scott does this thing of the day.

472
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,820
Speaker 0: no Let's watch it after so I can just do your thing today.

473
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:44,833
Speaker 0: All right, so you know and you ever seen him I'm watching it.

474
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:45,595
Speaker 1: Do you think of the day?

475
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:46,920
Speaker 0: This is not good.

476
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:47,502
Speaker 1: Just do it.

477
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:52,125
Speaker 0: No all right, so You ever watch like an old movie like.

478
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:56,963
Speaker 0: I don't know Monty Python the Holy Grail or the Pink Panther and they have those sort of.

479
00:33:57,124 --> 00:34:01,830
Speaker 0: you know those kinds of movie openings Sort of like the Rocky and Bullwinkle TV show opener.

480
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:06,069
Speaker 0: You know a movie that it's got like a little swing in music and sort of like bright colors.

481
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,354
Speaker 0: You know that kind of thing.

482
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:07,655
Speaker 0: well.

483
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,703
Speaker 0: generally a lot of 60s movies opened like that.

484
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:13,937
Speaker 1: any movie that has a clever or a cool Opening I always just feel better about overall.

485
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,224
Speaker 0: alright, so these guys what they did.

486
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:23,985
Speaker 0: I don't know who they are, but they basically took Star Wars and they made an opener for Star Wars.

487
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:28,261
Speaker 0: That's in that 1960s movie swing and opening style.

488
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:29,286
Speaker 1: this is pretty hot.

489
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:30,009
Speaker 0: It's pretty hot.

490
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:31,619
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

491
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:31,981
Speaker 0: I didn't.

492
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:34,790
Speaker 0: I couldn't find any better things of the day whatever.

493
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:37,096
Speaker 0: This is the best thing I saw.

494
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,306
Speaker 0: so so watch it all right rim.

495
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,190
Speaker 0: stop watching the hook done.

496
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,609
Speaker 0: Okay, but he's it's about to blow up five.

497
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,550
Speaker 1: Four just gave it away three anyway.

498
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,679
Speaker 0: So all right, that's what we're talking about today.

499
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me let me introduce.

500
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:51,310
Speaker 0: you want me to introduce.

501
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:57,258
Speaker 1: I'll say this though for those of you are looking for the rest of our katsu gan covers Do we got another hour or so?

502
00:34:57,781 --> 00:34:59,089
Speaker 1: we record that when we have time?

503
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:12,010
Speaker 0: alright, so In Japan you know it's very strange because there are many animes and mangas out there And it seems like there's a lot that are you know popular in one place and not popular in other place right for example?

504
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:24,929
Speaker 0: One piece crazy popular in Japan and Italy not so much in the u.s.. Right didn't didn't do so well here But there's reasons for that right yeah at one piece was not good I don't know Ken crazy popular in Asia not popular here at all.

505
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,013
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

506
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,582
Speaker 1: I think that everyone who watches and likes hokuto.

507
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:30,810
Speaker 1: no Ken watches it on a semi-ironic level.

508
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:34,784
Speaker 0: Maybe of course there are people who flat-out deny that they do that.

509
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:36,169
Speaker 1: yeah, but I don't know.

510
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:47,701
Speaker 0: I Watching it seriously, I I can't say that it's good all right, but son like detective Conan, right Super so crazy popular in Japan right like.

511
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,710
Speaker 0: they're on almost 500 episodes of detective Conan.

512
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:55,063
Speaker 0: You know what and they put you put it on TV in the u.s.. Flop.

513
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,050
Speaker 1: You know what scary geek nights is catching up to that.

514
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:01,729
Speaker 0: I guess there's there's many geek nights as there are detective Conan almost.

515
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,647
Speaker 0: So you could have watched every detective Conan instead of listening to geek nights.

516
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,250
Speaker 0: is that what you're saying?

517
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,314
Speaker 1: You probably should have to?

518
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,785
Speaker 0: oh yeah, but the 12 movies.

519
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:10,930
Speaker 0: I think we have to catch up with that.

520
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,174
Speaker 0: We need 12 nice movies.

521
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,323
Speaker 1: We'll get started on the first one as soon as we get that camera right.

522
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:24,752
Speaker 0: another one of these things That's crazy popular in the Japan and spit relatively unknown in the u.s.. Is Kitaro?

523
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:30,010
Speaker 0: right and it's it's tricky because this hakaba kitaro and gigi gay.

524
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:40,075
Speaker 0: No kitaro, and let me explain from talking to Japanese Person and reading Wikipedia and anime news network I believe you mean Wikipedia.

525
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:46,976
Speaker 0: that inside joke is only relevant to you all right Wikipedia a Japanese person and Anime news network.

526
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:56,898
Speaker 0: I am now going to tell you all you need to know about Gigi no kitaro and hakaba kitaro, and then we are going to talk about the latest in the Kitaro saga.

527
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,487
Speaker 0: all right, so This was a manga called hakaba kitaro.

528
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:09,178
Speaker 0: all right And the manga was from 1959. there are nine volumes of it.

529
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:10,483
Speaker 0: That's it right.

530
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,390
Speaker 0: It was a popular manga.

531
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:23,750
Speaker 0: Then they made a TV series called gigi gay no kitaro based on the manga But it wasn't super based on the manga right it was a little bit based on the manga.

532
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:30,894
Speaker 0: It was like the same characters the same kind of setting right, but it's much more like a kid-friendly show because you know it wasn't.

533
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:35,769
Speaker 0: it wasn't as serious and as didn't have some of the things the manga hadn't it right?

534
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:42,923
Speaker 0: and Gigi gay no kitaro was a lot more like a Monster of the week kind of plot structure.

535
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:47,750
Speaker 0: you know every week There's a different sort of monster going on and we deal with it.

536
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,036
Speaker 0: And then the episodes over.

537
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:51,950
Speaker 0: it was a lot more kind of happy and silly and and you know for kids.

538
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:57,305
Speaker 0: And that was a 65 episode TV series from in 1968 and 69. this is old shit man old shit.

539
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:04,353
Speaker 0: Then they made another TV series in 1971 and 72.

540
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:05,897
Speaker 0: Then they made another TV series.

541
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,100
Speaker 0: you see where this is going.

542
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:09,086
Speaker 0: there are like five different.

543
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,357
Speaker 0: gigi gay no kitaro TV series is right.

544
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:19,041
Speaker 0: it wasn't like one ongoing thing like detective Conan Which sort of just never stops or one piece which never stops.

545
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,827
Speaker 0: It's they made a TV series.

546
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:21,530
Speaker 0: They ended it.

547
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,710
Speaker 0: It was crazy popular.

548
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:25,579
Speaker 0: They made the second TV series and so on.

549
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,890
Speaker 0: it would be like a big Oh got through third fourth and fifth seasons.

550
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:33,984
Speaker 0: right Now there are also a live-action movie.

551
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:35,770
Speaker 0: There's another live-action movie.

552
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,316
Speaker 0: I can't tell if there's any.

553
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,721
Speaker 0: there might be some anime movies.

554
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:40,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's anime movies a whole lot of them.

Speaker 0: There's all kinds of stuff, right?

557
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,575
Speaker 0: but the thing we're gonna talk about now is a Brand new TV anime.

00:38:52,595 --> 00:38:57,290
Speaker 0: you see there is currently a gigi gay no kitaro TV anime, right?

00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:55,847
Speaker 1: now before we go any further I will say this if you're one of those anime fans who feels like you're bored or you're one of those people who isn't really an anime fan and you're just you know You listen to Wednesday because you can't get enough of geek nights and you just you really really need it Especially since we didn't do a show last night due to the the incident.

568
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:00,061
Speaker 1: but This is one of those shows that's different.

569
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,201
Speaker 1: It's not like the stereotypical Anime looks different.

570
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:05,050
Speaker 1: It feels different.

571
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:14,189
Speaker 1: It's got such a different vibe that if you're looking for something that'll I don't know kind of push the envelope of what you watch As anime, this is one of the shows you should check out

572
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:18,489
Speaker 0: You know, let me let me give you a couple interesting facts here just to get us started here, right?

573
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:29,265
Speaker 0: All the gay gay gay no kitaro TV anime have the same opening and closing song, you know They might change the singers or rerecord it, but it's like the same openers and closers, right?

574
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:35,605
Speaker 0: That's like the theme of the show Hakaba kitaro has a new opening song, which is awesome.

575
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,390
Speaker 1: It's called Mononoke dance.

576
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:37,932
Speaker 0: Well, it's.

577
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:38,394
Speaker 0: it's.

578
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:42,129
Speaker 0: yeah, it's Mononoke dance, but it's like Mononoke dance.

579
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,499
Speaker 0: You can play it.

580
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,242
Speaker 0: I have the mp3.

581
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:46,287
Speaker 1: Well, you know what I'll say this.

582
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:48,469
Speaker 1: I'll say this We'll put it at the end as like a stinger.

583
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:54,610
Speaker 1: No, but not only do I really like the song but the opener is is one of those openers right?

584
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,975
Speaker 1: Oh, oh man this show it's so Rocking it's.

585
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:04,741
Speaker 0: it's all stylized in like, you know The style of the original manga and it's totally funky and awesome.

586
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:07,750
Speaker 0: the closers a little and it's just sort of a calm closer.

587
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:13,141
Speaker 0: You know what though it is rare to have a show with good closers It is it is but the opener to this show rocks the house.

588
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:22,750
Speaker 0: now something else interesting about this show Is that the voice actors for Kitaro the main character and his father sort of the secondary character?

589
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,356
Speaker 0: His name is made Ama.

590
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:26,265
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah G made Ama, right?

591
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:27,049
Speaker 0: Cuz he's an eyeball.

592
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:30,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see where he's not just an eyeball.

593
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,910
Speaker 0: He's an eyeball with a tiny body.

594
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,704
Speaker 0: He used to be a mummy used to be a mummy.

595
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:34,087
Speaker 0: That's right.

596
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:50,150
Speaker 0: their voice actors for the in the new hakaba kitaro show are the sort are the Original not these super original voice actors But pretty much like the fate the people the voice actors that are like famously associated with these characters.

597
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:53,189
Speaker 0: You know like the I think they're from like the second TV series.

598
00:41:53,791 --> 00:42:00,390
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know, they're coming back, you know from the olden days to reprise their roles as Kitaro.

599
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:06,810
Speaker 0: So it's like if you had what our big Kitaro fan you'll watch this and you'd be like, oh the good voices are back.

600
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:15,370
Speaker 0: Yes, that's the right voice instead of like, you know Where you would maybe seen that the of the newer giga no Kitaro series have been like, oh, who are these voice actors?

601
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,449
Speaker 0: They don't sound the same.

602
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:26,145
Speaker 1: well, I can say one thing the the the woman who does the voice of Kitaro Masakawa Nozawa is Famous for being in fucking everything.

603
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:34,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much Kitaro doesn't really say that much in the show though, but the voice acting is really excellent though All right.

604
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:35,757
Speaker 0: So, let's see.

605
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:36,941
Speaker 0: What is this show about?

606
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:38,970
Speaker 0: Let me try to sum this up a little bit here, right?

607
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:40,790
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there's the funny way to sum it up.

608
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:47,665
Speaker 1: The first episode is about an asshole who throws a baby and then goes to hell Kind of on purpose because he's not that bright.

609
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:53,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, well basically This ticket will take you to hell whatever.

610
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:54,301
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

611
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:55,045
Speaker 1: I'm going to hell.

612
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,310
Speaker 1: What'd you expect dude?

613
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show is about this this.

614
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:02,670
Speaker 0: this basically the story is this you have the earth, right?

615
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,290
Speaker 0: But sort of supernatural ghosty monster hell kind of stuff is real.

616
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:14,390
Speaker 0: Okay, and there were these people called the ghost tribe that used to live on earth and they still live on earth.

617
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:15,453
Speaker 0: But they went.

618
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:20,630
Speaker 0: humans normal humans came along they persecuted the ghost tribe and the ghost tribe went to live underground.

619
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:27,005
Speaker 0: The final members the last remaining members of the ghost tribe which are Kitaro and his parents.

620
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:29,170
Speaker 0: Well Kitaro's parents, right?

621
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,808
Speaker 0: They come above ground to try to seek help because they have some disease.

622
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:43,070
Speaker 1: now You know in pursuant to all this they go to a hospital and One way or another they end up making some ghosts kind of hang around in the house.

623
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're scary supernatural powers.

624
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,050
Speaker 0: They mess up some stuff at the hospital.

625
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:51,023
Speaker 1: So then kind of the other the main ish character guy has to investigate it.

626
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:51,986
Speaker 0: He's not.

627
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,318
Speaker 0: he's not the main character He's the main human character.

628
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:54,479
Speaker 0: Yeah.

629
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,807
Speaker 0: Well, you know what he sorrows.

630
00:43:55,827 --> 00:44:05,615
Speaker 1: the main character He's kind of like a lame not that bright kind of jerkish master Keaton like that seems to be his job Sort of I guess not easy.

631
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:06,757
Speaker 0: He's definitely not a master.

632
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:07,459
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

633
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,653
Speaker 1: No, he's Technically a bachelor.

634
00:44:10,674 --> 00:44:12,559
Speaker 1: I guess not from a good school.

635
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,659
Speaker 0: No, but basically, you know, this guy goes to investigate he finds the ghost people whatever we're just sorry.

636
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,190
Speaker 0: and So stuff happens and I could give you all the details.

637
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:33,910
Speaker 0: But he sort of ends up with Kitaro right and and Kitaro is born and you know Raises Kitaro and Kitaro is like the last ghost kid right the last member of the ghost tribe.

638
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:41,704
Speaker 0: So he sort of lives like a human life in the human world Doing you know interacting with the humans yet.

639
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,330
Speaker 0: He's a ghost tribe person.

640
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,855
Speaker 0: He has supernatural stuff like.

641
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:49,730
Speaker 0: he can go to hell whenever he wants and he interacts with all these other ghost tribe people.

642
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,455
Speaker 0: And he's sort of creepy.

643
00:44:51,977 --> 00:44:55,970
Speaker 0: and you know, he's got his dad the eyeball hanging out with them telling him what to do.

644
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:58,560
Speaker 1: I think that we should just not even explain the eyeball.

645
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,250
Speaker 0: You just watch it and see no just his dad the eyeball.

646
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

647
00:45:02,058 --> 00:45:05,940
Speaker 1: It's not just an eyeball There's more parts to it, but not as many as you might expect

648
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:22,029
Speaker 0: right and basically every episode There's sort of some sort of supernatural, you know related troubles, right and by some crazy coincidence Kitaro gets tied up in them and maybe solves them in some sort of way.

649
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,661
Speaker 0: but Unlike some other, you know, it's.

650
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:35,690
Speaker 0: it's very strange in that Sometimes you have an anime like Gundam seed say right where there's a big Story and each episode is just like a chapter in the big story, right?

651
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:46,810
Speaker 0: Sometimes you have an anime like cowboy bebop where the episodes are largely I mean, they're related a little bit right as a little thread that goes between them, but they're largely episodic.

652
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:53,529
Speaker 0: Sometimes you have a show like Voltron where yeah, there might be a big story But pretty much every episode just stands alone.

653
00:45:53,911 --> 00:46:08,380
Speaker 1: But instead this show kind of follows this thread where each episode just kind of picks up from the last episode But yet doesn't rely on it and that if you hadn't seen the last episode You pretty much would it wouldn't matter.

654
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,528
Speaker 1: like not seeing the previous episode doesn't matter at all.

655
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:15,508
Speaker 1: But yet Everything kind of follows along in this chain that just goes off into infinity.

656
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:15,910
Speaker 0: It's weird.

657
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,931
Speaker 0: There's no really big overarching plot Like.

658
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:22,830
Speaker 0: there's no mega boss or giant conflict that needs to be resolved.

659
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:34,979
Speaker 0: The conflicts are within each individual episode But little details from one episode usually carry into the next episode and maybe sometimes even More than one episode out.

660
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:46,169
Speaker 0: for example in one episode Someone steals a lot of money from someone else and the next episode they use that money and it's like oh He's using that money and somebody makes a comment about the money.

661
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:56,430
Speaker 0: You know in one at the end in one part of an episode near the end Something happens that something is the total is the main focus of the immediately following episode.

662
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,735
Speaker 1: Now this show in a lot There's a lot of I mean.

663
00:47:00,036 --> 00:47:06,117
Speaker 1: what I like about it is that there's a lot of kind of black humor and a lot of times It'll be kind like a silly.

664
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:07,621
Speaker 1: You're really kind of off the wall.

665
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:14,625
Speaker 1: thing will happen, but it's kind of Surrounded by and part of this if you think about it actually happening.

666
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:25,830
Speaker 1: It's really horrible Yeah, but yet it ends up with a tiny Representation of some Anka singer popping out of a tree and then wandering off to go get drunk.

667
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:27,053
Speaker 0: Yeah the thing it.

668
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:34,241
Speaker 0: I think the reason I like it so much is it reminds me quite a bit of the bug boy in which You have this sort of the bug boy.

669
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:49,930
Speaker 0: You sort of have the horrible horror Aspect right because I mean these are horrible monsters doing monster things, you know people dying You know blood diseases all sorts of nastiness, right you have sort of the silly like the gross kind of horror.

670
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,658
Speaker 0: But the gross heart is also comedic grossness.

671
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:58,029
Speaker 0: cuz you got like a guy like, you know spewing bad breath into someone's face And then they pass out.

672
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:04,837
Speaker 1: Well, that's sort of gross funny scary at the same thing the thing with Dracula the fourth and the eyeball Was the funniest one yet?

673
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:07,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good one or just regular the fourth cuz he's.

674
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:16,577
Speaker 1: He's lame tries to be so intense and like arm Dracula, but he's just really Really lame and pathetic.

675
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:21,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know, you've got like other stuff going on like when they go to hell.

676
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,830
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty scary down in hell I don't know.

677
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:36,128
Speaker 0: I think that guy who kind of greets people coming in the guy who Gries guy the guy who greets people coming to hell is the best character in the show kind of like hey He like holds his thumb out like he said chucking Like hello.

678
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:42,386
Speaker 1: And then I mean then there's uh, the rat man Nesumi or Toko who is Raman's Eve.

679
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:43,008
Speaker 0: He's bad.

680
00:48:43,028 --> 00:48:43,550
Speaker 0: I don't like him.

681
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,630
Speaker 1: He's not so evil so much as he's just a complete jerk.

682
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:49,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like the rat man.

683
00:48:49,697 --> 00:48:51,904
Speaker 0: He's just he's an ass, but he's really smart.

684
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:58,880
Speaker 0: He graduated from Monster University Which is you know, apparently only really smart people can graduate from Monster University.

685
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:01,527
Speaker 0: I got some gas going on.

686
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:02,269
Speaker 0: All right, great.

687
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,830
Speaker 1: That's just what.

688
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:03,432
Speaker 1: are you sure?

689
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:05,257
Speaker 1: you're not Nesumi or Toko?

690
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:07,120
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe anyway.

691
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:13,620
Speaker 0: And the other thing though is the show also has plenty of like cuteness going on.

692
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:25,340
Speaker 0: I mean Kitaro like if you look at his character design, you just look at it you say wow It's really easy to take that character design and it really was just a little change in the facial expression.

693
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:38,725
Speaker 0: It can go from like horror to cuteness in a very Quasimodo kind of way, you know very easily and I think it's it's very apt because as the show is all about is he got Comedy, you got horror.

694
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:45,885
Speaker 0: You got cuteness all sort of rolled into one with this very distinctive stylings And I like it.

695
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:47,955
Speaker 0: I like it a lot and maybe you like it.

696
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:50,145
Speaker 0: Got anything else to say?

697
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:50,989
Speaker 1: I don't know.

698
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:58,714
Speaker 1: we could talk a little bit about the animation in the style The way the show is put together it and I really like the like.

699
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:21,213
Speaker 1: the effect and the way this seems to play out is that it almost feels like every scene as you're watching is a panel in a comic or in a manga that is then Animated as much as it would be animated and then the next kind of when the camera cuts It's like it cuts to the next panel and you're going panel by panel in a comic and then Animating like what would have been going on in each panel.

700
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:24,139
Speaker 1: that might sound strange But you'll see what I mean when you watch it.

701
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:24,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like.

702
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:28,500
Speaker 0: one of those things we're like, you know that one scene in flcl where it's like.

703
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,494
Speaker 0: You know, they it's sort of like a manga moving around.

704
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:37,540
Speaker 0: It's not like that No, but it's definitely like storyboarded like they might have just used the original manga as storyboard.

705
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,009
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, sometimes you say a manga is cinematic.

706
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:45,042
Speaker 1: I'd say the reverse of this that this show is Mongomatic.

707
00:50:45,263 --> 00:50:45,585
Speaker 0: maybe.

708
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:51,771
Speaker 0: I think a really large reason that that Comes across is because they apply.

709
00:50:51,871 --> 00:51:00,199
Speaker 0: so I don't know what it is because they're not an expert on these matters But some sort of filter where it looks like a lot of the backgrounds are like sorta.

710
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:10,624
Speaker 0: It looks like like a watercolor Painting or like a. really it it's like if you took a really old manga where sort of the pages got discolored But they were in color.

711
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:26,606
Speaker 0: It looks like that like they made everything look like some sort of like water damaged Painting almost and it really changes the atmosphere and everything and it's it's actually really cool and nothing else looks like it But it doesn't really interfere either.

712
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:35,440
Speaker 0: It's like they apply some crazy filter to like the show at all times You know, usually that really stands out like a sore thumb and makes it sort of annoying to watch.

713
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,370
Speaker 0: But here you really only you don't even really notice it.

714
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,755
Speaker 0: It's so subtle yet.

715
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:50,880
Speaker 1: It's so effective and also in terms of like the plot and the way it progresses the This is one of those shows that cuts right to the chase right to the interesting part.

716
00:51:51,020 --> 00:52:04,431
Speaker 1: like this will sound strange, but there's an episode the last one we just watch actually where someone plants a blood tree in someone's arm and The like the hint at it like oh the tree was planted in his arm.

717
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 1: now a normal show you'd expect like There's gonna be this sinister.

718
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:15,557
Speaker 1: He's got a lump and he doesn't know what to do and he goes to the doctor and the doctor doesn't know what it is And this thing is kind of festering and growing and then it comes to a head.

719
00:52:15,577 --> 00:52:16,060
Speaker 1: and oh my god.

720
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,427
Speaker 1: the next scene is.

721
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:27,000
Speaker 1: the guy looks at his arm and there's a tree growing out of it and he goes ah And then the next scene he's at the doctor and the doctor's like I don't fucking know but you're gonna die.

722
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:29,666
Speaker 1: And then it just it just goes straight away.

723
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:41,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really crazy because usually like it almost seems like the show The the pace is so fast that you would be like, oh, there's not enough exposition to make a decent show here.

724
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,652
Speaker 0: But at the same time It's very weird.

725
00:52:44,692 --> 00:52:47,399
Speaker 0: the pace is quick But it doesn't leave anything out.

726
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:58,880
Speaker 0: But at the same time you have to really pay attention because sometimes you know Like everything everyone says is meaningful every moment is is you know, so full and they don't waste anything.

727
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:01,420
Speaker 0: Everything is quality and everything matters.

728
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:14,256
Speaker 0: So you got to pay full attention to what's going on pay full attention to every word everyone says but it zooms right through the plot and It keeps you really interested all the time because there's always something new happening all the time.

729
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:17,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that And I think we can leave it at that.

730
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to really walk through the plot or what happens now.

731
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,829
Speaker 0: We don't need to do that.

732
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:37,480
Speaker 1: All I have to say those I think my favorite thing is still when the two vampires fight Yeah the east versus West Dracula versus the Chinese vampire and then Especially when the rat man walks over after it's all over and how he kind of reacts to all that.

733
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:39,569
Speaker 0: My favorite is Jen.

734
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:41,055
Speaker 0: My favorite part is pretty much any time.

735
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:41,980
Speaker 0: Hell is involved.

736
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:55,351
Speaker 0: It's mean in the first episode Guitar goes, you know He goes to hell like to have a good time and then later on when hell comes back into play Really funny stuff happens with who goes who stays in hell?

737
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:56,314
Speaker 0: who leaves hell?

738
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,260
Speaker 0: what happens to people going to hell?

739
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,665
Speaker 0: How you get in and out?

740
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,397
Speaker 0: I just I'm a big fan of the G Goku.

741
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:02,940
Speaker 0: What can I say?

742
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:08,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so once again tomorrow we'll explain why there is no episode.

743
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:14,119
Speaker 1: Yesterday and this weekend or at some point we'll record the rest of our katsu khan 2008 coverage.

744
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:21,620
Speaker 1: But I can sum it up The Khan was pretty damn awesome Other than the fact that we both got sick and all of our staff got sick.

745
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:22,819
Speaker 0: What do we still have to talk about?

746
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,606
Speaker 1: We didn't actually talk about the Khan.

747
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:28,444
Speaker 1: we talked about all of our craft at katsu khan and then we stopped Alrighty, then.

748
00:54:28,886 --> 00:54:30,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a nice hotel room.

749
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:32,540
Speaker 1: the end and stay tuned.

750
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:38,778

751
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,028
