1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,978
Speaker 1: It's Monday, June 30th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:10,178
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:13,608
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,840
Speaker 1: And tonight we talk about profiling.

5
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:17,950
Speaker 1: As in performance, not racial.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,118
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,280
Speaker 1: Now there is actually precedent for talking about racial profiling in terms of computers.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,380
Speaker 0: Racist computers?

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,388
Speaker 1: Type "Did someone

10
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:33,810
Speaker 1: blink?"

11
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,220
Speaker 1: into Google Image Search and you'll see what I mean.

12
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:44,680
Speaker 1: It's the sad truth of the way computer programmers do what they do and who most computer programmers are for consumer electronics.

13
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,898
Speaker 1: Or at least who the face models they use are.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,965
Speaker 1: So yeah, I refuse to talk about biking anecdotes for as long as possible because that's all we do.

15
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,536
Speaker 1: Every show he does lately in the beginning is like, "So I was biking and I saw someone do something

16
00:00:59,557 --> 00:00:59,939
Speaker 1: stupid.".

17
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,192
Speaker 0: "All I did today was

18
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:01,698
Speaker 0: biking.".

19
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:05,859
Speaker 1: Well, you were biking around and you were like, "Internet, where should I bike in the

20
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,100
Speaker 1: city?".

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,499
Speaker 1: And of course, you go where everyone tells you except me.

22
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,527
Speaker 0: You told me to go.

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,639
Speaker 0: If I went there, I could have made it.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,979
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be here doing this podcast right now because I'd still be on my way back.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,220
Speaker 1: It's not that long of a ride.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,240
Speaker 0: And I wouldn't have gone to anyone else's places either.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Speaker 0: I maximized going to every place people asked.

28
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:25,697
Speaker 0: I went to all of them.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,580
Speaker 1: So yeah, in the news, it's kind of a sad day.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,939
Speaker 1: Google announced that they're killing Orkut, which surprised me.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,998
Speaker 0: Dun, dun, dun.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
Speaker 1: Because I thought they'd already killed Orkut and I was just wrong.

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,020
Speaker 0: I thought that it was still going strong and it was just not used in this country.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so apparently it is still going strong and it's just not used in this country.

35
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:48,258
Speaker 0: Then why are they killing it?

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,860
Speaker 1: Probably because, now this is purely, I mean, their statement was pretty straightforward.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,058
Speaker 1: Quote, "Ten years ago, Orkut was Google's first foray into social

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,580
Speaker 1: networking.".

39
00:01:58,682 --> 00:01:59,259
Speaker 0: It was great.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,819
Speaker 1: Built as a 20% project, blah, blah, blah, blah.

41
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:07,740
Speaker 1: It basically shaped online life before people really knew what social networking was.

42
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:13,759
Speaker 1: Over the past decade, YouTube, Blogger, and Google+ have taken off, which is already kind of funny that they said it that way.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,798
Speaker 1: Google+ is doing so well.

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Speaker 1: With communities springing up and ever growing in the world because the growth of these communities has outpaced Orkut's growth.

45
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,100
Speaker 0: Orkut's not growing, it's just steady and large.

46
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:28,418
Speaker 1: I get the impression that it was growing slowly, but...

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Speaker 0: Listen, I can have something with one user.

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,893
Speaker 0: Once it gets user number two, that's 100% growth.

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,080
Speaker 0: Orkut's huge and it gets two people that didn't grow at all.

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:44,460
Speaker 1: It's important to talk about Orkut a little bit, though, because one, this is something Google has been doing a lot and you can't blame them because this is what all...

51
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,280
Speaker 0: That's their strategies, more wood behind fewer arrows.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,099
Speaker 1: But also, all companies will do this and you in your own life should probably do the same thing.

53
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:59,299
Speaker 1: If you got a bunch of buns in the oven and you remove one or two of those buns, those other buns get more oven.

54
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:03,160
Speaker 1: That's the worst analogy ever, but you get my point.

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,060
Speaker 1: The point is, companies will not bother with something, even if it's successful.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,860
Speaker 1: You can argue that Orkut is still successful and useful and probably breaks even or makes money.

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,119
Speaker 0: You figured they would just give it to someone for a rescue mission, like Delicious did or whatever.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,620
Speaker 0: Like, sell it off or something.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,380
Speaker 0: Someone wants it.

60
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,519
Speaker 0: Some Brazilian business person can make do with that.

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd think that, but at the same time, it's already, as I learned just now, pretty tightly integrated into the rest of Google's stuff.

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,740
Speaker 0: Everything Google does is tightly integrated with the rest of Google's stuff.

63
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not 100% integrated.

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,290
Speaker 1: They're always like 88% integrated.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,480
Speaker 0: Whenever Google buys something, they move it on to their infrastructure and their server farms as quickly as possible and they make it where you sign in with Google.

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,040
Speaker 1: So it was not until relatively recently, like in recent years, that they shifted a lot of Orkut stuff to be more with Google.

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,264
Speaker 1: Apparently, the redesign was in, what, 2009?

68
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,119
Speaker 0: So five years ago.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,639
Speaker 1: That's not that long ago.

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,418
Speaker 0: It's kind of long.

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:03:59,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:09,920
Speaker 1: So basically, Orkut was, for all intents and purposes, the first modern social network, and it really paved the way for what everyone else did later.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,020
Speaker 1: I mean, when we were using this, there really wasn't Facebook.

74
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,875
Speaker 1: Like, everyone we knew used Orkut.

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,700
Speaker 1: At least everyone who was technological and young used Orkut.

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,454
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it was like the year, like, '03?

77
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:24,154
Speaker 1: No, '04.

78
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:28,779
Speaker 1: It was '04, '05 is when we were using it strong, and then we stopped using it.

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,420
Speaker 0: Right, it's like everyone was in college.

80
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,199
Speaker 0: We all used it.

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,219
Speaker 0: We didn't really Facebook then, even though we could have, and that was our thing, and then Brazilians came in, and then it wasn't our thing.

82
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,979
Speaker 1: Orkut had a few fundamental flaws.

83
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,740
Speaker 1: It was lessons learned.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:50,820
Speaker 1: One, it assumed that everyone in your social network was 100% trusted by you, and that nobody was a spammer or an asshole.

85
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:51,973
Speaker 0: Well, this was in '04.

86
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,559
Speaker 1: Yes, and it worked.

87
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:54,918
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's different now.

88
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:56,140
Speaker 1: It actually worked.

89
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,000
Speaker 1: I mean, you could just, like, tweet.

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,859
Speaker 1: Like, it was totally open.

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,720
Speaker 1: Like, there was almost no restrictions on anything.

92
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:07,620
Speaker 1: So you could send a message and be like, "Yeah, I want this message to go to all my friends and all the friends of my friends,".

93
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,299
Speaker 1: and that was never abused.

94
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,540
Speaker 1: And then one day, I got a message in Portuguese.

95
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:21,220
Speaker 1: And then, like, 10 people I didn't know tried to add me as a friend, and their friending messages were in Portuguese.

96
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:30,640
Speaker 1: And then every group I was a member of, every single one, even the irresponsible Captain Tyler fan club, became inundated with Portuguese posts.

97
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,079
Speaker 1: And upon translating them, none of them were even talking about the topics of the groups.

98
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,314
Speaker 1: They were all just spammy, "Hey, follow me on Orkut

99
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:38,779
Speaker 1: messages.".

100
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:51,059
Speaker 1: And then pretty much overnight, every English-speaking user of Orkut disappeared, and it became the primary social network of Brazil and a significant social network in India.

101
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, I learned a lot about Portuguese culture back then.

102
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,468
Speaker 0: -Spam everybody.

103
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:58,459
Speaker 1: -Yep, pretty much.

104
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,820
Speaker 1: So if you use Orkut inexplicably...

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,820
Speaker 0: Well, Brazilian Portuguese, not Portugal Portuguese.

106
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,340
Speaker 1: They're pretty similar, if not the same in most cases.

107
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:16,758
Speaker 1: Anyway, so if you somehow use Orkut, you should use Google Takeout to get your data off of it.

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,679
Speaker 0: What, you have data in there?

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 1: Well, this is a separate thing.

110
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:30,780
Speaker 1: I've noticed a lot of people, when they worry about leaving a social network or some sort of online system like Flickr or something, and they're like, "Oh, my God, I have to leave this system.

111
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,079
Speaker 1: It's not enough time.

112
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,298
Speaker 1: What do I do with all the data I stored

113
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:34,520
Speaker 1: there?".

114
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:37,640
Speaker 1: My answer is, "Why the fuck did you store any data there?

115
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,520
Speaker 1: That is the place to share, not store.

116
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,170
Speaker 1: They're separate

117
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:40,517
Speaker 1: things.".

118
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,479
Speaker 1: So this is the end of an era.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,639
Speaker 1: It took 10 years for Orkut to become the biggest social network to dead.

120
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,080
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens to Facebook.

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
Speaker 0: It was only the biggest for, like, a few minutes.

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,359
Speaker 1: It was the biggest before there were social networks.

123
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,300
Speaker 0: All right, other news.

124
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,747
Speaker 0: Another thing that we used back in years like 2004, fresh meat.

125
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:05,840
Speaker 0: It died.

126
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,959
Speaker 0: It died actually like 11 days ago.

127
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,540
Speaker 1: I guess it's not fresh anymore.

128
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,979
Speaker 0: We haven't really done any shows since then.

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, fresh meat for anyone who doesn't know.

130
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,820
Speaker 0: Back in the day, before we had BitTorrents, right?

131
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:25,400
Speaker 0: If you wanted to download some open source softwares, your choices were A, SourceForge, right?

132
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,020
Speaker 0: B, but that was more like GitHub of its day, right?

133
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:31,000
Speaker 0: I mean, you downloaded stuff there, but not necessarily.

134
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,400
Speaker 0: Not at the beginning, anyway.

135
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:37,336
Speaker 0: B, if your distro had, like, package servers, you could use those.

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,358
Speaker 0: C, download, like, ISOs of the distro and all the packages came on the ISO on the CD and you installed from the CD.

137
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,338
Speaker 1: Usually pretty out of date, and unless you were in a college, it took a long time to download that ISO.

138
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,269
Speaker 0: And fresh meat.

139
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:54,559
Speaker 0: Fresh meat was the place to go to see when, like, open source.

140
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,020
Speaker 0: If you made an open source software, you released it there.

141
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,879
Speaker 0: You put your packages to download there.

142
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:00,271
Speaker 0: It was the thing.

143
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:03,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,300
Speaker 0: So now it is finally the gone.

145
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:08,679
Speaker 0: For reals.

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,838
Speaker 0: It is a sad day showing that other means of distributing software, besides having an old-fashioned website where you went and searched and clicked, right?

147
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,119
Speaker 0: I mean, for Windows software, there are other websites, like Toucaz.

148
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:22,859
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, all those sites.

149
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:27,360
Speaker 1: All those sites eventually just became nothing but malware distributors.

150
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, download.com.

151
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:36,979
Speaker 0: All those sites, you know, this is basically the open source of those sites, and now those sites died a long time ago.

152
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,859
Speaker 0: Now fresh meat is also dead.

153
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,318
Speaker 0: Rest in peace.

154
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,930
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

155
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:50,629
Speaker 1: What's your thing of the day?

156
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:52,650
Speaker 0: Ah, my thing of the day.

157
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,810
Speaker 1: The best thing you've seen in the last day.

158
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,570
Speaker 0: Let me open it up right now.

159
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,069
Speaker 1: You forgot it already, didn't you?

160
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:58,505
Speaker 1: Yes.

161
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,649
Speaker 1: You forgot what your thing of the day was.

162
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,490
Speaker 0: I remember it now because it just opened.

163
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:06,090
Speaker 0: So, right near us is a place called Five Points.

164
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,429
Speaker 0: Not six points, not four points.

165
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:09,530
Speaker 0: Five points.

166
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,548
Speaker 1: Five points with a Z and an uppercase P.

167
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the number five inside a star, inside a circle, right?

168
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:18,190
Speaker 0: Also, light bulbs are their logo and shit.

169
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,489
Speaker 1: It was an abandoned warehouse with awesome graffiti all over it.

170
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:25,389
Speaker 0: And they basically let people graffiti all over the abandoned warehouse on purpose, and that's why it was crazy awesome.

171
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,229
Speaker 0: Some people were like, "That's not real graffitis,".

172
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,970
Speaker 0: 'cause it's, like, everyone had, like, grids.

173
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,449
Speaker 0: Like, my thing goes here, your thing goes there.

174
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:38,189
Speaker 0: As opposed to just go wherever you want, which is whatever, cultural, whatever, you know, graffiti people.

175
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, graffiti people.

176
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,850
Speaker 0: They have their shit just like nerds have, right?

177
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:41,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

178
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,110
Speaker 0: But I don't care.

179
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:51,470
Speaker 0: There were awesome arts all over it, and if you rode the seven train between Queensborough, Court Square, and, you know, Hunter's Point, you saw it, and it was amazing.

180
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,769
Speaker 0: And you could even go over there and look at it closely if you took the time.

181
00:09:55,371 --> 00:10:05,370
Speaker 0: And then there was some sort of disputes, and the people who legitimately owned the building, no dispute about that, wanted to sell it and make some crazy luxury apartments, 'cause New York, money.

182
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, land, valuable.

183
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,569
Speaker 0: This thing's crazy huge.

184
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:11,989
Speaker 0: They were like, "Yeah, we're gonna build a new building

185
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:12,130
Speaker 0: there.".

186
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,362
Speaker 0: And everyone's like, "No,

187
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:13,423
Speaker 0: no.".

188
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,810
Speaker 1: Big protests, all sorts of, like, rabble-rousing people trying to get it designated as a historical art site.

189
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,581
Speaker 0: It's like, "We'll let you have space in the building to keep doing

190
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:24,148
Speaker 0: graffiti.".

191
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,469
Speaker 1: No, that's corporate, man.

192
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,510
Speaker 0: We love graffitis.

193
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,389
Speaker 0: That's why we let you do it all these years.

194
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,930
Speaker 0: So in our new fancy building, we'll let you do some.

195
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:31,033
Speaker 0: No.

196
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,910
Speaker 1: That's too corporate.

197
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:36,109
Speaker 0: And then the jerk move, the building is still there.

198
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,089
Speaker 0: They went and just painted over everything.

199
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:40,220
Speaker 1: The reason they did that was to

200
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,722
Speaker 0: get the people,

201
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:55,330
Speaker 1: because basically the people who were doing the graffiti art up to that point started getting really troublesome in the area with lots of protests and breaking into the building, and they were filing all these lawsuits to hold it off.

202
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:02,289
Speaker 1: So what they did is they destroyed all the art so that even if those people wanted to keep fighting, there's nothing left to fight for.

203
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,468
Speaker 1: And it worked.

204
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,770
Speaker 1: Basically, all the protesters dispersed, and that ended all debate.

205
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:07,710
Speaker 0: Still a dick move.

206
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a completely dick move.

207
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:17,069
Speaker 0: You still see around, like, if you take the N train up to Astoria, there's, like, a five-points "keep the lights on" graffiti, right, with the light bulbs on it.

208
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:18,270
Speaker 0: You see that in a few other places.

209
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:26,704
Speaker 0: I think what they could have done, right, that, you know, it's like, "Okay, look, ideally, you don't do anything here because this thing is totally awesome.

210
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,370
Speaker 0: Don't fuck it up.

211
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:28,182
Speaker 0: We hate you," right?

212
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:33,050
Speaker 0: But, okay, you own this building, and you're not making any money off of it.

213
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,120
Speaker 0: You're paying property tax.

214
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:34,706
Speaker 1: I get it.

215
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,390
Speaker 1: Also, there's a severe housing shortage in New York City.

216
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:46,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you could have just been like, "All right, look, we'll make a new apartment building, but you can paint all the fuck over it, and it'll be the awesomest apartment building

217
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:46,370
Speaker 0: ever.".

218
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,509
Speaker 0: And that, I would have not had any complaints with them.

219
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,510
Speaker 0: And that would have been totally sweet, actually.

220
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:52,230
Speaker 0: It could have been even bigger than five points.

221
00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:00,749
Speaker 0: Anyway, so most of you, I imagine, listening, have never seen five points like we have, having lived right around the fucking corner from it many times.

222
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,950
Speaker 0: So, if you need to see it, how do you see it?

223
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,770
Speaker 0: I mean, it's sort of a three-dimensional thing.

224
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,470
Speaker 0: It's not really, like, you know, if the Mona Lisa gets burned, guess what?

225
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,062
Speaker 0: You'll know what it looks like.

226
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:11,930
Speaker 0: You'll be all right.

227
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,309
Speaker 0: If five points went against the model already, you'll never know what it looks like.

228
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:27,010
Speaker 0: Except, Google Maps, or Google, yeah, Google Maps, they took some sort of 3D images of it, and you can check it out in 3Ds like you're there, looking out the train.

229
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:28,468
Speaker 0: Just like we did.

230
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,389
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

231
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,250
Speaker 0: As it was before it got painted over.

232
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,949
Speaker 1: Now, obviously, it changed a lot, so you're getting one snapshot of it near the end, not...

233
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:37,950
Speaker 0: No, that's the time that I saw.

234
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,385
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't see what it looked like in the '90s.

235
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,709
Speaker 1: No, what I'm saying, like, a lot of those arcs were changing regularly while we even lived here.

236
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure, but, you know, some of them were pretty, you know, they stayed there for a while and such.

237
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,390
Speaker 1: So, I noticed we had a trend here where everything we've talked about in the show up to this point was about something dying.

238
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,588
Speaker 0: Shadowgate show.

239
00:12:55,931 --> 00:13:07,310
Speaker 1: So, I figured for my Thing of the Day, I would continue this trend, because I discovered, as for whatever reason, YouTube decided to recommend this to me, saying, "Hey, here's a video you'd like to watch.

240
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:20,350
Speaker 1: It's the entire running length of the 1992 movie The Lawnmower Man, AKA Flowers for Algernon plus ridiculously bad CGVR.

241
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:25,369
Speaker 1: This movie is infamous for being what it is.

242
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,948
Speaker 1: The reason I make it my Thing of the Day...

243
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,808
Speaker 0: What does it do with death?

244
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,530
Speaker 1: ...is that lately the Oculus Rift has been getting a lot of attention.

245
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,710
Speaker 0: That is the biggest shit.

246
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:43,930
Speaker 1: And Google did their cardboard thing, and VR, virtual reality, which is distinct from augmented reality, is becoming a thing again.

247
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,429
Speaker 1: It's starting to become, regardless of the technical aspects of it, it's starting to enter the public lexicon again.

248
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:50,069
Speaker 0: Coming back.

249
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:51,741
Speaker 1: In the '90s, like '92, '93.

250
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,475
Speaker 0: It was big.

251
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,890
Speaker 0: It's bigger then than it is now.

252
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,650
Speaker 1: VR was the biggest goddamn thing in the world.

253
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,550
Speaker 1: There were VR laser tag things in malls everywhere.

254
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,650
Speaker 1: Magfest has some of those in the arcade occasionally.

255
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:06,809
Speaker 1: And there were TV shows and movies and VR, VR, VR.

256
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,625
Speaker 1: So, I present to you three things.

257
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,336
Speaker 1: The Lawnmower Man, the pilot episode of a television show from that era called VR5.

258
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,661
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

259
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,368
Speaker 1: And VR Troopers.

260
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:32,130
Speaker 1: These three things collectively are the dream of virtual reality that was born in 1991 and died in 1993.

261
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,348
Speaker 1: And inexplicably, a decade later, just as... Two decades later.

262
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:36,641
Speaker 1: Well, God.

263
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:37,410
Speaker 1: God world.

264
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:47,409
Speaker 1: Inexplicably has returned now that technology has finally caught up to the point that it's able to do what we expected it to do back then.

265
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,283
Speaker 0: Kind of.

266
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:49,930
Speaker 0: Sort of.

267
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,609
Speaker 0: It's still a really giant uncomfortable headset.

268
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,550
Speaker 1: It's not that uncomfortable.

269
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,589
Speaker 0: It's still not super comfortable.

270
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,070
Speaker 1: It is way less uncomfortable than a Virtual Boy or that thing in the mall.

271
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:58,532
Speaker 0: Yes.

272
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,070
Speaker 0: Call me when it's as comfortable as like a pair of Oakleys.

273
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,630
Speaker 1: So, in the meantime, the Book Club book is A Canticle for Leibowitz.

274
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,729
Speaker 0: It's Jewish.

275
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,340
Speaker 1: I read it a while ago.

276
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,429
Speaker 1: I was waiting for Scott to read it.

277
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been nice out, so...

278
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, how far did you get in the book?

279
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,210
Speaker 0: I haven't read any more of it since I last read it.

280
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,369
Speaker 1: So, it's still about monks?

281
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:17,346
Speaker 0: Yes.

282
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,050
Speaker 1: It's about monks in a medieval society?

283
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,390
Speaker 0: It's about monks in the desert.

284
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,470
Speaker 1: Okay, it's not monks on spaceships yet, then.

285
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,067
Speaker 0: No.

286
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:28,409
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for that part.

287
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,343
Speaker 1: And the most important thing we can talk about is that coming up July 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th is Kineticon.

288
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,629
Speaker 0: Oh, shit, son.

289
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,510
Speaker 1: This con, seriously, we talk about it a lot, but...

290
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:41,970
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some guests of the con this time.

291
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:43,108
Speaker 1: Who's on the guest list.

292
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:46,930
Speaker 1: Let me pull up the featured guests of Kineticon 2014.

293
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,349
Speaker 0: People that we would actually care about and want to see.

294
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,529
Speaker 1: Scott will not know who most of these people are.

295
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,610
Speaker 0: Okay, well, if you care about and want to see them, that also counts.

296
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,110
Speaker 1: Alan Oppenheimer.

297
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,027
Speaker 0: I don't know who that is.

298
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:58,630
Speaker 1: Okay, Scott.

299
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:08,850
Speaker 1: He is recognized as the voice of many characters, often from Filmation in the '70s and '80s, such as Mighty Mouse, Ming the Merciless, the Overlord, Skeletor.

300
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,729
Speaker 0: It's the voice of Skeletor, oh my God.

301
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:15,089
Speaker 0: Why didn't you just say the voice of Skeletor is going to be there?

302
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:18,389
Speaker 1: We have Noah Hathaway.

303
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,430
Speaker 0: I don't know who that is either.

304
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,750
Speaker 0: You don't know who Hathaway is?

305
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,370
Speaker 0: Is it the voice of He-Man?

306
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,887
Speaker 1: No, look at this picture here.

307
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,650
Speaker 0: That's someone with a horse.

308
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,589
Speaker 1: Someone with a horse.

309
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:29,810
Speaker 1: That's Atreyu, Scott.

310
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:30,908
Speaker 0: Okay.

311
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:32,549
Speaker 1: From The NeverEnding Story.

312
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know who that is.

313
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:35,508
Speaker 1: You didn't react when I said Atreyu.

314
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:37,270
Speaker 0: I don't care about The NeverEnding Story.

315
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:38,789
Speaker 1: We have Ricky Simmons.

316
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:39,729
Speaker 0: All right.

317
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,350
Speaker 1: You don't know who that is either, do you?

318
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:42,947
Speaker 1: Voice of Gur.

319
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:43,733
Speaker 0: Oh.

320
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:45,150
Speaker 0: Okay.

321
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,688
Speaker 1: We have Walter Jones.

322
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:48,209
Speaker 0: All right.

323
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,150
Speaker 1: The original Black Power Ranger.

324
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:51,166
Speaker 0: Okay.

325
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:51,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

326
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:53,170
Speaker 0: The American one?

327
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you get me the original Japanese Kamen Rider, that would be fucking awesome.

329
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,708
Speaker 0: That guy's probably got mad stories, yo.

330
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:06,530
Speaker 1: I'm going to link this page because it's actually really, really, really long and more guests have appeared here since the last time I looked at it.

331
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,170
Speaker 0: The guest I care about the most, you know, Super Art Fight.

332
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,349
Speaker 1: Super Art Fight.

333
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,388
Speaker 0: Is having in the final bout on the card, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark, is going to battle.

334
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,549
Speaker 0: Oh my God, who the fuck is it?

335
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,307
Speaker 1: I'm going to bet Banksy.

336
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,339
Speaker 1: That would be ...

337
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,750
Speaker 0: I don't even know what would happen if that happened.

338
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,690
Speaker 0: Connecticut would suddenly go from like, you know, Hartford local news to world news.

339
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,950
Speaker 1: And in terms of panels, I mean, we've got a belly dancing workshop.

340
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:36,827
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

341
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:40,029
Speaker 1: A workshop on how to make levels in doom.

342
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:41,166
Speaker 0: Oh yes.

343
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,490
Speaker 1: Getting into animation, the dreams and the nightmares.

344
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,570
Speaker 1: Mostly nightmares.

345
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,308
Speaker 1: A sculpting workshop.

346
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,928
Speaker 1: Yowie and you.

347
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:48,909
Speaker 0: All right.

348
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 1: I guess that is ...

349
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,230
Speaker 0: I guess he needs some yowies.

350
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,610
Speaker 1: Something about ponies, something about Hyrule, a whole Kineticon kids zone.

351
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,809
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

352
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,243
Speaker 0: Yeah.

353
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,043
Speaker 0: Picks up a whole room.

354
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:01,470
Speaker 0: We don't have to program.

355
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,110
Speaker 1: The internet and gender politics.

356
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,209
Speaker 0: Oh, gee, that's not a hot topic.

357
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:06,730
Speaker 1: Anime directors you should know.

358
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,010
Speaker 1: Juggling 101.

359
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,828
Speaker 1: Women in anime.

360
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,449
Speaker 1: Unsettling Pokemon.

361
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,582
Speaker 0: Spiritomb.

362
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:17,949
Speaker 0: Closing ceremonies.

363
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:18,475
Speaker 1: Mr.

364
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:18,587
Speaker 1: Mime.

365
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,970
Speaker 1: Convention feedback.

366
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,250
Speaker 0: Ooh, that's my favorite panel.

367
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:26,890
Speaker 1: Seriously, Kineticon every year has been way better than the previous years.

368
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,545
Speaker 1: So Kineticon is rapidly going from a con to go to if you're in the area to a con you should travel for.

369
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:42,390
Speaker 1: And of course, if nothing else, to highlight one thing, look at our YouTube channels, subscribe to them, like the videos, and watch the videos because we're actually making a lot of videos.

370
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,150
Speaker 0: All my videos are Netrunner videos.

371
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,670
Speaker 1: All my videos are everything else that we do with our powers combined.

372
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,248
Speaker 1: So I'm in the middle of a lot of this at work and Scott as a proper developer has a lot to say about it.

373
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,430
Speaker 1: But we've talked about aspects of performance and computers and how fast to make a computer and everything.

374
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,770
Speaker 1: We haven't talked about writing performance software because that's already a pretty broad topic.

375
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,708
Speaker 1: But how do you even know what your performance is?

376
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:10,707
Speaker 0: Right.

377
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,910
Speaker 0: Let's say I write a Hello World program and it's slow for some reason.

378
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,270
Speaker 0: When I run it, it takes like a minute to write Hello World.

379
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,570
Speaker 0: And I'm like, why the fuck is this taking a minute?

380
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,689
Speaker 0: Well, obviously, it's slow.

381
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:24,850
Speaker 0: But the program has a lot of moving parts in it, right?

382
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:29,030
Speaker 0: It could be slow when it's reading the program from the hard drive into the memory.

383
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:32,770
Speaker 0: It could be slow when it's executing the instructions in the program.

384
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:42,610
Speaker 0: It could be slow with the I/O sending the output and input, accepting inputs to the program and sending the outputs to the monitor or the speakers.

385
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,890
Speaker 1: It could be slow because it's poorly written and has a bunch of weird thread locking issues because you wrote your multi-threaded Hello World.

386
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,770
Speaker 0: There are about a hundred reasons your Hello World could be slow in different places.

387
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,830
Speaker 0: So how do you know if you have like, say, a car and the car is not working, you can sort of use your ear.

388
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,059
Speaker 0: And figure out which part of the car is not working.

389
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:07,110
Speaker 0: or use logic and, you know, the the process of elimination, like, OK, when I turn the key, something happens.

390
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,570
Speaker 0: So that means the ignition is at least doing something.

391
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,189
Speaker 0: But maybe the starter isn't any good.

392
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,975
Speaker 1: But even then, already you say you use your ear, but that still requires specialized knowledge.

393
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:17,210
Speaker 0: It does require specialized knowledge.

394
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,590
Speaker 0: But, you know, I guess now computers have diagnostics things you plug in.

395
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:20,852
Speaker 0: Right.

396
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,550
Speaker 0: But I get no cars have them.

397
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,275
Speaker 0: Not computers.

398
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,610
Speaker 1: Computers also have them.

399
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,804
Speaker 1: They're called computers.

400
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:26,250
Speaker 0: Sure.

401
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,603
Speaker 0: But, you know, like a Model T, it's like doesn't have.

402
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:32,232
Speaker 0: you can't plug a computer and no Model T.

403
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:36,781
Speaker 1: And if my Model T stopped working, I'd open the hood and see if the one belt was still connected.

404
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:37,570
Speaker 0: Quiet.

405
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:52,469
Speaker 0: I'm saying when you have a computer program, a thing that is entirely in software and you're pretty sure all your hardware is working and it's slow for some reason and you need you know, if it's broken, you have debuggers that help you.

406
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:53,589
Speaker 0: But it's slow.

407
00:20:53,972 --> 00:21:02,693
Speaker 0: You need a profiler to basically look at all the different parts of the program and it will tell you which how long each part takes and then you'll know which part is the slow part.

408
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:07,850
Speaker 1: Now, even this is extra complicated because a lot of times, like, for example, in my job, we're just finance.

409
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:16,434
Speaker 1: There's a lot of a lot of very high performance situations, but there's also sort of asynchronous aspects of these things that don't necessarily need to be high performance.

410
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:31,379
Speaker 1: But depending on what's in the sort of active workflow of a message versus what's asynchronous and how the threading model is, sometimes even if you run some sort of profiling against test data and everything looks great and then you run the exact same

411
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:31,700
Speaker 0: code

412
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,380
Speaker 1: in a production environment and the performance profile is completely different.

413
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,733
Speaker 1: Testing this shit is actually really hard.

414
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:50,413
Speaker 1: And the worst part is it's actually very difficult ahead of time to determine what the performance of something will be by any method other than experimentation.

415
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:59,934
Speaker 1: There's almost no way to say, well, I'm using MongoDB for this like storage aspect of it and I'm using this component and this component and this threading model.

416
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:03,793
Speaker 1: Therefore, the latency per message will be eight microseconds.

417
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:08,053
Speaker 1: That doesn't really happen in the kind of programming most of you will ever do.

418
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:19,876
Speaker 0: It's like you can sit there and count like with by hand how many assembly instructions are executed between point A and point B. But then you have to add in not just your program, but every assembly instruction the operating system executes.

419
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:27,698
Speaker 0: Oh, and the other things the computer is doing while that's happening that you don't even know about because the OS is giving control to other programs that are also running.

420
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:30,814
Speaker 0: and the network, who knows what the network situation is going to be.

421
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:32,140
Speaker 0: Network conditions are like weather.

422
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:36,036
Speaker 0: You don't know, right?

423
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,266
Speaker 0: I test, I did the profile and it worked great.

424
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:41,245
Speaker 0: Now it's coming in like 10 minutes to do the same thing because YouTube's down.

425
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:41,870
Speaker 0: That's why.

426
00:22:42,190 --> 00:23:00,142
Speaker 1: I think the worst part about all this is that what I found really hard is when you find a performance problem in some software, let's say, and you believe that it's due to the hardware simply not being adequate, but you need to be able to prove that to the person you're about to tell that to.

427
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,977
Speaker 1: When you're like, yo dog, it's your server.

428
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,143
Speaker 1: You need better hardware.

429
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:07,198
Speaker 1: One, they're going to ask you, how did you determine that?

430
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:10,655
Speaker 1: And two, they're going to ask you what hardware would be adequate?

431
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,649
Speaker 1: And that's also really hard to figure out, right?

432
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:20,363
Speaker 0: Like sometimes, you know, the program might be slow and say the reading, you know, reading the program from the disc into the memory, right?

433
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:28,078
Speaker 0: Some IO might be slow so you can buy an SSD maybe if you don't have one already, but is it really the fact that you don't have an SSD?

434
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:34,256
Speaker 0: or could the program be rewritten in such a way as where it would be fast enough on a magnetic drive and your programs just poorly written?

435
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:35,285
Speaker 0: Like here's the one thing I ran into.

436
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,623
Speaker 0: And you're using fast hardware to make up for your shitty job you did.

437
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:42,912
Speaker 1: Here's something similar to that that I actually ran into and it was fascinating when we figured out what was going on.

438
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:51,978
Speaker 1: Basically, this relational store, well, non-relational store, one of those no DB things we had going, because there's a, basically we needed gigantic multi-dimensional hash maps on the fly.

439
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:01,518
Speaker 1: So this is Java and the process when the thing started running to process messages and do its thing would do some jits, some just-in-time compilation.

440
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:12,447
Speaker 1: So the performance for the first n milliseconds would be pretty bad because there's a thread doing the just-in-time compilation and then suddenly performance would get really good.

441
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:22,654
Speaker 1: But then you look at the profile over minutes and you see this huge deviation because you had all these outliers in like the first microsecond buckets before you get into the later profile.

442
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:24,884
Speaker 1: But then what do you do about that?

443
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:26,752
Speaker 1: Do you have it just-in-time already?

444
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,742
Speaker 1: Now you got to really rework your application.

445
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:32,380
Speaker 1: Do you prime it with something, with fake data at a time?

446
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:33,908
Speaker 1: Do you use a different framework?

447
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,590
Speaker 1: Do you maybe not use Java?

448
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:47,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what profiling tool usually does is you sort of give it your program and usually you need a different profiling tool based on what language you're using or what framework you're using.

449
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'll use, like if I'm doing something, I'll use something like JVisual VM.

450
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:57,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really, I guess the Django debug toolbar sort of does, you know, all I need in it.

451
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:01,696
Speaker 0: It tells you like how long, it shows you every SQL query you did and how long each one took.

452
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:06,640
Speaker 0: And then it shows you basically every Python instruction and how long it took, right?

453
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,190
Speaker 0: So you know like, aha, this took a long in the database and not so long in any other area.

454
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,147
Speaker 1: Though that usually doesn't tell you why it took so long.

455
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,755
Speaker 1: It tells you that that's what took so long.

456
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:23,009
Speaker 1: So it's not, I've noticed that a lot of developers know how to use their profiling tool, but don't know much about OSes.

457
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,981
Speaker 0: Right, so let's say it tells you that database query took a whole minute and you're like, well, that's a problem and I know exactly what query it is, so I need to change this query to make it faster.

458
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,209
Speaker 0: Yes, that is what you need to do.

459
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:34,489
Speaker 0: What's slow about this query?

460
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,468
Speaker 1: Yep, select star from where, where, where, where, where, where, where.

461
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,147
Speaker 0: On, on, on.

462
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,708
Speaker 1: Using the esoteric merges.

463
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:56,290
Speaker 1: But, but I've noticed that like programmers will only know the programmer side and then the system administrators are almost never developers.

464
00:25:56,851 --> 00:26:00,286
Speaker 1: So they have no idea about like threading or anything.

465
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,503
Speaker 1: They just know about like the OS itself on a fundamental level.

466
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:10,728
Speaker 1: And then you have these like functional programmers who usually write very low-level applications in assembly or C++ or Objective-C.

467
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,689
Speaker 0: That's not functional.

468
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,409
Speaker 0: Functional programming is Lisp and shit.

469
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:21,309
Speaker 1: Well, as in they'll write the, they'll write the core logic of performance systems around which people write their bigger things.

470
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:35,849
Speaker 1: And those guys are usually the only people who can actually say something like your application is running slow because you do your threads like this and hyper-threading is enabled and this particular thing is happening and you didn't use core affinity.

471
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:47,250
Speaker 0: Yep, the kind of people who write like the Linux kernel or device drivers and other low-level programs are the only people who actually mostly know any shits about actual computer performance in software.

472
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,300
Speaker 0: Pretty much anyone else doesn't know.

473
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,642
Speaker 0: All the people who program at like high level languages, um, like they don't know.

474
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:57,890
Speaker 0: They just write and all the stuff that actually matters to performance is completely hidden from them.

475
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:00,604
Speaker 0: Like you'll see a lot of questions in Stack Overflow.

476
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:03,721
Speaker 0: Like, okay, here's two different ways to write this.

477
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:05,230
Speaker 0: Basically the same thing in Python.

478
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:09,190
Speaker 0: And it's like they give me the same result, but this one took twice as long.

479
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:09,731
Speaker 0: Why?

480
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:18,854
Speaker 0: And then the Stack Overflow answer is from one of those guys who can write C and looks at the assembly code output of both of those Python things and is like, this is why.

481
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:21,482
Speaker 0: And you go, uh.

482
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,350
Speaker 0: But the thing is you don't know.

483
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,750
Speaker 0: You have to read that and go, oh, that guy can figure it out.

484
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:31,010
Speaker 0: You can read the assembly and know what it's saying and know why it's slower.

485
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:34,989
Speaker 0: And that is a person you need to pay a lot of money if you care about your program being fast.

486
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:41,427
Speaker 1: Now the one thing you cannot do is try to rely on benchmarks to figure out what your performance will be.

487
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,470
Speaker 1: Benchmarks are the most ridiculously synthetic and increasingly useless metrics of computer performance in the world.

488
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:49,931
Speaker 0: Right.

489
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:55,504
Speaker 0: Well, a benchmark for a computer is, you know, we'll stick with our, mostly the most used analogy ever.

490
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:56,530
Speaker 0: The car, right?

491
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,290
Speaker 0: It's like a dynamometer where you put it on the thing and you just, right.

492
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:04,090
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, you've told me how much the engine can spin the tire.

493
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,414
Speaker 0: You didn't.

494
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:09,965
Speaker 0: It doesn't tell you anything about the downforce and the aerodynamics or any of the other things, right?

495
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:16,169
Speaker 0: The, the friction on the pavement or different materials of the road or the driver or anything like that.

496
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,772
Speaker 0: All it tells you is pretty much how much the engine can spin when you put fuel in it.

497
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:22,847
Speaker 1: So what advice should we give people?

498
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,955
Speaker 1: Like how do you, how do you do this?

499
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:33,670
Speaker 1: Cause a lot of you are probably, you know, a lot of our listeners on the Monday shows are recently out of college or are going to college soon or recently young in their careers, young in their jobs.

500
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,602
Speaker 1: How can you be better at this than everybody?

501
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,130
Speaker 1: Because most people suck at this.

502
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,678
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, first of all, you might not need to be better at it, or you might not need to know it at all.

503
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:44,153
Speaker 0: A lot of most software these days, right?

504
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:46,330
Speaker 0: Doesn't really need to be performance optimized.

505
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:55,430
Speaker 0: You can write a poorly written iPhone app and it'll be so fast on an iPhone, even if it's poorly, sure, it could be faster, but it's already so fast.

506
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,890
Speaker 0: No one will ever complain about it being slow or care.

507
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,490
Speaker 1: They might complain about you draining their battery though.

508
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:08,283
Speaker 0: That's, that's different than performance is speed, but yeah, that's, that's, that is for the user.

509
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,990
Speaker 1: I, you know, I, I'm a product manager.

510
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:10,959
Speaker 1: I speak for the user.

511
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,378
Speaker 1: As far as the user is concerned, battery use is performance.

512
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,448
Speaker 0: It's an aspect, but you know, performance usually just refers to speed.

513
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:18,549
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:21,265
Speaker 1: What I'm getting at there is that not that that's not important.

515
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:34,270
Speaker 1: in my, as I've kind of shifted my career away from tech and more toward design and all these things as a product manager, I've realized increasingly that my job is to advocate for the user.

516
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:41,072
Speaker 1: And when you're doing performance testing, the only thing that matters is what is your deliverable and are you achieving it?

517
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,750
Speaker 0: But a performance tool isn't going to tell you anything about battery.

518
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,756
Speaker 0: You need different things.

519
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:46,950
Speaker 0: that, you know, that's a battery performance tool.

520
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,096
Speaker 0: Perhaps I don't know.

521
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:51,679
Speaker 0: you approach your profiler wouldn't tell you anything about your battery, right?

522
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:54,213
Speaker 0: You need, that's like a separate thing to check for, right?

523
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:56,766
Speaker 0: At least in mobile apps specifically, especially.

524
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:57,208
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:29:57,248 --> 00:30:04,815
Speaker 0: But yeah, um, you know, no one will care if your thing doesn't use a lot of battery and is, you know, reasonably fast.

526
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:13,246
Speaker 0: So spending time, spending time, rewriting it to be faster, isn't going to, is a whole lot of effort for not a lot of results.

527
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:20,627
Speaker 1: But for example, could you make it feel faster by simply making the UI snappier and more responsive, even if the actual things it's doing take longer.

528
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:21,010
Speaker 1: Yep.

529
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,084
Speaker 0: But at the same time, let's say you make a fancy 3d game.

530
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:31,670
Speaker 0: If you make it, you know, people will notice if it's slow and shitty and you do need to make it faster and it's going to take a lot of work, but you have to do it anyway.

531
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:34,290
Speaker 1: Like I remember there was a map for a action quake too.

532
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,761
Speaker 1: I think it was based on the Hoover dam.

533
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,850
Speaker 1: It was an awesome map, but people would complain that it had really bad art speed.

534
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:45,581
Speaker 1: You know, Scott, CS Thunder is back.

535
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,290
Speaker 1: I've been playing Counter-Strike on it regularly.

536
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,303
Speaker 0: I don't play Counter-Strike.

537
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,168
Speaker 1: CS Thunder is there, Scott.

538
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,818
Speaker 1: You can just play on it right now.

539
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:52,925
Speaker 0: And you just get killed.

540
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:53,650
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

541
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,336
Speaker 1: You should play with the listeners.

542
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,422
Speaker 1: Most of them really suck.

543
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:57,650
Speaker 1: You'd be fine.

544
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,670
Speaker 1: You'd be in the, you'd be in like the top five players against the listener.

545
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:01,254
Speaker 0: Great.

546
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:03,750
Speaker 0: Get more listeners to play.

547
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:14,190
Speaker 1: So, uh, that map, people would complain about the art speeds because if you looked toward the dam and your computer was not really fast, your FPS would drop to like one per second.

548
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,602
Speaker 0: Well, that's why all the quake games were in, like really in Doom even, and Wolfenstein were in these tight tunnel areas.

549
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:23,989
Speaker 0: They didn't have big open rooms because whenever you're in a big open room, suddenly you see a bunch of shit at once.

550
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,910
Speaker 0: So the game has to render a bunch of shit at once and shit slows down.

551
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,409
Speaker 0: Or when there's a lot of bad guys on the screen at once.

552
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:31,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything slows down.

553
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:35,865
Speaker 0: The game is designed in such a way like, okay, you're looking at like two bad guys in a tiny hallway.

554
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:36,549
Speaker 0: We can handle that.

555
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:40,190
Speaker 0: Oh, you're looking at like a giant open arena with a hundred bad guys in it.

556
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,490
Speaker 0: Uh, uh, oh my god, uh, uh, uh, uh.

557
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:51,295
Speaker 1: So my advice is, one, understand more than just the basics about how servers work and how I/O works.

558
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:57,870
Speaker 1: You should, if you figure out that I/O is the problem, you should understand what that means and what you could do about it on the server.

559
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:03,969
Speaker 1: You should understand how to use the I/O stats command then to figure out exactly what's going on with the I/O.

560
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,784
Speaker 1: 'Cause sure, like Scott said, your SQL query is slow.

561
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:07,470
Speaker 1: Why?

562
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,999
Speaker 1: How do you profile your MySQL server?

563
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,586
Speaker 1: Well, one, it's MySQL.

564
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,310
Speaker 1: That's why it's slow.

565
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:19,430
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, number one, it could be that the database, you didn't put indexes and shit on it that you need to make that query faster.

566
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,990
Speaker 0: Two, it could be just a really shiddily written query.

567
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:26,529
Speaker 0: Three, you could need to, might need to readjust your database schemas 'cause they're really bad.

568
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:31,630
Speaker 1: Or you might not have a lot of RAM and it swaps to actually pull the database stuff into memory.

569
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:39,790
Speaker 0: Uh, you might be selecting so much amounts of data in that query that even though the query processes quickly, it has to read all that data from disk.

570
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,735
Speaker 0: Oh, and by the way, it's so much data, it takes a long, and your database server is on a separate computer.

571
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:48,210
Speaker 0: Oh, it has to send all that data over the network to the web server.

572
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:49,295
Speaker 0: Oh, and it takes forever.

573
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:59,750
Speaker 0: How, that's, I noticed that one is one that happens a lot because what happens is people, when they're developing a web application, the database server is on the same machine as the web server.

574
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:04,030
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they're completely open, no security, locally running MySQL.

575
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:17,050
Speaker 0: Exactly, so no matter how much data you query, it's just basically putting that data directly into the RAM, right, or just passing it within the computer to the other process and it's ridiculously fast over like, you know, the internal socket or whatever.

576
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:29,717
Speaker 0: But as soon as you move the database server to another computer, oh, that SQL query that selects like a hundred megabytes worth of rows, you have to wait for basically, how long does it take you to download a 100 megabyte file over the LAN?

577
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:32,050
Speaker 0: That's how long it's going to take for that query to execute.

578
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaker 1: Oh, and by the way, most network cards consume CPU resources to go through the stack.

579
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,281
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a shame.

580
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:38,810
Speaker 1: Oh.

581
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,829
Speaker 1: And there's probably other I/O going on in the network cards.

582
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,030
Speaker 0: And there's other queries going on in the database server.

583
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:52,330
Speaker 1: So you can, like, you need to understand the server enough to be able to say, oh, the problem is my network card is consuming too much CPU.

584
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:56,809
Speaker 1: I should get, you know, some sort of FPGU network card, like one of those solar flare things.

585
00:33:58,573 --> 00:33:59,489
Speaker 0: Almost no one needs that.

586
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:01,470
Speaker 1: I need that, but I'm doing packet capture.

587
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,488
Speaker 0: You're almost no one.

588
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,046
Speaker 1: Well, I'm doing packet capture, so I actually have the one use case for that.

589
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:06,890
Speaker 1: that's necessary.

590
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:13,250
Speaker 1: Or, like, you should understand RAM and swapping, like page faults and all those things.

591
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,530
Speaker 1: Like, know what those things are.

592
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people are like, my computer's slow, I gotta buy more RAM, my computer's still slow.

593
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,449
Speaker 0: Maybe because RAM wasn't the fucking problem.

594
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:25,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I've only got 12 gigs of RAM in my PC right here, and I'm using about six of it.

595
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,210
Speaker 1: And five of that is cache.

596
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,650
Speaker 0: Right, so if you increased his RAM, it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever.

597
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,710
Speaker 1: Like, when I render a video for Geek Nights, it uses about eight or nine gigs of RAM.

598
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,889
Speaker 1: But all eight of my cores are maxed the fuck out the entire time.

599
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,850
Speaker 0: Which tells you that adding more CPU would help that go faster, but adding more RAM would not.

600
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:51,570
Speaker 1: And adding faster disks would also likely not improve my performance in any measurable way.

601
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:52,728
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

602
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:57,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the CPU is pulling, you know, it's got plenty of data, it's just processing it as fast as it can.

603
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,189
Speaker 0: The same way if you're playing, like, a 3D video game, and when you click to start the game, it takes a long time before the level shows up.

604
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,350
Speaker 0: That's because it's taking a long time usually loading textures from your disk into the memory.

605
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,510
Speaker 1: The video card's memory, not your system's memory.

606
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,136
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

607
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:21,290
Speaker 0: So, if your video card runs out of memory, it's gonna use the system memory, which is ridiculously fast, but not as ridiculously fast as video card memory.

608
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:33,950
Speaker 0: And if it can't fit all the textures in both those places combined, it's gonna read them from the disk while you're playing in the level, or not have textures, and it's gonna be bad.

609
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,297
Speaker 0: So, how do you fix that?

610
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,590
Speaker 0: Number one, SSDs to load the textures faster.

611
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,270
Speaker 0: And two, video card with more video memory.

612
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:41,232
Speaker 1: Yup.

613
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:51,970
Speaker 1: Now, SSDs are expensive, so if you're doing server-y type stuff, as much as it's awesome to get, like, a RAID 10 of just a bunch of SSDs, that could cost tens of thousands of dollars.

614
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,710
Speaker 0: But, in the long run, it might actually save you money.

615
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,030
Speaker 0: You have to do a lot of math to figure out the optimal things to buy.

616
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,650
Speaker 1: I'd argue that you can't do the math without doing actual lab testing.

617
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:03,229
Speaker 0: Sure.

618
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:11,948
Speaker 1: So, usually you can get away with just getting 15,000 RPM drives instead, put them on a fucking RAID 1, or RAID 0 if you have to.

619
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:13,349
Speaker 1: Maybe.

620
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:14,550
Speaker 1: Just for pure performance.

621
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:15,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,120
Speaker 0: And then they crash, and you buy a new one, and suddenly you're approaching the cost of the SSDs.

623
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, except, no, you're not.

624
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:22,469
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

625
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:41,530
Speaker 1: But if you are going to do anything with performance profiling, you need to understand programming, profilers, the application itself, like what it's doing, and systems on a much deeper level than the superficial knowledge that most other programmers and IT people need to know.

626
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:47,050
Speaker 0: I mean, if you just know one area, you can make your area faster, and then leave it up to the other people.

627
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,549
Speaker 0: If their stuff is slow, it's like, well, look, I've already done everything I can do.

628
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:52,630
Speaker 0: I'm the system administrator.

629
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:59,370
Speaker 0: I tune the OS with all configuration options, and I change the hardware selection to be as optimal as possible.

630
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,009
Speaker 0: If the thing is still slow, it's all you.

631
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then, those OS options are usually voodoo.

632
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:04,236
Speaker 0: Yes.

633
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,710
Speaker 1: Most software companies, when they say set these kernel options, that's not because of math.

634
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:13,130
Speaker 1: That's because they did some performance testing on one set of reference hardware.

635
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,850
Speaker 1: Those are the best options, and they just stick them in their documentation.

636
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,510
Speaker 0: You're running a web server.

637
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,370
Speaker 0: How many concurrent HTTP requests do you want to allow?

638
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:20,984
Speaker 1: Yeah.

639
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,310
Speaker 0: How many Apache processes do you want to have simultaneously running?

640
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, how the fuck do you even figure that out?

641
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:29,625
Speaker 0: Is more better?

642
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:29,909
Speaker 0: Less?

643
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:33,025
Speaker 0: How often do you want them to reset?

644
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:37,910
Speaker 1: Beyond all that, you need to approach this with a scientific mind.

645
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,289
Speaker 1: You need to understand statistics as well.

646
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:47,670
Speaker 1: If you run a profile, say you have a messaging bus, like some sort of middleware thing, so you're sending messages between multiple applications.

647
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:51,470
Speaker 1: You look at your message rates, and then you analyze it.

648
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:56,290
Speaker 1: How long did it take between this process sending the message and this other thing getting the message?

649
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,090
Speaker 1: Then you need to understand things like standard deviations.

650
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:01,890
Speaker 1: What is the standard deviation of your data?

651
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:05,650
Speaker 1: What is the shape of the latency of your processing pipeline?

652
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:08,609
Speaker 1: Is it fast at first and gets slower as time goes on?

653
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:12,546
Speaker 1: That's really different from if it's slow at first and gets faster as time goes on.

654
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,329
Speaker 1: Or super jittery, meaning that maybe your Java garbage collector is going crazy or something.

655
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:20,950
Speaker 1: Garbage collection.

656
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:24,249
Speaker 1: Every now and then, I remember that I deal mostly with Java these days.

657
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,562
Speaker 1: Garbage collection can be a stop-the-world event, and it's not pleasant when you watch the-- You see this latency curve.

658
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:36,869
Speaker 1: that's nice and smooth, and then suddenly there's like ten outliers that are two to five orders of magnitude beyond the rest.

659
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,249
Speaker 1: But even then, what does that mean?

660
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,749
Speaker 1: If you don't know statistics, that doesn't mean anything to you.

661
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,690
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

662
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:54,810
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

664
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,150
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

665
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,889
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

668
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,830
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
