1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,139
Speaker 0: It's Monday June 22nd 2020.

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:12,600
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,286
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:16,850
Speaker 0: We're talking about CICD.

5
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:34,328
Speaker 1: Let's do this alright, so When it comes to most political discussions out there that we at least I like to avoid on geek nights as much as is You know possible, right?

6
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:41,330
Speaker 0: Not that it's possible period but you know, yeah, all things are political all things all art all everything.

7
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:50,888
Speaker 1: I just you know when I say that I mean explicitly talking about, you know Politicians and and things that are actually happening in governments like right now or whatever, right?

8
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:52,714
Speaker 1: There's better place It's not.

9
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,910
Speaker 0: we're not trying to avoid like talking about Black Lives Matter.

10
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,730
Speaker 0: We're trying to avoid like the DNC is going to have these four delegates doing this thing on Tuesday, right?

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,970
Speaker 1: There are better places you can listen to get information on that than geek nights.

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,495
Speaker 1: But you know in most political discussions right even in other countries things are pretty You know two-sided.

13
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:17,770
Speaker 1: hey, you're for or against a person or a position or a platform, right?

14
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,402
Speaker 1: And you know, you tend to be pro or con and any particular thing.

15
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:35,710
Speaker 1: It's pretty rare to find something that People can agree on when they're far apart But if you're not paying attention to what's going on in New York because you're not from here Which would be understandable you might not know.

16
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,410
Speaker 1: And even though the mayor of New York is nominally a progressive Democrat

17
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:46,849
Speaker 0: And was more progressive than previous mayor's and was seen as a victory relative to them

18
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:55,820
Speaker 1: Right and was voted in like on a platform of going against stopping and frisking people He's like, all right, we're gonna put an end to that shit, right?

19
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,914
Speaker 1: He is hated by Everybody.

20
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,017
Speaker 0: Yeah.

21
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:04,328
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny cuz way back like I voted for.

22
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:07,241
Speaker 1: I thought he was good But there's no one else to vote.

23
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,523
Speaker 0: because in New York New York City The primary election for the Democrats is literally all that matters.

24
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,129
Speaker 0: Nothing else matters in this city.

25
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,400
Speaker 1: Whoever wins the Democratic primary then wins.

26
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you're in a few weird places.

27
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,164
Speaker 0: But when de Blasio was elected conservatives hated him because of the progressive.

28
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:23,746
Speaker 1: they still hate.

29
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:24,348
Speaker 0: they say they don't.

30
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:28,495
Speaker 0: they still hate him but the cops Also hated him.

31
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,427
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like to the point the cops are also Republicans.

32
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:38,890
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah But cops specifically like police unions hated him way before this wave of protests.

33
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:51,269
Speaker 0: I'm talking years and years and years ago Like he gave speeches where police officers would all like in uniform turn their backs on him because he talked about slight changes to regulate police better.

34
00:02:53,371 --> 00:03:01,230
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is is that even the Democratic progressive lefty people hate him because he's not far left enough, right?

35
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,680
Speaker 0: He's not far left enough and despite the police already hating him.

36
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,030
Speaker 0: He still is unwilling to really go against the police.

37
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:16,604
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's a huge article in New York magazine That just came out today and the cover for the article is actually really great.

38
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,266
Speaker 1: is what they did?

39
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:22,521
Speaker 1: is they posted the mayor's photo around the city like And they just let the photo?

40
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,810
Speaker 1: it was just a photo of him, right?

41
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:36,109
Speaker 1: They just put it out there and then they came back a while later and took photos of the posters to see what how they had Vandalized naturally And that and they use that to make their their cover image.

42
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,575
Speaker 1: But yeah, no one likes him.

43
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:39,819
Speaker 1: Basically, I don't know.

44
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,930
Speaker 0: he alienated the left because he's not progressive enough.

45
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,917
Speaker 0: He alienated the right because he's not evil.

46
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,764
Speaker 0: he alienated the cops because he's not evil.

47
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,390
Speaker 0: There's no one left in this city.

48
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:56,746
Speaker 1: This is article that explains in great detail how everyone came to hate him But there's a particular two paragraphs that I want to focus on.

49
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,750
Speaker 1: where he says I'll just read the two paragraphs.

50
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:08,281
Speaker 1: Okay So part of the problem longtime friends and aides say is that de Blasio is one of the few people in New York Not really on social media.

51
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:11,677
Speaker 1: until a few years ago He still used a flip phone.

52
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 1: the images that bounce around the internet don't always reach the mayor Especially now that he's not surrounded by his usual coterie of AIDS.

53
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:28,679
Speaker 1: Even as some of his own staffers there to observe the demonstrators were kettled in with protesters and unable to escape He defended the NYPD and the strategy.

54
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,890
Speaker 1: He doesn't see the footage you and I are seeing on Twitter.

55
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,970
Speaker 1: He doesn't see the cops pepper-spraying protesters in the face or running over people says one former advisor.

56
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,796
Speaker 1: He is counting on the PD or some staffer to tell him what is going on And he doesn't get that.

57
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:44,890
Speaker 1: the world is watching this play out on their phones as it is happening.

58
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:51,490
Speaker 0: So I feel like using like not being able to use modern social media and technology is disqualifying for office.

59
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,210
Speaker 1: Alright, so this that's exactly what I want to point out.

60
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,500
Speaker 1: Is that a lot of this divide that we're seeing right?

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,590
Speaker 1: we talk about the divide along gender lines.

62
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,302
Speaker 1: Right, you know men are more likely to vote right than left.

63
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:14,233
Speaker 1: right about the line along age, which is Right wing wealthy people are more likely to be right wing and therefore they're wealthy So they live longer.

64
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:23,110
Speaker 1: therefore old people are more likely to vote right way because the left-wing, you know Old people didn't make it to be old because they were Right.

65
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:38,370
Speaker 1: you know Non white people are more likely to vote left and right for all the obvious reasons you can imagine Right and for all the ills of social media and the internet which are many and need to be repaired.

66
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:46,410
Speaker 1: Right, that does not mean that somebody you know, you should you know use it responsibly.

67
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:50,350
Speaker 1: You shouldn't use it like crazy and just sit on Twitter all day all night.

68
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:51,699
Speaker 0: We live in a society.

69
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:56,759
Speaker 0: situation like Twitter is a hell platform But it's kind of important and there's nothing else that replaces it.

70
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:00,670
Speaker 1: right, but that doesn't mean you should not use it at all.

71
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:07,910
Speaker 1: You should you know Unlike say alcohol, which has no positive health benefits whatsoever and will give you cancer, right?

72
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,968
Speaker 1: Being on Twitter for all of its negative things Which you should try to mitigate as much as you can by blocking using it responsibly, etc, etc.

73
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,940
Speaker 1: I don't want to emphasize that enough.

74
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,510
Speaker 1: avoiding harassment, right?

75
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:20,950
Speaker 1: You know.

76
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,213
Speaker 1: protecting your mental health first Right.

77
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:35,890
Speaker 1: you still as a human who participates in society, you know You need to be on there to some extent to see what's happening in the world, right?

78
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,673
Speaker 1: You know, you don't.

79
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 1: obviously people who are like, I can't trust the media Different kind of right-wing nutjob craziness, right?

80
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,653
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

81
00:06:45,175 --> 00:07:03,041
Speaker 1: But at the same time only getting your news through The mainstream media, you know CNN's MSNBC's New York Times is Washington Post's for as not Conspiracy not bullshit as they are They are not showing you the whole Picture like right now.

82
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:07,322
Speaker 0: if you watch Fox News You think Seattle has been like taken over by Mad Max villains.

83
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,550
Speaker 0: if you forget forget Fox News.

84
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:17,225
Speaker 0: but if you want to see it enter anything else that you might get the impression that the Protests are not happening as frequently as they were when in fact they're happening a lot more.

85
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:21,038
Speaker 1: if you go on Twitter You can see the tweet thread.

86
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,430
Speaker 1: That's like hundreds of videos of police harming people.

87
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you don't see that anywhere else, right?

88
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,870
Speaker 1: So and that's not some conspiracy nut thing right and some of those videos have different context.

89
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,661
Speaker 1: You can go watch them for yourself, right?

90
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:44,319
Speaker 1: You're not hearing some crazed ass commentator or whatever no matter how Legit or intelligent they may or may not be.

91
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,389
Speaker 1: you're just seeing the videos for yourself knowing what the you know Where the videos start and end?

92
00:07:50,190 --> 00:08:06,687
Speaker 1: Imagining what could have happened before and after them with your reasonable mind, right knowing that you know there may be something missing there or not, but you're just seeing it as it is and You know, you're watching as much of it as you can tolerate watching and getting the real story, right?

93
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,749
Speaker 1: To some extent that you don't get anywhere else.

94
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:13,820
Speaker 0: But like I think why doesn't he just have someone or job?

95
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,947
Speaker 0: it is to be on social media and actually believe him Like I was saying to be.

96
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:27,870
Speaker 1: You know It's one thing to to participate in society and not have this information or not be tapped into the net.

97
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:32,529
Speaker 1: Right creates this divide of people who see what's going on and people who don't right?

98
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,950
Speaker 1: But for you to be governing people, right?

99
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,993
Speaker 1: It's like if you can't.

100
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:42,530
Speaker 1: even it becomes hard to communicate with someone when they don't have access to this.

101
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,850
Speaker 1: You know, if you're a person on the net, how do you even talk to someone who's not right?

102
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,006
Speaker 1: It's very difficult to when you're not even starting at the same base level of information.

103
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:59,750
Speaker 1: It's like in a conversation I can't transmit to you right the total sum of things I have absorbed from the internet and even like an hour.

104
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,531
Speaker 1: Right, it would take me longer than an hour to tell it to you What is?

105
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:09,110
Speaker 0: I saw an interaction online fuel last week people making fun of where someone tried to explain something that was going on with?

106
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,139
Speaker 0: Juggalos and the person was like what's a juggalo?

107
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,050
Speaker 0: and then they tried to explain more and then they're like what's the fur and you realize You can't explain anything.

108
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:26,533
Speaker 1: No, it's like if you're not tapped in you're literally like living in a different, you know world right mentally Societally informationally, right?

109
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:31,608
Speaker 1: So, you know that's creates the same divide in our society between you.

110
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,070
Speaker 1: know I guess you know, you might be trapped in a right-wing world on the internet, too.

111
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,030
Speaker 0: But yeah, well, here's the thing you want to dig into the real primary sources.

112
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,425
Speaker 0: But don't dig so deep that you hit the like right.

113
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:46,110
Speaker 1: the voltage wires Point is you're still even right-wing people who are nuts on the internet, right?

114
00:09:46,270 --> 00:10:07,863
Speaker 1: Like Nazis on the internet are still living in a different world from right-wing old people who are not on the internet Right, like if you could imagine like some Nazi guy white supremacist to internets Right trying to talk to a right-wing Fox News watcher who doesn't internet and having the same problems We would have talking to a left-wing grandma who doesn't internet.

115
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know.

116
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,087
Speaker 1: They'd be trying to explain to them some stuff and they'd be like what the what.

117
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:13,670
Speaker 1: now, right?

118
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,355
Speaker 1: You know, there is needs a solution.

119
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:20,030
Speaker 0: anyone who's running for office should hire you or me to be their social media advisor.

120
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:34,310
Speaker 1: So just saying is that - if you're going to govern people Right, you know You if you're like this mayor you're having this this Even though you are ideologically aligned with some people, right?

121
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,851
Speaker 1: You can't even communicate with them because you're not seeing the same thing They're seeing.

122
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:44,170
Speaker 0: but also you're getting your information from people who have a vested interest in making sure you do not see everything, right?

123
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:52,950
Speaker 1: Well, but at the same time right if you let's say you had an internet e-mayor right who twittered a bunch Like an AOC type person, right?

124
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,773
Speaker 1: That person has.

125
00:10:54,793 --> 00:11:00,110
Speaker 1: there's still people who don't internet who vote and it becomes hard to communicate with them.

126
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,009
Speaker 1: How do you you know if you can govern us?

127
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,903
Speaker 1: Well, like we'll say ah that person knows what's going on in the world.

128
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,230
Speaker 1: They're on the net they can govern.

129
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:13,955
Speaker 1: Well, but the people who don't internet now see that person is governing like a nut because they're governing based on all the stuff that Like what?

130
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,170
Speaker 1: How'd you come to that decision?

131
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:21,590
Speaker 0: Situation where they have a mayor's making decisions based on crazy talk or even just they have a mental model of the world.

132
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,250
Speaker 0: They see a leader do something that seems crazy to them because their model is so out of date.

133
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:32,990
Speaker 0: But if you actually go outside the model makes sense, but that disconnect is not able to be bridged by most people, right?

134
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:39,693
Speaker 1: So that the the TLDR is a Right as much as there's bad shit on the internet You'd need to be.

135
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:52,270
Speaker 1: you know being connected it to some extent in a in a healthy Manner is good because you can have the correct mental model of the of the world that were the society that we're living in.

136
00:11:52,691 --> 00:12:00,415
Speaker 1: Right, but at the same time we need to solve the problem of being able to communicate between Because you know the problem.

137
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:06,409
Speaker 1: some of the other problems right that are dividing people can't be solved as easily right, you know.

138
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,300
Speaker 0: Fundamentally people who disagree on first principles cannot be reconciled.

139
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,963
Speaker 0: if someone right?

140
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,026
Speaker 0: How do I make use?

141
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,190
Speaker 0: slavery is good?

142
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,976
Speaker 0: Like there's nothing you can do.

143
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,270
Speaker 1: How do I make how do I tell you that you need to care about other people?

144
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,603
Speaker 1: I think is like right It's like.

145
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:26,632
Speaker 1: but if someone does care about other people and the problem is simply that they're not on the net and your your model of the World is different.

146
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:27,716
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if they disagree.

147
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:32,170
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that is still difficult to fix but not impossible.

148
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, but think about how crazy it is.

149
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:38,630
Speaker 0: We know I don't know what our first principles and we have disagreement on facts, right?

150
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,770
Speaker 1: So I don't know what the fix is But I know it can be fixed more easily.

151
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,470
Speaker 1: Then how do I make this person care about other human beings besides themselves?

152
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I don't which I don't think is as easily fixed what I would say technologically without This.

153
00:12:52,632 --> 00:13:01,190
Speaker 1: so work on and It boys if you work on that you could get people like the mayor of New York.

154
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:06,190
Speaker 1: I I basically believe that like if he was on Twitter, he would be more progressive.

155
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:13,001
Speaker 0: But I think the real solution is to elect someone more like AOC in a place like New York Where there is no risk of a non.

156
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,630
Speaker 1: but I'm still to do that.

157
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,907
Speaker 1: You still need to solve this communications problem because that's what.

158
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,035
Speaker 0: oh, you got a lot Someone like that gone.

159
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:23,969
Speaker 0: dad be like look the other people voting for me aren't even reading this.

160
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,616
Speaker 0: guy's Just right.

161
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:34,318
Speaker 1: I know I see you But like to get elected you need to be able if you were on the net you need to be able to communicate with the non Net people that are constituents.

162
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,930
Speaker 0: part of that is the platforms need to change like this will do your rails.

163
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:45,810
Speaker 0: I don't want to move on but like look at the difference between What happens on Facebook lately in regard to all this and what happens on a platform like Twitter?

164
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,877
Speaker 0: They're both hell platforms.

165
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,690
Speaker 0: Like I'm not saying but also better, right?

166
00:13:48,850 --> 00:14:00,673
Speaker 0: But somehow Twitter is being used as a true primary source for a lot of people and is getting information out in a way that a platform like Facebook is Reliably suppressing.

167
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:06,930
Speaker 1: but also if you look outside of politics, you know the the actual, you know political field.

168
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:13,550
Speaker 1: You look at just your everyday life, right and your interactions with other people who are not internet II, right?

169
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:20,182
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know people make you know People do stupid things and make mistakes and do horrible things.

170
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,450
Speaker 1: and or like don't recognize problems.

171
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,490
Speaker 1: And it's like you saw that on the internet last week.

172
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,415
Speaker 0: Well here look at look at nerds a gaming god like.

173
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:30,215
Speaker 0: they're like a very specific nerdy Almost prosaic example.

174
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:39,189
Speaker 0: There are nerds that go to conventions or online and they know what's going on And there are nerds who just show up to conventions not actually knowing anything about those conventions.

175
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:51,573
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm somehow those two groups end up coexisting in a space but then there's conflict because they have fundamental disagreements on what those conventions are for or fundamental disagreements on facts Like no.

176
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,721
Speaker 0: PewDiePie is giving a talk at 9 a.m.

177
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,267
Speaker 0: Today not 9 a.m.

178
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:55,930
Speaker 0: Tomorrow.

179
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:10,210
Speaker 0: In some other brief news Tomorrow is the last day to vote in the New York City primary and like we just said primaries in New York matter Way more than the actual elections.

180
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:23,560
Speaker 0: I cannot stress enough if you live in New York You have to join the Democratic Party if you actually want to vote because nothing else you do in terms of voting will matter Except that primary unless you live in a very specific place.

181
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:28,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's different but for the vast majority of New York, you know Yep, that's.

182
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:38,263
Speaker 0: and because we have mail-in voting I saw I went over to the post office to drop over our absentee ballots today because one of them came at like the last Possible second ton of people got their ballots in the mail today.

183
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:52,630
Speaker 0: I just want to remind you nerds Postmarks mean that the post office has to get your envelope Officially by the end of the day tomorrow or it doesn't count if you put it in a mailbox.

184
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,520
Speaker 0: It's not guaranteed to get that stamp.

185
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,764
Speaker 0: That means your vote counts.

186
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,330
Speaker 1: mine went in a mailbox.

187
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:03,489
Speaker 1: But it went in a mailbox several days ago and it went in a mailbox right in front of the post office.

188
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,402
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, I think it's okay.

189
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,510
Speaker 0: I went to the post office.

190
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,818
Speaker 0: Here's there's a secret that a lot of internetty people don't see.

191
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:09,541
Speaker 1: I think I'm alright.

192
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:16,490
Speaker 0: if you look inside any mailbox in America It actually says the schedule of when that mailbox gets picked up.

193
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:18,449
Speaker 1: But yes, that is true.

194
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,560
Speaker 1: But I often find that those schedules could lie.

195
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,850
Speaker 1: and the blue post office boxes?

196
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:25,834
Speaker 0: they tend not to.

197
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,140
Speaker 1: they tend not to.

198
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,450
Speaker 1: but all you know, the the I Often see this the mailboxes that are in weird out-of-the-way locations.

199
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,830
Speaker 1: Well a obviously have schedules posted on them that are less frequent.

200
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,922
Speaker 1: I've seen ones that are like you look at.

201
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,250
Speaker 1: it's like oh, it's mailbox in my neighborhood.

202
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,520
Speaker 1: You look at the sticker and it's like Saturday at 1 p.m Yep, right It's like that's the only time mail comes out of this.

203
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,430
Speaker 0: but I thought those things tend to be extremely accurate.

204
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:55,530
Speaker 1: The problem is they're accurate to a schedule that may not make sense to you Well, but also some I don't think they're that I've had times where they're not that accurate.

205
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:59,070
Speaker 1: And also the ones that are directly in front of the post office.

206
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:04,310
Speaker 1: Those are the ones where it's like, you know, yeah, those are definitely getting picked up.

207
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:09,289
Speaker 0: But when in doubt you can go to a post office and they will guarantee that it gets stamped with the correct date.

208
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:19,961
Speaker 0: yep, I hope none of you needed that little primer on how the post office works, but Anyway, so in some other news a Little like last week.

209
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,089
Speaker 0: I forget what day it happens.

210
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:24,868
Speaker 0: This was a hundred years ago at this point, but it bothered me enough where I want to talk about it today.

211
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:35,190
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of people Started talking about how there was a massive DDoS cyber-attack taken down cell networks to stop the protests and it was made up bullshit.

212
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:41,377
Speaker 0: But I saw like journalists talking about it I saw people who are otherwise intelligent talking about it.

213
00:17:41,618 --> 00:18:12,750
Speaker 0: people kept talking about this like the cell networks are down and the two main threads of discussion were either it's something with to do with North Korea or it's something to do with I Was the thing or it has something to do with the protests and I had a few people even come at me when I posted very skeptically that it's probably just the same kind of routine outage that Happens all the time and for some reason like I don't know why people picked up on this and freaked out about it so much.

214
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:25,530
Speaker 0: but basically t-mobile head and outage someone in their network team like fucked up a circuit failed and Some percentage of t-mobile calls and text didn't go through for like a day and a half.

215
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:27,374
Speaker 0: That just happens.

216
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,578
Speaker 0: that happens all the time.

217
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:38,770
Speaker 0: that has happened in living recent memory and yet somehow the internet went crazy About this last week and I even saw news Reporting on like this massive outage that barely existed.

218
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:43,750
Speaker 1: I saw reporting that was like all cell networks in US are down and I'm like that doesn't seem right.

219
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,717
Speaker 1: I looked at my cell phone.

220
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:45,522
Speaker 1: I had five bars.

221
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:52,630
Speaker 1: I was like, nope That sounds wrong to me and also like if you're on the fact that I own I didn't see the article posted in enough.

222
00:18:53,156 --> 00:19:00,430
Speaker 1: If that was true The it would have been posted many more places and up tweeted and it would have been a much bigger explosion.

223
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,659
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it would have been a much.

224
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,601
Speaker 1: I would have either seen a a lot more posts about it Or I would have seen a lot less activity because no one could post anything.

225
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:17,917
Speaker 0: Yep, but instead I just saw like Millions of people freaking out and even people we knew like we're posting it like in discord servers Like oh, there's this big outage.

226
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:18,339
Speaker 0: Is it?

227
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,263
Speaker 0: is it the protests?

228
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:24,659
Speaker 0: and I still can't figure out Why people freaked out about this particular outage?

229
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,750
Speaker 0: Like I cannot find the origin of everyone freaking out.

230
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,452
Speaker 0: So all I want to say about this, I'll link to the article that explains what happens one in The modern world.

231
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:48,133
Speaker 0: if you see one website talking about something do not believe that that is necessarily true until you see a separate website with real website not like my crazy right-wing nut job rant org and Website.

232
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:53,390
Speaker 0: that's not simply reiterating what the first website I was like, you know people always say we got to get two sources.

233
00:19:53,551 --> 00:20:06,530
Speaker 0: but I also see a lot of people see something posted on like some like Dodgy news site like the post or something and then they'll point to a second source That is CNN reporting that the post said something that is not a second source.

234
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:10,041
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who just like report and you read the article.

235
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:16,230
Speaker 1: it's like so-and-so reports and it's like wait I mean, I just it's like I'll read an article and then I'll read another article about the same thing.

236
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,721
Speaker 1: It's literally just another outlet reporting that the first place reported.

237
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:20,243
Speaker 0: Yep.

238
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,370
Speaker 1: So why is that even legal?

239
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,332
Speaker 0: I don't like.

240
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,750
Speaker 0: if you see news that seems big and crazy.

241
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:30,400
Speaker 0: Like wait a little bit and find another source.

242
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,183
Speaker 1: because right now also for something like that You can verify yourself like I did look at your phone.

243
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,269
Speaker 1: Yes, is it dead?

244
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,369
Speaker 1: No, well, then it's obviously something's fishy or even better.

245
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:42,680
Speaker 0: Remember we'd what scotch has said we were talking about like be connected.

246
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:48,050
Speaker 0: if you're using like social media and Twitter Like, you know, I'm in a lot of OPSEC circles.

247
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,089
Speaker 0: I follow a lot of people who are experts on networking and security.

248
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:57,110
Speaker 0: People like me and people like that will freak out online if something serious goes down.

249
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:04,430
Speaker 0: I noticed that no one in the OPSEC community No one in the internet like security community was freaking out at all.

250
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:10,089
Speaker 0: The odds of none of those people freaking out yet something serious going down are basically zero.

251
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:16,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the t-mobile outage was literally just like some network person had a bad day.

252
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,448
Speaker 0: nothing else happened.

253
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,558
Speaker 0: good lord All right.

254
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,948
Speaker 1: So today was an Apple day.

255
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,456
Speaker 1: It's the WWDC.

256
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:29,780
Speaker 1: they obviously couldn't hold a little Apple conference because Viruses would kill people so that was good.

257
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,064
Speaker 1: They made a video instead.

258
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:33,090
Speaker 1: They used a lot of drone footage.

259
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,160
Speaker 1: there were a lot of drones in the in the video.

260
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,763
Speaker 1: if you watched it as Predicted remember this is WWDC.

261
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,230
Speaker 1: So it's focused on developers, right?

262
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:49,970
Speaker 1: Yeah Pretty much almost everything they said was something we predicted including the huge announcement that they're gonna move away from Intel.

263
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:50,752
Speaker 1: Right.

264
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,979
Speaker 1: They're using the exact same strategy.

265
00:21:53,019 --> 00:22:18,441
Speaker 1: They used when they moved to Intel from power PC yep, of having both a a build Tool so you can recompile your apps into a universal binary that will run on both platforms As well as having an emulator type layer called Rosetta that will just run apps if it's the wrong of old style binary You know rolling it out slowly.

266
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:25,628
Speaker 1: over the course of a couple years They'll keep releasing OS X. that will work on both architectures and probably in a couple years.

267
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:26,997
Speaker 1: They're like, okay We're done with x86.

268
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:34,132
Speaker 1: You got to use You know our new Apple chips now right arm only Whatever.

269
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's as it's.

270
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,109
Speaker 1: everything we said about it was you know We talked about it before and everything we said is still true?

271
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,758
Speaker 1: I don't think it's gonna be.

272
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,110
Speaker 1: I think it's be good for Apple because their chips are way fast.

273
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,893
Speaker 1: Yeah better.

274
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:54,763
Speaker 0: and and I'm pretty sure now that now that this is all sort of official in public Pretty sure Adobe is going to make arm builds at some point now.

275
00:22:54,924 --> 00:23:07,190
Speaker 0: No, they said in the in the talk that well When Microsoft launched an arm laptop a while ago Adobe actually gave a statement saying we're gonna support arm and they just didn't.

276
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,298
Speaker 1: Well, see the difference here right?

277
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:11,370
Speaker 1: is Adobe already has apps for like iPad, right?

278
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:18,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the main thing that they showed that I think was to Apple's advantage Which is like the seek.

279
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,224
Speaker 1: this is like the I guess the buried lead on this story, right?

280
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,981
Speaker 1: Is that it's like, okay You'll have the same kind of transition head last time.

281
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:29,678
Speaker 1: people will freak out about it too much Even though they shouldn't freak out about it at all.

282
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,765
Speaker 1: It's probably good for Apple long run.

283
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,070
Speaker 0: Apple's a much more ecosystem.

284
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,966
Speaker 0: There's less like consequences of this kind of thing.

285
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:51,861
Speaker 1: They showed They showed that the new OS X on the new chip right, you can just go to the App Store and install an iPhone or iPad app and Just run it, right?

286
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,855
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay What does Apple give a shit?

287
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:02,095
Speaker 1: even if they lose your your OS X app that you spent, you know, whatever you're done with Apple Now you don't want to port it to a new CP you are.

288
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:04,790
Speaker 1: you don't want to open up Xcode and recompile to a different target.

289
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:07,749
Speaker 1: It'll take you how long right an hour to fix the bug or whatever, right?

290
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:10,583
Speaker 1: You don't want to do that right too much work for you.

291
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,367
Speaker 1: It's like alright.

292
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:20,301
Speaker 1: Well anyone who wants to buy a Mac can now use all iPhone and all iPad software Which will just work because those are already on the same architectures.

293
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:23,913
Speaker 1: So and also on like plenty of apps They're not.

294
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,458
Speaker 1: they're gonna be sad without your app.

295
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:27,625
Speaker 0: But also unlike those arm laptops on Microsoft.

296
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:35,248
Speaker 0: I was talking about I These these devices seem like they will be powerful enough to be able to emulate in a way that those laptops couldn't.

297
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:46,075
Speaker 1: which will Imagine this will make Apple Laptops, right the most powerful Laptop available.

298
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,567
Speaker 0: I think it'll make them definitely powerful enough.

299
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:59,890
Speaker 1: with insane Life is what I guess you would have to discount like the crazy gaming ones that are huge and thick Yeah, right and have to be plugged in with a battery last five minutes.

300
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:02,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like other than those that way it would make.

301
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,520
Speaker 1: Apple laptops are probably going to be the the fastest and the strongest I don't know.

302
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:11,244
Speaker 1: I think the desktops are still gonna have problems because again Apple even.

303
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:13,210
Speaker 1: they said they focus on power efficiency.

304
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:19,913
Speaker 1: Right and they point it out like yeah desktop computers that aren't ours are so fast because why they don't give a shit about power Right?

305
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:27,061
Speaker 0: when I when I render a video on the PC under my desk It heats the room up so badly that the AC kicks in right within.

306
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,730
Speaker 1: a GPU has freaking three fans on it, right?

307
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:34,125
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I do think though they are missing still.

308
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,610
Speaker 1: Is that what they should do?

309
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,339
Speaker 1: I don't know why they don't do this, right?

310
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:38,083
Speaker 1: You know what you should do.

311
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,654
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like okay.

312
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:42,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've conquered efficiency.

313
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:43,850
Speaker 1: great fantastic job, right?

314
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,785
Speaker 1: That's absolutely the right thing to be doing right.

315
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:50,026
Speaker 0: getting the most performance per because that's what most users actually care about.

316
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:53,839
Speaker 0: people like me are Not the majority for this kind of computer.

317
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,490
Speaker 1: in that big-ass Mac Pro you have right?

318
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,919
Speaker 1: You should use your same Efficient architecture that you have right.

319
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:06,690
Speaker 1: that gets so many more, you know so much more performance per watt.

320
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:10,650
Speaker 1: I just aren't cranking watch through it and just turn up the watts to the same number of watts.

321
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:13,298
Speaker 1: Intel is running right, you know?

322
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:17,110
Speaker 1: on that one machine on the Mac Pro just use the same architecture.

323
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,632
Speaker 1: You've got.

324
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:21,429
Speaker 1: put a cooler and turn up the watts on it and it's like ta-da.

325
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,052
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

326
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:22,717
Speaker 0: There's definitely.

327
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,610
Speaker 0: there are people who are used servers.

328
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,458
Speaker 0: There's a balance between performance and efficiency.

329
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,610
Speaker 0: that is necessary because we have to not just waste energy, but laptops.

330
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,205
Speaker 0: Energy matters way more than performance 99% of the time.

331
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:42,710
Speaker 0: Workstations and gaming PCs are like the only two exceptions where power is all that matters.

332
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,735
Speaker 0: Nothing else matters.

333
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:46,388
Speaker 0: use as much electricity as you want, right?

334
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:50,218
Speaker 1: Exactly Anyway, so that's what's going on in that with the CPU department.

335
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,462
Speaker 1: smaller Apple newses.

336
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:54,710
Speaker 1: They're adding bike directions Apple Maps.

337
00:26:56,351 --> 00:27:02,030
Speaker 1: Everyone in the bicycle community is basically of the opinion of better late than ever, but I'm sticking with Google Maps.

338
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:08,450
Speaker 0: Apple Maps has just been the worst option for as long as it's existed and that continues to be true.

339
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:08,731
Speaker 0: right.

340
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:17,394
Speaker 1: Apple has always talked about how their platform is the best for privacy and they pretty much focused on that during every single part of The keynote.

341
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:39,343
Speaker 1: they talked about how privacy goes with whatever it was including when they talked about the fact that Safari is now getting browser extensions and That's just more of the same thing Apple has been doing for its entire existence, which is Do something someone else has already done and do it maybe better.

342
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:46,850
Speaker 1: Maybe you're in a nicer design You know possibly but act like you invented it and now people start using it, right?

343
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:55,470
Speaker 1: You know, they came out with You know the Mac when other computers already had mice and gooeys and they acted like they invented the GUI, right?

344
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,450
Speaker 1: They came out with the iPad iPod when there were already other mp3 players.

345
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,362
Speaker 1: They came out with the iPhone when they're already other smartphones.

346
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:04,390
Speaker 1: They acted like they invented the smartphone, right?

347
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,035
Speaker 1: You know, they can't with the tablet.

348
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,542
Speaker 1: there had been tablets for a long time.

349
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,587
Speaker 1: They acted like they invented.

350
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:18,647
Speaker 1: that also Came out everything they've done From the small features like adding virtual desktops to OS X when Unix has had them forever to you know.

351
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:19,730
Speaker 1: coming out today.

352
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,721
Speaker 1: They showed the iPhone is gonna have widgets in the home screen.

353
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:23,303
Speaker 1: It's like dude.

354
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:26,112
Speaker 1: androids had that since like version 1.

355
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:29,249
Speaker 1: They act like they invented widgets on the home screen, which they're adding.

356
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,760
Speaker 1: You know things like picture-in-picture on Apple TV, right?

357
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,429
Speaker 1: It's like picture-in-picture has been around since like the 90s.

358
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:45,059
Speaker 0: Yeah My CR CRT television in the 90s had two tuners in it and had a picture-in-picture that you could even configure Where on the screen it sat and how big it was.

359
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,866
Speaker 0: and well and you can even configure it to have closed captioning Enabled but audio coming from the main one.

360
00:28:50,886 --> 00:29:03,910
Speaker 1: Yes a lot of other small things and acting like they're new or a big deal simply because by you know For example being able to set your default web browser email client and iOS is gonna be a thing now.

361
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like.

362
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:15,170
Speaker 1: it's like Windows has had that since like Windows like at 95 98 It's like now it's a but because they've been holding back on it so long and people want it so bad.

363
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,981
Speaker 1: It's like oh, it's like a huge deal right to do something.

364
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,329
Speaker 1: That's should just be there without yeah.

365
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:23,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, there's all these announcements just boil down to.

366
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:27,950
Speaker 0: a lot of this was expected but now we got clarification or details.

367
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:34,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, the biggest thing is the non announcement which is like how come there still is an Xcode on iOS.

368
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:38,704
Speaker 1: You can't make an iPad or iPhone app on an iPad or iPhone.

369
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:46,327
Speaker 1: You need to get a Mac still Powerful enough like yeah now that the N has a keyboard if you have the seams and a mouse support.

370
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:53,760
Speaker 1: if you have the same CPU on a Mac and an iPad Why shouldn't an Xcode is running on that CPU?

371
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,482
Speaker 1: There's no reason.

372
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:59,958
Speaker 1: you know it's like you've got the iPad apps running on OS X. There is no reason that Xcode shouldn't run on iPad.

373
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,007
Speaker 1: They still didn't announce that despite it being rumored.

374
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:04,210
Speaker 1: It's bullshit.

375
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:11,610
Speaker 1: I'm not buying a Mac to make iPad apps, but if I could make iPad apps on my iPad I would right anyway.

376
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:17,650
Speaker 1: So that's bullshit, and then the final thing is we talked about the hey app email thing situation last Thursday.

377
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:19,006
Speaker 1: So go back to listen to that.

378
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:25,709
Speaker 1: yeah But hey modified their app in such a way they thought of a way to get it approved and Apple approved it.

379
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,612
Speaker 0: That was fast.

380
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:39,750
Speaker 1: what they did is they made it to where if you install the hey app without paying for hey You get a random bullshit Email account that will be turned off in a few days.

381
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:46,650
Speaker 1: That's basically completely useless, but you can like use the hey app and see how it works and stuff because you've got.

382
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,818
Speaker 1: You've got like a temporary bullshit account.

383
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,890
Speaker 1: That's useless right, but you can use the app and it does something.

384
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:57,190
Speaker 0: I wonder if part of them approving this solution was just to make this whole problem go away.

385
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,733
Speaker 1: I think part That's you know.

386
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:00,442
Speaker 1: there's definitely a lot of pressure on them.

387
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,468
Speaker 1: that seemed to have worked.

388
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,297
Speaker 1: plus You know you go to developer conference.

389
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:04,021
Speaker 1: you don't want to go in.

390
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:04,764
Speaker 1: you get.

391
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,990
Speaker 1: you got a bunch of angry developers.

392
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:06,372
Speaker 1: Right?

393
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:08,909
Speaker 1: you want to be able to say something to them right so?

394
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:18,545
Speaker 0: In the last news before we get into the main bit this also is gaming news But it's relevant to Monday for a bunch of reasons.

395
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:25,156
Speaker 0: mixer is being shut down by Microsoft and Basically merging into Facebook gaming.

396
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:26,360
Speaker 1: right so I don't know.

397
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,326
Speaker 1: a lot of people a didn't know about mixer.

398
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:37,037
Speaker 1: mixer was basically a twitch Competitor that had a lot of features and it actually was technologically probably the best of the games Streaming platform.

399
00:31:37,057 --> 00:31:37,641
Speaker 0: like the penny.

400
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:42,243
Speaker 0: guys were using it a little bit And it did just a bunch of really neat stuff that I had

401
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:42,705
Speaker 1: a lot of you

402
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:43,308
Speaker 0: don't do had

403
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:50,330
Speaker 1: a lot of Interactive features that twitch you would have to like do development to get you know like twitch plays Pokemon those sort of interactive things.

404
00:31:51,333 --> 00:32:02,069
Speaker 1: A lot of those are like built outside of twitch And then like plugged in via hacks and api's and through twitch chat and things like that Whereas mixer had that stuff built in from the get-go, so it was a good platform.

405
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:06,504
Speaker 1: People who did know that mixer existed a lot of them didn't know Microsoft owned it.

406
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,250
Speaker 1: I didn't know that originally.

407
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:09,515
Speaker 1: I learned it some months ago.

408
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:10,078
Speaker 1: Probably.

409
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:12,588
Speaker 0: I think like how did you not know that cuz we were?

410
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:12,950
Speaker 1: I knew it.

411
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,099
Speaker 1: I knew I knew it like last summer.

412
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:24,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel I remember though I feel like it's knowledge that you and I and other people learned But was so unknown worthy that we just forget.

413
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:25,213
Speaker 0: and then well no It's like.

414
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:35,914
Speaker 1: I remember that I knew about mixer And then I was surprised that after I learned of mixers existence like early last year that I later learned Oh, Microsoft owns that.

415
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:36,697
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

416
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,422
Speaker 1: I was surprised when I found that out.

417
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:40,770
Speaker 1: I just had that surprise long ago.

418
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:48,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, people now who now feel like I got that surprise at pecs south last year I don't know remember when I got it, but it was a long time ago.

419
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:56,972
Speaker 1: but the point is it was definitely 2018 or 19. the people now who are seeing mixer die are Surprised.

420
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:02,250
Speaker 1: they didn't know it existed or if they did know about mixer are now also receiving the Microsoft surprise.

421
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,379
Speaker 1: So what's happened?

422
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,227
Speaker 1: What's happening is?

423
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,408
Speaker 1: Everyone who had the exclusive mixer deals notably ninja have been freed from their deals given all their money, right?

424
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,679
Speaker 1: They're like totally set free like great there.

Speaker 1: Yeah Right like golden parachute for them.

428
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:33,390
Speaker 1: all of the other mixer partners the lower level ones are basically being handed the opportunity to go to Facebook gaming and Again base gaming right basically getting the same deal or a very similar deal to what they had it mixer.

429
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:33,873
Speaker 1: They're like.

430
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:36,130
Speaker 1: it's like don't you can continue your deal over there?

431
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:42,370
Speaker 1: Mixer itself is just gonna slowly shut down like end of July that you're just gonna turn it off.

432
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,510
Speaker 1: So it's not that it was unsuccessful.

433
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,297
Speaker 1: It just wasn't successful enough.

434
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:53,302
Speaker 1: and what you're getting is sort of again a sprint T Mobile kind of deal because I've talked about this before.

435
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,634
Speaker 0: but game stop idea or game spy IGN Right.

436
00:33:56,915 --> 00:34:02,756
Speaker 1: the business model of the 21st century seems to be Make a company right.

437
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:07,249
Speaker 1: do what would normally beak in a normal time with normal antitrust regulation.

438
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,056
Speaker 1: be Considered to be predatory pricing.

439
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:24,096
Speaker 1: yeah to where you get lots of investment money from VC and other sources To run a business at a loss like say uber right get lots of customers because you're basically providing some insane Service at an insanely low price.

440
00:34:24,156 --> 00:34:25,942
Speaker 1: That's like who wouldn't want to use uber?

441
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:27,306
Speaker 1: you get such cheap rides.

442
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:28,530
Speaker 1: It's such an amazing service.

443
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz someone else like early twitch wait.

444
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:33,989
Speaker 0: I can just stream video to an infinite number of people for free, right?

445
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,590
Speaker 1: It's like you're getting this insane service for a low price.

446
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:36,831
Speaker 1: Why?

447
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:41,870
Speaker 1: because the business is losing money on it, but the business is cheating to stay alive sort of like a Ponzi scheme.

448
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:47,070
Speaker 1: But if you're not an investor you're not being Ponzi schemes, you're just getting a free service, so why not be a customer?

449
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,293
Speaker 1: It just benefits you to be a customer Yeah Like being a custom customer.

450
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:55,570
Speaker 1: Amazon just benefits you right even though they're doing evil on the side to make that a reality.

451
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,813
Speaker 1: Right so?

452
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:07,425
Speaker 1: and then you get so many customers because your business is just so insane and anyone operating in the same space Responsibly can't compete with that because they're trying to make a profit and stay in business and pay their.

453
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:08,930
Speaker 1: you know everyone fairly or whatever.

454
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:13,726
Speaker 1: So you then because you have this predatory pricing everyone else in the market dies.

455
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:14,870
Speaker 1: you don't have a monopoly.

456
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,730
Speaker 1: You're the only game in town right uber?

457
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,410
Speaker 1: We're the only car thing in town if we can beat everyone else right by cheating.

458
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,566
Speaker 1: And then once you're the only game in town you have a monopoly boom real prices.

459
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,790
Speaker 1: What's anyone gonna do about it?

460
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,954
Speaker 1: There's nowhere else to go right?

461
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:29,822
Speaker 1: so the same thing is happening.

462
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,348
Speaker 1: You're seeing it in the streaming space.

463
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:31,569
Speaker 1: where?

464
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:37,605
Speaker 1: YouTube Facebook gaming Twitch and mixer right we're all operating on the same.

465
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:40,274
Speaker 1: try to become a Monopoly business model.

466
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:42,801
Speaker 1: yeah, right anyone can stream here for free.

467
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:45,749
Speaker 1: We need to be the biggest platform and conquer the world right?

468
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:47,218
Speaker 1: Whatever?

469
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,989
Speaker 1: why wouldn't you stream with us right?

470
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:55,887
Speaker 1: And then you know if you find out you're not gonna achieve that monopoly that means it's not gonna work.

471
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:56,890
Speaker 0: right now.

472
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,290
Speaker 0: There's no future where you make money because you can't right.

473
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,147
Speaker 0: It's like you can't charge the people watching and you can't charge the people putting and you can't.

474
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:09,858
Speaker 1: your whole plan Your whole plan is to cheat to get a monopoly So that you can then raise prices.

475
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:14,297
Speaker 1: if you can never reach the monopoly you can never raise prices Which means you will just lose money forever.

476
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:19,336
Speaker 1: right if uber doesn't take over the entire space that it's in it Will just lose money forever.

477
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:24,721
Speaker 1: those investors it will just all the money They invested to make that you know acquire.

478
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,650
Speaker 1: those customers will just be lost.

479
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,775
Speaker 1: They'll never make the money back.

480
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:29,564
Speaker 1: so the monopoly must happen.

481
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:34,981
Speaker 1: mixer sees even though It's doing quite well for it is all things considered It's not number one, but it was doing quite.

482
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:35,203
Speaker 1: Well.

483
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:40,868
Speaker 1: It was a great platform All things considered you know even though there are now reports of racism as there are everywhere.

484
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:44,519
Speaker 1: yeah Good enough you know to make me not cry over.

485
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,185
Speaker 0: it seems like it was pretty egregious.

486
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:53,590
Speaker 1: at mixer right We got some racism and sex crimes going on over at twitch also alright, so you know no one's innocent in these world.

487
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,278
Speaker 1: Right you know kill them all.

488
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:02,677
Speaker 1: I say the point is that Because what is never going to be a monopoly You know they got the ninja deal.

489
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:05,230
Speaker 1: if that didn't make them the number one game in town nothing would.

490
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,887
Speaker 1: So if you're not gonna be number one well, we can't lose money forever.

491
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:09,610
Speaker 1: We got to shut it down.

492
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:11,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they wisely shut it down.

493
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,597
Speaker 1: You know they sort of.

494
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:17,750
Speaker 1: I think the mistake they made was surprising all the people with the shutdown.

495
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,959
Speaker 1: It's surprised pretty much everyone even their partners.

496
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:22,509
Speaker 1: They should have been better about communicating and telling people.

497
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,413
Speaker 0: Why bother?

498
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,023
Speaker 0: because most people don't even know it's Microsoft you.

499
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:28,585
Speaker 0: why bother?

500
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,970
Speaker 1: because to not be evil.

501
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:36,028
Speaker 0: But I'm saying from a capitalist corporate standpoint the right move is just - it stops working.

502
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:36,630
Speaker 0: That's it.

503
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:44,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just disappears exactly anyway the the point is that They're doing a sprint t-mobile merger.

504
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,883
Speaker 1: right sprint t-mobile?

505
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,610
Speaker 1: neither one is the biggest game in town.

506
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,576
Speaker 1: They're not Verizon or AT&T right.

507
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:53,750
Speaker 1: so if you can't be number one you have to merge or go out of business.

508
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:59,554
Speaker 1: So they chose to merge with face merge slash go out of business with Facebook gaming To see.

509
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:03,967
Speaker 1: you know I guess Facebook can keep losing money longer to try to try to win the war.

510
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:06,104
Speaker 1: yeah We'll see.

511
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:13,566
Speaker 0: but anyway Things of the day, so I know you all many of you are fans of the Animal Crossing.

512
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:14,970
Speaker 0: I enjoy the Animal Crossing.

513
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:15,702
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

514
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:29,670
Speaker 0: But one of the aspects of Animal Crossing is that the characters talk in this pseudo nonsense But not completely nonsense language like they talk and it maps to the words that they're actually saying in the text in the game.

515
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:31,223
Speaker 0: But it's not a full language.

516
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,795
Speaker 0: It's like a Minimized cute language.

517
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:40,847
Speaker 0: so when characters sing like when KK Slider gives a concert he sings in that made-up language But he sings like a whole song.

518
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:49,827
Speaker 0: This is a band that does covers of KK Slider's music But they sing it in the Animal Crossing language.

519
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:59,586
Speaker 0: live All right, they also dress up like KK Slider in okay in a. It's not furry.

520
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:00,551
Speaker 0: This is not furry.

521
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03,142
Speaker 0: This is I Don't know what this is.

522
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:05,992
Speaker 0: he didn't just watch it and you'll see.

523
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,473
Speaker 0: but this is expertly done All right.

524
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:29,343
Speaker 1: Well you may have seen a story going around the the webs or whatever about a crossword puzzle plagiarism Which is even though crossword puzzles themselves are not really there's sort of a trivial matter in the world the people who make crossword puzzles take plagiarism very seriously because crossword puzzles are Difficult to make.

525
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:30,606
Speaker 1: they're very time-consuming.

526
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:35,420
Speaker 0: a good crossword puzzle like that is on the level of designing a pretty good like small board game.

527
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,283
Speaker 0: Right right.

528
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:43,540
Speaker 1: so if you so and there's you know there's certain publications need crossword puzzles and pay out for them And they're actually worth quite a bit right?

529
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,820
Speaker 1: It's like a lot of people will buy like you know New York Times Sunday for that crossword puzzle, right?

530
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,380
Speaker 1: It's actually worth it to the New York Times to give the crossword maker a lot of money.

531
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:56,459
Speaker 1: Yeah especially if they write a good one the kind of good one that they expect to be in there right.

532
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:04,979
Speaker 1: so Crossword puzzle is still a big deal in the world and Crossword plagiarism is taken very seriously by people who make them right.

533
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:09,997
Speaker 1: So when someone discovers crossword plagiarism that's taken very seriously.

534
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:18,288
Speaker 1: so somebody The person in this video was just looking to do some studies of you know have fun Studying crossword puzzles right there.

535
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:19,393
Speaker 1: We're looking for plagiarism.

536
00:40:19,955 --> 00:40:24,572
Speaker 1: They were just saying like hey I wonder what like you know it's probably a cool interesting data to look at.

537
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,736
Speaker 1: I'm a nerd right like.

538
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,443
Speaker 0: does someone use this one Clue?

539
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:29,360
Speaker 0: that's like really useful to fit into a weird.

540
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:41,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, the person right the person in this video looks like you know the most stereotypical computer science student And they tell a story about how they tried to collect a bunch of crossword puzzle data.

541
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,046
Speaker 1: They managed to get the data.

542
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:46,280
Speaker 1: They made a new file format for crossword puzzles.

543
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:59,491
Speaker 1: They put the day all the puzzles in that format And then they used your normal everyday Unix tools on that format like grep and cut and you know diff and they found Oh, oh, they just discovered plagiarism.

544
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:06,540
Speaker 1: that happened right like whoa And that became a big deal right for 15 seconds on the internet.

545
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:12,377
Speaker 1: But yeah this talk this person gave explains in great detail everything they did the genius file format.

546
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:13,079
Speaker 1: They came up with.

547
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:28,408
Speaker 1: but I think the Interesting thing is that this is at a convention I didn't know about what conference called CSV con which is like a convention for people who care about like data and So it's like you know.

548
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,353
Speaker 1: it's like CSV right cuz CSV.

549
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:32,339
Speaker 1: I assume it's about comma separated value.

550
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:37,795
Speaker 0: con Say that I have a 140 megabyte CSV file on my desktop right now.

551
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:40,004

Speaker 0: we never did because like Normal physical conventions with their limited space don't want us to do our weird stuff like.

560
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:31,235
Speaker 0: now is the time to let us get weird Or let us get very hyper specific about the panel topics.

561
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:33,621
Speaker 0: We've always wanted to do Otherwise.

562
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:35,288
Speaker 0: follow me and Scott on YouTube.

563
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:37,035
Speaker 0: We're putting stuff out sometimes.

564
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,100
Speaker 0: We're just streaming games.

565
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:40,777
Speaker 0: I'll say I'll put a link to our discord Which is pretty rockin.

566
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:47,016
Speaker 0: Discords are a good place to hang out during all this cuz it's not like you're gonna hang out in person or at a con anytime soon.

567
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was I was just typing a bunch of stuff and not paying attention at a moment.

568
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:56,729
Speaker 1: any convention any talks.

569
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:02,473
Speaker 1: we we might give some talks for You know make record some videos that will be shown at online conventions.

570
00:43:02,494 --> 00:43:06,128
Speaker 1: We got the packs online pretty much Yep, and then maybe we you know.

571
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:10,126
Speaker 1: if we have some talks that we want to give and no one accepts them Just give me.

572
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:12,600
Speaker 1: maybe I'll make the video anyway and put on YouTube.

573
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:16,237
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I did that you didn't want to do any Five Nights at Freddy's horror stuff.

574
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:22,590
Speaker 0: so years ago I just made my own like video essay panel and just put it up there and Kind of want to do the same thing.

575
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:30,827
Speaker 0: for another thing that again I'm not going to even mention what the topic is because until I make this panel, which is actually a lot of work I'm not gonna shit talk it.

576
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:39,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, not a chick talking anything I'm just saying that that is an idea I have that I may or may not do is to just you know It's like I'm good at writing panels and doing them.

577
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:41,538
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just do it in front of this camera behind me over here.

578
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,685
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe I won't.

579
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:50,339
Speaker 0: I mean the easiest thing to do is We'll get together at your apartment and we'll record panels in person together in front of a camera.

580
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:52,529
Speaker 1: When will it be safe to do this?

581
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully by September.

582
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,199
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it'll be a little bit difficult to put together that panel for packs online.

583
00:44:01,928 --> 00:44:02,498
Speaker 1: Do a two box.

584
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:12,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's tough though, I mean even now like there's a little bit of delay like we talk over each other It's just really hard to do like I just do what we could just do one people panels.

585
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:13,288
Speaker 1: I do want you do one.

586
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,156
Speaker 0: Oh we could do that, too.

587
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:17,122
Speaker 0: The problem is I got some one people panels I could do.

588
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:20,139
Speaker 0: that aren't the insane amount of effort of the one that I keep talking about.

589
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,380
Speaker 0: that I'm not gonna talk about because I really want to do it.

590
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,303
Speaker 0: It's such a good topic But I will.

591
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:36,082
Speaker 0: it'll literally take me like 30 or 40 hours to get together all the data and sources I need to actually make this panel and I don't know if I have it in me to actually do that All right.

592
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:38,233
Speaker 1: Well, let's move to the main bit because I'm hungry and I got shit to do.

593
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:41,687
Speaker 0: So CSCD You'll hear this what you'll hear this a lot.

594
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:42,731
Speaker 0: What does that actually mean?

595
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:51,497
Speaker 0: If you're not a nerd continuous integration and Continuous deployment or sometimes people say continuous delivery depending on the content.

596
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:52,440
Speaker 1: It's all the same thing.

597
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:59,670
Speaker 1: the core idea is that you're writing software right and You know back in the day the way software worked is.

598
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,085
Speaker 1: you would write the software you would put it on some floppy disks Or some shit, right?

599
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,778
Speaker 1: It's like you didn't have an internet to deliver your software.

600
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,302
Speaker 1: Yeah You would.

601
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:16,300
Speaker 1: you would put it on floppy disks or you ship those computers to a QA person who tests or cartridge Cartridges or chips or something, right?

602
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,347
Speaker 1: and then that was the final version and if you released a new version.

603
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:24,797
Speaker 1: you had to sell a new thing or You know, it's like that was it right?

604
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:28,609
Speaker 1: so it's like for example if you buy like a Super Nintendo cartridges, right?

605
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,613
Speaker 1: It's like you might have.

606
00:45:29,914 --> 00:45:32,867
Speaker 1: you know, we talked about like Japanese 1.0 linked to the past.

607
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:37,001
Speaker 1: It's like well some Cartridges in Japan aren't 1.0 linked to the past.

608
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:39,370
Speaker 1: They're a newer version that doesn't have all those bugs in it, right?

609
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:45,950
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they you wouldn't patch your software, right and even when patching came into existence, right?

610
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,335
Speaker 1: The patch has to be deployed.

611
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:49,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, it goes up on a server.

612
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:51,150
Speaker 1: You need some sort of automatic update thing.

613
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:54,298
Speaker 1: so Software was done and delivered.

614
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,723
Speaker 1: you had to like build software make it perfect Put it out into the world and then that's it right.

615
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:06,100
Speaker 1: patching was was very difficult And even if you could patch the patches themselves were sort of.

616
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:06,962
Speaker 1: that's it.

617
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:11,696
Speaker 1: You put them out and they're there now with the web Primarily right.

618
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:16,050
Speaker 1: the software people are running is not deployed to them.

619
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:17,473
Speaker 1: It's on a website.

620
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:28,470
Speaker 0: every time they reload they're reloading the software and it tends to not be a monolithic stack of Extremely siloed pipelines that don't interact with each other, right?

621
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,324
Speaker 1: It's not one exe right that is done and everything's in the exe.

622
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:35,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this your dad They're dad.

623
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:42,188
Speaker 1: every time they visit your web page They're downloading a ton of random stuff and they're hitting other APIs that are all over the internet.

624
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,517
Speaker 1: that are them Themselves.

625
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:51,310
Speaker 1: individual pieces of software Right and only the web browser itself is sort of a monolithic blob that is installed.

626
00:46:51,371 --> 00:47:07,050
Speaker 1: Yeah and even so if you're writing Software right and your software is sitting on a server somewhere and everyone using the software is loading it from the server Every time they use it you can just update on the server that one copy of the software, right?

627
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,780
Speaker 1: You just update the one thing and now you've updated everyone.

628
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:12,210
Speaker 1: Everyone's always using the same copy of the software.

629
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:13,727
Speaker 1: It's like it's installed only once.

630
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:31,614
Speaker 1: imagine if we only installed Counter-strike on one computer and everyone in the world and that CPU on that computer was running everyone's game of counter-strike Right and you would just download right the graphics and you would send your your keyboard inputs now Like we're laughing.

631
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,383
Speaker 0: but that is literally how computers worked for a long time.

632
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:36,630
Speaker 1: So literally that's also how Google stadia works.

633
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:37,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's literally.

634
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:52,840
Speaker 1: does that some computers that run the counter-strike or whatever game it is You just play right websites work is you're just downloading HTML's you download the JavaScript program it runs But the next time you visit that website the JavaScript program might be different and you download it again.

635
00:47:53,832 --> 00:48:00,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, now if you're writing such a program You know, you don't need to like, you know.

636
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:06,885
Speaker 1: make deploying and updating the server this big event Right because you're not it's not permanently stamped in stone.

637
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:11,524
Speaker 1: if you make a mistake Right, you can just fix it and you fixed it for everyone.

638
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:12,267
Speaker 1: Of course you break it.

639
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,170
Speaker 1: you break it for everyone.

640
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:21,201
Speaker 1: That's the part we'll get into the most in a minute, right, but you can just update it in one place Frequently like you can just patch it constantly right?

641
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:24,857
Speaker 1: You can edit a web page while someone's visiting it They reload they get the update right away.

642
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:27,890
Speaker 1: You can just keep working on it constantly, right?

643
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:31,187
Speaker 0: You know, like we're playing for up to these these German like.

644
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:31,750
Speaker 0: well not German.

645
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:43,549
Speaker 0: We're playing these like weird train games on this website and literally like I'll take a turn and then like I hit f5 and they have deployed some new code to the server and the graphics look different and they fixed a bug.

646
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:46,320
Speaker 1: Like you're still in the middle of your game.

647
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,265
Speaker 1: Your game is not broken.

648
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:48,090
Speaker 1: Yep, you know.

649
00:48:49,431 --> 00:49:03,969
Speaker 1: So this is great a great way to deploy your software because you can get patches out immediately There's no waiting and you don't need to like sit on this huge pile of updates right and then release them to the world like aha here are all the updates like look what Apple is doing with like.

650
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:04,912
Speaker 1: we just Talked about WDC.

651
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:07,802
Speaker 1: they're like here are all our updates for iOS whatever.

652
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:12,860
Speaker 0: that last part is really important because that's where like Management comes in of like large projects.

653
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,249
Speaker 0: because sure say Scott fixes a bunch of bugs.

654
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:28,990
Speaker 0: Say Scott fixes bugs and makes changes to something for a month and then deploys it and then all those other APIs and services Don't quite work right because of some decisions Scott made along the way maybe good decisions.

655
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:37,290
Speaker 0: Now a bunch of stuff is broken because no one tested the end-to-end workflow until Scott put his month worth of code out there.

656
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:49,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's really good as a pro, you know developer right to be able to just constantly release your changes Like I don't even know why they still do, you know, imagine if you just got iOS updates like daily, you know Just.

657
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:53,050
Speaker 1: or they just happen without even realizing and you just constantly got new features.

658
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,918
Speaker 1: Just pop it up all the time all over the place.

659
00:49:54,958 --> 00:50:01,469
Speaker 1: instead of here comes OS X. big sir we got big updates for you, right just what if OS X just constantly got better?

660
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:03,735
Speaker 1: as Apple developers worked?

661
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:06,465
Speaker 1: they finish a new feature and now suddenly everyone has it, right?

662
00:50:06,846 --> 00:50:11,568
Speaker 1: So the Obviously the problem with this is that okay?

663
00:50:11,649 --> 00:50:12,371
Speaker 1: Sure You're.

664
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:15,058
Speaker 1: you're just putting stuff out into the world as you do it.

665
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,105
Speaker 1: You're incrementally constantly updating the software.

666
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:18,747
Speaker 1: That's amazing.

667
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:26,410
Speaker 1: Right but You're not because you don't have this sort of big release event where you're like making CDs.

668
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,270
Speaker 1: If you're gonna know you're gonna make a CD and it's set in stone.

669
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:33,930
Speaker 1: You test that shit like crazy to make sure that what you put on that CD is perfect.

670
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:42,350
Speaker 0: Like you have a lockdown date We're like, alright, no more code submissions except critical bugs and then a massive QA project kicks off on its own.

671
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:47,819
Speaker 1: This is why you see with like Nintendo but especially back in the day in the cartridge times They would do tons.

672
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:54,090
Speaker 1: if you made a game Nintendo would do insane testing on it to make sure before they would let you sell your cartridges.

673
00:50:54,612 --> 00:50:56,681
Speaker 1: Right with the Nintendo seal of quality or whatever.

674
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:58,910
Speaker 1: right because they don't want anyone putting games out there.

675
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,673
Speaker 1: They just don't work.

676
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:04,370
Speaker 0: But now like I make some tiny change like oh that words been misspelled for like a year.

677
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:05,373
Speaker 0: I'll just fix it.

678
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:08,623
Speaker 0: but two other API is just for whatever reason.

679
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,790
Speaker 0: that's a problem for them and you break everything.

680
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:24,049
Speaker 1: So you're not doing this huge big amazing Hardcore QA process before your release that you did back in the day because you can't be doing that ten times a day Right, what you need is some way to test.

681
00:51:25,054 --> 00:51:26,270
Speaker 1: You still need to test though, right?

682
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,283
Speaker 1: If you don't test then you're just gonna be breaking your app ten times a day.

683
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:30,770
Speaker 1: or you're gonna like push out a patch.

684
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,501
Speaker 1: You break your website push out a different patch.

685
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:33,246
Speaker 1: It's still broken.

686
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:33,870
Speaker 1: push a different patch.

687
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:34,473
Speaker 1: It's still broken.

688
00:51:34,774 --> 00:51:38,250
Speaker 1: all the customers are mad because everything's broken and then you finally fix it.

689
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:41,690
Speaker 1: So it's like what do you do every time you make a small update to your website?

690
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:47,590
Speaker 1: It's like you need to test still but you can't do some insane deep QA, right?

691
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,059
Speaker 1: You just need some way to test.

692
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:52,615
Speaker 1: and no you're not gonna break the website when you ten times a day and you

693
00:51:52,635 --> 00:52:03,088
Speaker 0: need two fundamental kinds of testing the idea of unit testing like continuous unit testing and then Continuous integration testing which is the part we're really talking about because that's the part that makes this work,

694
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:03,810
Speaker 1: right?

695
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,029
Speaker 1: So what CI is is basically these platforms and services you can use and set up.

696
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:11,533
Speaker 1: that will You?

697
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:16,610
Speaker 1: basically the idea is that you use your version control, right and you make a pull request with git.

698
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:23,750
Speaker 1: Usually right is usually what you would do in the year 2020 You know and then or you'd you know, you'd merge into a branch or something like that.

699
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:33,185
Speaker 1: you push your new source code out there and This platform is looking at that source code and saying aha It's always watching and it sees aha somebody has written new source code.

700
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:34,550
Speaker 1: That is that they think is ready.

701
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:47,630
Speaker 1: Oh you think it's ready, right that that platform will go and take that source code To create a computing environment out of nothing that is identical as possible to the production environment, right?

702
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:48,510
Speaker 1: It'll make a new server.

703
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:54,627
Speaker 1: It will run the code that you just wrote and then run a battery of tests that you wrote.

704
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:55,770
Speaker 1: you wrote tests, right?

705
00:52:56,597 --> 00:53:01,229
Speaker 1: tests And it will run all those tests against the code that you just wrote.

706
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:05,102
Speaker 1: now You should have been testing it yourself on your local computer before you made that push.

707
00:53:05,122 --> 00:53:07,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but there's still.

708
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:10,770
Speaker 1: Testing on your local computer is not the same as testing in production, right?

709
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:22,810
Speaker 1: So it's making an environment that's more true to production than your local development Environment is and will catch possibly errors and bugs that your local tests did not catch even though they might be the same exact test.

710
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:32,910
Speaker 0: and the important part is that environment will have Versions of hopefully also continuously integrated all the other services and API's and things that your code relies on.

711
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:40,150
Speaker 1: Even if you don't manage that code It can also run much more extensive tests than your local development environment can have right?

712
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,250
Speaker 1: So for example, maybe I write a little JavaScript form kind of thing, right?

713
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:48,386
Speaker 1: And I test it locally and I write a test and it totally works on my computer.

714
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:49,330
Speaker 1: It's great.

715
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:50,377
Speaker 1: So I push it out.

716
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:54,159
Speaker 1: I make a pull request and they say hey, I wrote this It should be added to the real the full project.

717
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:56,569
Speaker 1: It's a great new form that will help users out.

718
00:53:57,433 --> 00:53:58,165
Speaker 1: Let's do it, right?

719
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,038
Speaker 1: So you push it out and the continuous integration thing comes along.

720
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,453
Speaker 1: it takes it and it tests it and then it tests it in Every single browser.

721
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:15,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, then it tests and then it tests it, you know on different versions of Linux Right and it tests it on different versions of Apache or whatever other.

722
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:22,621
Speaker 0: maybe it's a big iron Enterprise thing where not only will it run all these browser tests But it'll have other people who are using your API's.

723
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:32,010
Speaker 0: like maybe you have a federated model where you have a website But you also have API's Where they will hit those API's from like a hundred different kinds of endpoints to make sure that they all work, too.

724
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:36,204
Speaker 1: Maybe when you were testing local you were just testing the part you were working on.

725
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,070
Speaker 1: It's gonna run the full tests.

726
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:41,650
Speaker 1: So maybe you broke something that's far away from the code you wrote inadvertently.

727
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:47,416
Speaker 1: It's gonna catch if your tests are comprehensive enough, which they're never fully comprehensive But they should be good enough.

728
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,863
Speaker 1: right to prevent to me.

729
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,150
Speaker 1: You don't need them to be perfect.

730
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,190
Speaker 1: They'll never be perfect right but the tests just need to be thorough enough.

731
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that most of the time when you push to production nothing's broke.

732
00:54:57,647 --> 00:54:58,390
Speaker 0: You want to know my hack?

733
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,163
Speaker 0: This is not a hack This is common knowledge but like a good secret.

734
00:55:01,183 --> 00:55:12,370
Speaker 0: to get this going Come up with a good set of unit tests like very early and build them and obviously anytime you add new serious functionality Like make sure you build tests as part of that like you're not done until you've wrote tests for your own code

735
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:13,696
Speaker 1: But I know what I do.

736
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:16,909
Speaker 0: every time you find a bug like QA finds a bug or the testing finds a bug.

737
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,369
Speaker 0: That was a test for it.

738
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:23,970
Speaker 0: Yeah Make a test for the thing that was just fixed and you will naturally grow your unit tests over time with almost no effort.

739
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:27,685
Speaker 1: When I when I make tests, you know my test is I basically make a test.

740
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,506
Speaker 1: that just if I'm making a website Which is usually what I make websites, right?

741
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,860
Speaker 1: I just make a test that hits makes a sense of.

742
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:42,750
Speaker 1: basically I get to every single Endpoint every single possible URL and says did I get a 200 or did I get it right?

743
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:43,610
Speaker 0: That's a good smoke test.

744
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:51,730
Speaker 1: like it's either working or it's just just just hit every URL with an Appropriate request and say did I get a 200 or did I get what I was supposed to get, right?

745
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,996
Speaker 1: Maybe it's like a login page.

746
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,770
Speaker 1: So for a login page, I'll send a good login and a bad login.

747
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:57,243
Speaker 1: I'd like did the bad login get a 403, right?

748
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,600
Speaker 1: It's like just the most simple possible test for a website.

749
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:04,610
Speaker 1: just hit every URL check the response code, right?

750
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:12,474
Speaker 1: And if you get any 500s, that's a failure and then I'll start with that and then I'll just add more tests for you know That's a testing.

751
00:56:12,615 --> 00:56:15,790
Speaker 1: All right testing is like a separate topic from the CI thing, right?

752
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:20,126
Speaker 0: But testing is like the core value of CI.

753
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:21,150
Speaker 0: is the test, right?

754
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:21,972
Speaker 1: Exactly.

755
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:26,170
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you just made a machine that breaks your code like you're gonna break things easily and quickly.

756
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:37,190
Speaker 1: Right, and you know, I've talked about testing before is like you still shouldn't go so crazy with the tests that writing Tests becomes too much work, right?

757
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:38,633
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you.

758
00:56:38,754 --> 00:56:43,290
Speaker 1: you some people go create like they're super test driven development nuts, right?

759
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,230
Speaker 1: And it's like they spend so much time writing tests.

760
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,219
Speaker 1: It takes them like a week to make the simplest.

761
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,585
Speaker 1: I would say they wrote a hundred.

762
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:49,509
Speaker 0: that is fine.

763
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:58,483
Speaker 0: in Specific contexts where you're making medical software you are doing Engineering work, but medical software shouldn't be continuously deployed.

764
00:56:58,503 --> 00:57:03,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, it should be continuously integrated in a test environment.

765
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,219
Speaker 1: Yes continuous deployment is not for things that matter.

766
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:12,197
Speaker 1: you don't to continuously deploy software to your satellite or your train signaling Right, exactly.

767
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:13,970
Speaker 1: You continuously deploy for things that matter less.

768
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:16,289
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's safe to you know.

769
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:25,870
Speaker 1: Only if you're basically saying I'm gonna put this small safety net of the automated tests and if anything can beat that I'm willing to let it deploy even if it's busted.

770
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:36,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, right if you're not willing to let something deploy that's even a little bit busted Which you shouldn't be for medical software train signaling satellites in space, you know Anything right.

771
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,950
Speaker 1: then you shouldn't be using continuous deployment, right?

772
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,310
Speaker 0: That's right.

773
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:49,413
Speaker 0: Well depending on because deployment can CD gets into the idea of you'll have many layers of staged environment you could.

774
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:57,569
Speaker 1: you could have in those in those instances the continuous testing where I am at Lee tests before being merged and They just don't automatically deploy.

775
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:03,314
Speaker 0: Well, I get a previous company where we had like we had a continuous Only with no CD.

776
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:09,070
Speaker 0: We had a CI environment, but we also had CD to a beta environment.

777
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:18,210
Speaker 0: That was basically like a mirror image of production, but was like like it just like all the data in production There's monitoring software was copied over to this other environment.

778
00:58:18,571 --> 00:58:25,330
Speaker 0: So one test could be written against that holistic environment and two people would notice if that environment broke.

779
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:34,310
Speaker 0: But so we could continuously deploy Beyond just the integration testing to catch more holistic issues, but there was no automated and also to production.

780
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:47,376
Speaker 0: But we did have a way and something had to be continuously deployed into that beta environment and at some point Someone would basically freeze it and say okay We're done deploying.

781
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,499
Speaker 0: That was the last commit.

782
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,630
Speaker 0: and then there's an automated process to deploy from beta to production.

783
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:57,510
Speaker 0: But that's when you start getting into enterprise software or big complex environments.

784
00:58:57,973 --> 00:59:03,140
Speaker 0: but that's also where continuous integration really starts to shine because that's where Imagine everything's got talked about.

785
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:13,470
Speaker 0: is one team in a company that has like 400 different teams or multiple companies in a consortium that are sharing code or providing joint services or all sorts of nonsense like that?

786
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:24,380
Speaker 0: That's where your continuous deployment is often into a testbed Environment where all the other people you interact with have their own CI CD into that testbed environment.

787
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:28,236
Speaker 0: and then there's a meta level of hey Is the testbed working?

788
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:35,630
Speaker 0: because if you do something that breaks the testbed you would have broken it for Everybody in production if you deployed right?

789
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:41,590
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's that's actually what happens that like most of the places I worked where it's you you push your code, right?

790
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,677
Speaker 1: It passes the tests.

791
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:59,210
Speaker 1: then if you merge your code It'll go to like it'll actually be deployed but it'll be deployed to like a QA environment Yeah, and then to be deployed to a higher environment There'll be like another branch like a staging branch And if you what you'll do is you'll just go with like one click manually though, right?

792
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:03,124
Speaker 1: Intentionally someone will say I like what's on QA right now.

793
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:04,530
Speaker 1: It looks good, right?

794
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:12,342
Speaker 1: We're gonna merge that to staging and now when you when they do that merge Right the tests will and deployment will run.

795
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:22,053
Speaker 1: and now that code they just merged Will now be deployed onto the staging environment and then if they like that then they'll apply like a tag like git tag 2.0.

796
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:22,214
Speaker 1: Yep.

797
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:32,190
Speaker 0: I bet we made extensive use of that tagging especially because we might get something that's going all the way into prod But then we find a bug that's only serious for like one type of client or like one use case.

798
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:38,830
Speaker 0: We could continue to go into prod but we have a tag branch to fix the bug for a narrow patch We could release later, right?

799
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:48,230
Speaker 1: But it's like you make a tag and it's like if a tag appears Then that suddenly triggers the CD and it gets deployed to the production environment for real.

800
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like you're it's on.

801
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,750
Speaker 1: all these deployments are happening automatically.

802
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:57,717
Speaker 1: you don't need a human being to go and be like go to the servers and Push buttons to make the deploy if you're like.

803
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:01,550
Speaker 0: if you're like dragging binary files with win SCP or something like.

804
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:03,319
Speaker 1: That's what you did back in the day.

805
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:05,007
Speaker 1: It's like oh I got to deploy the code on.

806
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:06,738
Speaker 1: you know It's like I want to update my website.

807
01:01:06,778 --> 01:01:08,530
Speaker 1: I guess I have to SSH to the server.

808
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I copy copy my code to the server unzip my code on the server Restart, you know sudu Apache restart, right?

809
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:23,495
Speaker 0: I remember in ancient times the first time I encountered Jenkins was like wait so I can click deploy and It'll actually just deploy that.

810
01:01:23,635 --> 01:01:29,690
Speaker 1: like that build you just automate all that parts all those parts just automatic They just happen, right?

811
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:38,150
Speaker 1: so all you need to do is through your version control and you know Testing is like a wall to keep things from going up to the no getting deployed.

812
01:01:38,732 --> 01:01:39,977
Speaker 1: You can just do all that stuff.

813
01:01:40,037 --> 01:01:45,689
Speaker 1: and now the greatest thing about this is that as a company It saves you a lot of time.

814
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:49,690
Speaker 1: You don't have to hire as many people like admin people, right?

815
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,603
Speaker 1: You just hire a devops person who you will pay less because you're evil.

816
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:56,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a set and the dev I find.

817
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,069
Speaker 0: in many industries devops gets paid more than engineering.

818
01:01:59,109 --> 01:02:03,390
Speaker 1: now I'm not I'm not saying the devops person gets paid less than the admin person.

819
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,180
Speaker 1: I'm saying you would need a team of admin.

820
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:05,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

821
01:02:05,562 --> 01:02:06,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true, right.

822
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:08,236
Speaker 1: to do it You would need a team of admins.

823
01:02:08,396 --> 01:02:11,150
Speaker 1: who to do like all these deployments and things, right?

824
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,978
Speaker 0: Well, like back before DevOps is a wise one.

825
01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:19,515
Speaker 1: devops person will set up the CI and CD systems and maintain them And then that's it.

826
01:02:19,957 --> 01:02:34,429
Speaker 0: Like when I worked at a broker-dealer a long time ago like our ops team did both the devops and like deployment stuff, but also the administration and The troubleshooting like we're all does in one team.

827
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,486
Speaker 0: But but what you just said that was also an environment where it was so long ago.

828
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:39,390
Speaker 0: I can talk about it in detail.

829
01:02:39,913 --> 01:02:42,084
Speaker 0: This is the furthest extent I've ever seen of this.

830
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:49,273
Speaker 0: like environment staging Five levels is like the furthest you want to go unless you're working on the deadly stuff We just talked about.

831
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:50,617
Speaker 0: we had dev.

832
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,674
Speaker 0: dev was gate was the contract was dev is not Guaranteed to be stable.

833
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:58,021
Speaker 0: like do not rely on dev being stable.

834
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:00,268
Speaker 0: dev will break all the time.

835
01:03:00,328 --> 01:03:00,850
Speaker 0: That's expected.

836
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:03,139
Speaker 0: Then we had QA one.

837
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:10,626
Speaker 0: someone's dev signed off saying yeah, this is good it would automatically just deploy to QA and QA could do whatever testing they wanted to do.

838
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:14,248
Speaker 0: then we had Beyond that we had a UAT of all.

839
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:21,649
Speaker 0: right now the users like the devops people will Deploy this in their environment and poke at it and make sure they understand it and they're happy with it.

840
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:29,176
Speaker 0: pre-prod which the sole purpose of pre-prod was to be a mirror image of production to make sure that it acted exactly Exactly the way production is supposed to act.

841
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,561
Speaker 0: and then finally production.

842
01:03:30,882 --> 01:03:39,474
Speaker 0: it took us two weeks to deploy software But every step was automated along the way except the human parts of like hey Does the thing actually work?

843
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:53,790
Speaker 1: or hey verify like sign off that you actually looked at this before we went live Mm-hmm, and you know even for things that aren't on a server for example Right if you have some sort of auto update platform, right?

844
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,990
Speaker 1: So let's say you have a game on Steam for example.

845
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,096
Speaker 1: Right you could continue.

846
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:00,219
Speaker 1: you're working on your game.

847
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:07,200
Speaker 1: every time someone a developer on the game pushes something out it builds Right and it auto builds right you know.

848
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:07,581
Speaker 1: so you don't?

849
01:04:07,922 --> 01:04:11,177
Speaker 1: the person at their computer doesn't need to like run the build and then Go take a drink.

850
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:18,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, right they push their code They keep they make a new branch And they work on something else and they'll get emails if that build failed and have to go fix it and fix that branch.

851
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:22,119
Speaker 0: My last place so everyone got an email.

852
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:27,458
Speaker 1: if someone broke the build okay sure but like you know that build is happening Automatically on some other server.

853
01:04:27,498 --> 01:04:37,556
Speaker 1: you can just code code code focusing on your code Right not worrying about the building and the deploying when you're the developer right and then you know once you know if you're Sitting at the game studio.

854
01:04:37,597 --> 01:04:37,878
Speaker 1: You're like.

855
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:40,389
Speaker 1: Oh, I like what I see and the dev build right now.

856
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:45,433
Speaker 1: I think that's word that has enough stuff in it that we should push that out to our Players.

857
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:48,529
Speaker 1: right so you push a button, and it will make up.

858
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,810
Speaker 1: It'll make a build and send it to steam and then everyone will get an auto update.

859
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:54,014
Speaker 1: Yeah Your new vert you write your.

860
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:58,613
Speaker 1: you write your update notes or your update notes for your iPad app or whatever it is goes to The App Store.

861
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,263
Speaker 1: right you wouldn't do it too frequently.

862
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:02,297
Speaker 1: You don't want updates every day But you do it.

863
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:07,728
Speaker 0: You know once a week once a month whenever Practical example overwatch right they have the real game.

864
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:09,557
Speaker 0: Everything scout just described.

865
01:05:09,898 --> 01:05:21,530
Speaker 0: they also have up like a play a testing Instance of the game and you can tell your client I want to play on the test and they just continuously deploy like balance changes and tweaks there all the time.

866
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,724
Speaker 0: It's just like whatever are they experimenting with right now is just there.

867
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:24,805
Speaker 0: yep.

868
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:38,717
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you are developing software in 2020 right before You start if you're if you're planning on doing something that's going to be a project that is like small And we'll just like end mm-hmm.

869
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:41,571
Speaker 1: right you probably don't need to waste time setting this up Right.

870
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:45,627
Speaker 1: you need to if your project is going to be long-lived right.

871
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:55,730
Speaker 1: so a website You're going to keep maintaining even you know a small website I guess for as a web any website That's small enough you would just use Squarespace or a card or one of those auto website things.

872
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, like don't write a website unless you have a good or WordPress, right?

873
01:05:59,470 --> 01:05:59,891
Speaker 1: We're talking about.

874
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:04,729
Speaker 1: we're talking about you write a website because you're making web application right developing something continually, right?

875
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:06,252
Speaker 1: Any?

876
01:06:06,272 --> 01:06:11,922
Speaker 1: or a game that you're gonna not just release and move on to the next thing But you're gonna keep patching because you have players right.

877
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:14,761
Speaker 1: you know something with users That's always existing.

878
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:15,569
Speaker 1: that needs work.

879
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:21,026
Speaker 1: You should start by making a blank project that has nothing in it right.

880
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:22,310
Speaker 1: so like say you're making a website.

881
01:06:22,754 --> 01:06:29,330
Speaker 1: You would just set up a blank website That's a blank page right and set up a server so that it continuously tests.

882
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:41,948
Speaker 1: It will run no tests at the start right, but it'll run the test runner And it'll say there are zero tests, and they all passed right and then Automatically deploy that to a server that will have a blank web page that you visit with your domain.

883
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:42,610
Speaker 1: you go to your website.

884
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:46,017
Speaker 1: There's a blank page there And you have that working to start with.

885
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:50,350
Speaker 1: as soon as you do that now working on the website will be so easy.

886
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

887
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:52,920
Speaker 1: You'll just start working like all right.

888
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,827
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make my home page make a home page.

889
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:55,409
Speaker 1: you make it.

890
01:06:55,752 --> 01:06:58,702
Speaker 1: Oh, it's on the server five And there's a test.

891
01:06:58,722 --> 01:06:59,890
Speaker 1: you make it one test for it.

892
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,496
Speaker 1: This is does the home page load?

893
01:07:01,777 --> 01:07:06,093
Speaker 1: so you and you you'll push and like the home page is on the server And it loads good.

894
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:11,950
Speaker 0: It feels just like an ancient times where I'd be like sitting there in VI like editing my web page.

895
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:20,290
Speaker 0: I write out the changes and then hit f5 on the browser that was pointed at the server I was on physically, but with appropriate layers of protection.

896
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:25,464
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so let's briefly talk about some of the options you have for doing this right.

897
01:07:25,524 --> 01:07:29,232
Speaker 1: so the thing that I've I guess I'm not really a fan Is the thing.

898
01:07:29,272 --> 01:07:36,330
Speaker 1: is it for all of these choices out there and in that our circle CI or or GitHub actions or?

899
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:37,532
Speaker 1: Jenkins?

900
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:42,110
Speaker 0: yes Jenkins is the only one I'm deeply familiar with because I don't write code anymore.

901
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,155
Speaker 0: I haven't write code.

902
01:07:43,175 --> 01:07:45,385
Speaker 1: get lab get lab includes one now.

903
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:46,350
Speaker 1: get lab get lab.

904
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,774
Speaker 1: I guess included one before get hub.

905
01:07:47,854 --> 01:07:49,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually get lab CI.

906
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,003
Speaker 1: of all these options.

907
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:53,270
Speaker 1: I'm actually not a huge fan of any of.

908
01:07:54,554 --> 01:07:57,214
Speaker 1: They're all sorted janky Right.

909
01:07:57,234 --> 01:07:59,429
Speaker 1: the none of them are awesome and great and beautiful.

910
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:02,529
Speaker 0: Well Jenkins is pretty good once it's set up.

911
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:06,709
Speaker 1: But no no they all all of them seem to work well when set up.

912
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:07,653
Speaker 1: It's just the.

913
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:09,782
Speaker 1: setting them up is not great.

914
01:08:10,124 --> 01:08:11,529
Speaker 1: Docker is always involved.

915
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:16,437
Speaker 1: YAML is usually involved.

916
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:17,078
Speaker 1: right.

917
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,466
Speaker 1: at least forget hub actions and circle CI.

918
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:20,529
Speaker 1: YAML is involved.

919
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,138
Speaker 1: So it's like none of them are great right?

920
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:31,644
Speaker 1: so you want to pick one that meets your needs right And it meets your pricing and your your whatever right.

921
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:32,930
Speaker 1: so you look at how much they cost.

922
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:36,040
Speaker 1: Look at whether you need your own hardware right.

923
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:45,609
Speaker 1: so Jenkins would be one that you're gonna use because you're setting it up on your Own hardware right and you're installing Jenkins, and you're configuring it And you have your own machines where the builds are gonna run.

924
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:58,670
Speaker 1: You know circle CI would be like you define these docker containers in these YAML files and then Circle CI is basically selling you their cloud servers, which are going to run your you know builds right?

925
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,962
Speaker 1: GitLab or get hub are the ones that they have.

926
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:05,710
Speaker 1: are sort of giving you the choice, right?

927
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:06,555
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

928
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:13,055
Speaker 1: you can install GitLab on your own servers Or you can pay for hosted GitLab you know and there's some amount of free service They'll give you.

929
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:16,639
Speaker 1: circle CI has an amount of free service They give you as well right, but you're basically.

930
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:19,050
Speaker 1: I think OZ also has some CI solutions.

931
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:21,661
Speaker 1: They have like OZ code deploy for the deploying part.

932
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:23,550
Speaker 1: I forget what they have for this the testing part.

933
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:33,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't actually know offhand But I have seen people with the integration testing use AWS specifically to spin up like external environments That will hit your servers or whatever it is.

934
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:39,037
Speaker 0: you're hosting your full thing on From the outside like clients to do like full end-to-end testing yeah, and all is.

935
01:09:39,117 --> 01:09:48,870
Speaker 1: the difference is when you get you and you use like a Solution like circle CI or get hub actions or GitLab actions with Docker right is they're getting their machines from somewhere else?

936
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,606
Speaker 1: Right like OZ?

937
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:56,584
Speaker 1: probably Right and they're spinning up your your your your docker containers or whatever.

938
01:09:56,644 --> 01:10:00,073
Speaker 1: right when you use OZ For your stuff.

939
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:09,424
Speaker 1: right you could actually spin up an EC2 instance right run install your whole application On it test it and then turn off the delete the instance.

940
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:10,629
Speaker 1: right you can do shit like that.

941
01:10:11,011 --> 01:10:15,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that really depends on the scale or Google Cloud as well, right?

942
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:15,872
Speaker 1: So

943
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:28,064
Speaker 0: you if you're in college right now like you're like you're gonna start your career Learning one or two of these and like learning how to set this stuff up will make you Surprisingly invaluable because no one wants to deal with this crap just for

944
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,930
Speaker 1: however long these things have been around.

945
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,036
Speaker 1: The people just really don't.

946
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:39,249
Speaker 1: I think a because it's sort of a set it and forget it thing where people tend to work on It at the beginning and then not touch it again once it's there.

947
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:40,433
Speaker 0: I've been.

948
01:10:40,473 --> 01:10:48,733
Speaker 0: I've been in instances where the jenkin builds failing and the problem is Jenkins but no one remembers how Jenkins was set up exactly or the?

949
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:51,818
Speaker 1: Now he said it and forget it.

950
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:54,491
Speaker 1: but like one person said it no I'll sit.

951
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:59,530
Speaker 0: oh yeah the person who had set up that Jenkins had retired and no one touched that Jenkins.

952
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:02,590
Speaker 0: They kept adding unit tests, but no one touched the Jenkins server.

953
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:03,132
Speaker 1: So it's like.

954
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:05,059
Speaker 1: the beauty of it is also the harm right?

955
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:13,310
Speaker 1: is that the people that it makes developers lives great because you just Focus on your code and this beautiful system takes care of the deploying and the testing and it's great.

956
01:11:14,372 --> 01:11:16,025
Speaker 1: But if you ever have to mess with that it sucks.

957
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:18,295
Speaker 1: so learn How those things work.

958
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:19,640
Speaker 1: learn a few different ones.

959
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:25,246
Speaker 0: learn one of them in detail like you don't have to get expert at all of Them because every job you work will have a different thing.

960
01:11:25,266 --> 01:11:25,930
Speaker 0: you're gonna have to learn.

961
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:35,950
Speaker 0: But right if you know like if you know Jenkins really well That will give you the tools to be able to learn any of these other things really well, right?

962
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:45,210
Speaker 1: But you know mostly it's that once even if you're doing a small product Project just for you all on your own, right?

963
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:57,625
Speaker 1: Having this set up to just deploy your little web app is gonna make you so much more productive Right that you're actually have a higher chance of actually delivering your product.

964
01:11:57,926 --> 01:11:59,570
Speaker 1: right just psychologically speaking.

965
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:05,090
Speaker 1: Right because of you know not having to like test and deploy all the time.

966
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:19,377
Speaker 1: you can just zone in right write code and Do one feature at a time and each feature as you develop it will be automatically deployed And you're gonna get closer to that sort of like instant gratification.

967
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:29,860
Speaker 1: you got back in the day writing like with like logo or We're like you would see your application like come together like as you're writing it And I think for most programmers and developers.

968
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:31,347
Speaker 1: I know the psychology of that.

969
01:12:31,407 --> 01:12:34,521
Speaker 1: you know Instant gratification of write code thing is better.

970
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:34,681
Speaker 1: right.

971
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:38,750
Speaker 1: you know having it immediately go out It's hugely beneficial.

972
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:39,272
Speaker 1: And

973
01:12:39,292 --> 01:13:03,899
Speaker 0: if you end up working for like a big enterprise company or like you know these like work for a Microsoft Or one of these big companies with huge armies of people writing very complex stacks of code The reality is you've got to know your way around these types of environments and these types of tools Because while you can work without them in small projects like Scott said it makes you faster and makes you better and probably makes you Happier in a big project.

974
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,087
Speaker 0: It's impossible to make progress without this stuff.

975
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:06,750
Speaker 1: yep.

976
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:14,099
Speaker 1: So yeah like for you know I just set it up for you know the new I'm trying to fix front row crew comm.

977
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,706
Speaker 1: it needs a lot of work as it does.

978
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:16,650
Speaker 0: that website is old.

979
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:26,024
Speaker 1: It hasn't been updated in a zillion years right and every time I have to make a change to it Right like I think like what happened recently Oh Libsyn changed their FTP or something.

980
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:28,190
Speaker 1: yeah for the automatic episode uploading.

981
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,830
Speaker 0: I think the last change before that was you prevented me from accidentally uploading a wav file.

982
01:13:32,372 --> 01:13:33,436
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, something like that right.

983
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:39,370
Speaker 1: so for me to fix that because it's so old and unmaintained I have to like go SSH to the server and mess around.

984
01:13:40,732 --> 01:13:41,976
Speaker 1: I have no way to test.

985
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:44,042
Speaker 1: I can have a local environment or anything right.

986
01:13:44,082 --> 01:14:01,438
Speaker 1: so I'm basically setting up a blank website that auto Deploys so that it can make a blank front row crew comm Right out of nut and then once I have that and then from once I have that set up I'll be able to update front row crew comm beautifully going forward and also bring in developers You know to help with.

987
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:02,543
Speaker 1: you know other stuff right.

988
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,766
Speaker 1: you'll people get us push changes And they'll be tested and deployed if I you know if I merge them right.

989
01:14:06,787 --> 01:14:08,392
Speaker 1: so It's.

990
01:14:08,552 --> 01:14:13,875
Speaker 1: it's great even for tiny projects like a podcast website if you're writing it yourself Which you probably shouldn't.

991
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:14,821
Speaker 1: but that's what we did cuz.

992
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:17,335
Speaker 0: yeah well because we started Podcasting before.

993
01:14:17,395 --> 01:14:20,430
Speaker 0: there were a lot of things that support started with WordPress.

994
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:24,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we still wrote code to glue it all together.

995
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,797
Speaker 1: We could have kept with WordPress forever.

996
01:14:27,058 --> 01:14:30,147
Speaker 0: We didn't use lips and do website because it barely worked back then.

997
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:35,818
Speaker 1: no So yes, that's the basics of CI CD.

998
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:39,568
Speaker 1: if you want to know more just google it and read a ton of documentation.

999
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:42,908
Speaker 1: the documentation Sucks, I've been reading it for some of these things.

1000
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:47,489
Speaker 1: But if you just just keep working at it until you get there ask for help.

1001
01:14:48,212 --> 01:14:55,950
Speaker 1: Support whatever you'll you'll you'll get there and the free versions of most of them are And more than enough for a small personal project.

1002
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:58,178
Speaker 1: You're only gonna run into having to pay money like.

1003
01:14:58,218 --> 01:15:03,458
Speaker 1: I think one of them was like thousands of minutes a month of free Compute time and I did my test.

1004
01:15:03,518 --> 01:15:06,550
Speaker 1: my test take 30 seconds for me to make thousands of minutes in a month.

1005
01:15:06,873 --> 01:15:08,270
Speaker 1: You know how many patches I would have to write.

1006
01:15:09,313 --> 01:15:10,302
Speaker 1: It's like it's not gonna happen.

1007
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:15,208
Speaker 1: so It's gonna be free for you unless you're a big project.

1008
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,938
Speaker 0: All right This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
