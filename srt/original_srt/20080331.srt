Speaker 0: more on programming languages.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:31,827
Speaker 0: Let's do this This weekend.

6
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:35,200
Speaker 1: well this past weekend was the night of iron.

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,547
Speaker 0: It's really more like the nothing weekend.

8
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was the weekend that also included the night of iron.

9
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:46,160
Speaker 1: well Saturday night We had nothing better to do and we had free time and all our work was done.

10
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:55,340
Speaker 1: So uh we had the night of iron And it was indeed a night of much metal, and it was a very good kind of metal notice.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,466
Speaker 1: I'm not saying what it was.

12
00:00:56,527 --> 00:01:02,160
Speaker 1: that's because I kind of want to keep you all in suspense Because nothing called night of iron could not be awesome.

13
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:08,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, we sort of just we didn't plan the night of iron and just sort of we were like hey Why don't we do this and like hey?

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,507
Speaker 0: That's that would be the night of iron wouldn't it?

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,276
Speaker 1: and the of course then we had no choice.

16
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:14,907
Speaker 1: the path before us had been Prepared.

17
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:17,246
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah That's all I got.

18
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,451
Speaker 1: the weekend was relaxing.

19
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,400
Speaker 1: I went to work today.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, I remember.

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:22,908
Speaker 0: I have an opening bit.

22
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,559
Speaker 1: I remember what it was like five minutes before the show going on.

23
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,979
Speaker 1: man I wanted to say something, but I forgot it as screw it and now you remember it.

24
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:31,722
Speaker 0: now I remember it.

25
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:35,180
Speaker 0: I knew I would remember it real soon that I did all right.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,700
Speaker 0: So what do you got so when I worked in the city the last time which is the first job?

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,783
Speaker 0: I got out of college.

28
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,909
Speaker 0: that wasn't a co-op right.

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,149
Speaker 0: I worked over near where Emily and Alex work now right and that building Had a scaffold on it.

30
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,059
Speaker 1: is that scaffold finally gone?

31
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,029
Speaker 0: well No, that's scaffold while I was still working there.

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,336
Speaker 0: They removed it right at some point.

33
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:55,998
Speaker 1: is it back?

34
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,827
Speaker 1: no Did it fall on someone now?

35
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:05,944
Speaker 0: then I that same company moved me to the middle of nowhere And then I quit that company and I came to work for the company I'm working at now.

36
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,139
Speaker 0: the building that I'm working at now had a scaffold on it.

37
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,371
Speaker 0: Until today they removed the scaffold.

38
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,980
Speaker 1: I think that means that you're gonna get a new job.

39
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:22,039
Speaker 0: I know I think it means that I I will only be hired by companies in New York that have scaffolds around the building.

40
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,871
Speaker 0: Well, you know eventually that scaffold to be removed for the building.

41
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,804
Speaker 1: by that logic because I have a similar logic every time I get a job.

42
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:39,468
Speaker 1: I walk from Yonkers station up to Well from Yonkers station up to kind of the northern part of Yonkers Uh-huh, and then I take the number six bus.

43
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,591
Speaker 0: All right.

44
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:42,598
Speaker 1: So yeah call Randy, okay.

45
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:45,331
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's all we got.

46
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:48,104
Speaker 0: That's it Scaffolds on buildings.

47
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:55,574
Speaker 0: It's pretty freaky when they take them off cuz that scaffold must have been there so long Cuz all the stores they don't have big signs saying what they are.

48
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,060
Speaker 0: This is this big flat area.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,560
Speaker 0: So all those stores are probably gonna be calling up the sign makers.

50
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,785
Speaker 1: Well, actually funnily enough.

51
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,720
Speaker 1: I went to dinner a ramen joint with Emily on Friday just kind of out of the blue.

52
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:05,608
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to go to dinner.

53
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we went out and I did.

54
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:12,679
Speaker 1: we just we're walking through asked like near Astor place because there's an awesome video game store there.

55
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:27,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then she says hey, look where we are Remember this and I'm like I look around and I don't recognize anything like I look and it's like wow I probably never been on the street before and it turns out no It was that she used to live on that street.

56
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,953
Speaker 1: The scaffold was just gone.

57
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,540
Speaker 1: It looked like a different Street.

58
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,924
Speaker 1: Yep, but that reminded me of something that happened Before I met her.

59
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:38,155
Speaker 1: I got out of work I got killed by a scaffold.

60
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:38,537
Speaker 1: Yes.

61
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 1: I'm in fact dead.

62
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,623
Speaker 0: This is a computer-generated Rim and scaffold.

63
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:45,893
Speaker 1: ate your mom much like how they finished that John Candy movie without John.

64
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,060
Speaker 0: and I even seek you miss eek scaffold revenge.

65
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,120
Speaker 1: Actually that that leads to even God talk about the non sequitur train going off to nowhere.

66
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,688
Speaker 1: Well, actually no, it's the sequitur train.

67
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,373
Speaker 1: It's not a non sequitur at all.

68
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,284
Speaker 1: when John Candy died that When John came back

69
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,548
Speaker 0: I was killed by a scaffold

70
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:16,116
Speaker 1: and when princess died when both of them died were two instances Where I was able to prove to my parents Astoundingly that the internet was powerful because they never believed me and they always kind of scoffed at like whatever.

71
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:20,435
Speaker 1: and then I remember one day I was like, hey John Candy's dead and they were like what.

72
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:21,019
Speaker 1: that's BS.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,963
Speaker 1: There's no way.

74
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:27,199
Speaker 0: and then the next day the new there's no way that a big fat unhealthy guy died.

75
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,965
Speaker 1: Okay It was there's no way.

76
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,531
Speaker 1: how would you found out about that?

77
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:30,893
Speaker 1: I was like.

78
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,319
Speaker 1: the internet said so.

79
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:42,980
Speaker 1: And then when princess died, I was in the realm playing and then someone named princess die was said out of the blue man I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this name.

80
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:45,927
Speaker 1: He'd even called that for like two years.

81
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,677
Speaker 1: Uh, and he I'm like what.

82
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:51,832
Speaker 1: and he's like, uh, Well, and he says what happened.

83
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,544
Speaker 1: and then we're all like, oh Yeah, that sucks.

84
00:04:55,227 --> 00:05:02,180
Speaker 0: change your name dude, no, he was like level 80 you couldn't change your name, uh Yeah, what can you change your name in the World of Warcraft?

85
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,859
Speaker 1: It's just make an alt and power level it.

86
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:09,935
Speaker 0: I know but I mean like if I level up to like the highest level in World of Warcraft But my name suddenly becomes taboo.

87
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:10,499
Speaker 0: Can I change it?

88
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,154
Speaker 1: Yes by making an alt and power leveling it.

89
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,208
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the thing all you kids now.

90
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:17,951
Speaker 1: You're so lucky.

91
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,020
Speaker 1: There was no such thing as power leveling in the realm.

92
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:24,945
Speaker 0: Well, there was there every I think, you know back in the day there was power leveling But you know what they did.

93
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,420
Speaker 0: they would fucking notice you doing it and kick your ass.

94
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:28,330
Speaker 0: No, no.

95
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:34,540
Speaker 1: back in the day Once you got a high enough level you get like one experience point for killing the biggest baddest thing in the land.

96
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,280
Speaker 1: You'd have to go and kill it a thousand times to level up.

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,404
Speaker 1: There was no way around that.

98
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,414
Speaker 1: a higher level character couldn't get you more experience.

99
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:42,819
Speaker 0: All right anyway.

100
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:50,810
Speaker 1: Good move on to news and things of the day, but I didn't tell my story Because I don't worry I don't know I have a lot to say about my news.

101
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:59,120
Speaker 1: so aside from John Candy dying I was waiting in the Starbucks duster place not the scary hobo Starbucks the other Starbucks the nice one.

102
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:00,239
Speaker 0: Oh this story.

103
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:06,320
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is just weird and funny and it's probably bad because I'm sure it stroked my ego just a little bit.

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,908
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's kind of weird.

105
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:08,451
Speaker 1: It's funny.

106
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:15,580
Speaker 0: I think your ego It's kind of hard for anyone to stroke it because basically you have these auto Strokers that are covering every inch of it.

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,549
Speaker 0: You know what and the surface area is.

108
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,240
Speaker 0: even though the surface area is constantly increasing He does the auto strokers sort of spawn new strokers.

109
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,309
Speaker 1: I think the real the real issue with my ego is that.

110
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,139
Speaker 1: well actually it's much related to tomorrow's thing of the day anyway.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm sitting in the Starbucks and Emily calls me.

112
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,960
Speaker 1: She says she's gonna be a little bit late, and that's fine.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,820
Speaker 1: I got my laptop I'm working on stuff, and I'm just chilling there and a few minutes later this cool this guy.

114
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,440
Speaker 1: He's pretty cool-looking you know 20-something guy, and he he walks up behind me, and he says excuse me, sir.

115
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:49,834
Speaker 1: And I'm like yes, I turn around are you a?

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,046
Speaker 1: Long pregnant pause are you rim from geek nights, and I'm like yes Oh my god.

117
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,334
Speaker 1: I can't believe it's you.

118
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,465
Speaker 1: I heard your voice But I wasn't sure where.

119
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,116
Speaker 1: I had to look a picture of you up online and make sure it was you.

120
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,339
Speaker 1: oh my god My girlfriend's gonna be so jealous cuz she's not here, but oh my god.

121
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:18,974
Speaker 1: And that the fact that I have been recognized by a fan Randomly in New York City as opposed to randomly at say an anime convention.

122
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:24,937
Speaker 1: I've been to for the last five years is Somewhat startling and bad for my ego not getting any smaller.

123
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:31,690
Speaker 0: well I mean on the one hand it's sort of likely I mean in a crowded city with a lot of people.

124
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:46,179
Speaker 0: you know if you have a few thousand fans around the world You know and we Limit to the English-speaking world odds of fans being in New York City pretty good Odds of fans being in a part in New York City where people our age tend to be a little bit about.

125
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,143
Speaker 0: you know It's really.

126
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:55,108
Speaker 0: you met a fan in public in the one of the most likely places Most likely places that'd be like a GameStop.

127
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but you know what I'm saying.

128
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,500
Speaker 0: It's like it's pretty close.

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,658
Speaker 0: It's pretty high on the charts of likely place to meet a geek nights fan in public.

130
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:07,500
Speaker 0: yeah But even then I think it's not like you met a geek nights fan on a cornfield in Kansas.

131
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:17,693
Speaker 1: You know that might be more likely because odds are if I was going to a cornfield in Kansas on the show I'd be like I'm gonna be in this stupid cornfield next week if anyone lives there.

132
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,897
Speaker 1: Please come say hi.

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:25,469
Speaker 0: Please give me some gosh Much of glory.

134
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,698
Speaker 0: I need more of everything else.

135
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,758
Speaker 1: But no I think it illustrates something much more important.

136
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,828
Speaker 1: People recognize us not by sight, but by sound.

137
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,120
Speaker 1: now think of that sitting there doing your thing and Sony redo our website.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,440
Speaker 0: We'll have we'll go get pictures taken of us, and we'll have pictures there.

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,734
Speaker 0: So people will recognize us by sight and we'll also start doing videos or something.

140
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:51,900
Speaker 1: the fact that you could be sitting somewhere And then you hear my voice, and it's like I don't know where that voice came from but I know what it was.

141
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,167
Speaker 1: Yep, so yeah, dude.

142
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,656
Speaker 1: I forget your name, but I think I saw that you emailed me.

143
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 1: You're totally cool.

144
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,748
Speaker 0: I think his girlfriend emailed.

145
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:01,897
Speaker 1: Oh he also emailed us like a little while ago.

146
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,600
Speaker 1: I haven't read it yet.

147
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,278
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, whatever cuz I'm doing this podcast thing instead.

148
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,194
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm speaking of podcast.

149
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:08,979
Speaker 1: What are you on the news?

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,202
Speaker 0: okay, so Motorola.

151
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,564
Speaker 0: Motorola is a company.

152
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:17,049
Speaker 0: Motorola makes a lot more things than you realize they make.

153
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:22,051
Speaker 0: I mean Before the max had like IBM power PCs in them.

154
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:25,020
Speaker 0: now all the max had Motorola CPUs in them.

155
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,789
Speaker 0: Motorola makes a lot of chips that make a lot of things.

156
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,080
Speaker 0: in general you probably have Motorola products in your house.

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,665
Speaker 0: You don't even know about The Motorola products in your house.

158
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:37,136
Speaker 0: that you do know about though are usually probably cell phones and that sort of thing.

159
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:42,469
Speaker 0: and you know for a long time Motorola actually was a pretty badass cell phone maker.

160
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,613
Speaker 0: I mean that's star tech.

161
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,480
Speaker 0: I had one that was one of the best phones.

162
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,711
Speaker 0: It's like the first phone that was kind of thin you know.

163
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,687
Speaker 0: and then they made the razor Which is like y'all.

164
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:51,512
Speaker 0: it's a huge hit.

165
00:09:51,914 --> 00:10:01,819
Speaker 0: right crazy huge but You don't really realize it these days, but Motorola is kinda in the shitter not doing so.

166
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:12,000
Speaker 0: well yeah, they they've had a lot of trouble lately in the stocks and such and and and One of the things I realized you know from reading this and reading other things is that business wise?

167
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:18,268
Speaker 0: Part of the reason they're doing bad is not only because they haven't come up with anything new But I'll get to that but because the razor right.

168
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,652
Speaker 0: when the razor first came out.

169
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:23,180
Speaker 0: It was like it was sort of like Apple's products.

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,440
Speaker 0: It was a super sexy high-profile device that people desired because it was so ludicrously thin right.

171
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:37,700
Speaker 0: But unlike Apple where Apple will up the marketing up the price and make it you know like oh, it is so great.

172
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,208
Speaker 0: Motorola started out that way.

173
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,138
Speaker 0: the razor was like 200 bucks and like this ultra fancy thing.

174
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:43,880
Speaker 0: only for a minute.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,919
Speaker 0: You know cool people.

176
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:50,434
Speaker 1: But then now long later him Captain gets the cheapest crap cell phone that he can get free from.

177
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,832
Speaker 1: whoever gets cell phones from Goes to get a cell phone, and they're like here's a razor.

178
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:55,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, now.

179
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:56,980
Speaker 0: I have it like every freaking color.

180
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,247
Speaker 0: It's the free phone that you get it's like.

181
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,056
Speaker 0: so it's really you know doing that.

182
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,098
Speaker 0: on the one hand You know it's sort of like.

183
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:21,267
Speaker 0: well You make a lot of money because now you sell a bajillion razors But on the other hand you don't make so much money and keep your company afloat because you don't have you're not the having the cool Awesome products, but now as for not coming up with anything else Some guy he's not just some guy.

184
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,112
Speaker 0: actually he's new mayor for Oz.

185
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,455
Speaker 0: I probably pronounced his name wrong.

186
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:32,087
Speaker 0: Sorry new mayor for Oz He was the personal advisor To Jeffrey Frost.

187
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,400
Speaker 0: Jeffrey Frost was Motorola's former CMO.

188
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:45,580
Speaker 0: That's the guy who in pretty much invented the razor right and then worked on the rocker And he was pretty much the guy at Motorola who may and pretty much came up with all their shit.

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,563
Speaker 0: That was worth a damn.

190
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:47,888
Speaker 0: and without that guy.

191
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:48,450
Speaker 0: They're fucked.

192
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:56,519
Speaker 0: and well that guy died in 2005 and it's pretty sad Because I mean there's no evidence of this.

193
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:01,701
Speaker 0: But if you read the story like if this was like a play on Broadway You it.

194
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,248
Speaker 0: basically the guy was worked to death.

195
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:13,040
Speaker 0: the company and all the executives pretty much work this guy To death having him come up with all the new stuff, but regardless that's a separate.

196
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,960
Speaker 1: It's a separate issue though granted this obviously this guy had a high truck factor.

197
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:27,058
Speaker 0: He had the highest truck factor because now without him Motorola's in the shitter and his personal advisor new mayor for Oz Wrote a letter to engage.

198
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:34,728
Speaker 0: well He wrote a letter to Greg Brown and the rest of the executive team of Motorola pretty much Calling them out like well you guys suck.

199
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:41,209
Speaker 0: You've ruined Motorola, which is a great company blah blah blah and This is really a fascinating read.

200
00:12:41,229 --> 00:13:02,220
Speaker 0: because he sent the letter to Engadget to be posted on Engadget, which There's a guy Jason Calacanis who used to be in charge of weblogs incorporated which is a division of AOL which is which Engadget's a division of that and He's now doing something else, but on Twitter He talked about how the way Engadget is so awesome.

201
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:07,740
Speaker 0: Is that all these people who work at these big tech companies are like friends with the Engadget guys?

202
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:22,886
Speaker 0: And they'll use Engadget as a bludgeon against their own companies like so some guy working at a company Like say Apple right if Apple does something They don't like they'll leak it to Engadget and Engadget will say it and then force Apple You know to change its ways or whatever.

203
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:26,456
Speaker 1: granted if I were Apple what I would do is internal to the company.

204
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:30,000
Speaker 0: I'd Periodically I'll just block Engadget.com.

205
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:43,119
Speaker 1: I'd make it appear that things were gonna happen to select groups of employees that weren't gonna happen But that were bad and see what got leaked and then and then of course I can look good by being no That's totally untrue and made up and discredit all these people.

206
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:48,616
Speaker 1: But then I could slowly figure out who's leaking and either get rid of them or get rid of them.

207
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:52,880
Speaker 0: the side effect of that Though is that all these really bad stories about your company will get out.

208
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:57,940
Speaker 1: See, but then all those really bad stories immediately get refuted and never come to pass.

209
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,832
Speaker 0: It doesn't help it doesn't you know that?

210
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,128
Speaker 0: might you know, that's true But the mind share is still.

211
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,930
Speaker 1: you're putting negative mind share even when if the reputation Short term if you do it once yes view it twice.

212
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,131
Speaker 1: Yes, if you do it 40 times Then suddenly no one trusts any bad news about your company.

213
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:25,077
Speaker 1: and then when it finds out that you're actually dumping radioactive waste inside of baby seals for fun No one cares cuz that's just fake like all those other fake stories.

214
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:34,674
Speaker 0: anyway The point is is a really fascinating news story and it's it's kind of sad cuz like wow Motorola was you know They made good phones.

215
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,759
Speaker 0: and now What's going on?

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:48,759
Speaker 0: The company is splitting in half one half of the cut the phone part of the company is going one way and all the other Stuff that's actually profitable and still, you know business as usual chips and stuff is going to the other part of the company.

217
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 1: now I'm not allowed to really talk about my opinions on the future of Motorola But I think I can say it pretty obliquely by saying that I will probably never see in my hands a new Motorola cell phone.

218
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,507
Speaker 0: No, it's pretty.

219
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,760
Speaker 0: it's really fascinating reading all this stuff.

220
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:12,640
Speaker 0: This guy says because he talks about how like why does Motorola Have like this fleet of private jets where other companies the same size maybe have one or two, you know?

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,440
Speaker 0: And it's like why you know are the executives like don't even know how to use a computer?

222
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:30,255
Speaker 0: he has you know emails printed out and put on his desk and He basically just bashes all the CEOs and boards and all the high-up executives in the company for being completely incompetent and not knowing anything.

223
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:36,540
Speaker 0: and He talks about how there's the one the guy who died is pretty much the only reason that their phones ever successful.

224
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:48,179
Speaker 0: and wow, it's a pretty sad story that it is general and It's really worth reading if you care about the insides of tech companies and how the tech industry works and whatnot.

225
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:55,320
Speaker 1: So speaking of one person who's awesome I want to talk about this a little bit because it the story itself is not super important.

226
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,950
Speaker 1: This is like news from nowhere that no one will really care about.

227
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,920
Speaker 1: but the lessons learned from this are pretty Impressive and important to damage irreversible.

228
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:07,295
Speaker 1: Man, that comic hasn't updated in like ever.

229
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,600
Speaker 0: but those guys you still do stuff.

230
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,819
Speaker 0: They did something for penny arcade recently, but they don't do anything for me now that out.

231
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,549
Speaker 0: In fact, I imagine if you paid them they do something.

232
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:16,774
Speaker 1: No, they didn't remember.

233
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:23,080
Speaker 1: I ordered from them A big poster and for like five months it never came.

234
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:28,360
Speaker 1: So finally I went to mocha and they were there and I was like I ordered a poster.

235
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:29,824
Speaker 1: Where is it?

236
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,453
Speaker 1: And they were like, ah, would you like one now?

237
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:34,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like, yes.

238
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:35,162
Speaker 1: Yes I do.

239
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,875
Speaker 0: if they're at mocha again, you can get on their case.

240
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:50,694
Speaker 1: Ah Oh, well anyway, so, uh, basically the story here is that some school that had a computer network Was so Incompetently managed like pretty much every school I've ever seen is in terms of pretty

241
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:55,400
Speaker 0: much every public school in the u.s And most of the private schools and pretty much most schools.

242
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:01,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but well, there's a town somewhere where the town has I like a team of like three IT guys who were super Linux.

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,446
Speaker 0: Ease of the whole town is perfect.

244
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:05,579
Speaker 0: But anyway anywhere else is probably terrible anyway.

245
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:14,434
Speaker 1: So basically what happened is this 11 year old kid who knew a little bit more about computers than everyone else at this school Including the teachers.

246
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:18,720
Speaker 1: everyone Basically said I'll fix it and now he's the network admin.

247
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 0: Well days after the IT guy just left, you know, basically was just like screw this school and he was a terrible IT guy.

248
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:32,587
Speaker 0: Apparently, you know the the librarian who sort of you know, because the librarian has to deal with you know Like library computers and whatnots they.

249
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:40,239
Speaker 0: I remember in elementary school our librarian was sort of more You know the computers than anyone else because he sort of forced to learn that sort of thing a little bit.

250
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:46,165
Speaker 0: So his mom was librarian which is why you know, he sort of got into that You know gig there

251
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,210
Speaker 1: now the kid didn't get

252
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,135
Speaker 0: an inside the kid

253
00:17:48,155 --> 00:18:03,274
Speaker 1: didn't do a perfect job but he proved something very important because Basically, all he did was the smart thing that anyone with even basic like technological computer literacy not straight-up computer literacy But like kind of power user computer literacy would do.

254
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,780
Speaker 1: he support scan the network.

255
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:16,020
Speaker 1: You know ping scan figured out what all the devices were Got rid of all the spyware and malware Put some antivirus and some you know gateways and things and basically just cleaned everything up and upgraded everything.

256
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just you know went around doing Windows Update and all that He didn't.

257
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:39,695
Speaker 0: actually he's not actually doing the good amazing job that someone like us would do But he's still what he's doing with basic knowledge of things that he's basically doing to every computer in the school What you should do to your computer in your house and it's making the school a thousand times better than every other school Even though it's still not good on the absolute Scott scale.

258
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:43,567
Speaker 1: now this Speaks both of hope and of fear.

259
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:58,338
Speaker 1: it speaks of hope because it is proving to me that yes the generations that are coming up Despite the fact that things are a lot easier for them than they were for us And then things are a lot easier for us than they were for the people before us There are still punk kids out there who know what they're doing.

260
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:08,340
Speaker 0: Yep They're still learning the technology because I mean we you know, there are some people who have said that hey You know we because you weren't forced to use computers when computers were hard to use.

261
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:09,866
Speaker 0: You don't actually learn anything.

262
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:10,970
Speaker 0: and it sort of seemed that way.

263
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,800
Speaker 0: it seemed like, you know people who were younger than us.

264
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,400
Speaker 0: They knew how to use a computer for Facebook or whatever But they didn't really know because they didn't have to deal with installing PC games and DOS.

265
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,891
Speaker 0: But then at the same time, you know writing in basic on it.

266
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:33,883
Speaker 1: Yes a lot of people from that generation They only know how to use Facebook, but the similar percentage of people from the previous generation Couldn't have used a computer at all Even if they were like.

267
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:39,520
Speaker 1: and this I think the same percentage of kids are awesome and techie regardless of how easy it is.

268
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:40,999
Speaker 0: It's beginning to seem that way.

269
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:47,536
Speaker 1: They have the benefit that they can stand on the shoulders of giants and skip all the.

270
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,120
Speaker 1: they don't have to learn about IRQs.

271
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,276
Speaker 1: They can jump straight into writing a Python program.

272
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:51,639
Speaker 1: Yep.

273
00:19:53,061 --> 00:20:09,020
Speaker 1: But it also speaks of fear because the fact that this school did not have any competent technological person at all Not a single person knew enough about computers to let to be able to do a better job than an 11 year old.

274
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I would do it hire me, but they cry can't afford me.

275
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:13,754
Speaker 0: So it's not gonna.

276
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:15,520
Speaker 1: they're not gonna pay me six figures?

277
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:18,360
Speaker 0: No, they're not which which is what it would take for me to be.

278
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,160
Speaker 0: I would be the IT guy and the computer teacher at the high school for an entire school district.

279
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:29,934
Speaker 0: You'd have to pay me $100,000 a year because I would be like, you know I'd probably be willing to do it for a lot less.

280
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:36,400
Speaker 0: That'd be a great job But even then it would still be like 80,000 like they wouldn't pay me that I'd be getting more than any teacher.

281
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:41,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's really the sad thing is really I'd be doing two jobs teacher job and IT guy job.

282
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,299
Speaker 0: That's gonna take a lot of monies.

283
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,808
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is just that there's.

284
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,720
Speaker 1: there's no the way IT and CS and computer things work.

285
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:57,380
Speaker 1: If you're competent at all You can always make a ton of money out in the real world and not working for schools.

286
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,370
Speaker 1: Not just schools, but other things do I mean?

287
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,939
Speaker 1: most hospitals have awful IT.

288
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,933
Speaker 1: Part of the reason why I live a part of the reason why I left my previous company.

289
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:05,094
Speaker 1: Yeah.

290
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:11,635
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, IT is so bad that 11 year old kids can do a better job.

291
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:16,736
Speaker 0: Even when the job they do is terrible It's still a better job than real people thing is those J.

292
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:17,740
Speaker 1: He didn't do a terrible job.

293
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,466
Speaker 1: He did probably the same job.

294
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,352
Speaker 1: I would have done when I was 11.

295
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:24,021
Speaker 0: I mean God when I was 11.

296
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:27,524
Speaker 1: Well, you were 11 Scott when I was 11 They didn't have any windows.

297
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:35,619
Speaker 1: but but even if they did when you think about what think about in middle school What you knew about computers you would you could do a middle school job, probably.

298
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:40,466
Speaker 0: Yeah Realistically my school didn't really do such a bad job there They're only there.

299
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,676
Speaker 0: the bad job they did was and you know There were a few sick obvious security problems, which I could have patched up that they didn't.

300
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:51,300
Speaker 0: but other than that The main problem was their bad policy rather than their bad systems.

301
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,212
Speaker 1: I remember when they caught me in hacking the computer.

302
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,960
Speaker 0: hacking the computer was installing shockwave flash.

303
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,230
Speaker 1: Not even that hacking the computer was.

304
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:11,458
Speaker 1: I rebooted and then I held f5 So I was in DOS and then I was writing a program in cube basic to make sounds Bored and they accused me of hacking and I was like, can you even explain what I'm doing?

305
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,425
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and they really couldn't.

306
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,340
Speaker 1: and they were like if you weren't an honor student you would have been suspended.

307
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,748
Speaker 0: Whatever.

308
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:28,718
Speaker 1: yeah, okay But anyway things of the day.

309
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,762
Speaker 1: I'll warn you.

310
00:22:30,063 --> 00:22:32,290
Speaker 1: I think this thing of the day is awesome.

311
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,061
Speaker 1: However, some of you might think that is boring.

312
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:41,064
Speaker 1: what I have to say to you who think it is boring That is that I don't know I could make fun of you.

313
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:42,510
Speaker 1: I don't know what I would say.

314
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:48,460
Speaker 1: I'll just warn you that you might not find this terribly interesting But at the same time you might find this fascinating.

315
00:22:49,002 --> 00:23:10,109
Speaker 1: This is a 20-minute explanation of how to manipulate three-dimensional and two-dimensional shapes in terms of inversion and That might sound weird but trust me if nothing else watch the first five minutes because they'll explain what they're talking about and Then they'll ask a question.

316
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:11,557
Speaker 1: You'll get a couple of.

317
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:14,812
Speaker 1: you'll think oh, I'll just do it this way and they'll say oh well Here's why that doesn't work.

318
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:21,010
Speaker 1: and they show you with this little diagram and then they'll show you the answer and the answer is crazy.

319
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,418
Speaker 1: Now if after seeing the answer

320
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:31,163
Speaker 0: and someone's like Nobel Prize or not Nobel Prize level But that's like masters doctor thesis math answer there in terms

321
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:31,324
Speaker 1: of

322
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,026
Speaker 0: some guy figure

323
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:41,130
Speaker 1: that out and describing kind of like Three-dimensional geometry and and math like just I'm trying to use words that will make this make sense.

324
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,180
Speaker 0: It's the kind of stuff, but we don't even really understand.

325
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,969
Speaker 0: so it's not easy to talk about it.

326
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:46,877
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it.

327
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:53,737
Speaker 0: I remember doing a lot of stuff with three-dimensional service and calculate I mean, I sort of I understand it on a surface level I could not reproduce.

328
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:55,505
Speaker 1: was that it was that a joke or did?

329
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:56,570
Speaker 1: was that just a mistake?

330
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,853
Speaker 0: It was sort of a joke.

331
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:58,837
Speaker 0: I could not.

332
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:02,430
Speaker 0: I could not reproduce it nor could I explain it very well.

333
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:10,883
Speaker 1: I mean the furthest I got was like alright calculate the The charge distribution on a three-dimensional surface.

334
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:16,341
Speaker 1: and if that sounds scary It's even scarier when you find out that the answer is double integrals.

335
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:19,350
Speaker 1: Yep, double integrals suck my balls.

336
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,900
Speaker 0: Single integral sometimes like my balls.

337
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,250
Speaker 0: So - she has more ball sucking.

338
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:28,626
Speaker 1: The thing is a double integral sucks the whole set isn't even so simple as two integrals.

339
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:29,750
Speaker 1: It's something far worse.

340
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:39,810
Speaker 1: I know I know but anyway, this video is Amazing because this is this is the way to teach things like this because it's kind of a question and answer.

341
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:52,709
Speaker 1: You've got the instructor who knows the answer asking the leading questions and the person who doesn't know the answer asking Questions and they're kind of being guided toward discovering the answer on their own without being given the.

342
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:59,024
Speaker 0: yeah it's sort of like the very beginning of the video, which is all I've seen is Basically, anyone can understand what's going on.

343
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:05,896
Speaker 0: It's very visual It's very obvious and it really if you're the kind of person who is a problem-solving thinking person You're gonna look at this.

344
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,490
Speaker 0: you give like, huh?

345
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,444
Speaker 0: Huh, and the guy is thinking the same thing.

346
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,390
Speaker 0: You're thinking so, huh?

347
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,190
Speaker 1: I showed Scott a little bit and he's like duh, I do this and then the video is like duh, I'll do this.

348
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:17,836
Speaker 1: Oh, it didn't work shit.

349
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,081
Speaker 0: And I'm like, no, it's bullshit.

350
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,126
Speaker 0: It would have worked.

351
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,150
Speaker 0: But I was wrong.

352
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,487
Speaker 1: They're like, no, here's why I wouldn't work.

353
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:32,904
Speaker 0: And then eventually like here's the right answer and the right answer is so crazy that you want to watch the rest Which is probably would have been boring on its own except it's explaining the thing.

354
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:34,550
Speaker 0: That was so crazy that blew you away.

355
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,960
Speaker 1: Yes, and seriously, it's worth watching just to see the crazy thing.

356
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,524
Speaker 1: You'll know it when you see it.

357
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:46,010
Speaker 1: It's crazy the answer It's like the answer is probably gonna imagine if there's like a simple math problem, right?

358
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,410
Speaker 0: But you couldn't really figure out the answer, but it didn't seem too complicated.

359
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,295
Speaker 1: It's like adding like they ask you questions like add a bunch of single-digit numbers together Like and you're like, huh?

360
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,629
Speaker 0: And it's a little tricky maybe but you're sort of getting at it.

361
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,494
Speaker 1: And then you're like what.

362
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:04,363
Speaker 0: you have the ability to think about the problem But you can't arrive at the answer because every answer you come with is wrong.

363
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:07,570
Speaker 0: and then you're just like, oh, yeah The answer is absolutely insane.

364
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,668
Speaker 1: It's like add a bunch of single-digit numbers and then multiply it by like 1.1 and blah blah blah.

365
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,178
Speaker 1: You're like, alright Alright, what's?

366
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:15,610
Speaker 1: the answer is like 10 billion?

367
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,870
Speaker 1: Like what 10 million?

368
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,218
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway This is super cool.

369
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:23,483
Speaker 0: All right, so check out.

370
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:25,210
Speaker 0: This is way cool, dude.

371
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:31,990
Speaker 0: And he's doing some raps now usually raps about things that are you know, it's so often corny.

372
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,023
Speaker 0: This one is a little bit corny, but this is terribly corny.

373
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,126
Speaker 0: It's not terribly good.

374
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,230
Speaker 1: It is terribly corny.

375
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,758
Speaker 0: It's kind of corny, but it's terribly corny.

376
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:42,600
Speaker 0: It's kind of corny.

377
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,286
Speaker 0: This dude does a rap.

378
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:55,802
Speaker 0: He's pretty good at the rapping I would say slightly above-average rapping skills but his rap is about web design and This guy really knows about web design.

379
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:03,593
Speaker 0: and if you know about web design This rap will entertain you greatly because it's pretty much just inside Basically.

380
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:07,846
Speaker 1: guide to web design don't get turned off by the very beginning.

381
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,350
Speaker 1: It might be like, oh, this is gonna be lame.

382
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,319
Speaker 1: He goes into some depth.

383
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we're talking minutia.

384
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,230
Speaker 0: We're you know, usually you hear one of these raps and it's like they sort of talk about something.

385
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:25,030
Speaker 0: They'll discuss a topic, but obviously they only have some sort of surface layman's knowledge of the topic.

386
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,740
Speaker 1: You know a lot of those like people who are.

387
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,540
Speaker 1: they say they're nerdcore and they try to make some nerdcore But all they really do is say Dungeons & Dragons twice.

388
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

389
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,530
Speaker 0: This guy really knows his shit.

390
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:42,324
Speaker 0: I imagine he's a web designer and a rapper and If you are a web designer, you will find this very amusing.

391
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,996
Speaker 1: and if you are a rapper I hope you find this amusing.

392
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:51,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a rapper, you could probably find a better rap, but this rap is not bad You know, it's much better rap than expected.

393
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:54,210
Speaker 0: You expect like a really bad rap for this kind of thing.

394
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,595
Speaker 0: But no, it's an okay rap.

395
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,619
Speaker 0: This guy gets mad points.

396
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:01,689
Speaker 1: So moving right along, you know, we've been doing this Alternating ITCS thing for a while.

397
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:06,230
Speaker 1: We're gonna do one more set of them and then we're gonna go back to kind of our normal Monday shows for a while.

398
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,275
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, it's yesterday.

399
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:08,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

400
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,609
Speaker 1: Oh wait, I guess I could talk about it.

401
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:17,295
Speaker 1: Just kidding cuz I just dropped 50 grand on a stupid ticketing system and I got a flyaway for like a week to learn How to use it.

402
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:18,384
Speaker 0: No, I'm just kidding.

403
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:19,070
Speaker 0: I'm messing with you.

404
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:29,239
Speaker 0: I was trying to be all like oh shit wait to make people, you know, I'd ruined it anyway Talk about some CSS today, I guess right?

405
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

406
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:30,544
Speaker 1: No last week.

407
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:31,608
Speaker 1: I think you talked about pro.

408
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,137
Speaker 0: last week I did a terrible job.

409
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,667
Speaker 1: Well last time not last week.

410
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,500
Speaker 1: last time We realized that Scott and I are alternating.

411
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,062
Speaker 1: the Mac is.

412
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,397
Speaker 1: Scott did an awesome intro to IT And I was like CS CS.

413
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,981
Speaker 1: Yes, and then it was like my turn to intro IT But I was hungry and we had bra.

414
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:53,330
Speaker 1: so I was kind of like yeah It is everything and I was the end and then I did a really good one is in we're alternating here.

415
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,719
Speaker 1: So it's Scott's turn to do an awesome one.

416
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,221
Speaker 0: Yep.

417
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,610
Speaker 0: All right, so I'm gonna try to do an awesome one.

418
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,350
Speaker 0: I realized that it's sort of like trying to do these episodes.

419
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:07,271
Speaker 0: I have to find a balance because on the one hand it's like I want to give all the information Like.

420
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:11,690
Speaker 0: I want to give the whole thing from beginning to end not jumping over any steps.

421
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,010
Speaker 0: So in the beginning there were only zeros.

422
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:23,830
Speaker 0: I want to step on every single stone to get across the river But I realized some of those stones like the stone I did last time not so interesting and not so useful to the people.

423
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about it most of you even though it is an important thing to learn most of you out there.

424
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:31,599
Speaker 1: a lot of the questions we're getting people are Like so what programming language does what?

425
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,445
Speaker 1: which programming language that I weren't is Python?

426
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:33,626
Speaker 1: cool.

427
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,228
Speaker 1: What about Ruby?

428
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:39,345
Speaker 1: and To answer that question Scott really had to talk about what is programming?

429
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all those people were going.

430
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,524
Speaker 1: Okay, but what about Ruby?

431
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:53,229
Speaker 0: Yeah so I'm gonna have to find a way to strike a balance between the things you need to know and Also the things you want to know and being entertaining and I think I can do this, right?

432
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,009
Speaker 0: So last time I talked about you know, what a language is.

433
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:03,234
Speaker 0: now it's a set of rules for arranging an alphabet, you know in a way and You Know.

434
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:06,430
Speaker 0: the thing is is you can make up any language you want, right?

435
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,844
Speaker 0: so why do we have a whole bunch of different programming languages?

436
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:17,635
Speaker 0: because Each language the set of rules you come up with is made in such a way So that you can match.

437
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:22,770
Speaker 0: the goal is to match human thinking with the assembly language in the computer.

438
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,677
Speaker 1: So the glad you didn't say computer thinking computer thinking.

439
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:34,910
Speaker 0: you want to find a language because a programming language can't be a human Language because a digital non fuzzy logic computer cannot understand it.

440
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,038
Speaker 0: Right if it could be a human language.

441
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:47,090
Speaker 1: when we develop some amazing fuzzy when AI computer There will be a pearl compiler and then write me a pearl program and compile it in its exactly We won't need programmers anymore.

442
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:55,950
Speaker 0: All you'll do is you'll tell your computer what you want to do and it since your computer is an AI that just happens To also be connected to some you know, really powerful processing

443
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:02,288
Speaker 1: The same time connected to some sort of schoolgirl prosthetic, all right, you know what's gonna happen in the future.

444
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:05,830
Speaker 0: Yep Then you won't need a programming language anymore.

445
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:20,208
Speaker 0: But because we still need a programming language what we do is we come up with rules for arranging alphabets some grammars to design languages in such a way that a human can think in those languages and work with them the same way.

446
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:24,310
Speaker 0: you think in English you can think in C or think in pearl or think in Python.

447
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:33,470
Speaker 0: But also the computer can read those languages and actually do something based on those languages can divert them into computer instructions.

448
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:42,610
Speaker 0: so the reason we have different languages and not just one language that's perfect is because What you're doing with a language is you're trying to solve a problem.

449
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:47,570
Speaker 0: All right You might be trying to solve the problem of when people visit my website send them a page.

450
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,970
Speaker 0: You might be trying to solve the problem of do complex math on a supercomputer.

451
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:58,710
Speaker 0: You might be trying to solve the problem of make my calculator do normal math, you know, there's all these different problems.

452
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:04,030
Speaker 0: And when there's different problems, it's easier to think about certain problems in certain ways.

453
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:10,369
Speaker 0: And since you can't sort of write one language to rule them all Which I guess would be sort of crazy, right?

454
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:17,510
Speaker 0: We create languages that are structured in different ways so that they are suited to solving certain kinds of problems.

455
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,037
Speaker 0: For example list lisp as in.

456
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,801
Speaker 0: I got lisp now not.

457
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:29,809
Speaker 1: I would like to preface what Scott's about to say by saying that I Discovered that lisp is used a lot in terms of writing audio processing things.

458
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:34,565
Speaker 1: Yes, so I started looking into lisp because it that I don't program much if ever.

459
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,167
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

460
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:52,864
Speaker 0: Good God Right, but lisp the word lisp the reason it's called lisp is because the list processing language you see and Basically I call them the parentheses languages because it's all parentheses all over the place Like you do a parentheses something comma something comma something.

461
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,070
Speaker 0: you got a list, you know.

462
00:32:54,331 --> 00:33:01,464
Speaker 0: Then you'll put like some name of a function, you know Like pop push I forget what the words are because I haven't used.

463
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:03,050
Speaker 0: I use lisp once a long time.

464
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

465
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:07,900
Speaker 0: I know about it on paper But I don't really know it because I don't use it.

466
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,261
Speaker 0: for like.

467
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:09,145
Speaker 1: audio is an example.

468
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:12,349
Speaker 1: you because I was you know looking into This you want to say you want to process some audio?

469
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,093
Speaker 1: So it's like.

470
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:17,310
Speaker 1: you've got a list of different kind like different transformations.

471
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,363
Speaker 0: It's like the sugar and the cutter.

472
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:20,450
Speaker 0: there's something like that.

473
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,609
Speaker 1: Well, you've got like a list of different attributes of audio and then you've got a list of different functions You want to apply based on different parameters?

474
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:34,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, the point is that lisp is a Language that is built around lists, right?

475
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,829
Speaker 0: So if you're thinking of solving a problem that involves lots of lists of things, right?

476
00:33:41,451 --> 00:34:00,510
Speaker 0: Lisp if you think about that problem in the lisp language or try to you know Solve that problem with the list programming language it that was sort of a ATM machine right there lisp programming language It'll probably be really easy and it probably won't take as many lines of code to do that to solve that problem.

477
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:06,010
Speaker 0: You know, for example, well at least when I used AutoCAD way back in the day and like high school, right?

478
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,452
Speaker 0: Like it must have been AutoCAD 2000 or I would think it was AutoCAD release 14 The.

479
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:12,534
Speaker 0: you know AutoCAD.

480
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:16,790
Speaker 0: you control it with the GUI clicking on buttons and then clicking on the screen to give the print.

481
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,016
Speaker 0: You know.

482
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,850
Speaker 0: But you can also do all of AutoCAD from this little command line and all the commands were very lisp-like.

483
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,799
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it might have been lisp powering the AutoCAD in those days.

484
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,326
Speaker 0: because think about what is AutoCAD when it's.

485
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,530
Speaker 0: it's your you're creating.

486
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:34,870
Speaker 0: You know architectural diagrams mechanical diagrams, you know blueprints that sort of thing.

487
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:40,889
Speaker 0: It's lists of points lists of coordinates lists of vectors and that's all it is.

488
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,737
Speaker 0: So lisp is the perfect language to do that sort of thing.

489
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:48,730
Speaker 0: So people often ask you like, oh, what's what's the best language?

490
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:49,695
Speaker 0: You know for learning?

491
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:51,184
Speaker 0: or what's the best language for this?

492
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,130
Speaker 0: and what's the you know?

493
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:54,438
Speaker 0: Is this language better than that language?

494
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,170
Speaker 1: And the answer is I want to use an analogy real quick Is a hammer better than a screwdriver?

495
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, see each language, you know answers, of course.

496
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:04,026
Speaker 1: Yes.

497
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:11,897
Speaker 0: Well, actually There are some program, you know lisp is not the only Language of its kind.

498
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:14,750
Speaker 0: there are other languages that are similar to lisp.

499
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:21,636
Speaker 0: For example scheme is very similar to lisp right and so many people will argue that you know Scheme is better for learning than lisp.

500
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:25,246
Speaker 0: and you know, there's different variations on the same theme.

501
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:28,162
Speaker 0: and you know many times It won't matter which one you choose.

502
00:35:28,222 --> 00:35:32,570
Speaker 0: or maybe one has a few Disadvantages and one has other advantages sort of like you go to the Home Depot, right?

503
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,842
Speaker 0: It's a whole bunch of hammers, but this one's a ball peen hammer.

504
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:37,870
Speaker 1: and this you just wanted to say ball peen.

505
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,230
Speaker 1: You've been wanting to say it since I said the word hammer.

506
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,535
Speaker 1: You've been obsessed with that word.

507
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:45,290
Speaker 0: for the last or like you'll go and there'll be a Phillips screwdriver and a flathead screw.

508
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,992
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

509
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:46,574
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

510
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:49,101
Speaker 0: They're both screwdrivers, but they're a little bit different.

511
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,585
Speaker 1: What about tech hammers.

512
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:53,708
Speaker 0: tech hammers are the best anyway.

513
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:01,810
Speaker 0: So a programming language is much like that, but sometimes there is one that is just better than the other for example.

514
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:12,090
Speaker 1: Actually, I can't think of a terrible language right now In terms of like doing something useful Q basic not so useful.

515
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know that there are languages that are.

516
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:17,250
Speaker 0: sometimes they're the same kind of language.

517
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:22,075
Speaker 0: They're suited to solving the same kind of problem But one is just better than the other.

518
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:26,390
Speaker 0: for example a plastic toy hammer a big metal hammer.

519
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,229
Speaker 0: You know one is just better than the other.

520
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:31,526
Speaker 0: boner.

521
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:34,919
Speaker 0: yeah You can suck that.

522
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,070
Speaker 0: he both solved the same kind of problem.

523
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,820
Speaker 0: You know that one doesn't really do anything.

524
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,590
Speaker 0: the other one doesn't do but one is just better at that.

525
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:51,894
Speaker 0: So one of them is kind of useless, but you know when it comes to comparing something like C and something like Java They're not really Comparable.

526
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:58,479
Speaker 0: I mean if you have a problem in mind like this is my problem Which language is best for solving this problem?

527
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:10,242
Speaker 0: then then I can give you an answer because I can say well The this language the advantages of this language will mean you can solve that problem much easier or get these Advantages and such and such I can.

528
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:22,641
Speaker 1: I can give one opinion though I think and for people who don't know more about this topic or kind of are listening to Scott to learn about CS But don't really code or just like you're new to all this I think I would in the end recommend Python.

529
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,770
Speaker 0: well that see here's the thing right here.

530
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,679
Speaker 0: I'll start talking about what certain languages are good for right.

531
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:31,189
Speaker 0: We'll start with Python because it's a very popular recent choice, right?

532
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,501
Speaker 0: Python is a language that is really.

533
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,469
Speaker 0: it's an object-oriented language.

534
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,698
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm not going to talk about.

535
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:39,929
Speaker 0: maybe I'll talk about what that means.

536
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:49,916
Speaker 0: It's an object-oriented language and pretty much for most modern programming for the web and for desktop applications Object-oriented, you know.

537
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:53,730
Speaker 0: when it first came out, they thought it was a fad but no it's the real deal.

538
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:58,890
Speaker 0: Object-oriented is pretty much is is the way a lot of programming is done these days.

539
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:11,885
Speaker 0: Because thinking in an object-oriented manner seems to be very good for solving a great many common computer problems And even if it's not the optimal way of solving your particular, you know problem.

540
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:13,690
Speaker 0: It's usually a very good way.

541
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:23,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the example I was given by a professor early on at RIT was he showed quake and He talked a little bit about programming languages while quake just played in the background.

542
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:24,410
Speaker 0: I think I was there.

543
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might have been.

544
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:35,010
Speaker 1: and then he basically said all right now because you know We were all techie people a little bit like we were punk kids and most of us knew some procedural programming like basic or something.

545
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:38,769
Speaker 1: and it was like how would you make quake in a procedural language?

546
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:44,470
Speaker 1: and We were like, ah and he's like it's not impossible, but it's effectively impossible.

547
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:46,315
Speaker 0: Yep, because a procedure.

548
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:56,045
Speaker 0: I'll start talking about this then write a procedural language, right and in many ways all languages are sort of procedural or a procedural aspects of the better.

549
00:38:56,065 --> 00:39:10,870
Speaker 0: procedural language is Pretty much sort of just easier assembly, you know assembly Says do this then do this then do this then go over here and do something different Then go back over here and do what you were doing again.

550
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:20,470
Speaker 0: You know, it's here the order to do things and sometimes it can repeat things It does which it will often do if I go and do something else that it can go and do a bunch of times.

551
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,072
Speaker 1: Go sub.

552
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:21,735
Speaker 0: Yep.

553
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:22,859
Speaker 0: It'll do also it.

554
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,890
Speaker 0: basically it's programming by procedure.

555
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,970
Speaker 0: It's like here are the things to do in order, you know.

556
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:37,090
Speaker 0: If you want to build a house first pour the foundation then set up the frame then, you know put on the roof.

557
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,778
Speaker 0: I don't know how to build a house obviously But then I mean there's some problems there.

558
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,310
Speaker 1: and what if you want to build ten houses?

559
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's not just do you want to build ten houses because building ten houses easy It's follow the instructions of building a house ten times.

560
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:57,970
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but what if you want to you know to have you know, red houses blue houses and green houses?

561
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,030
Speaker 0: Well, we can still do that with the procedural language.

562
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it gets more and more complicated on townhouses.

563
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:08,329
Speaker 0: And then you want to build houses on different streets and you want to people in the houses furniture in the houses.

564
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:14,170
Speaker 0: You're gonna build a lot of different a lot of people walking around the houses and you also want to program the construction workers.

565
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,915
Speaker 1: different houses have Different attributes.

566
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:23,102
Speaker 1: or you want the prices of the houses and like all the houses are different But they're all based on like a same basic house.

567
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,390
Speaker 1: Just everyone wants some custom stuff.

568
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:35,790
Speaker 0: This is where you get object oriented programming in which the the thinking behind object oriented programming is you define a bunch of classes Right in a class, you know an instance of a class is an object.

569
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:48,730
Speaker 0: So I'll have the class house and one instance of the class house is an actual house and I can write the class House to sort of describe it sort of writing the class house is sort of like saying houses are like this

570
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:53,365
Speaker 1: I have to interrupt you by people who live in class houses shouldn't throw it.

571
00:40:53,405 --> 00:40:54,107
Speaker 0: That's bad.

572
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,017
Speaker 0: That's bad I'm sorry, so I write.

573
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:59,610
Speaker 0: I could also write a class car, you know.

574
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,909
Speaker 0: And I basically when I write the class car in code I'm saying cars are like this.

575
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:08,102
Speaker 0: They have these properties and cars can do these things.

576
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,125
Speaker 0: a car has a color.

577
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,154
Speaker 0: It has a horsepower It has a size and has a weight.

578
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:20,759
Speaker 0: it can drive it can stop it can honk its horn, you know, I Define sort of what a car is like.

579
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,046
Speaker 0: then I define specific cars.

580
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,333
Speaker 0: I say new car Ferrari.

581
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,025
Speaker 0: it's red it can as 400 horsepower.

582
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:31,719
Speaker 0: It goes really fast It's horn sounds like this.

583
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:43,589
Speaker 0: and then I say Ferrari go drive and then the Ferrari will drive and then I can be like new car new car new car drive drive drive stop You know and I can make all these cars start doing all these things.

584
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:54,838
Speaker 0: They're just defining what a car is like then making cars and then make it, you know looking changing the properties of the cars and Invoking the things that the cars can do.

585
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,550
Speaker 0: and it's a much, you know thinking about solving problems in that way.

586
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,603
Speaker 0: You can solve a lot of problems that way.

587
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:06,349
Speaker 0: I mean, let's try to think of a Real problem you would solve that way like a video game, right?

588
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,175
Speaker 0: Enemy, I make the enemy class.

589
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:11,823
Speaker 0: The enemy has these many hit points and he can.

590
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,970
Speaker 0: these are his attacks, right?

591
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:16,461
Speaker 0: The good guy he has these many hit points.

592
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,587
Speaker 0: He does these many attacks.

593
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,228
Speaker 0: the map The map is this long it has this many things in it.

594
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:27,150
Speaker 0: Then I after I make all these classes I describe what enemies and good guys and maps are like.

595
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:39,326
Speaker 0: I then just say new map put in the map ten enemies put in the map one instance of the good guy and Map go and then you have a game and like you just loop through and have them all like.

596
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:40,530
Speaker 1: things will call thing.

597
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,029
Speaker 0: You don't even need to loop through you just you know, say everything start and then the things will go.

598
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:52,363
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, but if you program properly with threads and in such odd I I'm not likely never be at the point.

599
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:53,528
Speaker 1: Well, I will program with three.

600
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:54,150
Speaker 0: It's not that hard.

601
00:42:55,131 --> 00:43:00,095
Speaker 1: Anyway, I make a bunch of objects and then I loop through them calling some sort of timing thing that tells them all to do Their shit.

602
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:02,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, see you take See, that's that's.

603
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:20,510
Speaker 0: that's a very common way to program things is to use an object-oriented data model But to use an actual, you know procedure wrapped around that as opposed to just using you know, some sort of functional Non-object-oriented, you know data structures just like some list linked linked lists and some arrays

604
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:33,009
Speaker 1: That the main reason like I do things like that and a lot of people do is because the object orientedness of setting it Up makes it very easy to put everything together and then coding the other part is very easy.

605
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:37,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, so between the two it takes a lot less good programming practices.

606
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:37,974
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,115
Speaker 0: So a programming language.

608
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:54,705
Speaker 0: the reason we have so many of them is because each of them allows you to think in a different way to help you solve different kinds of problems and you really want to pick the language and Lets you think in a way that is conducive to solving the problem at hand.

609
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:56,050
Speaker 0: Should I keep talking?

610
00:43:56,932 --> 00:43:57,274
Speaker 1: I don't know.

611
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:58,400
Speaker 0: I keep talking some.

612
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,150
Speaker 0: so let's just go over.

613
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,350
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be real brief and talk about like the most popular languages.

614
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:04,349
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a good thing.

615
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:09,990
Speaker 1: Not talking about some specific languages would be pretty sad and people would not be happy.

616
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,691
Speaker 1: I think so.

617
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,074
Speaker 0: see see is a pretty popular language.

618
00:44:13,495 --> 00:44:15,137
Speaker 0: It's not object oriented.

619
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:27,491
Speaker 0: It's it's a functional procedural language And it's mostly good for doing things like device drivers and You know programs that might have to like run on your microwave or stuff like that cuz.

620
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,136
Speaker 0: but C is really good at is.

621
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:36,280
Speaker 0: It's very close to assembly, you know, it does a compiler for C for pretty much any piece of hardware out there.

622
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:40,280
Speaker 0: So you can do really low-level stuff, but you don't have to write assembly.

623
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,219
Speaker 0: You can write C which is a little bit easier a lot easier, you know You can mix C and assembly together a lot, too.

624
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:52,117
Speaker 0: So it really it makes writing that sort of close to the hardware program a lot easier now.

625
00:44:52,157 --> 00:45:02,428
Speaker 0: before a long time ago C used to be it and for a lot of things C is still it because You know, even though it might be harder to write something big You know like a game like a big 3d game.

626
00:45:02,468 --> 00:45:09,400
Speaker 0: and see if you do write it and see because you're so close to the hardware You can do lots of optimizations and get a really high performance.

627
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:12,939
Speaker 0: So if you need high performance C is also a good way to go.

628
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:15,408
Speaker 0: But there's also C plus plus.

629
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:22,191
Speaker 0: C plus plus is pretty much a lot like C But it's got object-oriented action going on.

630
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,499
Speaker 0: objective C is also similar to that.

631
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,137
Speaker 0: The thing about C plus plus is that I really don't like the syntax.

632
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,000
Speaker 0: It's pretty painful.

633
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:30,442
Speaker 0: It's it's.

634
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:38,380
Speaker 0: you know writing in C plus plus is not a joy But it has advantages in that like C you can compile it for anything.

635
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:43,020
Speaker 0: You can actually still get really close to the hardware like in C, but it's object-oriented.

636
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:48,420
Speaker 0: So you can actually think about a lot of problems in a more modern way, but also get high performance.

637
00:45:48,561 --> 00:46:00,595
Speaker 0: And that's why a lot of games are written in C plus plus because they get the high performance But they can still think about the game in an object-oriented way And it won't be so hard to make a game as it would be to make the game in straight C Like they did in the olden days.

638
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,540
Speaker 0: Let's see what else we got here here.

639
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,329
Speaker 0: Visual basic right.

640
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:12,100
Speaker 0: visual basic is a programming language But it comes with sort of like this GUI making thing for Microsoft.

641
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:20,467
Speaker 0: You know the Visual Studio whatnots and pretty much what is good for is if you need a Windows only program Or want to run it in wine or something.

642
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:24,380
Speaker 0: That's pretty simple, but it's mostly just a GUI.

643
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:30,140
Speaker 0: You know a Windows GUI with buttons and labels and images and you know nothing nothing fancy.

644
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:33,360
Speaker 0: You can whip it up in visual basic really quickly.

645
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,771
Speaker 0: It's it's a visual basic.

646
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:36,233
Speaker 0: You know it's.

647
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:37,860
Speaker 0: you make a visual thing.

648
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,959
Speaker 0: That's very basic and you can make it mostly by clicking on things without very little code at all.

649
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:44,947
Speaker 0: That's the visual basic is all about.

650
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,613
Speaker 1: but at the same time don't underestimate it.

651
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,360
Speaker 1: visual basic and the related.

652
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:52,200
Speaker 1: You know Microsoft II things are very powerful for doing certain things.

653
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:00,355
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if you want to make like a little GUI that helps people generate like spreadsheets in Excel in a little format Visual basic is where it's at.

654
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:03,124
Speaker 0: yeah Let's see what else I can think of.

655
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:08,660
Speaker 0: all right Java right Java is very object oriented like super object oriented.

656
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:15,540
Speaker 0: Right, but the advantage of Java is that first of all there is Java libraries for pretty much everything in the universe.

657
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,540
Speaker 0: So if you want to you know do like encryption you don't have to write a whole new encryption thing.

658
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:24,254
Speaker 0: There's a Java encryption thing that you just use.

659
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:25,280
Speaker 0: it's already there for you.

660
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,852
Speaker 0: You can actually you know you can add some features to it if you need to.

661
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:31,249
Speaker 0: if you want to do graphics There's already a Java graphics thing.

662
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:32,314
Speaker 0: you just take it and use it.

663
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:33,480
Speaker 0: You know they already wrote the classes.

664
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:35,569
Speaker 0: You just got to use them in your program.

665
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,132
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

666
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:40,689
Speaker 0: the thing about Java Is that you're not gonna get the highest performance.

667
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,002
Speaker 0: Java's a lot better with performance than it used to be but it's not the highest Performance.

668
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:49,460
Speaker 0: the advantage of Java is that Java runs in a virtual machine sort of like VMware, but not quite.

669
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:51,887
Speaker 0: So you write a program in Java.

670
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:56,580
Speaker 0: now that program runs on any machine that can run a Java virtual machine.

671
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,845
Speaker 0: You write the program once.

672
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:01,700
Speaker 0: you can put it on any machine that has Java from a cell phone to a supercomputer.

673
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,302
Speaker 0: All right.

674
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:07,620
Speaker 0: see you have to sort of rewrite your program for every different chip because you're writing so close to the hardware.

675
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:14,440
Speaker 0: You know that you've got to recompile the program for different machines and sometimes you might have to change the code in addition to recompiling.

676
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,629
Speaker 0: So that's the advantage of Java.

677
00:48:16,669 --> 00:48:24,200
Speaker 0: Java is actually you know a lot of you put down Java applets You know and they should put down Java applets because that's really where flash is the winner.

678
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,606
Speaker 0: But Java really is the way they go.

679
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:27,449
Speaker 0: look at puzzle pirates.

680
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,935
Speaker 0: puzzle pirates is written in Java.

681
00:48:29,236 --> 00:48:34,995
Speaker 0: a lot of cell phone games are Written in Java yahoo games a lot of those are written in Java, and that's you know.

682
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,099
Speaker 0: Java's really good at that.

683
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,695
Speaker 0: It's also really good a lot of other things that you may not realize.

684
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:46,260
Speaker 0: Java is being used Because a lot of people just sort of associated Java with Java applet, but you know a lot of web servers run Java.

685
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,224
Speaker 0: You don't even realize.

686
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:58,760
Speaker 0: it's also good for like enterprise database stuff because it's so you know robust You can just also, but just bump up new virtual machines all over the place You know you get the advantages of like a VMware without actually having to do a VMware.

687
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a lot of like big e-commerce website thing.

688
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:06,160
Speaker 1: solutions are using Java stuff integrated with some sort of crazy web sphere.

689
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,694
Speaker 0: Yep, yeah, let's see what are the major languages all right?

690
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,742
Speaker 0: I'll talk about PHP PHP.

691
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:13,626
Speaker 0: I don't know.

692
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:30,060
Speaker 0: I try to think of something to call it like piece of shit something but PHP started out way back in the day when people had like Geo cities right and they could only make HTML And that was it static HTML, but they wanted to put stuff on their websites like little counters and other dynamic things.

693
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:41,599
Speaker 0: you know things on a web page that weren't static and Basically PHP started out is like hey put this little bit of code on your website And I'll put a counter there or but it's a little bit of code on your website and an animated thing will appear.

694
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:47,877
Speaker 0: and People did that and it was like all men's and then PHP somehow expanded into being a full-on.

695
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:53,995
Speaker 0: programming like PHP is kind of useful and that you can use it as like.

696
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 0: you know a Scripting language you know just like for doing normal like operating system stuff.

697
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:02,135
Speaker 0: You can use it to sort of make really easy.

698
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,915
Speaker 0: You know websites that are dynamic because you can mix it in with the HTML.

699
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:11,419
Speaker 0: you can like write some HTML Then a bit of PHP then a bit HTML then a bit of PHP.

700
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,653
Speaker 0: So you can sort of put dynamic things in the middle of the web page, so if you're good at HTML It's not that hard to do.

701
00:50:17,673 --> 00:50:19,363
Speaker 0: PHP also You know and there's.

702
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,108
Speaker 0: it's a. it's really.

703
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:29,053
Speaker 0: you don't have to really program it even though if you want to You can take PHP and go full-on object oriented awesomeness all the way.

704
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:50,044
Speaker 0: It's it's it's totally crazy like that But it's not so Advanced and it actually leaves you with a lot of trouble where if you actually try to make something big and crazy You'll often fall short with PHP You know run into a lot of problems and such and it's actually pretty tied to like the web server in many ways and it Can cause a lot of trouble there.

705
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:52,111
Speaker 1: right talk a little bit about pearl.

706
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,900
Speaker 0: I'll tell you a pearl pearl the philosophy.

707
00:50:55,162 --> 00:51:09,219
Speaker 0: The other thing is that a lot of languages will be similar to each other But the philosophies will be different and pearl is the great example of you know a language where what it does is just fine But the philosophy is one that is basically the opposite of the Python philosophy, right?

708
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,340
Speaker 0: Pearl and Python in terms of what you can do with them are pretty similar.

709
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:15,328
Speaker 0: I mean you know you can both.

710
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:17,457
Speaker 0: you know they they're both for web pages.

711
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:21,050
Speaker 0: They can both You know make actual applications in them.

712
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:24,566
Speaker 0: They're both sort of higher level Languages.

713
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:26,998
Speaker 0: there's quite a bit of similarity going on.

714
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:34,764
Speaker 0: My thing is the philosophy of pearl is that there's a million ways to do everything and there's all these sort of syntactical Shortcuts and things.

715
00:51:35,186 --> 00:51:38,700
Speaker 0: so it's like you can write a verbal program, and I could write one.

716
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,762
Speaker 0: They do the same exact thing, but yours looks nothing like mine You know.

717
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:45,858
Speaker 1: yeah pearl is also the language where a lot of people learn what regular expressions are.

718
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:46,300
Speaker 0: yep?

719
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:46,921
Speaker 0: That does it.

720
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:48,870
Speaker 0: pearl is very good at processing text.

721
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,180
Speaker 0: you have some text and you want to do something with it.

722
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,191
Speaker 0: You know you want to read it or you want to turn it into some other text.

723
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:58,219
Speaker 0: pearl is awesome at that right because it's Very closely tied with the regular expressions.

724
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,777
Speaker 0: Python is sort of does all the same stuff as pearl except Python.

725
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:06,968
Speaker 0: Philosophy is.

726
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:08,439
Speaker 0: there should only be one way to do it.

727
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,388
Speaker 0: You know if I write a Python program to do X and you write a Python program to do X They should look exactly the same.

728
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,099
Speaker 0: there shouldn't be another way to do it.

729
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:18,210
Speaker 0: You know there's sort of a right answer or the.

730
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:22,379
Speaker 0: you know a theoretical right answer like This is the way that this program should be written.

731
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:23,788
Speaker 1: I thought I've just also.

732
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:25,620
Speaker 1: I found Python to be very intuitive.

733
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:27,147
Speaker 0: It is a lot of like.

734
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,760
Speaker 0: the thing is you probably haven't used a lot of the other also intuitive.

735
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:37,551
Speaker 0: No, I haven't, but I've used pearl and Python and I pearl isn't that intuitive But Ruby Ruby is just as intuitive as Python is.

736
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,720
Speaker 1: I never actually tried to use Ruby.

737
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:43,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of the things will look very similar to to Python.

738
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,909
Speaker 0: You know just sort of variable equals this you know.

739
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:50,311
Speaker 0: if this then that sort of you know the typical very easy to understand Sort of stuff.

740
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:53,028
Speaker 1: yeah There's this brain fuck.

741
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,418
Speaker 0: know about brain fuck.

742
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,340
Speaker 0: Yeah See brain flick is just sort of a joke language.

743
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:04,865
Speaker 1: It's not really useful for anything except teaching But at the same time you can learn a lot from it because if you are able to write something moderately complex in it You've learned a lot.

744
00:53:05,107 --> 00:53:05,349
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really you know.

746
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:12,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah There's a lot of languages out there that are sort of toy languages like.

747
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:19,172
Speaker 0: they make them not for the purpose of actually doing Anything really useful for the real world even though you might be able to.

748
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:33,973
Speaker 0: but sort of you know as Sort of like exercises like you look at the language And you think about it, and then you know your mind sort of expands thinking about that and now you're better at dealing with other Languages and such and brain fuck in white space, and

749
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:35,660
Speaker 1: I was about to bring up white space.

750
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,220
Speaker 1: They're all good examples of that because I just realized that the Wikipedia page on white space is fantastic.

751
00:53:40,642 --> 00:53:41,364
Speaker 0: Here's the language.

752
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,710
Speaker 0: you probably may not have heard of that.

753
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:50,071
Speaker 0: I sort of learned once called prologue right in prologue as the name sort of implies is a very logical language.

754
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:53,944
Speaker 0: you ever do those problems in the in the puzzle books that Are like you know.

755
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,140
Speaker 0: there are five people and five items.

756
00:53:57,782 --> 00:54:00,110
Speaker 0: Joe doesn't have the red item.

757
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:02,780
Speaker 0: Mary has the blue item.

758
00:54:04,123 --> 00:54:07,539
Speaker 0: You know he has the item that's darker than that one But lighter than the other one.

759
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:12,642
Speaker 0: You know that sort of thing and you sort of put X's in the boxes to figure out who doesn't match and who doesn't match With what.

760
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:17,446
Speaker 0: and see you figure out who has what item and who lives in what house and you know which item is in which house.

761
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:18,159
Speaker 0: and all that business.

762
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,650
Speaker 0: Prologue is a lot like that.

763
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,804
Speaker 0: you sort of say okay There's this thing This thing.

764
00:54:24,825 --> 00:54:31,291
Speaker 0: you sort of set up these these rules like you said at the circumstance like okay this can equal either this this or this.

765
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,159
Speaker 0: this can never be equal to that.

766
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:39,820
Speaker 0: and This is one of these three and then prologue just sort of sorts it out and arrives at an answer.

767
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:57,500
Speaker 0: So it's very good at solving logic type problems where you have associations of things and some sort of set of logical rules and you want to see like this sort of the the set of all The possible answers like if you're doing some discrete maths Prologue is the way to go because it'll just be like oh, that's your situation.

768
00:54:57,581 --> 00:54:59,957
Speaker 0: These are all the possible true things that will fit that.

769
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,966
Speaker 0: you know I'm gonna wrap.

770
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:03,933
Speaker 0: try to wrap it up here.

771
00:55:03,953 --> 00:55:09,800
Speaker 0: We probably should yeah You guys pick a language that haven't talked about this probably pretty big I don't know.

772
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,710
Speaker 1: I mean all I write it is pearl Python and bash.

773
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,480
Speaker 0: I didn't actually talk about Python even though I've mentioned it a hundred times.

774
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,532
Speaker 0: Python is basically the thing about Python.

775
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:20,155
Speaker 1: talk about Python.

776
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:21,260
Speaker 0: I sort of talked about it.

777
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,358
Speaker 0: What else you gonna say the thing about Python the answer to know about is that first of all?

778
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:35,320
Speaker 0: unlike a lot of other languages where indentation, you know Indentation is really sort of a thing to help you read like you can write and see and not indent and it won't care.

779
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,799
Speaker 0: But you know you you're supposed to indent because it makes it easier to read and makes it easy to be able to understand.

780
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:45,100
Speaker 1: by Indenting we mean like say I have a for loop or a while loop or something.

781
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:47,830
Speaker 1: I indent everything underneath that in the loop.

782
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,520
Speaker 1: So it kind of stands out as being grouped together under the loop.

783
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:51,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're easier to read.

784
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:54,120
Speaker 0: It makes it easier to read the program and figure out how it works.

785
00:55:54,568 --> 00:56:01,100
Speaker 0: Python Forces you to indent like it actually looks at when the Python interpreter runs and looks at your code.

786
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:05,957
Speaker 0: It looks at the indentations and it's like hey that indentation doesn't make sense.

787
00:56:06,117 --> 00:56:08,926
Speaker 0: or okay That's indented one down from this.

788
00:56:09,247 --> 00:56:10,631
Speaker 0: Therefore I should do this.

789
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,860
Speaker 0: You know, it's indentation actually matters in Python.

790
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:18,720
Speaker 0: But Python is a really useful language because on the one hand, right?

791
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:27,919
Speaker 0: it's it's a very high level object oriented language with a lot of power and a lot of Shortcuts to make you know everyday, you know programs and scripts very easy.

792
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:35,988
Speaker 0: It has an interpreter so you can just sort of type in Python code and it will happen Immediately to sort of test things out.

793
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:41,419
Speaker 0: like you if you have a class you wrote you don't actually have to write some You know script to test the class out.

794
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:56,337
Speaker 0: You just type Python you import the class and then you sort of make objects in the class and you can just sort of you Know you can be like I'll make a car and the car is made immediately and you'd be like, okay Drive car and you can watch the car drive and you can see if things are working and how they work.

795
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:59,020
Speaker 0: and that's why It's very useful for learning and testing.

796
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:07,539
Speaker 0: but Python also In is very strange in that you it sort of compiles into C sort of.

797
00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:17,160
Speaker 0: So if you a lot of people nowadays like when they're writing games Like a big game that has to be like, you know, very high performance 3d game need a lot of frame rates, right?

798
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,100
Speaker 0: They'll write it in Python because very easy easy to think about doesn't take very long.

799
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:28,890
Speaker 0: But then they'll convert the parts that are low performance like oh this part's really slow here The part where renders the the bad guy.

800
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:33,879
Speaker 0: so they'll convert it to C. They'll rewrite all that code to make it fast.

801
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:39,804
Speaker 0: But the rest of the code is still Python, but it's all good because just import the C library into the Python It doesn't care.

802
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:59,220
Speaker 0: There's a little Python wrapper around it or wherever you need to do and You can make really high-performance Applications without having to write everything in C. You can think about things in the Python way and only write that rewrite the slow parts in C. You think hey Python has a whole lot of other advantages besides that like, you know, a lot of frameworks.

803
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:04,420
Speaker 0: There's modules for pretty much everything you could want, you know, like if you want to you know, do this.

804
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,290
Speaker 0: Well, there's a Python, you know, it's sort of like Java.

805
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:08,280
Speaker 0: Python also has a module for everything.

806
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,699
Speaker 0: You just have to find that module and import it and read the documentation for how it works.

807
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:17,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's generally pretty useful for a whole lot of things.

808
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll probably talk about more languages again later.

809
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:24,475
Speaker 0: I gotta I gotta figure out what I'm gonna talk about next.

810
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:31,400
Speaker 1: well pretty much I mean, I'm gonna do one more and then we're gonna go back for a little while Maybe a week or two a couple of weeks probably to normal Monday night show.

811
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,360
Speaker 0: So I got like a month to figure out what I could talk about in the next one thing.

812
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,244
Speaker 1: I'd like to end on those.

813
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:41,506
Speaker 1: I think I was poking around the list on Esoteric or so Lang.

814
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:44,417
Speaker 1: it's a wiki of esoteric programming languages.

815
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:50,214
Speaker 1: That's the word And I think I discovered my favorite programming language ever.

816
00:58:50,234 --> 00:58:50,716
Speaker 0: All right.

817
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,378
Speaker 0: What is it rim?

818
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,362
Speaker 1: It is called IRP.

819
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:55,911
Speaker 1: All right internet relay programming.

820
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:58,320
Speaker 1: I will leave it to you to read how IRP works.

821
00:59:04,853 --> 00:59:07,442
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
