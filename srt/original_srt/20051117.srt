1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,040
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,131
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, November 17th, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:16,379
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about how not to suck at polish.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,223
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:22,291
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's uh, let's do this.

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,936
Speaker 0: It's pretty relevant to my thing of the day.

7
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:24,718
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,320
Speaker 0: Really.

9
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:32,618
Speaker 0: So, um... You know, Microsoft has their little advantage thing that makes sure you're not pirating and such.

10
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:33,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,987
Speaker 0: You know, with their Windows Update and whatnot.

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,299
Speaker 0: Well, they they changed it, so it works on Firefox now.

13
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,805
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of makes sense.

14
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,575
Speaker 1: considering that Firefox has hit, what, the 10% mark?

15
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,378
Speaker 0: Something like that.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:52,820
Speaker 0: But, I don't know, it's like... Wouldn't they still want to force people to use the IE, which is what- it's like too little too late.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,940
Speaker 1: It's like, if you would've done- I think "too little too late" applied five years ago.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,359
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but it's like, all right, if you would have done this, you know, years ago, then, uh... IE would have been dead by now, but doing it now kind of doesn't really help you, you know?

19
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:08,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

20
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:12,760
Speaker 0: Because anyone who's not gonna use IE already isn't using it, and I don't know.

21
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:19,111
Speaker 0: It's not gonna help Microsoft, you know, it's not gonna give anyone a better impression of them, and...

22
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:23,871
Speaker 1: Because I saw that they also made a Windows Media Player type plug-in for Firefox.

23
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:24,694
Speaker 0: Really?

24
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,480
Speaker 0: I thought that was just something they were going to do.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,348
Speaker 1: They're gonna do it.

26
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,340
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's finished yet.

27
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:33,561
Speaker 1: You can get it if you're in that beta program, just like you can see- you can play with Office 12.

28
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:42,800
Speaker 0: I don't even know why- I have- I use Firefox, and I have Windows here, and... Windows Media Player is in it just fine, and I haven't installed anything special.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,962
Speaker 1: Huh?

30
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:48,340
Speaker 1: See, I don't really look at media at work, and work is the only place in the world I use Windows now.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only- I look at media on my work laptop, which is my only Windows computer, and it happens.

32
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:56,578
Speaker 0: Huh?

33
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:06,780
Speaker 1: So, uh, EMI claims that Apple is gonna change iTunes to benefit them in the way that they've been screaming about for the last, I don't know, year.

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:14,382
Speaker 0: I don't know about this story, because a little while ago, didn't we see the story where Steve Jobs pretty much said, "No, no way I'm gonna do this,".

35
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,787
Speaker 0: and he gave the record companies the finger?

36
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:24,480
Speaker 1: But I also point out that right before the, uh, iPod video was released, he said that they would never make a product like that.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:26,739
Speaker 0: That's true.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,623
Speaker 0: Hmm.

39
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:40,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but apparently they're gonna- they claim that Apple is going to get rid of their "every song is 99 cents no matter what" policy, and replace it with a "songs that are more popular cost more money" policy.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Speaker 0: Oh, I think they're also going to do a "songs that are less popular cost less money" policy.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Speaker 1: You can't get much cheaper than a dollar, but you can get a lot more expensive than a dollar.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,540
Speaker 0: You know, a dollar, when it comes to me, no matter what song it is, that's way too much money.

43
00:02:55,321 --> 00:03:05,930
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to charge me- if you want me to pay for MP3s, you have to- first, you have to make it so much more convenient than any P2P network ever has been.

44
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:13,272
Speaker 0: I need, like, a full correctly indexed music library that includes everything I could ever possibly search for.

45
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:16,360
Speaker 0: And then it has to cost, like, 10 cents a song.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,973
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I think that in general, prices are going to go up as a result of this and not down.

47
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:28,268
Speaker 0: And I think that piracy is going to go up, and purchases are going to go down.

48
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,290
Speaker 1: Ah, piracy!

49
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:33,140
Speaker 1: The cause of, and solution to, every intellectual property problem.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,386
Speaker 1: Arrrrrrr.

51
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:37,671
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

52
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,920
Speaker 0: It's, it's just so dumb.

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,180
Speaker 0: I think what people are also worried about is that the prices will change, like, on the fly.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:54,820
Speaker 0: Like, if a song that's, like, so low and ancient, you know, but no one cares about it, it costs, like, 10 cents, and then people start buying it, and they just jack out the price.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,823
Speaker 1: Huh.

56
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,359
Speaker 1: The thing is, I don't see Apple doing any of those things.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,482
Speaker 0: Why not?

58
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,328
Speaker 0: They're not Google.

59
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,060
Speaker 0: They're not, you know, immune to evil.

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:12,460
Speaker 1: Because I think Apple at least understands how fickle people are, and they're only using iTunes because it currently provides the- exactly what they want, or at least enough of what they want to use.

61
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,180
Speaker 1: The minute iTunes goes "bleh," I think a lot of people are gonna jump ship.

62
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:22,720
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, is that, you know, iTunes is only what it is, because all these record companies still give their music to it.

63
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:27,440
Speaker 0: And, you know, Apple really doesn't have a lot of say, and they don't make, you know-.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,835
Speaker 1: However, Apple has the power of saying, "Fine, don't play by our rules.

65
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,457
Speaker 1: You're not on

66
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:32,000
Speaker 1: iTunes.".

67
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,888
Speaker 0: No, that's the other way around.

68
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,740
Speaker 0: The music people say, "Fine, don't play by our rules.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,912
Speaker 0: We'll take our stuff out of

70
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:38,418
Speaker 0: iTunes.".

71
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,961
Speaker 0: See?

72
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:46,440
Speaker 1: But it goes both ways, because unless a bunch of labels all say they're gonna pull out, if one label pulls out, they just miss out, and all the other labels profit more.

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:05:02,015
Speaker 0: No, because people stop using iTunes, because the point of using iTunes is that it has- Not only is it a dollar a song, which is, I guess, good as far as some other people who, you know, buy music online consider it, but it has all these songs.

74
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,160
Speaker 0: It doesn't have enough songs.

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,660
Speaker 1: It doesn't have even- it doesn't have anything I want to listen to.

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have anything I want to listen to either.

77
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:08,580
Speaker 0: By my standards, it is crap.

78
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:17,220
Speaker 0: But by people who listen to pop music standards, it has, like, ten times as much as any of the other pay music download services, except for maybe all of it.

79
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if it dropped to having nine times as much, and it's still so much cheaper and better- No, it would drop to having, like, one tenth the amount it has.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,540
Speaker 1: Nah, 'cause I don't think- I think EMI, if they pulled out, I don't think anyone would follow with them.

81
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 0: You know, you realize there's only, like, three record companies, so it's like a third of the music is just gone.

82
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that'll happen.

83
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:36,393
Speaker 0: I don't know.

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Speaker 1: Of course, apparently it looks like Apple is- if this article is to be believed, Apple's going with it and raising their prizes.

85
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:48,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, there was a contradictory article a week ago, so we'll just have to wait and see till that actually happens, and then discuss it again.

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,099
Speaker 1: Well, whenever there are contradictory articles, I generally go with the newer one.

87
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:01,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's- it's one way to go, but... I don't know, these articles- this article seems to be a little more hearsay than the previous one.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,140
Speaker 0: 'Cause the previous one was, like, from the Steve Jobs mouth, and this is, like, from a guy who heard a record company guy.

89
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,819
Speaker 1: And I trust Steve Jobs' mouth a little more than a record company guy's mouth, and a guy who listens- Actually, you know, this is the head of the EMI group, Alan Levy, who said this.

90
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,590
Speaker 0: So a big Jew, we can trust him.

91
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,779
Speaker 0: Alan Levy, yeah.

92
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,080
Speaker 1: And once again, Steve Jobs, what was the quote?

93
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,251
Speaker 1: "Why did we ever make a video iPod?

94
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,737
Speaker 1: There's no such thing as headphones for

95
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:29,219
Speaker 1: video.".

96
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:29,529
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:31,139
Speaker 0: You know what?

98
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,909
Speaker 0: They didn't really- they didn't make a video iPod.

99
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 0: They made an iPod that happened to have video.

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,489
Speaker 1: Yeah.

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,980
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of different than a special video iPod, you know?

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,100
Speaker 1: See, I think the moral is that these people lie, and until they actually have a press conference, we can't know.

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,883
Speaker 0: Yeah.

104
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,746
Speaker 0: But, you know what, it could be- You know what, you know what it really says?

105
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,400
Speaker 1: It was a slow news day today, and this is all I could dredge up.

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,140
Speaker 0: You know what it could be is that they say both things, and they want to see what the reaction is, and then they decide what to do.

107
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:04,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that doesn't fit Apple, because by the time he said it, it was too late, because they'd already produced the new iPod.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,460
Speaker 0: Hmm.

109
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:19,119
Speaker 0: I don't know, maybe that's why they like to keep the secrets, so that they can- if they keep everything secret, or at least technically secret, then whatever they do, for real, you can't say, "Oh, you didn't do what you said," because they didn't say anything.

110
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,680
Speaker 0: It's all secret.

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,879
Speaker 0: And then they could just look at what the reactions to all the rumors are, and then decide what to do.

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,400
Speaker 1: But they had already decided to make that new iPod, and then he said they're not going to make it.

113
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,700
Speaker 0: Had he known that the iPod's really simple-looking, had he known he didn't design it in like five minutes, right after people said they wanted it.

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:51,060
Speaker 0: Speaking of Apple, there's a rumor going around that we'll have the iBooks with Intel chips in January, and the additional rumor is that it will be like $200 cheaper than the current iBooks pricing.

115
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Speaker 1: So it's still far more than I'd ever pay for a laptop.

116
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, still- well, these aren't the powerbooks, these are the iBooks, the cheaper ones with the plastic, not the powerful titanium ones.

117
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,300
Speaker 1: Even so, I can get like an old Pentium 2 or 3-whatever for a couple hundred bucks.

118
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Speaker 0: You mean one where the battery only lasts five minutes?

119
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:09,659
Speaker 1: That's fine.

120
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,560
Speaker 0: No, no, it's not really.

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,837
Speaker 1: Because the only laptops that I want are the ones that I can't afford, like those lifebooks.

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,967
Speaker 0: It's not so expensive.

123
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:18,960
Speaker 0: It's more expensive than an iBook.

124
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:20,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,040
Speaker 0: By a lot, like by a thousand dollars almost.

126
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:24,800
Speaker 1: But I want that, I don't want an iBook.

127
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,110
Speaker 0: Well, hey, you know, small stuff is expensive, especially in the-.

128
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,900
Speaker 0: well, even in Japan it's expensive.

129
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 0: It's just more expensive here because you have to get it shipped over to the sea.

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,159
Speaker 1: If I lived in Japan, I wouldn't need a notebook, I'd just have a cell phone.

131
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:38,498
Speaker 1: With a basic plan.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm actually gonna try to get a cool phone soon, I'm looking into some options.

133
00:08:46,620 --> 00:09:07,380
Speaker 0: But I don't know, it's kind of weird that they put out the iBook with Intel first, because the PowerBook is really what needs the upgrade that people want, and this tells me that they don't have the powerful Intel chips, that they only have weak ones, and that things that are more powerful than the G5 that are x86 are like not ready yet.

134
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:12,559
Speaker 1: They're the ones who wanted to drop PowerPC, which is very powerful, so they're gonna have to deal with that.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know, we'll see what comes of it.

136
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,520
Speaker 0: I don't know how good the iBook's gonna sell.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,340
Speaker 0: People want PowerBooks and they're gonna hold out until they see them.

138
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:27,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just think it was funny, because way back when Apple was pulling out and stopping, they said, "We're not using PowerPC anymore,".

139
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,531
Speaker 1: and I worked for IBM, and I was like, "Oh, would that be bad?

140
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:31,938
Speaker 1: What are we gonna

141
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:31,998
Speaker 1: do?".

142
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,100
Speaker 1: And then I found out that everyone in the world buys more PowerPC chips than Apple.

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, PowerPC chips are a lot of things you don't expect.

144
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the Xbox, PlayStation 3, and the Revolution all use the same chips.

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,276
Speaker 0: GameCube has it.

146
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:51,119
Speaker 0: A lot of just random devices that you don't even know have it.

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,040
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of Motorola PPC chips in just random devices that you don't even know.

148
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:57,980
Speaker 1: Yep, because PowerPC is good.

149
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:58,920
Speaker 1: It's pretty powerful.

150
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,340
Speaker 1: It uses almost no power compared to an Intel chip.

151
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,680
Speaker 0: The assembly language is much better than the x86 assembly language.

152
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:06,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,940
Speaker 0: So it's just a much better CPU architecture.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,279
Speaker 0: It's just that the people who produce the chips won't produce them in quantity or style that Apple wants, I guess.

155
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, no one really knows exactly why Apple switched.

156
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:38,940
Speaker 0: The rumor I heard was that IBM refused to make one that was less powerful because they produce ones for their big giant supercomputers, and to also produce ones that are low power and slower for cheaper iBooks and things would cost them too much money to diversify the manufacturing.

157
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't really say anything about that.

158
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,979
Speaker 1: I mean, they're all made in the factory I work at, and I actually do kind of know the answer, but I really can't talk about it.

159
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I heard.

160
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't take too much stock in that rumor.

161
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh well.

162
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:04,435
Speaker 0: Anyway, now that it's, you know, MS Apple Day, apparently some of the Microsoft programs coming out in the future are going to be 64-bit only.

163
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:06,575
Speaker 1: Great!

164
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,476
Speaker 1: I wonder how many people are actually going to buy a 64-bit PC?

165
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:28,818
Speaker 0: Well, I think basically what's going to happen is that people buying, people who are using, have Windows networks already, and who are already Windows-ed, are going, they buy a new machine now, a new server, a new something, they're going to buy one with a 64-bit chip in it, and they're going to throw down some Windows on it.

166
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:37,295
Speaker 0: And that'll be good for AMD, because they'll probably make a bunch of sales, because I don't think the Intel, no one's in their right mind would buy an Intel 64-bit chip.

167
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:50,378
Speaker 0: But I also think it's going to screw MS, because people who want to upgrade the software, but then someone tells them, "Oh, you're going to have to replace your whole server with one with the 64-bit chip," are going to say, "Screw

168
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:50,559
Speaker 0: you!"

169
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,900
Speaker 0: And they're not going to get the upgrade.

170
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,840
Speaker 0: And Microsoft makes all their money by selling the next version of something to people to keep them in their cycle upgrades.

171
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,460
Speaker 1: Well, there's also the factor that for the first time ever, the new office at least is pretty radically different in terms of GUI.

172
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:11,880
Speaker 0: Oh, well, they have their ribbon thing, and I think the idea is the ribbon thing is going to be all over Vista.

173
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:19,599
Speaker 1: The thing is, I have a feeling that a lot of people who use Windows are kind of afraid of change like that.

174
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,800
Speaker 0: You know, you think that too, but have you actually seen this ribbon thing?

175
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:25,339
Speaker 1: Actually, I have.

176
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,319
Speaker 0: It's kind of okay, kind of.

177
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,580
Speaker 0: And I think that people could figure it out after like a few minutes.

178
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a matter of figuring it out.

179
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,599
Speaker 1: It's a matter of, I see people being intimidated by it.

180
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:43,177
Speaker 1: I mean, I see a lot of Windows users who are really intimidated by OS X in general, just looking at it like, "Wow, what do I do?

181
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:45,200
Speaker 1: It's different.

182
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:47,780
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they're just dumb.

183
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,300
Speaker 0: But I think that this thing, it doesn't actually change the way you use the computer.

184
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,980
Speaker 0: I mean, you still have the menus up there, right?

185
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,459
Speaker 0: And it actually takes away some of the intimidation because you don't have big menus with a million options in them.

186
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, but instead the menus change depending on what you're doing, too.

187
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:13,340
Speaker 0: Well, it's basically the same as having a menu, except, you know, if you're doing something, the things that you're most likely to, you know, click will appear in the ribbon and the ribbon changes.

188
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we'll see how well that actually works.

189
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,158
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen it, but I've never used it.

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,299
Speaker 1: And I've noticed that Microsoft programs in the past have been very bad at predicting what I'm actually going to do.

191
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the big problem I'm thinking of.

192
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:34,300
Speaker 0: is that, okay, so let's say the most likely thing I am to do is save, copy, paste, cut, and insert an image, right?

193
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,659
Speaker 0: So those are all in the ribbon.

194
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:39,660
Speaker 0: When I want to do something else, I think it's going to be a huge pain.

195
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:40,359
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:47,519
Speaker 0: And it's going to frustrate a lot of people because it seems like everyone who uses Office does one weird thing.

197
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:57,319
Speaker 0: Like, they're a mail merge guy, or they're a random Excel script guy, or they have one quirk and everyone has a different quirk.

198
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:02,639
Speaker 0: And all those quirks are going to suck and everyone's going to have one sucky experience.

199
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:12,579
Speaker 1: And I'd say, oh, maybe it'll push some people toward OpenOffice, but as much as I love Open Source and OpenOffice, OpenOffice is slow as shit.

200
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,340
Speaker 0: That's why I don't use OpenOffice, I use AbiWord.

201
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:14,958
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,440
Speaker 0: AbiWord is fast, it just doesn't have all the crazy features of OpenOffice.

203
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,419
Speaker 1: I use Office 2000 because I acquired a copy.

204
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,660
Speaker 0: I use AbiWord.

205
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,580
Speaker 0: It's real simple.

206
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,340
Speaker 0: All it does is type bold, italic underline, formatting of paragraphs.

207
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,460
Speaker 1: The thing is, I don't even really use an Office suite on my home computer because my old crap printer eventually died.

208
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,378
Speaker 1: I never bought a new one.

209
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:43,394
Speaker 1: Any document editing I do is usually digital text type documents, and I just use VI.

210
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I use VI mostly, but AbiWord isn't even an Office suite.

211
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Speaker 0: It's just a word processor.

212
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just have very little need for a word processor at home anymore.

213
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:59,299
Speaker 0: I sometimes like to use it if I'm writing something, not editing a text file, because it's nice to write paragraphs of text in.

214
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

215
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:08,459
Speaker 1: Thing is, whenever I write something, I'm usually writing it for a website, and I just have extensions in Firefox that let me do all the Office-y type stuff in it.

216
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,620
Speaker 1: Like spell check, and add HTML automatically for bolding, and stuff like that.

217
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,859
Speaker 0: That's all good, but you know, I'm on the train.

218
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,431
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,760
Speaker 1: What, are you writing a novel?

220
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:20,677
Speaker 0: No.

221
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:21,700
Speaker 1: What are you writing?

222
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,199
Speaker 0: Stuff for websites.

223
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,719
Speaker 0: But you can't exactly visit the website to type in the text box.

224
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:27,639
Speaker 1: You have an error card.

225
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:28,559
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

226
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,120
Speaker 1: Oh, they took it back?

227
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,399
Speaker 0: They took it back a long time ago.

228
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:31,836
Speaker 0: Oh!

229
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,079
Speaker 0: And then they gave me, they got these free singular ones, but they only lasted a month, and then that was that.

230
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,460
Speaker 0: The singular one is not as good as the Verizon one, and it's 20 bucks more money.

231
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:41,898
Speaker 1: Awesome.

232
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,459
Speaker 0: So if you're looking for a PCMCIA card to get you on the internet, get the Verizon Evdo for 60 a month.

233
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,999
Speaker 0: It's, it's the best in the US, even though it's crap compared to the rest of the world.

234
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,460
Speaker 0: Complete crap.

235
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:57,456
Speaker 0: All right.

236
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,717
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

237
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,259
Speaker 1: Things of the day!

238
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:01,980
Speaker 1: We have no music.

239
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:03,376
Speaker 0: Yet.

240
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:04,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,579
Speaker 0: Because we're still lazy bums.

242
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,360
Speaker 1: So uh, my thing of the day, I have always been kind of interested in lobotomies.

243
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,620
Speaker 0: Why were you interested in lobotomies?

244
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:14,679
Speaker 1: I'm not sure why.

245
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 1: It's one of those weird, not lobotomies as in current use or anything like that.

246
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,240
Speaker 0: Do they still use them?

247
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,480
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, but not in the same way they used to.

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,179
Speaker 0: Thinking about getting one?

249
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,268
Speaker 1: Nah.

250
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:35,160
Speaker 1: See, there was a period in the United States where there was a doctor by the name of Freeman going around, and he was lobotomizing people left and right.

251
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,719
Speaker 1: Thousands and thousands of people.

252
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,979
Speaker 1: He would do it in like five minutes with an ice pick.

253
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,160
Speaker 0: He just hit people in the head with an ice pick?

254
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,438
Speaker 1: He would just, he would lay it down.

255
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,800
Speaker 1: He'd use electroshock to knock you unconscious.

256
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,760
Speaker 1: And then he'd shove an ice pick over, like, above your eye.

257
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,899
Speaker 1: It's called a suborbital lobotomy or something like that.

258
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,559
Speaker 1: Take an ice pick, he'd shove it over the top of your eye into your brain, and then you swish it around.

259
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:00,398
Speaker 1: That's all he did.

260
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,859
Speaker 1: And he did it to thousands and thousands of people to cure various psychological ailments.

261
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,980
Speaker 0: See, this is why people like Randy are out and about.

262
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy did a lot of bad.

263
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,540
Speaker 1: And he did lobotomies on a lot of people.

264
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,239
Speaker 0: It's worse than any chiropractor I've ever heard.

265
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,010
Speaker 1: Now, one person who he did this to back in the '50s and '60s, it was done to this little kid.

266
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:26,400
Speaker 1: And the kid, luckily, wasn't turned into a complete vegetable, and he's still alive today.

267
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,959
Speaker 1: And he talked to some reporters, and he had a thing written on how he was lobotomized by this crackpot asshole back in the day.

268
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,539
Speaker 0: What's he like now?

269
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,039
Speaker 1: He's a pretty cool guy.

270
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,820
Speaker 1: He's campaigning against this sort of quackery.

271
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,540
Speaker 0: I don't think this quackery's happening.

272
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,679
Speaker 0: This particular quackery is happening.

273
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,400
Speaker 1: But other instances of this quackery are definitely happening.

274
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:48,235
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

275
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,574
Speaker 0: Where?

276
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:50,260
Speaker 0: Are people still lobotomying?

277
00:17:51,481 --> 00:18:01,000
Speaker 1: Actually, not specifically lobotomy, but now they've moved to various anti-psychotic drugs or mood-altering drugs that are really just as bad.

278
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not a fan of those.

279
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
Speaker 0: Especially the parents giving them to their kids because they don't raise them right, et cetera, et cetera.

280
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:18,577
Speaker 1: I mean, the worst part is, from what I gather, the reason this kid's mom had him lobotomized was because, according to what physicians said, he was a normal boy, and the mom couldn't take it.

281
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,539
Speaker 1: So she got him lobotomized to quiet him.

282
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,199
Speaker 0: Sounds about right.

283
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:22,770
Speaker 0: Yeah.

284
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,740
Speaker 0: Just back in the day, they didn't have the Ritalin.

285
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they just stuck an ice pick into your brain and swished it around.

286
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
Speaker 0: Ritalin's not that much better.

287
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:32,499
Speaker 0: It is better, though.

288
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:33,514
Speaker 0: Because, yeah.

289
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,739
Speaker 0: So, my thing of the day, well, first of all, I don't like the MMOs.

290
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:40,819
Speaker 0: You should know I don't like the MMOs.

291
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,179
Speaker 1: He really doesn't like the MMOs.

292
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:53,000
Speaker 0: I mean, I got my fix back in the day, and, you know, I decided that paying to click a button and make a number go up and chat with people with pictures- Oh, you mean Progress Quest?

293
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, is not something I wanted to do with my life.

294
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,500
Speaker 0: And I don't like the TV, either.

295
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,800
Speaker 0: If you know me, you know that I haven't watched TV, really, in years?

296
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:03,860
Speaker 0: Six years?

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,398
Speaker 0: Seven years?

298
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,159
Speaker 1: Since right about when we went to RIT.

299
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, since I got to college.

300
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,380
Speaker 0: And I'm out of college now for half a year, almost.

301
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't even have cable.

302
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,299
Speaker 1: More than half a year.

303
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,060
Speaker 1: Even though, despite the fact that Comcast thinks we're stealing cable, they keep coming and checking.

304
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,140
Speaker 0: It's not Comcast Cablevision.

305
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,619
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever.

306
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:19,274
Speaker 0: Anyway.

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,460
Speaker 1: Cable- C star.

308
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,739
Speaker 0: But today, there was something so cool on television, involving MMOs, that it got onto the internet.

309
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,059
Speaker 1: And, um- In fact, we have a clip, don't we?

310
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,340
Speaker 0: We do have a clip, and it is awesome.

311
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:45,519
Speaker 1: So, uh, without further ado- This role-playing game, out in 2004, returns to the world of Azeroth, where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.

312
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,250
Speaker 1: And that would be the world of Warcraft.

313
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:53,910
Speaker 0: Leroy Jenkins!

314
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,410
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

315
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:06,409
Speaker 1: So, either the guy who writes the questions for Jeopardy is a mega nerd, or- One of his friends preyed on the fact that he's not a mega nerd?

316
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:07,559
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,590
Speaker 0: What really got me, though, is normally you'd expect no one to get the question right, as no one got the question right.

318
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,470
Speaker 0: But this is the college edition, so you'd think they'd all get the question right.

319
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,770
Speaker 0: You gotta be a nerd to get on Jeopardy, but apparently not.

320
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,650
Speaker 0: You just have to be a loser.

321
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:24,910
Speaker 1: I mean, I've never played World of Warcraft.

322
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:26,958
Speaker 1: I've only actually seen it.

323
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,809
Speaker 1: once I saw someone's computer that happened to have it on.

324
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:31,846
Speaker 1: Yet I know who Leroy Jenkins is.

325
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:33,769
Speaker 1: And he's my hero.

326
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,189
Speaker 1: Second only to Omar Jenkins.

327
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:37,266
Speaker 0: Omar.

328
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:42,090
Speaker 0: So there's a quote from, uh, on Joystiq about this particular incident.

329
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:42,789
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

330
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:53,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a- and the guy said, uh, "This either says a lot about the spread of tired internet memes into the mainstream, or about the question researchers'

331
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:53,750
Speaker 0: addictions.".

332
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:54,868
Speaker 0: Hmm.

333
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:02,689
Speaker 0: "Either way, it reflects the rise of gaming into popular perception, while maintaining a huge divide between those who are in on the joke and those who

334
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,950
Speaker 0: aren't.".

335
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:13,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely see, say, ten years from now when we're all adults, and there'll be no chance for any of our, uh, age peers to know who Leroy Jenkins was.

336
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:23,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, this is really good about what's happening in general, is that a lot- there's a lot of geeks, and we're having this sort of meta conversation on the internet.

337
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:33,666
Speaker 0: It's like this whole- imagine if there was a newspaper that was printed that had completely different stories from the real newspaper, and it only went to some people's houses, and they never let anyone else read it.

338
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,724
Speaker 0: But you would still talk about it with other people who got the paper at the water cooler, and everyone else would be like, "What's going

339
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:39,966
Speaker 0: on?".

340
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:46,029
Speaker 0: Right, it's kind of like when you, um, you know, when people in the room are using Pictochat, and some people aren't.

341
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,710
Speaker 1: You have this side channel of communication that isn't available to everyone.

342
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, and some people are laughing about something, and everyone else goes,

343
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:53,089
Speaker 0: "What?"

344
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:54,249
Speaker 0: What?

345
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:06,870
Speaker 1: Plus, it's just so nice to see this- like when we went to Otacon, you know, 22,000 geeks running around, and I knew, and then I experimentally verified, that if I yelled Leroy, a lot of people would yell Jenkins.

346
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,090
Speaker 0: In fact, um, just whispering about yelling Leroy, like, "We're gonna do it.

347
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,345
Speaker 0: Someone else will do it before

348
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:13,467
Speaker 0: you.".

349
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:17,450
Speaker 0: And then you will invariably respond with the Jenkins.

350
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,189
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

351
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:18,808
Speaker 0: Really.

352
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,529
Speaker 0: It, you know, it's like, I don't know.

353
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:25,250
Speaker 0: It's like, kind of like an invasion.

354
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:35,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, geeks are kind of- we're slowly subverting- we're like taking culture and making our own, like, subculture, but our subculture is infiltrating the main culture.

355
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people still don't understand or recognize that it's there.

356
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:48,249
Speaker 0: It's kind of like, uh, spying, or like- remember in, uh, Hannibal, when he put the secret message in the classified ads to tell him what was going on?

357
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:54,110
Speaker 0: Normal people see it as a classified ad, but to the other guy, ah, evil Hannibal messages.

358
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,910
Speaker 1: But eventually, like, the more they see it, they'll be scared and/or confused by it, possibly.

359
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,629
Speaker 0: Well, they've already begun to persecute the geeks, and- Yeah, Jack Thompson.

360
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:03,247
Speaker 0: Jack Thompson.

361
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,909
Speaker 0: Jack Thompson.

362
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:04,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:05,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

364
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,049
Speaker 1: Though Germany has its own Jack Thompson now, but he's in a government position, and he wants to ban violent video games.

365
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,710
Speaker 0: Well, we have people in our Senate and whatnot that want to get rid of violent video games.

366
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think they really want to get rid of them.

367
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:23,087
Speaker 1: Hillary Clinton periodically campaigns against them, but I think that's just a political ploy.

368
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's mostly political ploy.

369
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:35,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, this German guy seems kind of nutty, like he really wants to ban him, and his rationale was that it's- basically, it would remove the burden from parents who don't understand these games.

370
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:43,610
Speaker 0: Well, Germany's not big on freedom anyway, I mean- No, no, no, not like- well, kind of like that.

371
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,730
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to be Nazi there.

372
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:47,349
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,249
Speaker 1: Here, you're allowed to be Nazi, you're just dumb.

374
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, I don't like Nazis.

375
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,187
Speaker 1: Illinois Nazis.

376
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:03,150
Speaker 0: But if you want to march down the street with your Nazi business, I don't care, you're not killing anyone, you're not doing anything, you're just walking around yelling.

377
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, First Amendment.

378
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,310
Speaker 0: While you're an idiot, go for it, you know, if that's what you want to say.

379
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,518
Speaker 1: If the Blues Brothers happened to drive through their parade, I wouldn't stop them, I just laugh.

380
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much what it comes down to.

381
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:27,729
Speaker 0: So, you know, Germany, sure, that was where the Nazis happened, so I can understand the wanting to keep it away, but the limiting freedom is kind of Nazi-ish, you know, it's kind of like this backwards thing.

382
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:35,670
Speaker 0: So this is just, you know, a government that doesn't have freedom will have less qualms about taking away other freedoms.

383
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:42,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though that doesn't scare me nearly as much as what's going on in Britain now with the cars.

384
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,570
Speaker 0: What's going on in Britain with cars?

385
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:50,230
Speaker 1: In Britain, you know, they got the cameras everywhere, they've got cameras almost everywhere in Britain, just watching everyone.

386
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:51,769
Speaker 0: Yep, and all about it.

387
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:01,723
Speaker 0: They even have that thing that can, like, see your face and match you up in the computer, and it just matches faces randomly and looks for people who are in criminal databases and wanted...

388
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,870
Speaker 1: Well, now they're setting up the system to do the same thing with car license plates.

389
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,409
Speaker 0: So they're just cameras looking at license plates all over, and if your license plate is in the database of bad, they come get you?

390
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:16,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also to, uh, in real time enforce speeding without needing cops.

391
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,650
Speaker 1: They'll just, they'll know if you got between two places too quickly.

392
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,410
Speaker 0: But then how will they know if that was, uh, like, the computer didn't malfunction or something?

393
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:27,710
Speaker 1: Ah, ah, well, the computer's perfect.

394
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,770
Speaker 0: Can you at least go to court and say something?

395
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:30,870
Speaker 1: I assume you can go to court.

396
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:36,669
Speaker 1: The system's not in place yet, so I'm sure we're going to see a lot of, uh, various court battles and fighting over it.

397
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,769
Speaker 0: So I don't know how Britain's courts work, but if that was a US court, you'd find one way to get out of it, and then...

398
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,639
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, I mean, right.

399
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,249
Speaker 1: when the cameras first started going in, a lot of Brits protested him furiously.

400
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,249
Speaker 1: And they went in anyway, and eventually people got used to him and stopped fighting him, and now a lot of people are glad they're there.

401
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:57,710
Speaker 1: So they get used to these things real quickly, scarily quickly.

402
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cameras are there, great, but they don't help when, you know, the cops kill some guy in the subway.

403
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,370
Speaker 0: Shouldn't have been killed.

404
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:07,050
Speaker 1: No, no, he might have been a terrorist, so it's okay.

405
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,949
Speaker 0: Well, where were the cameras then, huh?

406
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,889
Speaker 0: I don't see the film from these things, where is it?

407
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,030
Speaker 1: I wonder if a camera was pointed over there or not.

408
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,129
Speaker 0: There had to be, this camera's everywhere in Britain.

409
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,110
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:17,870
Speaker 0: Everywhere.

411
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,690
Speaker 0: Like, literally, just on every street, in every public place.

412
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,330
Speaker 0: They're just, they're not in your private place, as far as we know.

413
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,490
Speaker 0: But they might be looking at your window.

414
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:28,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is perfectly legal.

415
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,698
Speaker 1: Yep.

416
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,590
Speaker 1: In fact, here in the United States, I can stand on the sidewalk, and with a telephoto's lens, get whatever I can through the windows.

417
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,630
Speaker 1: Perfectly legal.

418
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,409
Speaker 0: Perfectly legal.

419
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,989
Speaker 1: In fact, I could even put those pictures on the interwebs.

420
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:40,290
Speaker 0: Interwebs.

421
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:48,918
Speaker 0: There's, you know, usually, if you're seeing something going on in a house that, you know, is all, eh, that you want to take pictures of, that's like, ooh, someone wants you to see.

422
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:50,730
Speaker 0: No one's dumb enough.

423
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:58,290
Speaker 1: I gotta say, because in New York City, there seem to be a lot of people who are naked in the window, and they know they're naked, and they know everyone can see them, and they're doing it on purpose.

424
00:26:58,874 --> 00:26:59,430
Speaker 0: A lot of people.

425
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:09,889
Speaker 1: There's no way you could be standing completely naked in front of a large window in a skyscraper, where there's another skyscraper right across the street with people in it, and not know that they can see you, because you can see them.

426
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,548
Speaker 0: Yeah.

427
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:14,565
Speaker 0: There aren't too many people who stand in the window naked that don't want to be seen naked.

428
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,630
Speaker 1: Granted, oftentimes, I'll stand in front of a window naked just because I'm not paying attention, and it's early.

430
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,610
Speaker 0: This is why bathroom windows are very high up and small.

431
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,269
Speaker 1: Or they're made with that clouded glass.

432
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,948
Speaker 0: I don't like the clouded glass, because I can't see out, and it defeats the purpose of the window.

433
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,589
Speaker 1: What do you want to see out when you're in the bathroom?

434
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:35,070
Speaker 1: The window's there just to let the steam out after you shower.

435
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,286
Speaker 0: I see what the weather's like.

436
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,090
Speaker 1: I have many other opportunities to see the weather.

437
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,709
Speaker 1: You know, like every other window I pass.

438
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,810
Speaker 0: I mean, while I'm standing out in the bathroom drying, I'm not doing anything else.

439
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,550
Speaker 0: I could look at the weather.

440
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,049
Speaker 1: I don't stand in the bathroom and dry.

441
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,329
Speaker 1: I walk right out of the bathroom.

442
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,129
Speaker 0: You get water all over the place.

443
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:55,490
Speaker 1: There's this thing someone invented.

444
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,670
Speaker 1: It was called a towel.

445
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I dry myself off with a towel.

446
00:27:58,392 --> 00:27:59,530
Speaker 0: Then I leave the bathroom.

447
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:04,010
Speaker 1: So you're worried about occupying yourself for those, like, five seconds.

448
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,128
Speaker 0: Hey, and every little bit helps.

449
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,049
Speaker 1: That'd be like if I played Mario Kart while I was walking to my car.

450
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:14,000
Speaker 0: I plead guilty.

451
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:25,979
Speaker 0: Actually, when I was driving home from the train station today, I was kind of, I had a little Mario Kart on the brain, and I was like, you know, going outside, the inside on the turn, back to the outside.

452
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,619
Speaker 0: I was getting ready to wiggle the wheel a bit.

453
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:36,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other day when I was driving to the drugstore or something, there was a corner and I had this urge to jump and then power slide.

454
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't work.

455
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,899
Speaker 1: No, my car doesn't jump.

456
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:41,660
Speaker 0: My car doesn't jump either.

457
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,259
Speaker 0: My car barely rolls.

458
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:55,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's going to be real hard for us to continue the podcast because my suspended DS is sitting right there and I can see it blinking at me.

459
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,819
Speaker 1: And I know that I'm one click away from racing some crazy Japanese kid.

460
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:08,980
Speaker 0: Uh, yesterday I played, like, a whole bunch of races, and I only lost once against a guy who was as good as me, and I lost basically by a hair on item luck.

461
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:10,959
Speaker 0: So I'm feeling pretty good.

462
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,119
Speaker 0: Most people just suck.

463
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't even seem to drift.

464
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Speaker 1: A lot of people use the bunny hop method where they just hop around every corner.

465
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:26,360
Speaker 0: Uh, there was one guy who wasn't as fast as I was, but he was, he found this shortcut on one track that I couldn't replicate.

466
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,195
Speaker 1: Which track?

467
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,080
Speaker 0: The Luigi, the final Yoshi circuit, the last track.

468
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:44,620
Speaker 0: And he basically, I don't know what he did, but I tried to go to the same place he went and it was a railing that stopped me from going, but he somehow jumped over this piece of the track and I would get way ahead of him by going real fast.

469
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Speaker 0: Then he would jump over and he'd be in front of me and then I have to pass him again.

470
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,918
Speaker 0: I still won, but it was, it was like, whoa.

471
00:29:53,821 --> 00:30:03,300
Speaker 1: Though I did see, and because we were talking the other day about the things people will put in their little emblems in the game, I saw perhaps the most offensive one ever.

472
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:05,420
Speaker 1: I don't think I need to elaborate.

473
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,220
Speaker 1: Let's just say that it was some form of intricately drawn penis with a racial epithet attached.

474
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:15,060
Speaker 0: I spent the hours where I was not working at work today and I drew a boo.

475
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,013
Speaker 1: Oh, a boo?

476
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,493
Speaker 0: A boo.

477
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:17,397
Speaker 1: A boo.

478
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:20,859
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

479
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:23,240
Speaker 0: It's better than my previous logo, which is lightning.

480
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, my current logo is a poorly drawn skull and bones.

481
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:29,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should draw a quality skull and bones.

482
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, this weekend I'm probably gonna sit down and make something cool.

483
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,719
Speaker 0: Like those skulls in Mario where you step on them and they fall down.

484
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,300
Speaker 0: I can make better than that.

485
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,720
Speaker 0: They make a little platform that goes in the lava and you stand on it and they carry you along.

486
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,619
Speaker 1: Or I could just, you know, make the most offensive thing I can think of.

487
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, could.

488
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,479
Speaker 0: It's not that interesting though.

489
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:52,120
Speaker 1: I mean, just one final note.

490
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,799
Speaker 1: The guy who had the really offensive emblem, his name also was FuckFuck.

491
00:30:57,763 --> 00:30:58,180
Speaker 0: Great name.

492
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,058
Speaker 0: I played the worst one.

493
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,160
Speaker 0: The only one I played against that was offensive was a guy.

494
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,799
Speaker 0: His name was capital T Bagger with two capital G's in the middle of it.

495
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,380
Speaker 0: And his icon, I think.

496
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,620
Speaker 0: Oh, his icon was a green t-shirt with two yellow letters in the middle of it.

497
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,798
Speaker 0: The letter F and the letter U.

498
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:15,199
Speaker 1: Classic.

499
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,300
Speaker 1: What an upstanding and eloquent young man.

500
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:19,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, he lost.

501
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,279
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

502
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:20,998
Speaker 0: Real bad.

503
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,517
Speaker 0: I whooped him.

504
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,020
Speaker 0: So we're having a hard time, you know, coming up with things to talk about Monday and Thursday.

505
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,959
Speaker 1: Because Thursday is only tough because we, uh, don't have any interviews lined up that we can go out and do just yet.

506
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,388
Speaker 0: Yeah.

507
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,340
Speaker 0: And it's, uh, it's hard to force ourselves to talk about something.

508
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,240
Speaker 0: We used to just kind of let it go and trying to force it is not so difficult.

509
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:52,280
Speaker 0: So at the spur of the moment, I came up with a bit and we decided to call this bit, at least temporarily, how not to suck with Brim and Scott.

510
00:31:53,501 --> 00:32:04,680
Speaker 0: And what I think we're going to the way the bits going to work is each episode of the bit, if we ever do another episode of the bit is we just start saying how not to suck at something.

511
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:11,579
Speaker 0: And whatever the something is, we just keep coming up with advice, one sentence or a few sentences of advice and how not to suck.

512
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:19,320
Speaker 1: And then we elaborate until we done describing and will very specifically only pick things that we don't suck at that way.

513
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,838
Speaker 1: We have some sort of knowledge, but we don't suck at anything.

514
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,760
Speaker 1: Uh, we suck at sucking.

515
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:26,579
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe.

516
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,900
Speaker 0: But well, we can do is, you know, while we're all the bit is called how not to suck.

517
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,040
Speaker 0: We can only talk about things.

518
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,440
Speaker 0: We're awesome at many, many things, but not all things.

519
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,919
Speaker 0: I'm not an awesome cross country skier.

520
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,118
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

521
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,640
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't even know how to cross country ski.

522
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,020
Speaker 0: As you put on skis and you walk around, it's actually kind of fun, but it's very, uh, I think it's mostly sliding, right?

523
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,549
Speaker 1: See, this shows how much I don't know about.

524
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,395
Speaker 1: it's mostly it.

525
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:56,440
Speaker 1: It's hard, like rollerblading is hard and that you do have to do a lot of work.

526
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,959
Speaker 1: It's mostly not downhill.

527
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,920
Speaker 0: Uh, anyway, the first one we're going to do is the easiest one.

528
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,520
Speaker 0: How not to suck at college.

529
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,899
Speaker 0: The first rule of not sucking at college is the two thirds rule.

530
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:14,939
Speaker 0: Then part one, the two thirds rule is there are three things in college life.

531
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:19,760
Speaker 0: You're sleeping, you're having fun, and your grades in your classes.

532
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,680
Speaker 0: If you pick any two of those, you will succeed.

533
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,660
Speaker 0: You cannot have all three unless they're all pretty weak.

534
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,580
Speaker 0: You pretty much get, you know, you can have, you know, you can have sleep, sleep all you want, never be tired.

535
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,220
Speaker 0: You can have tons of fun and you won't pass your classes or any other combination.

536
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,199
Speaker 1: We pretty much gave up sleep.

537
00:33:44,702 --> 00:33:49,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, getting, giving up sleep is what I would recommend because that way you pretty much we picked fun no matter what.

538
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,251
Speaker 1: And then we'd give up sleep to get good grades.

539
00:33:53,673 --> 00:34:00,718
Speaker 1: every now and then when we needed sleep, we temporarily give up grades to get sleep because fun is pretty much our number one priority all the time.

540
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,200
Speaker 0: We always maximize the fun.

541
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:05,900
Speaker 0: And then, you know, I had a little bit of sleep, but that took out a little bit of grades.

542
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Speaker 0: That's why I didn't get a 4.0.

543
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,619
Speaker 1: Like I remember the time when we just said fuck all and drove to Michigan to go to this Linux convention, penguicon.

544
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,739
Speaker 0: Well, I was working at the time.

545
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,338
Speaker 1: I was in school.

546
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was in school and I had a project due that Monday that pretty much if I passed it, I would graduate.

547
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,820
Speaker 1: And if I didn't pass it, I wouldn't graduate.

548
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,719
Speaker 1: So what I do, I went to penguicon and then I got back Sunday night and I stayed up all night and worked furiously and finished the project.

549
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,360
Speaker 1: And then I slept through like my next week worth of classes.

550
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:37,739
Speaker 0: Awesome.

551
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:38,737
Speaker 1: Yeah.

552
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:44,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I can't even talk about how many times where I had fun all night, didn't sleep and then went to class the next day.

553
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,759
Speaker 0: I mean, if that's not fun and grades with no sleep, I don't know what is.

554
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,719
Speaker 1: Now, the other rule along these lines is very simple.

555
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,159
Speaker 1: It is how to pass a class.

556
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:01,619
Speaker 1: You are guaranteed to pass the class with at least a low B, if not higher, if you do two of the three following things.

557
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:03,820
Speaker 1: Actually attend the class.

558
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,200
Speaker 0: And pay attention.

559
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,120
Speaker 0: If you attend the class and sleep, it doesn't count.

560
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:13,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you attend the class and just kind of hang out in the back and don't really pay attention, but you don't sleep straight up, you're fine.

561
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it helps a little bit, but actually paying attention is the best.

562
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,938
Speaker 1: Do your homework.

563
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:21,579
Speaker 0: Very important.

564
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:23,019
Speaker 1: Or study.

565
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,019
Speaker 1: Now, we never studied.

566
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:27,860
Speaker 1: Ever.

567
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,140
Speaker 0: I never studied ever.

568
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:34,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, when I was in elementary school and they said, oh, study for the test, I didn't know what that meant.

569
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:43,219
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew it meant you do something to prepare to get a better grade on the test, but I didn't know specifically what you did.

570
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,379
Speaker 0: I was like, what could I do?

571
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,460
Speaker 0: I already get a hundred without doing anything.

572
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I didn't understand it and I never took notes.

573
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,040
Speaker 0: And up until the end of college, I never studied and never took notes.

574
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:57,479
Speaker 0: And I now have a degree.

575
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,260
Speaker 1: But you can use this rule to your advantage to modify or take advantage of how much time you get living.

576
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,084
Speaker 1: Like, I had a class once where it was Visual Basic and I realized I didn't need to go to it.

577
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,280
Speaker 1: So I decided to never go to the class and I just learned Visual Basic on my own by studying and doing homework.

578
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,279
Speaker 1: And as a result, I passed the class.

579
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,460
Speaker 0: One important thing to also note about this rule is if there is homework that is graded like a project, that's pretty much mandatory.

580
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

581
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,800
Speaker 0: That's considered, you know, it's a test.

582
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,759
Speaker 0: You have to take it.

583
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:31,420
Speaker 0: It's a project.

584
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,400
Speaker 0: You have to do it.

585
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,838
Speaker 1: See, we were lucky at RIT.

586
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,980
Speaker 1: Very few people ever assigned homework.

587
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,840
Speaker 1: It was always either one big paper or there was like daily homework that was worth maybe five or six percent of your grade.

588
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, if something is graded, I always did it.

589
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:46,040
Speaker 0: But I never did homework that wasn't graded.

590
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,458
Speaker 0: And I never did, I hardly ever did reading homework unless it was for literature class and I hadn't read the book.

591
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,300
Speaker 1: See, I went one step further.

592
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:57,880
Speaker 1: I would only do homework if I could, because remember, RIT did not have pluses and minuses.

593
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,420
Speaker 1: It was A, B, C, D fail.

594
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:08,580
Speaker 1: So most people at RIT shoot for the low B, because the low B is still a B and it's the minimum effort required to get a decent grade.

595
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,179
Speaker 0: Some teachers put the B at 83, but what are you going to do?

596
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:11,898
Speaker 1: Yeah.

597
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:15,580
Speaker 0: But, uh, crap.

598
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:34,720
Speaker 1: Like, I'd look at the syllabus whenever a class started and I'd see like, oh, the final is worth 60 percent and the midterm is worth 20 percent and the project's worth X. Oh, the labs are only worth eight percent of my final grade?

599
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:43,057
Speaker 1: So if I don't do any of the labs, I can still get an A. If I don't do any of the labs and I do okay on the test, I'm guaranteed a B. Fuck the labs.

600
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,658
Speaker 0: It's funny how that often works out where the labs will be the most time consuming thing there is.

601
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:48,940
Speaker 1: And yet they're worth nothing.

602
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:49,518
Speaker 0: Yeah.

603
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:56,078
Speaker 1: Except in some IT classes where they're worth nothing, except they're a Boolean modifier to your final grade.

604
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't pass them, you fail.

605
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:02,220
Speaker 1: They multiply your final grade by the integer result of the Boolean.

606
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,140
Speaker 1: If you fail the labs, they multiply your grade by zero.

607
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,472
Speaker 0: Great.

608
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:13,559
Speaker 1: That was the one time I ever failed a class because I didn't do the lab.

609
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,680
Speaker 1: But it was a very conscious decision.

610
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,520
Speaker 1: It was well after the add drop date.

611
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,860
Speaker 1: It was well after the withdraw date.

612
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,618
Speaker 1: And there were still three weeks left of class.

613
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,220
Speaker 1: And I had kind of been slacking off all quarter.

614
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:26,279
Speaker 1: And I realized that I have a choice now.

615
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:31,719
Speaker 1: I can lose the next three weeks of my life and not have any fun, but pass this class.

616
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,280
Speaker 1: And get a pretty good grade.

617
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,780
Speaker 1: Or I can just say screw it right now, have fun for the next three weeks, and then retake the class the next quarter.

618
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:42,780
Speaker 1: I didn't.

619
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:43,840
Speaker 1: I just stopped going.

620
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,640
Speaker 1: It was fantastic.

621
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,320
Speaker 0: The one class I remember at RIT is the class I skipped more than any other class ever.

622
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,189
Speaker 0: So much to the point.

623
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,239
Speaker 0: I don't remember the class.

624
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:53,498
Speaker 1: What class was it?

625
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,720
Speaker 0: It was software engineering.

626
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,300
Speaker 0: Software engineering had a big lab component that went for the whole quarter.

627
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,020
Speaker 0: And it had a lecture component that lasted for two thirds of the quarter.

628
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,700
Speaker 0: Or a little over half the quarter.

629
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,600
Speaker 0: I think six or seven weeks, right?

630
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,279
Speaker 0: And basically at the end of the lecture part of the quarter, you took a final and that was the end of the lecture.

631
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,000
Speaker 0: And you just kept going to the lab, right?

632
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:17,599
Speaker 0: The lab counted for most of the grade.

633
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:21,220
Speaker 0: And that one test counted for a lot of the rest of your grade, right?

634
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:26,660
Speaker 0: I went to like the first lecture and the second lecture and maybe like one random lecture.

635
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,480
Speaker 0: Other than that, I skipped it all the time.

636
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,259
Speaker 0: I like I feel I kind of feel bad about it.

637
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:33,979
Speaker 0: Like I never went.

638
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,159
Speaker 0: There was just no attendance.

639
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:37,920
Speaker 0: And it didn't have homework, you know?

640
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,900
Speaker 0: And I studied a little bit for that test and I did okay on it.

641
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:41,658
Speaker 0: And that was that.

642
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess the moral here is just that.

643
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:56,600
Speaker 1: don't you don't have to always shoot for the perfect A, because if you do, you won't enjoy yourself in college and it's possible to get good grades without doing all the work they give you.

644
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,679
Speaker 1: Be smart about it.

645
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,220
Speaker 1: Min-max.

646
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,484
Speaker 1: If something's not worth a large portion of your grade and it's too much work, don't do it.

647
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,128
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,340
Speaker 1: You're better off spending that time working on other classes that matter more.

649
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,140
Speaker 0: You also have to look at your the your overall grade in the grand scheme.

650
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:21,516
Speaker 0: I mean, if you get a how much extra work will it take you to move from the easy B to the difficult A in like a calculus class and what effect will that have on the rest of your life?

651
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,199
Speaker 1: Especially if it would take you half as much work to get an A in another class that you're more interested in.

652
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,460
Speaker 0: If you're trying to be a mathematics PhD, maybe the A is really important.

653
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:36,806
Speaker 0: If you're trying to get a bachelor's degree in computer science, maybe the A isn't that important and you should.

654
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:36,987
Speaker 0: just.

655
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:40,476
Speaker 0: there's not even a point in doing the work because you don't get anything out of it.

656
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,016
Speaker 0: Yeah.

657
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,959
Speaker 0: And if you really want to know calculus, you can learn it.

658
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:48,397
Speaker 0: You can learn all that stuff without going through the extra effort of trying to get an A in the class.

659
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, the grade does not often reflect how much you learn about the subject.

660
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can speak from that very, very openly.

661
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,819
Speaker 0: There are many times where I could take a class and do everything that was going on in that class.

662
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,120
Speaker 0: But because of the format of the class or the type of test that we're given or the way the grading was done, I got a very bad grade.

663
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,359
Speaker 0: There are also classes where I didn't learn anything and I got an A.

664
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, like all the all the late IT classes are kind of dumb.

665
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,860
Speaker 1: They were all about like tech track.

666
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,375
Speaker 1: They were called cool things, but they were actually just like crap.

667
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:24,520
Speaker 1: team building exercises.

668
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 0: Oh, team building.

669
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll always mess up your grade working on a team.

671
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,340
Speaker 1: Because the thing is, your teammates will usually be pretty dumb, even though every individual person you know in that class is smart.

672
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,580
Speaker 1: They'll be this kid that you've never seen in class before.

673
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:46,138
Speaker 1: He'll show up one day and you'll find out that you're on a team with him and like two other mystery people.

674
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,380
Speaker 0: I was on an awesome team once in ad hoc networking, and that was like my last quarter at RIT.

675
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:55,640
Speaker 0: I was on the awesomest team of awesome.

676
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:58,439
Speaker 0: But before that, every team was crap.

677
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:08,579
Speaker 1: So I guess my advice here is if you're ever on a team with people in a class and you didn't get to pick and the people in the team are dumb, if anyone isn't pulling their weight, just first warn them.

678
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,980
Speaker 1: That way you won't get in trouble with the professor.

679
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,159
Speaker 1: And then just ignore them.

680
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,960
Speaker 1: If they're not going to do the work, don't bother them.

681
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,140
Speaker 1: Just do the work yourself and then tell the professor, "Yo, this guy's a dick and he didn't

682
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,347
Speaker 1: help.".

683
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:20,700
Speaker 1: And he'll get graded accordingly and you'll get graded accordingly.

684
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,939
Speaker 1: Don't let people grab your coattails and follow you in.

685
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:25,879
Speaker 1: Make them fail.

686
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,929
Speaker 0: The other thing is when it's time to pick teams, even if you don't know one in the class, don't be all,

687
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:32,415
Speaker 0: "Eh.".

688
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:38,280
Speaker 0: You know who the smart people in the class are just looking around the room and you know who you can communicate with and work well with.

689
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Speaker 1: If you hesitate at all, you'll be stuck with everyone else who hesitated.

690
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:41,751
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Speaker 0: Go and pick the good people right away.

692
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:55,699
Speaker 0: And if there's a good person who's kind of "Eh," like they're smart and they can do it, but they're not, you have to take... Don't expect someone else to be the leader and you can just get some work assigned to you and do it.

693
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,159
Speaker 0: You have to be the leader guy every time.

694
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:00,078
Speaker 0: If you don't, you're going to basically...

695
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,300
Speaker 1: If you're not the leader guy every time.

696
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,220
Speaker 0: You're just rolling dice for your grade, basically.

697
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,959
Speaker 0: You got to take it into your own hands.

698
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:15,960
Speaker 1: Also, one trend I noticed in all the group presentations I did throughout all of college, being funny matters a lot more than your actual content.

699
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:28,880
Speaker 1: And if you do something that's at all creative and you do it confidently and you do it humorously in front of the class, you'll get a good grade, even if the content itself is actually kind of ill-researched and/or crappy.

700
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did that a lot.

701
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:35,896
Speaker 0: I didn't do too many presentations, but I would always do a funny thing if I was ever in front of the class.

702
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,939
Speaker 0: So just like in that ad hoc networking class I just mentioned, we had to give presentations every week, right?

703
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:54,179
Speaker 0: And a lot of people had projects that were a lot more complicated than ours was or a lot more sciency or a lot more mathy, and they did a lot more work and talked a lot more about fancy things.

704
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,398
Speaker 0: We made a game that was ad hoc networked.

705
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:09,460
Speaker 0: It was just a lot like Atari Combat, and we just showed live demos of people with tanks driving around shooting each other, and that got a lot better grade than a lot of the other people.

706
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:26,200
Speaker 1: Because honestly, when they make you do a group project, and it's in most schools, even tech schools, even in extremely advanced, high-level, graduating tech classes, they're not really grading you on your ability to do the tech because you got that far.

707
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,000
Speaker 1: They know you can do the tech, or they know you BS'd your way through it, they don't care.

708
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,600
Speaker 1: They're grading you on how well you can communicate.

709
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,038
Speaker 1: They won't say that, but that's all they really care about.

710
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:45,260
Speaker 0: Well, it's also that when someone's watching you do a presentation, they really can't keep track of the information you're presenting.

711
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:47,360
Speaker 0: That's why they have you do a paper that goes with it.

712
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they're also usually really bored.

713
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,879
Speaker 1: I mean, no one in class is actually listening to you.

714
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:58,798
Speaker 1: They're either thinking about their own project, or they're imagining sexual things, or they're just asleep with their eyes open.

715
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried to pay attention to pretty much every lecture and presentation.

716
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,960
Speaker 1: I gave up right away, I realized I just couldn't.

717
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,119
Speaker 0: But I ended up only remembering and paying attention to the good ones, and the other ones, just whatever.

718
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,453
Speaker 0: Yeah.

719
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,439
Speaker 1: I actually hated watching the bad ones, because I'd cringe, it just felt so bad to watch someone floundering in front of a crowd of people.

720
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:21,960
Speaker 0: I also had the cringe effect going on real heavy.

721
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:30,520
Speaker 1: Or sometimes I had the asshole effect, where they'd always take questions at the end, and I'd pressure them about a point they weren't very clear on, and they obviously hadn't researched.

722
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,720
Speaker 0: I would pressure them, but only if they said something that was just flat out wrong.

723
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,800
Speaker 0: I wouldn't pressure them for being weak, just kind of going eh.

724
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,920
Speaker 0: I would hit them, though, if they said something that was wrong.

725
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,312
Speaker 0: They did something wrong.

726
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,319
Speaker 0: I'd be like, what you said was wrong.

727
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:47,339
Speaker 0: Here's my evidence.

728
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:48,719
Speaker 0: What do you say?

729
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:51,319
Speaker 0: We just copied this awful website.

730
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,999
Speaker 0: We didn't actually really research.

731
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:54,597
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

732
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:56,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got one kid.

733
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:05,360
Speaker 1: I mean, WEP is cracked now, but when I took this class, it was a networking class, an advanced wireless one, and WEP at that time was not cracked.

734
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,192
Speaker 1: No one can say it was cracked back then, because there was really no way to crack WEP back then.

735
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:12,080
Speaker 0: Brute force always worked.

736
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, brute force did, but even then, it took hours and hours and hours.

737
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,478
Speaker 0: Back in those days, yeah.

738
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was years ago.

739
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:24,620
Speaker 1: And this kid was doing a presentation on wireless security, and he was talking about how, yeah, WEP is totally insecure, and there are cracks out there.

740
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,300
Speaker 1: You can just crack it in, like, five minutes.

741
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,652
Speaker 1: And luckily, I didn't even have to raise my hand, because the entire class, including the professor right away, was like, uh, no?

742
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:36,719
Speaker 1: You got any evidence of that?

743
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:37,415
Speaker 1: I'd like to see it.

744
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,452
Speaker 1: Probably win some award.

745
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:40,940
Speaker 0: Oh, I wouldn't have won an award.

746
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,360
Speaker 0: I mean, he was right, you know, but I don't know where he got it from five years ago.

747
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,500
Speaker 1: Maybe it was, like-- I think he made it up, because I know that I made a lot of things up in presentations.

748
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:51,140
Speaker 0: No, I never made any things up.

749
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:57,058
Speaker 1: Not in tech presentations, like, not IT classes, but in my public speaking classes and my speech giving classes.

750
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,280
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, because then it's not about the information.

751
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:05,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, plus then, the people in those classes tended to be, like, freshmen in other softer majors who didn't know or care.

752
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never made anything up in a class.

753
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,739
Speaker 1: I made stuff up on the AP test, too, because I knew they couldn't read them.

754
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:17,399
Speaker 1: They only got 30 seconds to read your responses, so I made up books, and then I cited them.

755
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,656
Speaker 0: Way to go.

756
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,680
Speaker 1: And on the advice of my teacher, actually.

757
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,200
Speaker 0: Oh, pretty cool teacher.

758
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, our school has been accused more than once of cheating at the AP test, but they can't prove it.

759
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,499
Speaker 0: Maybe because they only spent 30 seconds reading it.

760
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,620
Speaker 0: And they looked at it for a minute.

761
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,431
Speaker 0: They'd be like, "Oh, they did

762
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:34,635
Speaker 0: cheat.".

763
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,759
Speaker 1: No, no, because what are they going to do?

764
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,320
Speaker 1: Go look up Theodore Stromwell's book, A History of British Politics?

765
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:46,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they'll find out it doesn't exist, and then they'll call you a cheater.

766
00:47:46,942 --> 00:47:48,619
Speaker 1: No, no, because they have to prove it doesn't exist.

767
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:53,838
Speaker 1: I'm sure in the time it would take them to find out that it didn't exist, I could whip up a copy of that book.

768
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,840
Speaker 0: What if the book doesn't exist?

769
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,840
Speaker 1: Actually, we did that in, god, this is back in high school.

770
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,760
Speaker 1: I think it was 11th grade.

771
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,239
Speaker 1: It wasn't me, but it was a friend of mine, and I helped him do it.

772
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,480
Speaker 1: He had to do a presentation on this obscure author, and there wasn't much information on the author online.

773
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,340
Speaker 1: There wasn't much information on many things online back then, compared to today.

774
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,480
Speaker 1: And the library at school had crap, so the guy just made it all up.

775
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:19,699
Speaker 1: And he cited some website.

776
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,209
Speaker 1: And then at the end of class, the teacher calls him over and asks him, "Hey, I tried to go to that website you linked to, and the link's

777
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:27,430
Speaker 1: dead.".

778
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:30,839
Speaker 1: So he said, "Oh, I must have given you the wrong link.

779
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:33,375
Speaker 1: Let me go home, and I'll email you the right

780
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:33,617
Speaker 1: link.".

781
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:40,680
Speaker 1: And he went home, and he grabbed me, and I made him a page with all the fake info on it, and I put it up on GeoCities, and then he gave the teacher the link.

782
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,559
Speaker 0: That's pretty awesome.

783
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,754
Speaker 1: This was back before teachers really knew what that internet thing was, or how to use it.

784
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:49,400
Speaker 0: If you did that today, you would be so screwed.

785
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, but back then?

786
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:55,420
Speaker 0: All right, so other ways not to suck at college.

787
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,279
Speaker 1: Go outside, have friends.

788
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,899
Speaker 0: Going outside to having friends is very key.

789
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,860
Speaker 0: If you just think that friends are going to come along, that's not going to work.

790
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,760
Speaker 0: You need to go and find like-minded people and talk to them.

791
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,135
Speaker 0: Yes.

792
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,660
Speaker 0: And don't try to do it with a frat or some other kind of "pay to have friends" group.

793
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,699
Speaker 0: You have to find some genuine friends, or else, you know, after college you're just never going to see these people again.

794
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,600
Speaker 0: They won't be real friends.

796
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,760
Speaker 0: They're just like, it's like prostitute friends almost.

797
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,280
Speaker 1: And there's nothing wrong with drinking in college, but don't be that guy.

798
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:31,419
Speaker 1: You know him.

799
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:32,440
Speaker 1: He's half naked.

800
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,460
Speaker 1: He's got one of those red plastic cups full of beer that he spilled all over, and he's running around outside your dormitory.

801
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:37,964
Speaker 1: I'm going,

802
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:38,369
Speaker 1: "Whoo!".

803
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't be that guy.

804
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,659
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like, sure, everyone at college does it, whatever, but actually not so many- It's just that guy who does it.

805
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just no one realizes it.

806
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,080
Speaker 0: And it just stands out so much that you think it's so in, but no.

807
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,172
Speaker 1: Nah, nah.

808
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,439
Speaker 1: Most people who drink in college aren't that guy.

809
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:09,840
Speaker 1: I've noticed, though, all the people who drink too much and cause trouble with alcohol in college are the ones who had never had alcohol before college, and then they just go crazy.

810
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:14,499
Speaker 0: Or the people where their parents just didn't let them do anything, and now they're at college, they let loose.

811
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,415
Speaker 0: I mean, when I was a little kid, my mom wouldn't let me eat the peanut butter or the butter out of the-.

812
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,140
Speaker 1: Oh, if you got a hold of that peanut butter?

813
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would have just eaten it all right out of the freaking jar, right?

814
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,378
Speaker 0: But I said, "Man, as soon as I'm out of here, I'm going to eat a whole jar of peanut

815
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:28,619
Speaker 0: butter.".

816
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,376
Speaker 0: But by the time I was out of there, I was so smart, I knew that eating the jar of peanut butter was a bad idea.

817
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,037
Speaker 0: You know?

818
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,960
Speaker 0: But it's like, these kids were like, "As soon as I'm out of here, I'm going to drink myself

819
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:38,358
Speaker 0: stupid.".

820
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,600
Speaker 0: And then as soon as they got out of there, they drank themselves stupid.

821
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,271
Speaker 1: Yup.

822
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,639
Speaker 0: Well, I think they were stupid before, that's why they drank so much.

823
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:50,049
Speaker 1: Ask girls out.

824
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:51,870
Speaker 0: Asking girls out is good.

825
00:50:52,250 --> 00:51:02,470
Speaker 1: Because all I'll really say about that is that most people... Well, I guess to put it very bluntly, girls like boys just as much as boys like girls.

826
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:09,228
Speaker 0: And when you're out of college, it's a lot harder to find girls that are your age to ask out.

827
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:13,070
Speaker 0: And a lot harder to find situations in which asking them out is appropriate.

828
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed you're having some trouble on that front.

829
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,709
Speaker 0: I'm not really looking too hard, but, you know.

830
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

831
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:20,134
Speaker 0: Mr.

832
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:21,127
Speaker 0: Penis is always on.

833
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:24,150
Speaker 0: And he retires.

834
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:29,769
Speaker 1: Well, in general, not just girls, it's hard to meet people when you're out of college who are like-minded.

835
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:30,683
Speaker 0: Yeah.

836
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,049
Speaker 1: I mean, in college, you go to the gaming club and there's a million geeks playing games and you make friends for life.

837
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,470
Speaker 1: You go to the anime club and there's a million geeks watching anime and you make friends for life.

838
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:44,529
Speaker 1: It's a geek college, but even if you're not a geek, if you go to- You join the theater group and you meet a bunch of theater-type people and they're friends for life.

839
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,944
Speaker 1: Yeah.

840
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:51,150
Speaker 0: Even if you're at like some normal state school, you know, some sport you play, or even an intramural sport.

841
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,370
Speaker 0: I mean, my brother does intramural dodgeball and he met a bunch of people there.

842
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:54,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

843
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,050
Speaker 0: You know, kind of random, but it works.

844
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:05,229
Speaker 1: Because really, once you get out of college, it's hard to meet new people and a lot of the people you meet are not as cool as you would like them to be.

845
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:08,850
Speaker 0: Mostly because they've been out of college and they haven't been doing cool stuff.

846
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,410
Speaker 1: A lot of people leave college and they give up and they become uncool.

847
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,360
Speaker 1: And we'll probably have another.

848
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:15,750
Speaker 1: how not to suck about that.

849
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,850
Speaker 0: How to not suck after college?

850
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:18,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

851
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:19,463
Speaker 0: Yeah.

852
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,410
Speaker 0: An important thing to do in college is always to not suck with money.

853
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:32,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a- God, we have a friend of ours, someone we know- Named you who got his car repo'd.

854
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:39,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was more because the money stopped coming in from sources that I was expecting it to come in from for a long time.

855
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:40,688
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

856
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:54,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we had a friend who didn't have any money and then he got some money from a student loan and instead of buying, you know, food or books, brought a drum set.

857
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:55,690
Speaker 0: Real useful.

858
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,569
Speaker 0: Does he- did he at least play the drums?

859
00:52:58,314 --> 00:52:59,289
Speaker 1: As far as I heard, no.

860
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, just wasting money.

861
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,810
Speaker 0: Trying to buy a little social currency and then not spending the social currency.

862
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:09,590
Speaker 0: I'll convert my real currency to social currency, which I will not spend.

863
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,389
Speaker 1: See, at least we had another friend who had the projector in his apartment as social currency, but that was not the only currency he had.

864
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,630
Speaker 0: No, it was not the only currency he had.

865
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,090
Speaker 0: And also he had the money to buy the projector.

866
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,569
Speaker 1: Yes, and also buy food.

867
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:28,929
Speaker 0: And not only was the projector great social currency, but, you know, it also was very entertaining.

868
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:29,789
Speaker 1: Yeah.

869
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:36,570
Speaker 0: Like, for real, not just like, you know, something to show, like, come look at my thing and then you start a conversation and then you're done.

870
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,650
Speaker 0: It's, hey, keep coming to my house because I have the thing.

871
00:53:40,077 --> 00:53:40,310
Speaker 1: Yeah.

872
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:45,350
Speaker 1: In fact, after- because our house was kind of the hangout place just because we were the ones that had the most furniture.

873
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:53,570
Speaker 1: And then when we left, his house became the hangout place and then he left and now it's all in the air because we're the old men who don't go there anymore.

874
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:56,070
Speaker 0: Don't be old men.

875
00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:56,627
Speaker 0: Oh, wait.

876
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,028
Speaker 1: Don't get old.

877
00:53:59,036 --> 00:53:59,648
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

878
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:06,669
Speaker 0: Another important thing to do in college is keep track of what's going on.

879
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:14,929
Speaker 0: If you're not on tap to the events happening in the school and the news in the school and the news in the world, a lot of things are going to pass you by.

880
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:15,984
Speaker 0: Yeah.

881
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,427
Speaker 0: I mean, there are funny things happening and awesome things happening at colleges more than anywhere else.

882
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:27,727
Speaker 0: And if you don't try to find them, you're just going to miss all of them and it's going to suck.

883
00:54:28,753 --> 00:54:38,463
Speaker 1: I mean, all these cool things you learn by finding out like the secret passages because there were secret passages at RIT and we found them because we met people who knew about them.

884
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:45,748
Speaker 1: Or like the cool hidden club that meets after hours somewhere or the freaking dodgeball club that just plays dodgeball every day.

885
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:54,310
Speaker 0: I mean, but it's even other stuff like we saw that we- the thing of the day a while ago was the video of like Pac-Man running into a chemistry lab.

886
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:01,970
Speaker 0: You know, if you can keep track of stuff like that, then you can go around and see those sorts of funny things happening at your school all the time.

887
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:04,089
Speaker 1: Or take one step further and be that guy.

888
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can be that guy.

889
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,209
Speaker 0: That's even better.

890
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,169
Speaker 1: We were several times close to that guy.

891
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:09,665
Speaker 0: Yep.

892
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:15,390
Speaker 0: But if you hide in the dorm all day, just minding your own business, doing your homework, you'll never see those things.

893
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,050
Speaker 0: And college will be a lot less fun than it is because the fun will be behind wall.

894
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,270
Speaker 0: But it'll be you and a wall in between you and the fun.

895
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:22,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

896
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:23,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

897
00:55:23,913 --> 00:55:28,149
Speaker 0: There's a wall between you and the fun, and if you don't peek around the wall, you're gonna have a lot less fun.

898
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:32,869
Speaker 1: Like, if you're into German board games and you play with your four friends in your dorm every night, that's fun.

899
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:39,230
Speaker 1: But if you're just gonna play the board game anyway, go play it in the middle of some building somewhere on campus.

900
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,010
Speaker 1: And you'll have a million people walk by and, "What's that?

901
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:41,175
Speaker 1: Ooh!".

902
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,610
Speaker 1: And then you'll meet more people.

903
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:43,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

904
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,330
Speaker 0: Add, you know, get your social currency's worth out of your board game.

905
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,786
Speaker 0: And at the same time, something cool might happen there.

906
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:49,270
Speaker 0: that you'll see.

907
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:49,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

908
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,730
Speaker 1: That's how we met a lot of our friends, by indulging in our geekeries publicly.

909
00:55:54,310 --> 00:56:00,390
Speaker 1: And other people who had interest in those geekeries came to see what all the hubbub was and joined our little rolling katamari of geek culture.

910
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:14,090
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

911
