1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,767
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 5th.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,072
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,782
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights Tonight.

4
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:17,148
Speaker 1: we're finally doing it.

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,779
Speaker 1: We're showing you all our pokemons.

6
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:24,247
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:34,408
Speaker 0: So we know a lot of you went to listen to geek nights in the wee hours of this morning and ended up hearing some techno instead.

8
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,909
Speaker 1: Well, that's what happens with.

9
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:48,005
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's primarily WordPress's fault, but it's also A lack of a feature in feedburner that many people would like that they do not have.

10
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,812
Speaker 1: but I could understand why they don't have It.

11
00:00:50,378 --> 00:01:01,166
Speaker 1: but yeah, basically Rim's thing of the day was a couple of mp3s and he linked Directly to those mp3s instead of linking to a web page that then linked to the mp3s.

12
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:03,999
Speaker 0: now part of the reason I did That was because I was lazy.

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,930
Speaker 0: I had him ready to go in my delicious.

14
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:10,383
Speaker 0: It was late and due to an unrelated issue where Rezone works now.

15
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:11,647
Speaker 0: We got Jacko and everything's great.

16
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:18,838
Speaker 0: But uh, little problem now with audacity in feisty and I can't use it currently.

17
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:23,217
Speaker 0: So I had to edit the show kind of Sloppily last night and it was late.

18
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:24,582
Speaker 0: So I was like that fuck it link link.

19
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,770
Speaker 0: I saw the feed appear and I went to bed.

20
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:38,765
Speaker 1: Yep but basically WordPress will look and if you link to an mp3 or a video or any other sort of media file in your blog post WordPress will try to see if that media file is out there and it checks it.

21
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:45,609
Speaker 1: and if it's out there Then it will add a link to it in the enclosures in the feed and feed burna will preserve those enclosures.

22
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:49,058
Speaker 1: thus That's how we get the podcast feed to work.

23
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,330
Speaker 1: We put a link to the mp3 of the yik nights episode in the blog post.

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,455
Speaker 1: That's the word geek nights.

25
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:58,250
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't realize the word geek nights is a link that links to the episode.

26
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:58,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

27
00:01:59,105 --> 00:01:59,390
Speaker 0: You know what?

28
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:03,615
Speaker 0: There's also a link on Mp3 download.

29
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:07,030
Speaker 0: we still get people asking how to download old episodes.

30
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,610
Speaker 1: Some of the old episodes don't have the mp3 download link and people don't realize they can click on the word geek nights.

31
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:13,734
Speaker 0: Well, they could also.

32
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:21,950
Speaker 0: I would assume if they're going through the archives you could figure out at some point even I mean It's a small number of episodes that don't have that link and I'll fix them whenever I get around to it.

33
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,530
Speaker 1: I'm gonna probably have to redo a whole bunch of the database when I update the website.

34
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,650
Speaker 0: Anyway, consider that a small test of your problem-solving skills.

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:38,406
Speaker 0: Let's see so far and you're listening every episode of this podcast ever has had a very consistent Filename convention based on the date.

36
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,110
Speaker 0: It was published.

37
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,490
Speaker 1: I wonder if I can guess the URL of the episode by looking at the title.

38
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:49,852
Speaker 0: We uploaded last year before we went to Otacon in the week of awesome a week and a half's worth of shows Before we

39
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:50,173
Speaker 1: left

40
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:54,366
Speaker 0: and then we set WordPress up to automatically post him every night while we were gone

41
00:02:54,667 --> 00:03:01,980
Speaker 1: and nobody Downloaded the episodes before they were available Even though it was obvious what the file names were

42
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,705
Speaker 0: and we it was obvious.

43
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,830
Speaker 0: We were out of town and yeah Yeah.

44
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,112
Speaker 1: so anyway we had.

45
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:15,130
Speaker 1: we linked to three mp3s in the blog post thus making three enclosures and That kind of screwed things up for some people depending on their feed readers.

46
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, iTunes did some people down to know what to do at all.

47
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, some people downloaded rims thing of the day instead of the episode.

48
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:27,329
Speaker 0: So if you heard of some pretty nice techno, well, uh, you can listen to the actual show.

49
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,755
Speaker 0: now It's up and working.

50
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,629
Speaker 1: Yes, and if you're having trouble just go to the front row crew.

51
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,504
Speaker 0: calm Yeah, I'd listen to that show if I were you though.

52
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,430
Speaker 0: the techno is pretty good.

53
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,219
Speaker 0: You might want to hear what that techno was.

54
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good you listen to the thing of the day, too.

55
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:39,942
Speaker 1: Don't skip on that.

56
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:57,030
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so this isn't really new news but I'd forgotten about this entirely and then there was some article on dig about it and Suddenly a flood of all these I wouldn't say bad but definitely tainted memories came to light in my brain.

57
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:08,210
Speaker 0: You see in 2002 a company Nominally called phantom Entertainment announced that they were going to make something called the phantom gaming console.

58
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:17,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the idea of the phantom gaming console was an idea that sounds good on paper But if you know anything about technology you realize is basically stupid and impossible.

59
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,260
Speaker 1: The idea was you would get PC games.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,895
Speaker 1: just buy any old PC game by half-life 2 by Quake 3 by whatever.

61
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:30,250
Speaker 1: put it in the phantom game console and it will install and play just five.

62
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,142
Speaker 0: Remember there was no steam back then.

63
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:32,705
Speaker 0: Yep.

64
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:33,410
Speaker 1: There was no nothing.

65
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:41,930
Speaker 1: it was so that was a pretty good idea in 2002 when a lot of people had out because Basically the one of the big problems of PC gaming is that it's hard.

66
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,766
Speaker 1: You got to set up a PC and you got to set up a gamer PC.

67
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:46,629
Speaker 1: Not just normal PC.

68
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,502
Speaker 1: You got to install the games.

69
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:51,001
Speaker 1: You got a tweak You got to do all sorts of shit.

70
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:56,828
Speaker 1: the phantom game console The idea was good can remove all that and PC game be as easy as console gaming.

71
00:04:56,868 --> 00:05:06,108
Speaker 0: and hooray So, yeah, the idea the base idea was good, but then all the smart people in the world asked this company So, uh, how are you gonna do this?

72
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:11,450
Speaker 0: And they didn't really say much because it's not really possible.

73
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:30,750
Speaker 0: and the years went by and the years went by and they kept running out of money and then either selling more stock or Paying off their debt with stock in their phantom company Or getting more investors or venture capitalists to give them money in return for style.

74
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,018
Speaker 1: No, I people gave them money because people didn't know.

75
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,610
Speaker 0: no one knew except well everyone on the internet every gamer.

76
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:39,333
Speaker 0: You know what?

77
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:43,107
Speaker 0: I start to think because this is multiple penny arcade comics about this.

78
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:43,890
Speaker 1: How could you not know?

79
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,884
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't penny arcade guys talk to this dude.

80
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:47,970
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

81
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:56,950
Speaker 0: I remember some instance where they talked to him where he Basically made light of the fact that they were making fun of him and tried to act like he didn't care.

82
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:01,966
Speaker 0: I don't think he does care because I do point out that it was called the Phantom console.

83
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,583
Speaker 0: I Am of the mind that this was a calculated grift.

84
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:09,475
Speaker 1: Yeah from the beginning I don't know.

85
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,890
Speaker 1: In fact, I would think it's worth coincidental irony.

86
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:26,756
Speaker 0: I would put forth the idea that not only is this a grift but it was such a Cocksure grip that it's basically like a panhandler coming up to you and saying I'm gonna swindle you out of five bucks and still succeeding

87
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,917
Speaker 1: and then buy alcohol As much alcohol as I can get.

88
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,289
Speaker 0: hey at least that one homeless guy showed us the alcohol he bought and offered us some.

89
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,010
Speaker 0: yeah The Phantom console saga didn't end there.

90
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,979
Speaker 1: No, the company actually changed their plans and came out with what I consider Something I might actually buy.

91
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, they they had this idea suddenly.

92
00:06:50,689 --> 00:07:02,290
Speaker 0: now My best guess is that they only came up with this idea in order to get some press releases and some coverage at e3 In order to trick more venture capitalists into dumping money into their phantom business.

93
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:03,856
Speaker 1: This is also a good idea.

94
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:15,010
Speaker 1: Basically if you're gonna have a PC game console in the living room You're gonna need a keyboard in the living room And as we all know keyboards in the living room kind of suck because you don't you're not sitting at a desk.

95
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:21,950
Speaker 1: So they came up with this sort of invention and it's a keyboard that sort of folds and goes on your lap.

96
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,384
Speaker 1: It's like a lap keyboard a keyboard designed for the lap.

97
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:29,200
Speaker 1: and well, I see it I see many pictures of it and I've never tried it.

98
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:31,590
Speaker 1: There's probably only like two of them in existence.

99
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:41,490
Speaker 0: Well, if you wonder how many are in existence I point out that you can just go to the Phantom store and order one and I dare any of you to try and order.

100
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,423
Speaker 1: I did try to order one and it was quite humorous experience.

101
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:46,848
Speaker 0: Yes, I expected.

102
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:48,956
Speaker 0: well It was I didn't get what I expected.

103
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:50,280
Speaker 0: what I got made me laugh a little.

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:57,407
Speaker 1: Yes, but yet I mean a Keyboard that is comfortable in living room is a good product that I'm willing to pay for.

105
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:58,532
Speaker 1: cuz right now I have that.

106
00:07:58,693 --> 00:07:59,355
Speaker 1: that's a problem.

107
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:00,058
Speaker 1: I need saw.

108
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:01,805
Speaker 0: it would be great with that video rocker.

109
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:06,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, but The Phantom people are just providing a phantom.

110
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:11,463
Speaker 0: Oh my god I'm looking at the Wikipedia here and I didn't realize this.

111
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:17,261
Speaker 0: but here are according to Wikipedia The specs of the Phantom console as of May 2004.

112
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,223
Speaker 0: All right.

113
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:22,934
Speaker 0: All right an AMD Athlon XP 2500.

114
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,626
Speaker 1: that's what I have in my computer the same exact chip.

115
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:26,409
Speaker 0: What the hell?

116
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,873
Speaker 0: GeForce FX 5700?

117
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,022
Speaker 1: I have a 5900 in my computer.

118
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:32,604
Speaker 0: All right.

119
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:36,796
Speaker 0: Now here's the fun part 256 megabytes of RAM.

120
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:37,961
Speaker 1: I've got twice as much.

121
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:41,692
Speaker 0: I've got a lot more than twice You've got.

122
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:42,053
Speaker 1: let's see.

123
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,839
Speaker 1: Let's see the eight times as much.

124
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:44,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I almost bought four gigs.

126
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:47,190
Speaker 1: That's too much.

127
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,156
Speaker 0: Yeah I think three is as much as I can.

128
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:54,298
Speaker 1: when you do four gigs you start needs doing funny stuff to the kernel and you Need to start doing 64-bit action.

129
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:58,743
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I ever run out of if I ever need more RAM I'm just gonna put another 500 or gig in there.

130
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:08,013
Speaker 1: I am considering buying two gigs of RAM for my computer and an 80 gigabyte quote content cache Uh-huh.

131
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,699
Speaker 1: So I guess that's a hard drive.

132
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that is a flash drive or something.

133
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:12,348
Speaker 0: 80 gigs.

134
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that could be enough.

135
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:21,910
Speaker 1: I don't know really but yeah Phantom game console never gonna come out like Duke Nukem forever might actually come out one day.

136
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:34,204
Speaker 1: Yeah along with some lasers - yes and the length of time that it is taken for the Phantom to come out is not really funny or meaningful because Duke Nukem forever and Team Fortress 2 have been coming for like at least five years.

137
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:34,565
Speaker 1: to me

138
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:54,760
Speaker 0: the Phantom's funny because Outside of the internet where everyone already knew it was never gonna happen in the real world where people with real money You know push that money around and have go to big fancy business meetings no one realized what was going on and people poured money into this thing and Industry people actually thought this was gonna come out.

139
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, they sure did.

140
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,976
Speaker 0: I mean investors Invested in this

141
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,709
Speaker 1: because people if you're

142
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,514
Speaker 0: Invested in the end game

143
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,526
Speaker 1: go to these like presentations or people show off their stuff

144
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,490
Speaker 0: or the Gizmondo

145
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:15,540
Speaker 1: and they try to convince you to invest in them and it's a guy trying to sell to a room full of investors and You basically the product doesn't exist yet.

146
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,930
Speaker 1: because until you invest the product will not exist.

147
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:29,250
Speaker 1: So you kind of have to go solely on what the people are selling you and if you're a good enough Salesman, you can get people to buy into frickin You know infinite energy devices and shit.

148
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:36,390
Speaker 1: I mean one guy made a lot of money trying to sell people this magic black box that made DSL ten times faster.

149
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever happened to that guy.

150
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:43,631
Speaker 1: Yeah And a lot of these people should end up in jail, but they don't Whatever.

151
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phantom game console never gonna happen.

152
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,046
Speaker 0: I just I was reminded of it.

153
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:52,070
Speaker 0: I'd forgotten it existed Yeah, and I remember when the lap board appeared.

154
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:58,790
Speaker 0: I was very cynical But I don't think it was Scott but someone in our group said something along the lines of why are you so down on that?

155
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,277
Speaker 0: Look, they've got a picture of it.

156
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:02,530
Speaker 0: It's actually gonna come out and it's really cool.

157
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,554
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna buy one.

158
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:07,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I guess I forgot to check up, but I don't know.

159
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,150
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

160
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,129
Speaker 1: I don't know if I would have said something that positive.

161
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I I totally forgot to check up.

162
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:17,641
Speaker 0: but if that ever came out So whoever it was who said they were gonna buy one.

163
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:18,906
Speaker 0: I'm still waiting.

164
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:24,390
Speaker 1: Yeah I do kind of want some sort of lap board, you know, we could just make one.

165
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:33,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, we probably could let some metal and a keyboard We should make like a little tiny like thing that like a table that sits over the video rocker Like.

166
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,490
Speaker 0: actually, you know what I do that works really well.

167
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,344
Speaker 0: I just put a big fluffy pillow in my lap and I put whatever I'm working on on the pillow.

168
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's alright works Great.

169
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:41,834
Speaker 1: It's okay.

170
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,742
Speaker 0: It's not like the keyboards gonna overheat.

171
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:45,650
Speaker 1: Alright, so I got some news.

172
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:47,420
Speaker 1: My news is three.

173
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,029
Speaker 1: pac-man news is your own.

174
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:59,622
Speaker 0: Wow, imagine going back to people when pac-man came out and telling them that in the year 2007 there would be three semi-simultaneous pac-man bits of news.

175
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:00,103
Speaker 1: Yeah.

176
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:04,076
Speaker 1: Well, here's all the pac-man news is actually I'm not sure if it's.

177
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:12,110
Speaker 1: if I'm it might be the Like the anniversary of pac-man, but I'm not sure way to have your research.

178
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,985
Speaker 0: I got all the other news captain Scott of the US anyway anyway.

179
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:27,367
Speaker 1: First of all, they had a pac-man tournament in the city today right in New York City and Billy Mitchell is the first guy ever to get a perfect score on pac-man.

180
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:38,034
Speaker 1: in 1999 He beat pac-man so perfectly that the score rolled over and the game froze up and it was over and he is considered the pac-man King today.

181
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:43,655
Speaker 1: he came in to play some pac-man of course because it's a pac-man tournament that this big He's got to play.

182
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,837
Speaker 1: but he said him I quote I told you I was gonna get whipped.

183
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,323
Speaker 1: Mitchell said with a laugh.

184
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:57,827
Speaker 1: in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon They sprung a surprise on us by releasing a brand new version of pac-man the first new version in 26 years.

185
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:01,939
Speaker 0: Huh that tells me that while this kid was really good.

186
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,691
Speaker 0: He had obviously memorized patterns in the original pac-man I see.

187
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:11,470
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah could not much like the people who can perfect double awesome some DDR song.

188
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,450
Speaker 0: They played a million times but give them something on trick that they've never seen before and they fail.

189
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:33,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Carlos Romero a 27 year old gamer from Mexico won the the pac-man tournament good for him and they gave him a pac-man themed Xbox 360 designed an autograph by Toru Iwatani the guy who invented pac-man in 1980, so it's the 27th anniversary of pac-man.

190
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,384
Speaker 1: All right.

191
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:47,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, and They also today that the reason they were doing this is because they've released a new game for the Xbox 360 on the live arcade called pac-man champion world championship edition or championship edition or something like that.

192
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:57,890
Speaker 1: It's basically pac-man with like widescreen mode and HD and new maps and smarter ghosts I assume and a worldwide leaderboard.

193
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,810
Speaker 1: So if you play this pac-man you're playing for the high score of everyone at Xbox Live.

194
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,764
Speaker 0: I gotta say the Xbox is looking more and more attractive every day.

195
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's it's not bad.

196
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:21,640
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't have an Xbox honestly, the reason I would have bought one months ago is because I already have every minute of every day filled up with entertainment and The DS and the Wii.

197
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,794
Speaker 1: anytime I want to play video games There's always some.

198
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,543
Speaker 1: there's enough DS and Wii to keep me sated.

199
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:37,046
Speaker 1: if there was even a minute during the day Where I wanted video game and there wasn't video game available I would get either a new PC or a 360 so fast.

200
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,130
Speaker 0: See I got a problem.

201
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,452
Speaker 0: I was in the same boat.

202
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:40,193
Speaker 0: Now.

203
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:51,770
Speaker 0: I have a gaming PC again a wicked gaming PC and I keep rebooting into Windows by accident and then accidentally clicking on steam and then accidentally playing counter-strike for three hours.

204
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:58,591
Speaker 1: I can't really blame you because you know, you just had a general gaming trout and also you never played half-life 2.

205
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:00,264
Speaker 0: So but I still haven't played half-life 2.

206
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,933
Speaker 0: I'm you will I'm.

207
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,990
Speaker 0: counter-strike alone would probably keep me going for another couple years even with the ads.

208
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:08,093
Speaker 0: You know what?

209
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,899
Speaker 0: I just avoid those maps.

210
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,561
Speaker 1: I know.

211
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,470
Speaker 0: All right, but the most popular maps in the game.

212
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,452
Speaker 1: So there was a pac-man tournament and they released a new awesome pac-man for the 360.

213
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,836
Speaker 0: So what could be your third news?

214
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:21,622
Speaker 0: What else could have happened in the pac-man world?

215
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,010
Speaker 1: the guy who made pac-man toru?

216
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,731
Speaker 1: Iwatani right who designed and autographed that special Xbox 360 and invented pac-man in 1980.

217
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,394
Speaker 1: He retired.

218
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:33,443
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm glad you didn't say died.

219
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,547
Speaker 1: No, that's it.

220
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,150
Speaker 1: He retired.

221
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:40,060
Speaker 1: He made this one last pac-man After his whole career and now he's done.

222
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,870
Speaker 0: I think that means this is going to be the definitive pac-man.

223
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,093
Speaker 1: I think I'm.

224
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:53,458
Speaker 1: I'm here by stating pac-man championship edition for the Xbox 360 is the definitive pac-man I will say because I mean the original pac-man.

225
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:01,642
Speaker 1: sure you could say this the definitive pac-man or miss pac-man is the definitive but Those games are not perfect and you can just master them and it's sort of like.

226
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:07,353
Speaker 1: it's not really a measure of pac-maning skill In the way that you know Ikaruga is.

227
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:15,370
Speaker 1: a is a test of your memorizing skill rather than your space shooter skill And I think this is the game that tests your pac-man skill.

228
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:24,500
Speaker 1: so this is why I call it the definitive pac-man for the for purposes of playing to see who's better and That is a whole lot of news about pac-man.

229
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:24,942
Speaker 1: Yep.

230
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:28,495
Speaker 0: I will say though that I always Generally preferred miss pac-man.

231
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:31,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just kind of like.

232
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:36,969
Speaker 1: I didn't really like pac-man that much when I was younger But now I really like that actually like the ghosts a lot.

233
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:42,310
Speaker 0: Well, I think my issue was just that most arcades I went to had a miss pac-man machine, but not a pac-man machine.

234
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:45,730
Speaker 1: Yes, anything is I would go to arcades that never play pac-man in the arcade.

235
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:46,214
Speaker 1: I would.

236
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,202
Speaker 1: that was like a waste.

237
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:50,590
Speaker 0: see cuz I Didn't realize the treasure trove where I live.

238
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:56,210
Speaker 0: I've read Gallagher when I was a kid the one arcade in the area which was in the mall in what was you what?

239
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,975
Speaker 0: Used to be a water slide.

240
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,530
Speaker 0: They had turned that whole water park that was inside the mall into an arcade.

241
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,489
Speaker 0: So it was a kind of a cool layout with arcade games like all in these balconies all over the place.

242
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:21,230
Speaker 0: And uh, they had like the new game section and then up in the balconies They had the old game section and those old games were awesome And they were also all on sale all the time and the prices weren't that bad.

243
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,608
Speaker 0: But my parents would never buy one and I didn't have any money.

244
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,925
Speaker 0: Yeah now I would buy all of them for the prices.

245
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:27,750
Speaker 0: They were up for back.

246
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, nowadays like I would I really want to buy that.

247
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:32,494
Speaker 1: What is?

248
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:34,965
Speaker 1: it's like the half Galaga half miss pac-man machine.

249
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:41,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like perfect, but the machines like over 10th that I could buy a car instead of that machine.

250
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,558
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, at least for a new one.

251
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,166
Speaker 0: I mean, I want a DDR machine.

252
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:44,850
Speaker 0: really badly.

253
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,169
Speaker 1: They also have that like centipede missile command like millipede machine or whatever it is.

254
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,410
Speaker 1: It's a really good machine too, but that's also a shit ton of money.

255
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:59,950
Speaker 0: Actually, if I could have any one arcade machine DDR wall DDR would very easily be at the top of that list.

256
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,013
Speaker 0: I think it's number two.

257
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:03,198
Speaker 1: You can get police 9-1-1 ramparts.

258
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,220
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

259
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,927
Speaker 1: Rampart arcade machine and not initial D.

260
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,309
Speaker 0: Ah That that's out there.

261
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,601
Speaker 0: But initial D would eventually get old because I'd master it see.

262
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:19,390
Speaker 1: what I would like to own is some sort of machine I would I wouldn't do I wouldn't go with any one time crisis game.

263
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:31,157
Speaker 1: But if there was some machine because the time crisis always had the same gun If there was some sort of all time crisis machine that had every existing time crisis and could upgrade to newer time Crises I would go with that.

264
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,668
Speaker 0: so you can kind of do that in DDR kind of.

265
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,830
Speaker 0: I mean There's some old forth mix machines that have made their way.

266
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,146
Speaker 1: I mean, I want to like turn the machine on and it'll say what time crisis.

267
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:41,975
Speaker 1: one, two, three four And I shoot the game.

268
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,639
Speaker 1: I want to play.

269
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,630
Speaker 1: that's what I want, huh?

270
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,209
Speaker 0: You know, I don't think there's a market for that because people just use their video games.

271
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,732
Speaker 1: I know I know their consoles their computers.

272
00:18:51,172 --> 00:19:00,020
Speaker 0: Yep things of the day.

273
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:14,532
Speaker 0: So if the Internet as a collective whole in the year, I don't know 2001 had a flag if it were a nation in the United Nations What would the Internet's flag from 2001 be?

274
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,520
Speaker 1: Scott the Internet's flag?

275
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:20,744
Speaker 1: Goat see?

276
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,155
Speaker 0: maybe I don't think it could be anything but goat see.

277
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:27,899
Speaker 0: I think goat see Impitimized everything that was the internet back then.

278
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:35,050
Speaker 0: I mean we could have ever done a show on goat see like the history and What we really do a whole show.

279
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,216
Speaker 0: I think we could.

280
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:37,080
Speaker 1: that's a bit much.

281
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:43,239
Speaker 0: Well, if we you know goat see as an idea as opposed to specifically how that guy did that which I don't want to get in.

282
00:19:45,961 --> 00:20:05,920
Speaker 0: No, well goat see is very much at least an icon of the last generation of the Internet and It's kind of lived on to this day as the symbol that is understood by people who are around during that day And most people on the internet who are hip have at some point run into this horrible horrible horrible thing

283
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:08,650
Speaker 1: Yep, or tub girl or any of its associates.

284
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean goat see was like the real one everything else.

285
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:18,715
Speaker 0: There's a lot of sick things on the internet, but goatee was the one that kind of Transcended just being a sick thing and became a cultural icon.

286
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:33,100
Speaker 0: It's legendary and One of the greatest pastimes and hobbies of people from our generation of the Internet is to trick people Who do not know about goat see into either seeing it or more importantly?

287
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,974
Speaker 0: unwittingly showing it to others on mainstream media.

288
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:45,972
Speaker 1: my favorite was when that guy had a flicker gallery where he took pictures of People as the people were seeing go see for the first time in their lives.

289
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:54,240
Speaker 0: the best one was he got Ron Jeremy Yeah, and the first picture is Ron Jeremy looking at it real close with this quizzical look of what is that?

290
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,815
Speaker 0: And the second was a look of utter horror and disgust from Ron Jeremy people.

291
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:05,333
Speaker 0: yes Actually from what I hear Ron Jeremy is a pretty funny cool guy and he seems alright.

292
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean for for what it's worth.

293
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:14,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway You can't just show goat see because if you see goat see even what if you don't realize what it is right away.

294
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:22,767
Speaker 0: You know that it's something horrible, and it's obvious you can't trick CNN into showing just straight-up goat See on TV.

295
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, CNN check out this picture.

296
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:26,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about it?

297
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,112
Speaker 1: It was disgusting.

298
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:29,459
Speaker 1: Can you show it on TV?

299
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:37,100
Speaker 0: No, so the hobby here the game is that you make arts or things that?

300
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 0: To someone who is aware of goat see they will look at it and think wow That looks a lot like goat see.

301
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:50,088
Speaker 1: usually it involves a circle with a hand on either side of the circle And that's how you can tell it when it's a goat see.

302
00:21:50,329 --> 00:22:04,579
Speaker 1: and a lot of times it started out where people were noticing unintentional goat sees out in the wild like they would see a sign for like a Bagel shop, and it looked like goat see the way it was drawn, and then you go oMG a goat see.

303
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:15,029
Speaker 0: So now this has kind of become an internet sport and my thing of the day is a video That was broadcast Worldwide I believe worldwide or at least in London.

304
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:21,088
Speaker 0: the BBC showed a thing about the Olympics 2012 and the logo for it.

305
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:24,820
Speaker 0: now people don't like the logo and a lot of people had submitted alternate logos.

306
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:33,373
Speaker 0: now they showed a couple of these alternate logos and one of them is Very very clearly goat see.

307
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:42,680
Speaker 0: there is no way Anyone hip to the internet who knows what goat see is could deny that this was intended to be an homage to goat see.

308
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:45,365
Speaker 1: and it is indeed an homage to goat see.

309
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:53,435
Speaker 0: so this was broadcast on TV and What I'd like to point out is that notice that the mainstream media had no idea.

310
00:22:53,897 --> 00:23:02,705
Speaker 0: the internet basically It has this level of culture where our icons are completely Unknown to the mainstream media.

311
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:06,675
Speaker 0: that reporter and all those people involved in that network didn't know.

312
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:08,178
Speaker 0: they probably still don't know.

313
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,680
Speaker 0: the wool Was pulled completely over their eyes.

314
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:20,916
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if you go to a foreign country right and you go up to someone you just say Fuck you your mother's a whore, and then the guy says in whatever language their native languages.

315
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:22,360
Speaker 1: It's like your translator friend.

316
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,283
Speaker 1: What did he say?

317
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:25,169
Speaker 1: and he said he loves your mother?

318
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,252
Speaker 1: She's a wonderful woman.

319
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,720
Speaker 1: You know and he goes oh, that's wonderful.

320
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of like a Masonic handshake.

321
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,400
Speaker 0: It's a secret code that only internet people know.

322
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:43,733
Speaker 1: So this icon thing is like a secret code is usually like it's the thing That's weird about this is usually a secret code is with an insular group of people.

323
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:52,920
Speaker 1: you don't tell anyone the secret But here we're able to keep the secret by sharing the information freely, and it's a secret.

324
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:54,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, think of this.

325
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:58,420
Speaker 0: It's like you have a secret handshake, and you're cool with anyone who knows the secret handshake.

326
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:02,600
Speaker 0: But you made a website that explains exactly how to do the secret handshake.

327
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,736
Speaker 0: Thus the only people who do not know the secret handshake are people who are not hip to the internet at all.

328
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:13,085
Speaker 0: a lot of people yeah, but What I know happened is none.

329
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:17,600
Speaker 0: no one involved knew what that was except think about how it works at a television station.

330
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:33,880
Speaker 0: I'm sure that this got delegated down and delegated down and Eventually there was some interns somewhere with a pile of like Alternate Olympic logos that were submitted somewhere and some reporter way up said yeah kid Pick three of these to show on the show pick the good ones.

331
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:45,202
Speaker 0: So the kids going through and probably doing what we would do if we were interns trying to pick the best ones Yeah, try to be on that one's cool, and then he saw this one, and he couldn't help but think this is goat See.

332
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:52,632
Speaker 0: and then he couldn't help but think No one here could fault me because it's not actually goat see.

333
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,075
Speaker 0: they wouldn't even know.

334
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,900
Speaker 0: I can make this appear on TV.

335
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,347
Speaker 0: I can put goat see on TV.

336
00:24:58,828 --> 00:24:59,530
Speaker 0: It's up to me.

337
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,820
Speaker 0: I am now a hero, and you know what it's up to us.

338
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:10,379
Speaker 0: Okay Press a press a. what do you got?

339
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:14,630
Speaker 1: So you know we're big fans at the tower defense games.

340
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,597
Speaker 1: I don't know why but I guess we are.

341
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:24,120
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan Of the idea of tower defense games, and I'm a big fan of any tower defense game before I play it one complete time.

342
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:32,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well here's a tower defense game That's worth playing one complete time and has some great ideas, but it's very poorly executed.

343
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:43,970
Speaker 1: It is called onslaught and the cool things about this tower defense game are that you can sort of put towers near each other and They sort of team up like putting two lasers next to each other.

344
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:51,681
Speaker 1: one laser will shoot into the other one and the other One will shoot the laser at the bad guy thus increasing the damage of the laser 25%.

345
00:25:51,681 --> 00:26:00,240
Speaker 0: see now this is really different from a lot of other tower defense games where like desktop tower defense Which is probably now pretty much the iconic tower defense.

346
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:00,740
Speaker 1: Yeah

347
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:15,003
Speaker 0: There were a lot of implicit combos where the game doesn't explicitly do anything to make a combo or say there's a combo or treat Things differently because of how you've got it set up, but it just so happened that if you set up typhoon towers Yeah,

348
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:22,202
Speaker 1: I'll use towers that make the bad guys walk slow right next to the towers with really short range and high Damage.

349
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:25,432
Speaker 0: now that's a really important part of a tower defense game.

350
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:30,048
Speaker 0: games that don't have some form of implicit combo Tend to be really crappy.

351
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,658
Speaker 0: Yep, because that's like a basic part of these games.

352
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:42,551
Speaker 0: now This game which I haven't even played yet only Scott's play it has explicit combos where the game Actually actively and openly does things differently.

353
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:43,334
Speaker 0: if you combo

354
00:26:43,454 --> 00:27:03,329
Speaker 1: it actually has a chart and it's like hey you know put like three of these towers one of these and one of these all close enough to each other and all you know increase the Upgrade the damage on all of them high enough and it will actually occasionally perform this other attack Like put landmines out on the map and crazy stuff like that.

355
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,351
Speaker 1: and you can also upgrade the damage range and fire rate of the towers Individually like you don't.

356
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:14,698
Speaker 1: it's not just upgrade the tower it's I just want to upgrade the damage on this and upgrade the damage only and you can do that.

357
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,262
Speaker 1: and the.

358
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,513
Speaker 1: the way the game works on paper is actually pretty good.

359
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:23,663
Speaker 1: the problem with this tower defense game is The numbers.

360
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:27,455
Speaker 1: they didn't really balance this game very well for like a hundred levels.

361
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:28,900
Speaker 1: The game is stupidly easy.

362
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,783
Speaker 1: You can't lose.

363
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:37,299
Speaker 1: you can build one tower and upgrade it and do nothing else and beat like a hundred levels and The tower will just kill all the guys.

364
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:40,792
Speaker 1: then the game gets exponentially difficult and you lose.

365
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:52,740
Speaker 1: and it's sort of annoying because Like in order to tell whether you're actually making a good strategy of towers or not You have to play this game a hell of a lot and it's pretty annoying and bad.

366
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,216
Speaker 1: But it does bring some new ideas into the tower defense genre and is worth checking out.

367
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:03,466
Speaker 1: if you're a tower defense fan I just don't think it's worth playing Habitually like some others are.

368
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:08,000
Speaker 0: no not out right so we can't put it off any longer.

369
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:09,928
Speaker 0: It's about time to talk about it.

370
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:11,596
Speaker 0: my pokemons.

371
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:12,419
Speaker 0: Let me show you them.

372
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:16,052
Speaker 1: Let me show you the pokemons that I have see.

373
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:18,440
Speaker 0: I heard that you like mudkips.

374
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:19,445
Speaker 1: I do.

375
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:21,152
Speaker 1: we all actually know I don't like mudkips.

376
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:22,700
Speaker 0: I think my tips are awesome.

377
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,232
Speaker 0: I really do once I saw what they actually looked like.

378
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:25,855
Speaker 0: I really like them.

379
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:26,619
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan.

380
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,358
Speaker 0: So these Pokemon games.

381
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,244
Speaker 0: Before we get started.

382
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:35,857
Speaker 0: I just want to point out that unlike Scott and probably most of you out there.

383
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:42,476
Speaker 0: I Had never ever until now played any Pokemon game ever.

384
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:44,000
Speaker 1: You didn't play Pokemon Puzzle League.

385
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:45,684
Speaker 0: No, except once.

386
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:51,719
Speaker 0: once I played one game of the Pokemon card game and I hated it.

387
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:59,324
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I played the Pokemon card game with my brother and like the first set but it only lasts Until our IT.

388
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:02,715
Speaker 0: Oh, wow, like I was a sophomore and I played Pokemon with someone.

389
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,805
Speaker 1: Oh, okay Yeah, I played it when it was.

390
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,634
Speaker 1: there was only one Pokemon game out now.

391
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:10,280
Speaker 0: I still knew about Pokemon.

392
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,586
Speaker 1: How could you not know about?

393
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:14,460
Speaker 0: because I actually watched the TV show pretty regularly.

394
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,334
Speaker 1: In fact, I actually I never watched the TV show and I didn't like it.

395
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:19,177
Speaker 0: I don't like the TV show I don't like it.

396
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: In fact, I used to cuz back in high school when I wanted to watch my anime.

397
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:31,396
Speaker 0: I had a VCR that was set up to record Pokemon and Gundam wing and Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z, even though I didn't actually watch it.

398
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:34,168
Speaker 1: No Yeah, and I like my Pokemon.

399
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,814
Speaker 1: I didn't like Pokemon the TV show.

400
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:37,440
Speaker 0: So I knew all about Pokemon.

401
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,380
Speaker 0: I knew Pikachu was I knew all the Pokemon culture whatever but I had never actually played a Pokemon game.

402
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:49,080
Speaker 1: Well, the thing about Pokemon is there are a lot of games with the word Pokemon on them or the Pokemon characters in them.

403
00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:01,540
Speaker 1: You know, there's Pokemon Ranger, Pokemon Snap, Pokemon Dash, Pokemon Trozei, Pokemon Whatever, but all of those games are just games that happen to have Pokemon in them.

404
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,305
Speaker 1: They're not actually Pokemon games.

405
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:08,460
Speaker 1: The only games that are Pokemon games are Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow.

406
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:13,753
Speaker 1: Let's see if I can do all the colors Ruby, Sapphire, I'm not doing it in order.

407
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:20,443
Speaker 1: Gold, Silver, Diamond, Pearl, Crystal, Emerald, Whatever.

408
00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:26,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones that have a color or a gem or something are the all the Pokemon games.

409
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,062
Speaker 1: And you know what?

410
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:31,220
Speaker 1: There's really only four because like Red and Blue are the same game.

411
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:41,468
Speaker 1: they just have different the slightly different Pokemon in them and Leaf Green and Fire Red are the same as Red and Blue and Yellow and so there's really only four Generations of Pokemon games.

412
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:52,491
Speaker 1: So if you played four you've played them all Which is pretty amazing because when I was a young in the olden days I played Red and I played Silver and now I'm playing Diamond.

413
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,980
Speaker 1: I really only missed one Pokemon game.

414
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,067
Speaker 1: I thought I missed two or three, but I missed one.

415
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:02,147
Speaker 0: I mean, I got Fire Red when Scott bought Em- or Leaf Green.

416
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:06,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, just because all right I got to play this old one so I can play the new one and understand it.

417
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:08,283
Speaker 1: Plus the old Pokemon is so much better than new Pokemon.

418
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:11,134
Speaker 0: I got to say for what little Pokemon I've played.

419
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:12,118
Speaker 0: I agree heartily.

420
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:20,486
Speaker 0: Yeah I have so much love for Bulbasaur and I really feel nothing for Fire Monkey or Turtle with the Stick.

421
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:26,031
Speaker 1: It's all about like Dragonite and It's all about Pidgeot all the way.

422
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:26,795
Speaker 1: Pidgeot sucks.

423
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,244
Speaker 0: Gengar Six Geodudes.

424
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:30,226
Speaker 0: I can't lose.

425
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:31,590
Speaker 1: Six Geodudes can't lose.

426
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:35,480
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so so we got two perspectives here.

427
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:40,160
Speaker 0: I had never played a Pokemon game and I suddenly blitzed it and Scott knew all the Pokemon games.

428
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,002
Speaker 0: He knew what to expect.

429
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:43,248
Speaker 1: So what's a Pokemon game like?

430
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,638
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the rea- it's Earthbound.

431
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:47,540
Speaker 1: You ever play Earthbound?

432
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,082
Speaker 1: It's an art.

433
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:49,730
Speaker 1: It's a fun RPG.

434
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,996
Speaker 0: A light RPG.

435
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:51,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very light.

436
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:57,420
Speaker 1: It's not like some heavy Final Fantasy with lots of customizing and magic and all that stuff.

437
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,641
Speaker 1: It's.

438
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:58,022
Speaker 1: it's just.

439
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:00,051
Speaker 1: you know fight the monster it dies.

440
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:01,457
Speaker 1: walk around talk to people.

441
00:32:01,497 --> 00:32:02,120
Speaker 1: happy times.

442
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:05,409
Speaker 1: You know you can heal for free in any town pretty much.

443
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:09,660
Speaker 0: Now, there's nominally a plot, but there's really not a plot.

444
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:10,987
Speaker 1: Well, there is a plot.

445
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,675
Speaker 1: you read the Pokemon adventures manga.

446
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:17,779
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I know there's a plot but playing the game the plot doesn't matter at all.

447
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:23,581
Speaker 1: Well, the plot is sort of absorbed by osmosis instead of getting up all in your face, you know except

448
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:36,980
Speaker 0: I'm gonna if I look at the game from an adult perspective or from my perspective as just a Gamer who picked these games up without any of the cache of Pokemon or any of the cultural stuff just as a pure game.

449
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,267
Speaker 0: The dialogue is garbage.

450
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:40,652
Speaker 0: The story is trite.

451
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:48,900
Speaker 0: The characters are boring the game Outside of the gameplay, but the game itself is really boring and tedious and terrible.

452
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not perfect by talking to people is a chore.

453
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,197
Speaker 0: I never want to read anything.

454
00:32:55,237 --> 00:33:00,949
Speaker 1: a character says Oh, I like to read what the people say because it's usually cute and funny But that not because there's any meaning to it.

455
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:03,760
Speaker 0: I just for me it got old really quick.

456
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:11,659
Speaker 0: I guess it wouldn't have been nearly as old if I played the game a long time ago Plus the fact that I was playing fire red and the new one at the same time.

457
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:19,065
Speaker 0: they're basically the same game and people say the same kind of things and I Play as I played through one.

458
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:22,560
Speaker 0: I stopped reading text in the other one because they're gonna say the same kind of thing.

459
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:24,205
Speaker 0: I'm professor whatever.

460
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,530
Speaker 0: Here's your pokedex.

461
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:28,360
Speaker 0: go out and catch whatever the rotata is in this game.

462
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:29,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is.

463
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:34,940
Speaker 1: one thing is all the Pokemon generations are basically the same as the other Pokemon generations.

464
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:49,440
Speaker 1: I mean you're not really getting a different game when you you know other than the upgrades to the interface the different map the New areas the larger amount of Pokemon the different endgame content the changes to the battle system.

465
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:52,509
Speaker 1: It's the same game especially the one-player game.

466
00:33:52,951 --> 00:34:01,199
Speaker 1: start out with a few Pokemon catch a bunch more Train them beat all the gym leaders beat the elite for do the post game content the end.

467
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,741
Speaker 0: See now I don't want to dwell too much on exactly how the games work because you probably all know and if you don't I Don't.

468
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,800
Speaker 0: I think commentary is more interesting than just hearing us talk about how the games work.

469
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, suffice to say all Pokemon games actually are is a light version of earthbound plus cock fighting for 11 year olds.

470
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,143
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

471
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:24,500
Speaker 0: granted the cock fighting alone is the only reason I'm still playing Pokemon.

472
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:26,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Pokemon.

473
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if you play it when you barely played it when you're just new to playing it.

474
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,900
Speaker 1: It's really fun and exciting just to walk around and like OMG a new Pokemon.

475
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,668
Speaker 0: Look at it was cuz think I'd never played a Pokemon game before.

476
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,063
Speaker 0: so I started up fire red and I've got my little Pokemon.

477
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:46,179
Speaker 0: I'm going around and I have a ball and I catch a new Pokemon.

478
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,090
Speaker 0: I've got two Pokemon and then like a minute later.

479
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,755
Speaker 0: I see I see a bunch of Pokemon whatever.

480
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:56,620
Speaker 0: then I see a new Pokemon I never seen before and I get excited because I want to catch that Pokemon and find out about it.

481
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:57,240
Speaker 1: That's right.

482
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:06,112
Speaker 0: But then halfway through the game I realized that that was the game and if there weren't a multiplayer component I probably just put the game down as soon kind of like MMOs.

483
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:07,317
Speaker 0: I loved MMOs.

484
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,100
Speaker 0: I was into him.

485
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,882
Speaker 0: They were awesome.

486
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:27,610
Speaker 0: And then one day because really my departure from the MMO world happened in the course of pretty much one day Yeah, I realized wait a minute I see what they did there and I just logged out and never logged back in and Pokemon would have been the same way except Pokemon has Compelling endgame content and social cachet.

487
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:41,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing with Pokemon is that it really is When you play it get right down to it after the fun earthbound RPG Which is the main reason I play Pokemon because I really like earthbound style RPGs.

488
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:55,497
Speaker 1: when that's over All you've got left is a grind of selecting Pokemon teaching them the moves you want Collecting items to power them up and leveling up the Pokemon so that you can beat other people in the multiplayer

489
00:35:55,637 --> 00:36:06,133
Speaker 0: and sadly to make Good Pokemon You really do actually have to do research and look online and because doing it by trial and error or just by playing the game Through you're gonna make crap Pokemon.

490
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:16,127
Speaker 0: You're gonna make bad decisions You're gonna waste one use items and it's just you really have to play the game from the start in the semi-conservative way Never using the special things until the end.

491
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:21,320
Speaker 0: never putting special moves on a Pokemon until the end when you're absolutely sure you want it.

492
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:25,660
Speaker 0: Never wasting your HMS on Pokemon that could do better with other moves.

493
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:36,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like, you know, the thing is if you're just like some kid just playing Pokemon for fun you know, you're gonna end up using all those things and you're gonna beat the game and have a lot of fun.

494
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:41,980
Speaker 1: but Too many people out there in the world play Pokemon too seriously.

495
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,856
Speaker 1: That's raising the bar and forcing everyone else to also play Pokemon.

496
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:53,918
Speaker 0: Very serious granted The Pokemon is probably the most talked about thing in our forums despite the numerous flame wars about politics and religion.

497
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:05,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, and There's one point when someone mentioned something I didn't know anything about about EV training and I looked up what EV training was and I realized that I am never going to Master.

498
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:09,805
Speaker 0: no because even if I Suspended all logic.

499
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:15,700
Speaker 0: I still could not bring myself to subject myself to that.

500
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:16,985
Speaker 1: It's just.

501
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:18,792
Speaker 1: there's no way it's gonna happen.

502
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:19,635
Speaker 1: You can forget about it.

503
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,920
Speaker 1: There's stuff that's in the game.

504
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,428
Speaker 1: That's obvious and into my face that I'm not dealing with.

505
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna deal with that kind of crap.

506
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:35,558
Speaker 0: Well my real problem I'm just gonna get right to it when I make a Pokemon team to play against other people not to beat the game But to actually play against other people which is the only reason to really play Pokemon.

507
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,385
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean after you've beaten one Pokemon game They're all the same.

508
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:47,556
Speaker 0: you play a Pokemon game So you can do all the fun things with your friends in the Pokemon world and I got to admit it is fun to talk About Pokemon occasionally in moderation.

509
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:54,260
Speaker 0: Yep So I do all this stuff that it's not that fun grinding to make my Pokemon team so that I can play against other people.

510
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:58,930
Speaker 0: Now when I'm playing against other people I want to win because I want to win any game.

511
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,120
Speaker 0: if I don't want to win a game and it's a winnable game Then why am I playing?

512
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 0: But I care a lot more about how cool my Pokemon look than I do about how effective they are.

513
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:12,300
Speaker 1: I also care a lot more about how my Pokemon look than how effective they are.

514
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:21,359
Speaker 1: Like if I cared about getting effective Pokemon getting a Pokemon team together would be no trouble because I can just go on the Internet To like the ultimate Pokedex.

515
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:31,520
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a bunch of websites that have like perfect Pokedexes pick out like the six most powerful awesome Pokemon that work together perfectly on A team with as few weaknesses as possible and make that team.

516
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,149
Speaker 1: The problem is that team has Pokemon that I don't like.

517
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of Pokemon are ugly or stupid-looking or bidoofs.

518
00:38:38,662 --> 00:38:40,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like who wants those Pokemon.

519
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,319
Speaker 1: Why are they even in there?

520
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,847
Speaker 0: I mean I could see playing with Snorlax.

521
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:44,028
Speaker 0: cuz.

522
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,497
Speaker 0: Snorlax is awesome or Borlax if you prefer.

523
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:47,180
Speaker 1: He's pretty cool.

524
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, good Pokemon.

525
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:49,206
Speaker 0: get old 10 Pokemon.

526
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:52,897
Speaker 0: Yep, but I don't care how cool your gold that is.

527
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:53,780
Speaker 0: He looks stupid.

528
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,935
Speaker 1: I know gold that is like a Pokemon that I would normally like.

529
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:57,055
Speaker 1: cuz.

530
00:38:57,095 --> 00:39:01,112
Speaker 1: I really like Zubat Ignore what he turns into go bat and he's really ugly.

531
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,257
Speaker 0: He ignore what he looks like.

532
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:03,100
Speaker 0: his powers are great.

533
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,286
Speaker 0: He's actually a pretty good Pokemon.

534
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,617
Speaker 0: He's okay Pokemon compared to some other Pokemon.

535
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:07,240
Speaker 0: He's pretty great.

536
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,934
Speaker 1: He's definitely not the worst Pokemon, but he just looks stupid does look stupid.

537
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:11,817
Speaker 0: He's let's bear to.

538
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:14,948
Speaker 1: the original Golbat was really ugly.

539
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,394
Speaker 0: as cool as Spiritomb is.

540
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,244
Speaker 0: I don't really like the way Spiritomb Oh, you suck.

541
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:20,214
Speaker 1: Spiritomb like is my new favorite Pokemon.

542
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:25,375
Speaker 0: in terms of looks I'm all about the thing that the little shinks evolves into the Luxray or whatever.

543
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,580
Speaker 1: That's okay Pokemon.

544
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:29,113
Speaker 1: It's not something I would keep around forever, but it's not bad.

545
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:30,360
Speaker 0: I really like my Snorlax.

546
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:35,920
Speaker 0: I should just leave a Bulbasaur unevolved because Bulbasaur is probably the cutest Pokemon ever to exist.

547
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,924
Speaker 0: I love Bulbasaur.

548
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:39,172
Speaker 1: The cutest Pokemon is like this this one.

549
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:40,015
Speaker 1: It's like coral.

550
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,360
Speaker 1: I forget what its name is.

551
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,704
Speaker 0: What about the smiling manor?

552
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:43,206
Speaker 0: a thing?

553
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:49,446
Speaker 1: That's an okay, but it turns into sort of this big ugly manor a or the the Honeycomb, whatever.

554
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,976
Speaker 1: Oh the freaking.

555
00:39:50,996 --> 00:40:00,130
Speaker 1: yeah The new Pokemon I forget but it's like a little flying honeycomb and it evolves like this big Queen bee thing that sucks And it's all about the little cute honeycomb.

556
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:00,532
Speaker 0: Yep.

557
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:05,232
Speaker 0: So and the worst thing is too I tend to like certain kinds of moves in Pokemon.

558
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:13,452
Speaker 0: I like psychic ghosts dark moves Yeah, so anytime I make a Pokemon team I look at it I realized that it's all psychic dark ghost Pokemon.

559
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:26,880
Speaker 1: I probably get its ass kicked and it gets its ass kicked Yep, because you can't concentrate at any one type of move and it's sort of annoying because I really only like the dark Pokemon And I don't really like the other Pokemon so much.

560
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:30,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing that bothers me about the games is I want to join Team Rocket.

561
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,460
Speaker 0: I would join Team Rocket immediately if the game gave me the option at any point.

562
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:37,379
Speaker 0: I just joined Team Rocket, even if it screwed me in the end.

563
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:38,890
Speaker 1: But they don't let you.

564
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,259
Speaker 0: I know that bothers me.

565
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,240
Speaker 0: They could have some of that Star Wars game thing where you can follow the bad side and get a different ending.

566
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:45,838
Speaker 0: Yep.

567
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:52,678
Speaker 1: So the thing about Pokemon is that it's so close to being an MMO and being some sort of unplayable game.

568
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:57,009
Speaker 1: after you beat The single-player earthbound it's pretty much almost an MMO.

569
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:57,651
Speaker 1: what's left?

570
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:03,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's this tiny bit of strategy That holds it together.

571
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:12,440
Speaker 1: somehow I can't really like explain it in great detail But the multiplayer of Pokemon there isn't much to it because it does sort of come down.

572
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,025
Speaker 1: Rock-paper-scissors of.

573
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:16,392
Speaker 1: you chose the fire and I chose the water.

574
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,020
Speaker 1: so I win and it does sort of come down to.

575
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,396
Speaker 1: You know, I put this one out first and you put that one out first.

576
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,019
Speaker 1: So I win.

577
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:24,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's more drafting than anything.

578
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:31,500
Speaker 1: Yes, but there actually is something to you know, cuz everyone has access to all the same Pokemon.

579
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,967
Speaker 1: It's not like Magic the Gathering.

580
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,620
Speaker 1: We're spending more money or you know gets you better Pokemon.

581
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:35,821
Speaker 1: if

582
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:51,259
Speaker 0: anything it's like how I wish Magic the Gathering was where Because there was a time when magic was actually kind of dying and not doing well and everyone thought it was just gonna end Around the fallen empires days, which is when I quit playing magic my hope and I didn't happen.

583
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:58,178
Speaker 0: sadly I thought that oh if it fails maybe they'll just print a bunch of cards and sell all of them and you can just buy whatever cards you want.

584
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:08,965
Speaker 0: and Then it would have been a drafting strategy game instead of a collecting game because it was clearly broken in that if you have the best magic cards, you'll always win and That never happened.

585
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:09,869
Speaker 0: so so much for that.

586
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:11,776
Speaker 0: Pokemon is the closest thing to that I can get.

587
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:19,040
Speaker 1: yeah Pokemon You can choose it ever Pokemon you want and it's more about the choosing and the choosing what moves the Pokemon have.

588
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:26,588
Speaker 1: Then the actual maneuvering although there is something to the maneuvering as well But it's mostly the choosing and maneuvering isn't so much.

589
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:27,851
Speaker 0: Oh you did something awesome.

590
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,536
Speaker 0: It's more don't fuck up.

591
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:32,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't fuck up Don't fuck up.

592
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,532
Speaker 0: Yep,

593
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:49,675
Speaker 1: and It's actually the multiplayer is slightly strategic and tactical and meaningful and it's not a complete waste of time and simply oh You know because if it was a complete waste you could basically just say well You've been playing longer than I have your Pokemon are higher level than mine.

594
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:50,840
Speaker 1: are you win?

595
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,562
Speaker 1: Why even play?

596
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:53,548
Speaker 1: is that you could actually beat someone?

597
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:55,374
Speaker 1: because it evens out all your levels.

598
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:58,979
Speaker 1: even though there's slight differences in stats It still evens you out enough.

599
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:03,740
Speaker 1: You know where you can you can do damage and if you have the right moves and you use them in a you know?

600
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,879
Speaker 1: a clever way you can beat just about anybody.

601
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:13,665
Speaker 0: I Think the best part about Pokemon is just the fact that there's a lot of culture around Pokemon And there's a lot of.

602
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:15,815
Speaker 0: I mean, there's all the mudkip jokes and all that.

603
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:33,950
Speaker 0: but aside from that I'm under no illusion that when I go to cons this season Much like in previous convention seasons when I'd see a crowd of kids playing Mario Kart And I just walk over open my DS and join in or if I held up my DS and yelled Bomberman eight people would just walk over.

604
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:43,933
Speaker 0: I imagine there's going to be quite a bit of Pokemon battling at Otakon and Kinetic on Underground and you're just gonna see people everywhere.

605
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:44,938
Speaker 1: just all it's gonna.

606
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:53,526
Speaker 1: actually DS's will probably have all sorts of problems because there'll be too many people trying to use them and causing lots of Interference and signal degradation.

607
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:57,058
Speaker 1: Yeah as often happens outside the Nintendo store waiting in line.

608
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:04,451
Speaker 0: Yep So now there's these new Pokemon games which is part of the reason we got into this for the DS Diamond and the pearl.

609
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:13,976
Speaker 0: they actually add Quite a bit to the game having played about two-thirds the way through fire red and having played about a little over halfway Through the DS one more than halfway now.

610
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:19,260
Speaker 1: Yep I think the number one thing that the new Pokemon is added is the fact that it's wireless.

611
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:27,959
Speaker 1: I remember back in the day you'd sit there with two game boys and this cable between them and you'd huddle up next to each Cable sucks and the cable was really short.

612
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:30,110
Speaker 1: It was really slow too and you're using.

613
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:37,060
Speaker 1: you're playing black and white Pokemon again Someone else's black and white Pokemon and if that cable slipped a little it was game over.

614
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:40,280
Speaker 0: There was only one game ever that used that cable.

615
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,420
Speaker 0: Well, and that was hunt for the red October the best game boy game ever.

616
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:48,312
Speaker 0: I don't know about that, but at least multiplayer game boy game ever maybe.

617
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:52,985
Speaker 1: but you play this Pokemon and battle someone over.

618
00:44:53,025 --> 00:45:02,129
Speaker 1: this really slow connection huddled right next to them and it was generally unpleasant and it seemed like the Point of Pokemon was to make Pokemon and battle people.

619
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,540
Speaker 1: but you really couldn't do it very easily at all.

620
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:06,999
Speaker 1: I only did it a few times.

621
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:18,160
Speaker 0: In fact, really that's to me the primary revolution of the DS wasn't the touchscreen But the local wireless because multiplayer gaming on the DS Exploded because it no longer sucked.

622
00:45:18,644 --> 00:45:33,700
Speaker 0: I loved advanced wars on the GBA but I rarely ever played advanced wars multiplayer because you either had to sit in the tiny huddle and it just sucked and then someone Would move or dislodge the cord in the game over after an hour or you played the stupid hot seat with the wireless.

623
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:34,466
Speaker 0: It's just heaven.

624
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:35,172
Speaker 0: It just works.

625
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:42,780
Speaker 1: Yep The second thing about the diamond and pearl that's pretty cool is they do a lot of things to streamline the game.

626
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:49,067
Speaker 1: They don't streamline it enough in my opinion, but like they give you the running shoes right away You can move around quickly.

627
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:52,880
Speaker 0: They also give you the bicycle really early and they made it really fast.

628
00:45:53,102 --> 00:46:05,792
Speaker 1: yep, and it's not hard like you get all this stuff that you need to make moving around the game and doing whatever you want really convenient really early on and So you're not spending a whole like in the early Pokemon.

629
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:15,253
Speaker 1: you pretty much had to walk around The entire game and then when you got to the end now, you can finally fly anywhere you want and this one It's like are you can fly anywhere you want.

630
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:21,014
Speaker 0: we give up And they added a lot of endgame content and a lot of just stuff you can do.

631
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:28,980
Speaker 0: you can farm the berries and Bake the poffins and feed them to your Pokemon to enter the contest to win the ribbons to stick on the other Pokemon.

632
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's a whole lot of extra stuff to do when you don't want to train your Pokemon.

633
00:46:34,382 --> 00:46:37,350
Speaker 1: But honestly, I don't like any of that stuff.

634
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,820
Speaker 1: like the contests are just stupid and I paid no attention to them whatsoever.

635
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,065
Speaker 1: I completely ignored them.

636
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:45,880
Speaker 1: and there was a whole bunch of other stuff like putting labels on your pokeballs.

637
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,244
Speaker 1: I completely ignored that.

638
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:48,147
Speaker 1: that's a waste of time.

639
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:49,451
Speaker 1: It's not fun either.

640
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:55,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, they also added a lot of Interesting stuff with the wireless and with the Wi-Fi.

641
00:46:55,431 --> 00:47:01,832
Speaker 0: well, I mean you can trade with people on the internet Which is pretty interesting actually because Japanese people give you.

642
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:02,193
Speaker 1: amazing.

643
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:05,685
Speaker 0: Japanese people for whatever reason Highly value.

644
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:06,909
Speaker 0: English name Pokemon.

645
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,174
Speaker 0: It'll give you high level.

646
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:09,579
Speaker 1: That's what we think is going on.

647
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,828
Speaker 1: It could just be the Japanese people cheat and they'll.

648
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:13,570
Speaker 1: they want the it.

649
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,200
Speaker 1: they'll trade you some cheating Pokemon for your English Pokemon.

650
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the people in Diablo back in the day.

651
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:24,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll trade you like a billion gold for one dagger.

652
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,631
Speaker 0: Yep But let's get to the more fun part.

653
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,960
Speaker 0: What's wrong with Pokemon?

654
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:34,510
Speaker 1: first of all the problem with Pokemon is

655
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:36,273
Speaker 0: While

656
00:47:36,434 --> 00:47:51,149
Speaker 1: you don't have to level up your Pokemon very high in order to You know get them to be a level at which they are useful to still have to grind you still have to grind and the grinding is boring and there's no way to do it efficiently.

657
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,800
Speaker 1: and You know some poke like it's very tedious.

658
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:09,770
Speaker 1: after a while like early when you're actually playing the game like going through the earthbound style game is kind of fun because you're running into new Pokemon and You know, you're trying to catch him most of the time and you're fighting against like these trainers who have interesting Pokemon company.

659
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:10,455
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

660
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:16,142
Speaker 1: It's always a hiker with six geodudes Usually but you know, the trainers in the gyms are interesting.

661
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:26,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, I collect Magikarp splash tag But you know late when you get to the end of the game, it's pretty much like yeah There's one place you can go the Pokemon.

662
00:48:26,424 --> 00:48:27,229
Speaker 1: They're high level.

663
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,420
Speaker 1: You basically have to fight fight fight fight fight.

664
00:48:29,721 --> 00:48:30,806
Speaker 1: go back to the Poke Center.

665
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:31,670
Speaker 1: fight fight fight fight.

666
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,029
Speaker 1: Go back to the books that are same Pokemon over and over again.

667
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:41,425
Speaker 1: And it all you might as well just sit there holding down a for a few hours Which is what you press a press a and what the hell's the point?

668
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,450
Speaker 0: This is the worst thing.

669
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:51,212
Speaker 0: This is how you know that this is one of those instances where game developers recognize a problem and solve the wrong Problem.

670
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:52,095
Speaker 0: problem.

671
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:55,406
Speaker 0: The game is a grind when you want to level up after you beat the game.

672
00:48:55,827 --> 00:48:56,710
Speaker 0: You got to hit a lot.

673
00:48:57,053 --> 00:49:06,129
Speaker 0: Solution well They made it so you can hit a by hitting L. that way you can play Pokemon One-handed and go about the rest of your life while you hit a and walk around.

674
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:08,678
Speaker 1: What a great solution that was.

675
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,885
Speaker 1: how about if I beat the game?

676
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:15,225
Speaker 1: because I beat the game Let me make any Pokemon any level I want.

677
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:16,210
Speaker 1: what the fuck does it matter?

678
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,945
Speaker 0: That's what I said, even if you have to catch him and the rare stuff.

679
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:19,650
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

680
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:29,579
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm fine with collecting the poke But there should be a guy who you can talk to after you beat the game who will just level a Pokemon up With whatever Eevee whatever to whatever level you want.

681
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I why should multiplayer?

682
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:43,290
Speaker 1: You know Even when you're evening out the levels if some guy has a level 100 Pokemon and I have a little 50 Pokemon and we bring His Pokemon down to level 50 in order to battle.

683
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:47,004
Speaker 1: His is still a little better because of the stats and the way it does thing.

684
00:49:47,024 --> 00:49:49,516
Speaker 0: plus he probably has that like the one move They leveled up for.

685
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,590
Speaker 1: yeah, he probably has some powerful move.

686
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,905
Speaker 1: He learned a level 80 so that's really still sort of unfair.

687
00:49:55,945 --> 00:49:59,958
Speaker 1: and because he played longer He's gonna beat me regardless of my strategy.

688
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,724
Speaker 1: Just when I beat the game.

689
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,690
Speaker 1: Let me put any move on any Pokemon.

690
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:05,078
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter anymore.

691
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, well any move that's relevant.

692
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,427
Speaker 0: I mean you still gotta have the limitations on what moves Pokemon can learn.

693
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:16,034
Speaker 1: Yes, of course You don't want me to teach, you know for fire moves to my water Pokemon Awesome Pokemon.

694
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:24,430
Speaker 1: that would be an awesome Pokemon, but if you want to see a fire type ice type Pokemon Yeah, that'd be pretty cool also, but yeah, just let me know it'd be pretty lukewarm.

695
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:27,904
Speaker 1: Let me do whatever I want.

696
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:28,690
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

697
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:32,010
Speaker 1: Why should it be a contest of who sat there holding a all day?

698
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:34,350
Speaker 1: Cuz yeah I don't have the patience for it at that point.

699
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:38,934
Speaker 0: If it gets to the point where there's a way to cheat to just make Pokemon whatever level I want I'd probably do it.

700
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:40,385
Speaker 1: I would also do it in a second.

701
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:52,469
Speaker 1: Yes basically, I beat the game and there's an island after the game with the end game content and I'm basically just not doing it because I have to Level up so much and I just I'm sick of it.

702
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:59,650
Speaker 0: Alright, so my primary complaint with Pokemon is that everything just takes too long to react to my action.

703
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,435
Speaker 1: Yes, this is my number one complaint when I'm in battle.

704
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:03,237
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see.

705
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:11,630
Speaker 0: So it says ah Battle and then throw my pokeball out and then the other trainer appears and he throws his pokeball out and I can't skip this.

706
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,613
Speaker 0: It already takes like five seconds and then it's like alright What move do I want?

707
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:19,930
Speaker 0: a big splash attack and then it just takes several seconds for it.

708
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,630
Speaker 1: It's like there's like a one second delay before it even starts the splash attack.

709
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:27,990
Speaker 1: Even if you turn the animation off it still makes the other Pokemon blink.

710
00:51:28,273 --> 00:51:29,489
Speaker 1: That's like two more seconds.

711
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:40,790
Speaker 1: Then it like text shows up and even if I set the text speed to fast The text is still too slow and it takes a whole two seconds for it to display the text of splash attack hit

712
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:41,996
Speaker 0: In fact, and then

713
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,810
Speaker 1: I have to wait for their damage meter to go down from all the day.

714
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,293
Speaker 0: I started playing fire right again.

715
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:48,297
Speaker 0: It's faster than the new one.

716
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,660
Speaker 0: Yeah fairly significantly.

717
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:53,150
Speaker 0: So I've started playing that more because it's more enjoyable.

718
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:54,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Pokemon should go.

719
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,910
Speaker 1: the battle should go as fast as I can push the button.

720
00:51:58,091 --> 00:52:04,189
Speaker 1: I should choose an attack and then let's say I go and I push a splash attack and splash deck does 10 damage.

721
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:12,130
Speaker 1: as Soon as I push a the exact instant I push a on splash attack the damage should already be removed from the other guy.

722
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:13,936
Speaker 1: There should be no animation whatsoever.

723
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:15,200
Speaker 1: There should be no text.

724
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:23,810
Speaker 1: if he was paralyzed make the paralyzed icon appear No text and then immediately the menu should reappear and be responsive to my button presses.

725
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,943
Speaker 0: No, I like that to be an option because I know people like.

726
00:52:25,984 --> 00:52:26,668
Speaker 0: yeah, that's fine.

727
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:37,169
Speaker 1: I like to turn the animation on when I'm like at the boss battle a gym leader or there's a Pokemon that might have really Fancy attacks that I haven't looked at before because looking at new attacks is fun.

728
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:41,864
Speaker 1: but even when I'm you know, even if I'm not grinding forget the grinding.

729
00:52:42,005 --> 00:53:10,704
Speaker 1: if I'm actually playing through the game and I'm beating a bunch of trainers in an area that all have similar Pokemon the only thing that's keeping me from getting ahead in the game is the amount of time the fucking battles take and Even if I'm powerful enough to just beat all the battles instantly I have to sit there for like 20 minutes waiting for all this goddamn text even if I set the game on the fastest least animation mode possible and It's really just wasting my time and pissing me off.

730
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:13,156
Speaker 0: and three I'm just gonna.

731
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:14,422
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna explain this.

732
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,850
Speaker 0: you should know what I'm talking about.

733
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:18,563
Speaker 0: Faint is not spelled that way.

734
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:19,769
Speaker 0: you assholes.

735
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:23,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, rim is pretty pissed off about that alone.

736
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:30,030
Speaker 0: Like when I like I saw that attack and I kept thinking all right Maybe it's a play on words because it makes you faint.

737
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:39,026
Speaker 0: And then I read the description of it and then I just turned the game off and discussed and then I realized that I Hadn't saved my game and that made me more disgusted.

738
00:53:39,207 --> 00:53:52,670
Speaker 1: Yeah It's an attack a certain Pokemon can learn called faint and it basically, you know faint fe I NT where you kind of You know, like you act like you're gonna go one way you go another way, but they spell it faint with an a.

739
00:53:52,991 --> 00:53:54,275
Speaker 0: That's not how you spell that.

740
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,450
Speaker 1: faint with an a is like I pass out because the blood rushed out of my head.

741
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:00,677
Speaker 1: That does not mean the same thing.

742
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,807
Speaker 1: So why would you call fe I NT fe I NT there?

743
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:04,770
Speaker 0: because they're stupid.

744
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:08,469
Speaker 1: There's one nice ever localized the game fucked up.

745
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:12,570
Speaker 0: But at the same time I think that's in all the Pokemon games that have that attack it is.

746
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:18,518
Speaker 1: I think they messed it up in the first one with a bad localization and they've just Continued the mistake rather than admitting it.

747
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:27,530
Speaker 0: but at least the people who localized diamond pearl There are a lot of things characters say that at least in the early game.

748
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:33,030
Speaker 0: I stopped reading text long ago that made me believe that those people are some form of internet geek.

749
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,620
Speaker 1: I think they might be the Phoenix Wright people.

750
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,103
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

751
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:36,210
Speaker 1: I guess there's gonna look it up.

752
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:41,475
Speaker 0: There are a lot of things people say that are not direct references But they're.

753
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:44,630
Speaker 0: they use words that aren't often used by people who aren't internet.

754
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:44,763
Speaker 0: Yeah

755
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:52,531
Speaker 1: Like I talked to someone in the just an NPC Standing in town and I talked to them in Pokemon and they were like, oh no is my something something Yep,

756
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:58,030
Speaker 0: and I beat one trainer out like some hiker with six geodudes and he said oh snap after I beat him.

757
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,596
Speaker 1: Yep, that's pretty cool right there.

758
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:02,181
Speaker 0: There's no way that was random chance.

759
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:05,770
Speaker 0: No, no one actually says oh snap except our people.

760
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:13,582
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool that we take the Pokemon into our internet culture and the Pokemon Reciprocates by taking our internet culture and putting it in their Pokemon.

761
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:15,650
Speaker 0: Phoenix, right somewhat did the same thing.

762
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:17,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phoenix, right is cool.

763
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:19,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, so is Pokemon for the same reason.

764
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, because other than those gripes I don't have much else.

765
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,965
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean Pokemon.

766
00:55:25,086 --> 00:55:29,250
Speaker 1: if you've never played a Pokemon game You know You might think it's for kids and it is kind of for kids.

767
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,950
Speaker 1: It's a game that is designed in such a way that kids can play it with great ease and derive much enjoyment from it.

768
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:39,289
Speaker 1: But it is sort of all ages like anyone who gets into it can get into it.

769
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,824
Speaker 1: You know don't think it's all cutesy wootsie kids crap because some of it is.

770
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:48,202
Speaker 1: but anyone can enjoy Pokemon Even if you're like an old man, you can enjoy Pokemon.

771
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:49,770
Speaker 0: It's basically just cock fighting.

772
00:55:50,192 --> 00:55:59,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's earthbound plus cock fighting and if you like either one of those two There's and Pokemon is so much in it that there's something you will like.

773
00:55:59,445 --> 00:56:02,720
Speaker 1: even if you don't like the cock fighting You just completely ignore levels.

774
00:56:03,062 --> 00:56:04,510
Speaker 1: you completely ignore beating the game.

775
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:09,364
Speaker 1: You can just like dress up your Pokemon and that's like a whole game in and of itself.

776
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:11,430
Speaker 1: the contests the thing that I completely ignore.

777
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:17,510
Speaker 0: I played in a few and won him and the DDR part was particularly annoying because I played it on the train.

778
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,274
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, it's like.

779
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:25,250
Speaker 1: yeah, that's one thing people have to realize when you make a stylist game for the DS.

780
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:35,510
Speaker 1: Basically if it requires any precision stylist movement It's impossible to play it in a car or a train unless there's absolutely no vibration whatsoever.

781
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,734
Speaker 1: And there's always vibration.

782
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:39,122
Speaker 1: like I could not play trauma center on the train.

783
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:39,724
Speaker 1: It's impossible.

784
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:41,570
Speaker 0: Well, you could you just kept killing people.

785
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:44,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just it's absolutely impossible to play it properly on the train.

786
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:46,427
Speaker 1: That's why I like trauma center.

787
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:47,170
Speaker 1: We a lot better.

788
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, also it was easier.

789
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pokemon.

790
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:52,964
Speaker 1: So I like them.

791
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:56,259
Speaker 0: right now I'm heading my team up with that.

792
00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:00,696
Speaker 0: I got a bronzer and I evolved him and leveled him way up And so now he's the big Chinese Bell.

793
00:57:01,077 --> 00:57:04,530
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think he's gonna be like my headline Pokemon from now on.

794
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:05,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like.

795
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:09,556
Speaker 1: I was excited about that Pokemon and I like it on paper But I just don't.

796
00:57:09,777 --> 00:57:11,064
Speaker 1: I don't like how it turns into the Bell.

797
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:14,220
Speaker 1: I like the Bell a lot But I like the dish better than the Bell.

798
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,024
Speaker 0: I like the dish too.

799
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,310
Speaker 0: I might use that one instead.

800
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:18,840
Speaker 1: Places in the game right is catch the Bell.

801
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:20,630
Speaker 1: I don't need to bother leveling up the bronzer.

802
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,402
Speaker 0: Oh, I live them up cuz I was using him the whole time.

803
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:24,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't use him.

804
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:25,190
Speaker 1: I used other book.

805
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:25,591
Speaker 0: He's my.

806
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:26,936
Speaker 0: he's one of my primary Pokemon.

807
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:31,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, and once I get the pal part baldassar is gonna be bringing up the rear.

808
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:34,339
Speaker 0: He's actually a Venusaur but I named him baldassar.

809
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:37,949
Speaker 0: Yeah much like how my Pidgeot or whatever is named Pidgey.

810
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:43,830
Speaker 1: Yep, like I got sort of you know washed out on Pokemon lately and I'm doing other stuff instead.

811
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,670
Speaker 1: But I feel it's gonna come back in like a few weeks.

812
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:56,409
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be all excited about Pokemon again, and I'll go back and I'll finally beat the leaf green And then I'll start dragging all the Pokemon into the diamond and pearl and making another move on it.

813
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:01,770
Speaker 1: It's really all I have to do now is construct my final team of six and then I'll then I'll be alright.

814
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:08,093
Speaker 0: Yeah I might have to make a couple of teams just because you can have the dual battles and I might want to have the backup Team.

815
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:10,169
Speaker 1: if there's a dual battle, I'll just go with it.

816
00:58:10,371 --> 00:58:13,312
Speaker 1: You know as long as you've got some flying Pokemon and dual battles All right.

817
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:15,680
Speaker 0: Yeah flying Pokemon earthquake.

818
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:18,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's obviously that's what you do.

819
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,864
Speaker 0: It's a classic move, of course, you've got all flying Pokemon.

820
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:21,829
Speaker 0: that doesn't work against you.

821
00:58:25,411 --> 00:58:31,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, Pokemon is not the greatest game in the world, but I can't pretend that I have not enjoyed my time thus far.

822
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:34,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also, you know DS there hasn't been.

823
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:39,584
Speaker 1: you know Pokemon is pretty much all you're gonna get in the DS for a few months here.

824
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:41,590
Speaker 0: Well until the explosion happens.

825
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:41,991
Speaker 0: Yes,

826
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:58,077
Speaker 1: so and Pokemon is definitely a game that while it might not be this great amazing game I mean the RPG is earthbound style But it's not as good as earthbound and the cock fighting is like one step above MMO making it tolerable But it's still pretty low down there.

827
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:01,570
Speaker 0: In fact, I'd say that Pokemon leveling is at the line.

828
00:59:02,011 --> 00:59:02,894
Speaker 0: It is the bear.

829
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:06,505
Speaker 0: It's the closest thing to a grind that I will accept.

830
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:11,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even that is grudging Yep, but regardless for $30.

831
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:19,973
Speaker 1: this game Pokemon Diamond Pearl, whatever Provides so many hours of entertaining gameplay Even if you take out the grinding.

832
00:59:19,993 --> 00:59:31,129
Speaker 0: that is totally worth it and that was geek nights with rim and Scott.
