1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,168
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday August 21st.

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,151
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:19,097
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight making babies with tempest.

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:30,026
Speaker 0: Let's do this You know until today.

5
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,330
Speaker 0: I'd never been on a train that just broke down.

6
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:38,830
Speaker 1: I was on a train that broke once but it only broke for a short while and then kept going again.

7
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:45,067
Speaker 0: See I'm riding I'm Fighting the elite four and doing okay despite the fact that I'd never played a pokemon game before.

8
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,717
Speaker 0: so I didn't realize that Once I start I got to go all the way to the end.

9
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:55,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I had just four Pokemon with me and two bibberell And I hadn't bought items pretty much for the entire game

10
00:00:56,231 --> 00:01:05,024
Speaker 1: You need if you're this is the first time you're going to the elite four and you're not super high level like you didn't level Up extra you need to bring in like a fistful of hyperpose.

11
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:21,762
Speaker 0: actually let me put it this way despite having almost like I was rationing like the few normal potions I had left and Despite only having four Pokemon all of which were below the levels of the Pokemon that the Masters had yeah I'd be at all the elite four with no problem.

12
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,250
Speaker 1: Did you beat the Pokemon champion?

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:33,239
Speaker 0: I just I killed two of her Pokemon, and then I had nothing left, but two bibberells Yeah, and I had no more revives or potions.

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,781
Speaker 0: basically

15
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:47,070
Speaker 1: the thing you have to do is you have to do it at least once And fail to figure out what Pokemon they have and which Pokemon they have that are trouble Pokemon And then make sure you bring in attacks that can get rid of those Pokemon way, and then it's real easy.

16
00:01:47,331 --> 00:02:00,230
Speaker 0: I don't like most of the Pokemon that are available to me before I beat the game, so I really only have four Pokemon Because I don't have a fire Pokemon because all the fire Pokemon are either crap or everybody uses them.

17
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:06,656
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't want to wrap it as the thing is because they get all the good fire Pokemon are after you beat the game Yeah, or any other games.

18
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:09,589
Speaker 0: I refuse to use a rapid ash just because everyone has one.

19
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, I stopped using mine.

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, I brought.

21
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:13,970
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bring over anyway.

22
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:15,661
Speaker 0: so I'm fighting through that.

23
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:20,642
Speaker 0: and then the HVAC the cooling air conditioning whatever just kind of stops.

24
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:21,225
Speaker 1: Well.

25
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,430
Speaker 1: It wasn't so necessary today.

26
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,537
Speaker 1: It was kind of cold and raining.

27
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:25,126
Speaker 0: actually the super heat was on.

28
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:36,970
Speaker 0: oh And then the lights flicker and come back on and then the train just kind of slowly rolls to a stop with The river on one side the cliffs on the other side, and it was one of those sections with only two tracks.

29
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,765
Speaker 0: So we're now blocking all northbound traffic.

30
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:43,598
Speaker 0: Yeah All right sit there for a while.

31
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:45,083
Speaker 0: I'm just kind of relaxing.

32
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:45,946
Speaker 0: It's actually really nice.

33
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,050
Speaker 0: There aren't many people in my car.

34
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,750
Speaker 0: There's an old guy sitting next to me reading some history book.

35
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:56,590
Speaker 0: I'm just sitting there, and there's a young hip yuppie kind of guy who immediately rips out his cell phone and starts texting furiously.

36
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:05,701
Speaker 0: So after about five minutes the conductor comes on and says yeah the Engine just kind of stopped.

37
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,829
Speaker 0: We're trying to start it again.

38
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,300
Speaker 0: We expect to be on route shortly.

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,770
Speaker 1: can't they just get another engine to come down and grab your train?

40
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,608
Speaker 0: And do you know how much of a pain in the ass that would be and how much time that would take?

41
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:20,898
Speaker 1: I thought Engines could just like grab engines or yeah Behind the train push it Scott.

42
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:23,710
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand at all how trains are routed.

43
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 0: it's kind of like air traffic in that there's zones and Once a train enters a zone no other train can enter that zone for a period of time until the train leaves the zone.

44
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:40,179
Speaker 0: And zones are one way and you have to you have to do all this stuff basically to send another train in.

45
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:49,140
Speaker 0: they got to Get another train get it ready get it into position But it would take so much time that they basically sat there trying to get this engine going so they wouldn't inconvenience.

46
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:54,178
Speaker 0: Of course you do that that duh, but I don't think they didn't even plan to send anything else.

47
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,265
Speaker 1: yet What if they couldn't get it fixed?

48
00:03:56,466 --> 00:04:06,400
Speaker 0: the only plan if they couldn't get it fixed was to send an auxiliary train on the southbound Track to pick everyone up and take us to our destination, and then I guess delay all southbound traffic for a while.

49
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,227
Speaker 1: Oh, that's kind of sucky.

50
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then eventually send some way out to get this train out of the way.

51
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,127
Speaker 1: They just had those things.

52
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,177
Speaker 1: they put them on the track and you pump up and down.

53
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:18,824
Speaker 0: yeah So I don't care.

54
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:23,620
Speaker 0: I put away the Pokemon because after I was getting it home too late, so it wasn't so bad.

55
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:29,949
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it wasn't so bad, but I sat there for a good half hour And the thing is it's all cool.

56
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,411
Speaker 0: I don't care.

57
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,680
Speaker 0: I'm in no hurry, so I'm just kind of sitting there.

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,700
Speaker 0: It's raining outside.

59
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,311
Speaker 0: I stopped playing my Pokemon cuz.

60
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:36,419
Speaker 0: I'm pissed off that I died.

61
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,067
Speaker 0: Start reading my plutar.

62
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,156
Speaker 0: the old man next to me is just reading his book.

63
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:40,739
Speaker 0: We're all cool.

64
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,548
Speaker 0: The announcer says again all right.

65
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,491
Speaker 0: We think we got it.

66
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,100
Speaker 0: Give us a minute and the train is gonna continue.

67
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:54,465
Speaker 0: We're gonna get to garrison and then the guy the conductor walks by and the uppy guy starts grousing Loudly.

68
00:04:54,485 --> 00:05:08,367
Speaker 0: and then when the conductor reaches his seat He grabs the conductor and stops it and basically says so obviously the trains just gonna limp into garrison and then we're gonna have to change to the whatever train that just passed us because I saw the 652 whatever train just passed.

69
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,752
Speaker 0: so why did you just announce that?

70
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:10,455
Speaker 0: why lie?

71
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,900
Speaker 0: and the conductor?

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,298
Speaker 0: Completely ignores him and keeps walking.

73
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:22,900
Speaker 0: Yep, and then we get to our stop at garrison And he says garrison station and the yuppies crumbling and grousing and yell at him blah blah blah blah.

74
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,006
Speaker 0: Why don't these tell us we're gonna have to change?

75
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:29,760
Speaker 0: and then the doors close and the train keeps going to cold spring.

76
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:35,041
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then it goes to beacon and the guy totally got owned Punned.

77
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:36,827
Speaker 0: the guys wouldn't shut up thought.

78
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:44,056
Speaker 0: I don't get the people who if your life causes a problem You're stuck somewhere you have a problem, and there's nothing you can do about it.

79
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:54,359
Speaker 0: the moment there is nothing you can do about a problem any complaining and anything you do other than just accept it and Mitigate it as best you can or do something.

80
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:58,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know something or shut up Scott I already said it's beyond your control.

81
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,720
Speaker 1: well sometimes you can do something.

82
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:07,780
Speaker 0: I already say if beyond your control once it is beyond your control by definition There's nothing else you can do beyond your control.

83
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,466
Speaker 0: There are a lot of things beyond your control.

84
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:11,033
Speaker 1: could you could get out and push the train?

85
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,197
Speaker 0: No you can't.

86
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:12,960
Speaker 0: that's illegal.

87
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,244
Speaker 1: You could try.

88
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,307
Speaker 0: you can't even get out.

89
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,149
Speaker 0: You don't have the key.

90
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,293
Speaker 1: you could try.

91
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,198
Speaker 1: no the emergency window.

92
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:19,258
Speaker 1: no.

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,908
Speaker 0: Regardless the situation is beyond your control.

94
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,594
Speaker 0: grousing about it's not gonna help.

95
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,698
Speaker 0: being angry is not gonna help.

96
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:26,240
Speaker 0: what I did?

97
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:30,199
Speaker 0: I kept reading my plutarch, and I just sat there relaxing on the train.

98
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:36,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're supposed to do, but all you know you can do other things like I just said, but they have consequences.

99
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:44,518
Speaker 0: But any I just I don't get people who get so worked up about things that they have no control over like Can't they think don't they realize all right?

100
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,080
Speaker 0: Yelling at the conductor is gonna get a whole bunch done the trades is gonna start moving immediately.

101
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:58,320
Speaker 1: some people they live with the the don't worry be happy and Some people don't and those people are generally less happy, and it's their own damn fault.

102
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:06,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but anyway I don't want to talk about that because there is kind of big news in the role-playing games world and Big is a very relative term.

103
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:15,080
Speaker 0: Wizards of the coast has decides ours update coast that they are going to release a new edition of Dungeons and Dragons.

104
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,956
Speaker 0: Yay, this is going to be fourth edition so so far.

105
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,067
Speaker 0: We've had Dungeons and Dragons and all its iteration

106
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,594
Speaker 1: advanced Dungeons and Dragons which

107
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:41,458
Speaker 0: was my favorite Dungeons and Dragons because then there was advanced Dungeons and Dragons second edition which was in my opinion overall the best Dungeons and Dragons system for role-playing, but I think the only reason it was good is because of its crippling flaws.

108
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,240
Speaker 1: perhaps.

109
00:07:42,942 --> 00:08:06,079
Speaker 0: Then they released third edition which was supposed to revolutionize role-playing and revolutionize Dungeons and Dragons and It basically just turned D&D into Super D 20. super everything has a rule for it basically made it a video game with some role-playing kind of tacked on and Then they didn't sell so well because most people started pirating it and people really got disillusioned and whatever.

110
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:12,060
Speaker 0: They released third and a half edition and tried to get everyone to buy these books all over again.

111
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:13,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, they made a whole.

112
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,154
Speaker 1: the idea of Dungeons and Dragons is they make their money by selling books.

113
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:22,920
Speaker 1: if they sell one book to Everyone who plays that's not really enough money for a big game company like WotC.

114
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,477
Speaker 1: So they make another book and another book and another book and another book and they all add together.

115
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:34,080
Speaker 1: and there are a bunch of People out there not me, but there are people who buy many if not all of these books.

116
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:35,485
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

117
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:48,480
Speaker 0: the worst thing about third and a half edition was that they release new books and They change a bunch of relatively minor rules all over the place and while they release little erratic sheets Like here are the changes.

118
00:08:48,981 --> 00:09:00,677
Speaker 0: It was basically impossible to use a third edition book effectively in third and a half edition and I'm convinced that they designed this Update specifically to sell to everyone who already had the book.

119
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:01,480
Speaker 0: It was crap.

120
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,720
Speaker 0: The only reason I bought a third and a half book was that my third edition book fell apart like physically it was unusable.

121
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:18,468
Speaker 1: Yep, that me also my third edition book kind of and you know while you know I could have lived with just the third edition book because it wasn't as bad as rims He was turned in terms of condition.

122
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:19,372
Speaker 0: I was pretty bad.

123
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,020
Speaker 1: This was on what I call unreadable.

124
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,089
Speaker 0: The thing is mine was perfectly readable.

125
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,620
Speaker 0: The problem was that about the pages.

126
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:36,550
Speaker 0: the only pages that were missing were the pages at the end that had the monsters because that book came out before The Dungeon Master's Guide and the monsters manual came out.

127
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:41,987
Speaker 0: remember I bought that book the day Third edition D&D was renounced and released.

128
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,660
Speaker 1: I did also bought the very first printing of that book, but it wasn't the day.

129
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:47,323
Speaker 1: It was.

130
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:50,258
Speaker 0: it was the day my whole D&D group went out and got it.

131
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,759
Speaker 0: And in fact also remember that book came with that CD.

132
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,452
Speaker 1: Yep, now the CD that there's.

133
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,000
Speaker 1: only one thing you're allowed to do with that CD.

134
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,157
Speaker 0: I believe it was Chuck it after breaking it.

135
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:04,351
Speaker 0: Yes It was actually kind of ritualized among the front row crew.

136
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:11,020
Speaker 0: anytime we found someone who had the CD We basically forced them under threat of death to take it out and of their own free.

137
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:17,300
Speaker 0: Well their own relatively free will break it with their own hands and throw it away possibly spitting on it.

138
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:26,375
Speaker 1: Basically, the CD had this really shitty character generating software on it Bullshit thing on it - I don't remember but it's a shitty character generator.

139
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:27,700
Speaker 0: It was just crap.

140
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:38,672
Speaker 0: so Fourth edition I'm gonna come out right now and say that I Generally get the impression that fourth edition is crap.

141
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,578
Speaker 0: However, I can't say it's crap.

142
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,080
Speaker 0: universally.

143
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,520
Speaker 0: I can say it's crap for people like us and when I say people like us, I mean people who roleplay

144
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:59,577
Speaker 1: well, basically from what everything I've read and I've read some not as I haven't read everything, but I've read some and Fourth edition if everything that has been said about it is correct is a better.

145
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:00,139
Speaker 1: Dungeons & Dragons.

146
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:12,480
Speaker 1: They're going to fix things that are wrong with Dungeons & Dragons like for example familiars won't suck anymore and be ignored and You know stuff like that stuff that is wrong with Dungeons & Dragons itself.

147
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:22,912
Speaker 1: However, if you are like us and your main complaint with Dungeons & Dragons is that it is Dungeons & Dragons Guess what fourth edition D&D is still D&D.

148
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:30,960
Speaker 1: They're not changing it to something else They're just fixing it within itself sort of like the way that World of Warcraft is still a mud.

149
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:32,504
Speaker 1: It's just a fixed mud.

150
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:54,530
Speaker 0: The thing is when Scott says fixing it basically from what I can gather the majority of the changes are fleshing out combat more and making combat more complex Making the decisions you make with your characters creation and leveling in regards to combat much more meaningful and generally just making the combat system a lot more robust.

151
00:11:54,711 --> 00:12:10,980
Speaker 0: and I don't see really anything about doing anything else other than making combat more robust and changing the way classes work a bit and changing the way races work a bit and changing the alignment system and having optional alignment systems and Completely changing the way feats work and all that sort of business.

152
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:19,180
Speaker 1: They're making it go to 30 levels instead of 20 levels before you get to you know Epic power and I think that's for this system.

153
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:32,439
Speaker 1: I think that is a better Dungeons & Dragons because part of Dungeons & Dragons this sucks is that you only Increase in power and and progress very, you know, relatively rarely and progressing is very fun.

154
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:37,540
Speaker 1: However, the real solution is burning wheel constant progression of gradual.

155
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,283
Speaker 0: Well, not just that.

156
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:42,840
Speaker 0: the real issue is that they're adding 30 levels, but I get the impression that they're adding 10.

157
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,688
Speaker 0: Well, they're adding 10 levels to the 20 levels.

158
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,740
Speaker 0: They're just adding the 10 levels on the end instead of that epic stuff.

159
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,002
Speaker 0: They did.

160
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:48,486
Speaker 0: I don't know.

161
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,080
Speaker 1: I think they're spreading the 20 levels.

162
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,325
Speaker 1: That's what it seems like to me.

163
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,879
Speaker 0: it seems like they're basically just adding to combat.

164
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:01,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the specific really is in the book is combat.

165
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:05,194
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read a quote from some shit blog because there's really no good.

166
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,366
Speaker 0: It's not a blog but whatever it is there's no good gaming press.

167
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:18,360
Speaker 0: most of the sites I found were either wrong or Just linked to the D&D website or quoted the D&D website directly in poor choice.

168
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:23,040
Speaker 0: And the D&D website is actually kind of useless because it's all just videos that I don't want to watch.

169
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,122
Speaker 0: Yep But here's an excerpt from this side I'm looking at.

170
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:32,545
Speaker 0: the fighter is the only current fourth edition class with capabilities that depend on the weapon They have chosen to train with the most.

171
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:40,980
Speaker 0: even at first level a fighter who uses an axe will have different power Selection than a fighter who relies on a flail or a rapier or a pick.

172
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,891
Speaker 0: uh Walt I don't know what I want to say about this.

173
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,232
Speaker 0: second edition was kind of cool in that They really broke it down.

174
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,160
Speaker 0: weapons didn't matter.

175
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,719
Speaker 0: They all just did kind of different damage.

176
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:56,300
Speaker 0: But they used to have weapon speed and initiative was determined per round.

177
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:02,015
Speaker 0: So as a result Yeah Did at least decide do I want the quick weapon or the slow weapon that does more damage?

178
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:03,220
Speaker 0: and they kind of got rid of?

179
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,002
Speaker 0: That in third edition.

180
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:09,780
Speaker 0: as a result very few weapons had really anything to make them different from other weapons.

181
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:17,439
Speaker 1: The only things that differentiate weapons in third edition are Some of the weapons can critical hit more than others but very few.

182
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:20,304
Speaker 1: Some of them have an extended range But very few.

183
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:24,224
Speaker 1: and all of the ones that are weird require you to have crazy Proficiencies.

184
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,690
Speaker 1: so barely anyone can use them.

185
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:30,434
Speaker 1: and the rest of them just either Ranged or not ranged and they do an amount of damage.

186
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,842
Speaker 1: and that's it There's.

187
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:35,312
Speaker 1: no really, you know a sword is a sword.

188
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,180
Speaker 1: one does slightly different damage from the other.

189
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:49,934
Speaker 0: I guess the bottom line is as far as I can tell they're not really changing anything in Dungeons & Dragons other than making it more third edition and forcing everyone to buy new books so they can make more money.

190
00:14:49,974 --> 00:15:00,235
Speaker 1: because if they just sold one edition forever Eventually everyone would own the books and no one would buy it anymore because they're not trying to get more players They're just trying to sell more shit to the existing players.

191
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:01,060
Speaker 1: the same you shit.

192
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,164
Speaker 1: That's wrong with comic books.

193
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:02,325
Speaker 1: if

194
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:08,708
Speaker 0: you like combat in Dungeons & Dragons by fourth edition If you don't like the combat or

195
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:10,473
Speaker 1: you don't like buying more than one book

196
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:19,238
Speaker 0: or if you care about any of the things Other than combat at this time I see zero reason to buy fourth edition or to even bother considering it, you

197
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,535
Speaker 1: know If you buy Burning Wheel, you won't need to buy another book for the rest of your life.

198
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,744
Speaker 1: in terms of role-playing It's just one book though.

199
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:29,819
Speaker 0: I will point out there is another fairly significant change and I kind of like this.

200
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,510
Speaker 0: You know, there's the old the living Greyhawk.

201
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,454
Speaker 0: if you don't know what that is.

202
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:34,840
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna bother explaining it.

203
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:35,525
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

204
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,100
Speaker 1: They're doing all this online stuff.

205
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:48,279
Speaker 0: no, not even that just living Greyhawk has been around for a long time and Greyhawk was kind of the like official generic setting for Dungeons & Dragons for god knows how long.

206
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:53,037
Speaker 0: They're dumping that because no one gives a shit about Greyhawk and no one likes it good.

207
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:56,751
Speaker 0: Finally They're making Forgotten Realms the fucking official thing.

208
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:02,391
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell it's now gonna be Living Forgotten Realms and they're just dumping Greyhawk.

209
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:03,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they're actually.

210
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:10,198
Speaker 1: they're doing a lot of online Stuff right that I've heard like they're gonna make some softwares you could play online and stuff like that.

211
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:23,040
Speaker 1: and This is good business because there's a lot of people out on the internet and around the world who want to play Tabletop role-playing games, but they can't because people who they're losers with no friends in their area who would play with them.

212
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:27,660
Speaker 0: Also, I note that I always say that third edition and I guess fourth edition combat.

213
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:29,858
Speaker 0: They basically made it like a video game.

214
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:39,540
Speaker 0: It's getting to the point where it'd be easier and more interesting if you all just sat around a computer and did your D&D Combat with the computer handling all the rules for you.

215
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,320
Speaker 1: I think there's gonna be a convergence between the D&D books and like the D&D games like, you know That every winter nights and the Mara wins.

216
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:57,740
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna expect people to play D&D with their friends using the online tool to handle combat or Play it with their friends around the world using an integrated talk to each other dice rolling combat.

217
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:06,557
Speaker 1: Hoping they're gonna be able to still make money from this property They own by selling software and internet services as opposed to books, which no one wants from that perspective.

218
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:07,560
Speaker 0: They're doing everything, right?

219
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,329
Speaker 0: They're making a system that becomes more and more tedious to use tabletop and more and more awesome to do online or with a computer.

220
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:18,709
Speaker 0: and They're catering to this really important thing of.

221
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:24,731
Speaker 0: a lot of people play a lot of D&D in high school And then they go to college and they miss their old D&D group.

222
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:39,380
Speaker 0: if they set it up where it's really easy to play D&D specifically online a lot of people are gonna use their online service to continue to play games With their old gaming groups when they move or when they get jobs and don't have time to get together for eight hours every month.

223
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:45,160
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, it's great business, but It's it's not great as far as I'm concerned personally.

224
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:50,040
Speaker 0: But I'm glad that they're given Forgotten Realms the nod because I got to say the Greyhawk setting was crap.

225
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,186
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that straight up.

226
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:52,011
Speaker 0: It was bullshit.

227
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:52,936
Speaker 0: It was garbage.

228
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:53,519
Speaker 0: I hated it.

229
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,659
Speaker 0: It was just really bland and uninteresting and poorly thought-out.

230
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,809
Speaker 0: Forgotten Realms just for the wealth of novels and everything.

231
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,060
Speaker 0: Well, it's a high fantasy kind of la-di-da setting.

232
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:10,409
Speaker 0: It's really fucking fleshed out and I think it's a great place to run a Dungeons & Dragons Gaming if you're not gonna make your own campaign setting.

233
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,520
Speaker 1: I'm just not a real fan of any of the campaign worlds.

234
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:20,999
Speaker 0: You're not a fan of campaign settings period even if someone makes it from scratch pretty much Which I think is kind of dumb, but I'm not gonna get into that.

235
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,612
Speaker 0: And I thought Planescape was always kind of cool though a bit crap.

236
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,920
Speaker 1: Some of the ideas of the settings are okay.

237
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,600
Speaker 0: Just playing it never fleshed out.

238
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,527
Speaker 0: Well playing Planescape was always kind of eh.

239
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:37,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course granted part of that was that most of the Planescape I played was third edition and I don't like third edition.

240
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,727
Speaker 0: So it's tainted and Dark Sun.

241
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,830
Speaker 0: they just kind of abandoned.

242
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,414
Speaker 1: Dark Sun is the best idea.

243
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,076
Speaker 1: that doesn't work.

244
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:48,918
Speaker 0: and Ravenloft They just kind of abandoned which is fine because Ravenloft is a cliche boring idea.

245
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:51,228
Speaker 0: Yeah I've never played a good Ravenloft.

246
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,819
Speaker 1: The only good thing about in Ravenloft is Vecna and that's it.

247
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,083
Speaker 1: It's whatever.

248
00:18:55,444 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 0: and then there was Dragonlance and all I want to say is fuck Dragonlance.

249
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,453
Speaker 0: I'm a dude who loves dragons.

250
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:13,818
Speaker 0: anything involving dragons I'm all about and I got to say Dragonlance, which is all about dragons is One of the worst things I've ever encountered and I don't limit that to D&D or role-playing or anything.

251
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:14,560
Speaker 0: I'm talking ever.

252
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,373
Speaker 1: I don't even know much about Dragonlance, but I know it's shit.

253
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,117
Speaker 1: That's how bad it is.

254
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 1: The books are crap.

255
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,350
Speaker 1: I can smell it from a mile away how shitty it is.

256
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,880
Speaker 0: Raceland is crap, and that's all I got to say about that.

257
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:24,522
Speaker 1: All right.

258
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:26,007
Speaker 1: I've heard that name somewhere before.

259
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't bother looking up what it is.

260
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,057
Speaker 0: All right.

261
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:30,080
Speaker 1: Can I can I do stuff?

262
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,998
Speaker 0: I think you can do stuff.

263
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:36,866
Speaker 1: Okay Basically, if you haven't been paying attention It is crazy.

264
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:40,479
Speaker 1: Like we had it I was talking a week or two ago about how it's video game season.

265
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:40,740
Speaker 1: again.

266
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,948
Speaker 1: It is stupid video game season.

267
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:46,340
Speaker 1: It is like video game world series right now.

268
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,305
Speaker 1: You got your Bioshock coming.

269
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,431
Speaker 1: You got your Metroid 3 coming.

270
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:51,695
Speaker 1: It should be out.

271
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,640
Speaker 1: Everything's coming up the hell right now.

272
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:56,952
Speaker 0: Oh my god, press a press a zombies in your room.

273
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:57,715
Speaker 0: It killed your parents.

274
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,140
Speaker 1: his actions on fire, right?

275
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:09,840
Speaker 1: So it's come to my attention that you know a lot of people out there Unlike myself are not too familiar with the Metroid and they might have wheeze cuz a lot of wheeze out there.

276
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,460
Speaker 1: But you know and they this Metroid corruption is coming out and they're not quite sure what the deal is with Metroid.

277
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,611
Speaker 1: Luckily Nintendo is smart and they just put the original Metroid and Super Metroid on the Virtual Console.

278
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:29,278
Speaker 1: and I'm gonna tell you right now If you have never played Super Metroid and you don't want to emulate it or anything because even though you could why not?

279
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,953
Speaker 1: It is worth it to buy it on the Virtual Console.

280
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:37,440
Speaker 1: I never legally owned that game So I bought it on the Virtual Console for eight Wow eight dollars.

281
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:43,535
Speaker 0: I'm the dude who doesn't like Metroid games that much and I own that game Super Metroid, I'm gonna do a geek fight on this.

282
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:46,799
Speaker 1: by the way right now Is perhaps one of the best?

283
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,427
Speaker 1: five video games ever Period there is.

284
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:54,660
Speaker 1: there is nothing bad to say about Super Metroid.

285
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:59,112
Speaker 1: It is perfect in every way that that game could be.

286
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:07,995
Speaker 1: you couldn't do anything to the game to make it better except maybe Make it longer But even then the length feels just so right now before any you jump in and on Scott.

287
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,580
Speaker 0: and now the Metroid one egg was.

288
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,933
Speaker 0: That was the classic legendary.

289
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:11,257
Speaker 0: whatever.

290
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:16,033
Speaker 1: Metroid one is nostalgic and retro but it's not as good as game is.

291
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:30,139
Speaker 0: super Metroid one is a great game for the kind of purse like back in the day when Exploring the glitches of a video game and dealing with a Nintendo game and all that mystique Was still an issue in video games as a game.

292
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:31,408
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

293
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:37,479
Speaker 0: I mean it was a great revolutionary game But it wasn't that great because it was really fucking hard and it had some problems.

294
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, super Metroid is like the sake cuz.

295
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:46,860
Speaker 1: Metroid 2 if you don't know for the game boy It was for the game boy original wasn't at all like Metroid 1.

296
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,327
Speaker 1: It was like you fought Metro is all the time and you know It was sort of completely different.

297
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:54,320
Speaker 1: in a way, even though it was still sort of, you know an exploring game.

298
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,699
Speaker 1: It was much more linear and less exciting.

299
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:05,871
Speaker 1: Super Metroid was a return to the original Metroid style of play to Planet Zeebs and In full force man.

300
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,272
Speaker 0: it had one of my favorite moments in video gaming.

301
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:15,493
Speaker 0: when I'm playing the first part of that game and I'm in the same world from Metroid 1

302
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:28,301
Speaker 1: you come you fly in on your ship You land on this planet you get out of your ship you go in and you go down an elevator and you're in the place Where the head boss of Metroid 1 was and it's the same room The

303
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:31,109
Speaker 0: rotted out remains of mother brain and you

304
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,720
Speaker 1: go you go to the next room and you go to the next room and you go.

305
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,140
Speaker 1: Holy shit, it's the beginning part of Metroid 1.

306
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:47,333
Speaker 1: It's the first room and it's the exact same map that it's laid out in the same way But it looks like Samus has already been through here.

307
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:55,075
Speaker 1: Just like you were already through here in Metroid 1 Everything feels like rotted and decrepit and decayed and really cool things were decrepit and decayed in.

308
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:56,700
Speaker 1: Metroid 1 feels dusty.

309
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:17,164
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is that the all the organic stuff was cleaned out by Samus and you go in and it's cleaned out mostly But you know and then you go back and it's either these cameras they see you and then you have to go back after you get the ball and The space pirates come out and you're like, oh shit And that's how the game gets crazy.

310
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:22,100
Speaker 1: go nuts and all the organic stuff comes back and you're back to the Metroid business.

311
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:31,755
Speaker 1: basically this game if you like Finding secrets that are actually Secret and awesome not like finding a secret in Zelda.

312
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,120
Speaker 1: We're like, oh, there's a key door.

313
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,189
Speaker 1: I wonder where the key is and you find the key but like hey There's a wall the wall opened up sort of like it's.

314
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:42,018
Speaker 1: it's like a lot like finding secrets in Wolfenstein 3d.

315
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:50,720
Speaker 1: in a way It's sort of brute force But also sort of intuitive because you have this arsenal of items that you kind of know what they're just things like, huh?

316
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:55,259
Speaker 0: I just hiked for five minutes and now there's a dead end and some lava, huh?

317
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,108
Speaker 1: Or hey, that floor is cracked.

318
00:23:58,289 --> 00:23:58,991
Speaker 1: you do do do do.

319
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:00,516
Speaker 1: Ah, look what's over.

320
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:05,208
Speaker 1: there is something something or Missiles, I can see something over there.

321
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,060
Speaker 1: There has to be a way to get that missile pack up there.

322
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,520
Speaker 1: I wonder how do I come into it directly?

323
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,267
Speaker 1: Do I come into it from the other side?

324
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:15,640
Speaker 1: and you have this arsenal of weapons bombs ball?

325
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:30,669
Speaker 1: hookshot power bombs missiles super missiles and All sorts of different beams the wave beam and stuff and you use them all together in sort of non obvious but intuitive complex ways to get to different places.

326
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:35,703
Speaker 1: and Basically, the awesome thing about Metroid games is that the game doesn't direct you.

327
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:41,383
Speaker 1: you go wherever you want to go Until you do what you have to do to get to the end part

328
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:45,580
Speaker 0: and the game will in a lot of ways let you Go places that are fucking dangerous that you shouldn't be yet

329
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,654
Speaker 1: and you'll just die because you don't have what you need to handle yourself There.

330
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:51,330
Speaker 1: Oh Super Metroid is so great.

331
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,870
Speaker 1: If you haven't played Super Metroid.

332
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,094
Speaker 1: You're basically not.

333
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,864
Speaker 1: it's like not playing Zelda 1 or not playing Mario Brothers.

334
00:24:56,884 --> 00:25:00,019
Speaker 1: you if you play video games You must play it.

335
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:01,449
Speaker 1: You should play it now.

336
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:05,490
Speaker 1: Why are you listening to geek nights unless you're listening playing Metroid at the same time?

337
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,925
Speaker 1: Which you shouldn't because the music is awesome and you should be listening to it.

338
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:10,712
Speaker 1: Good God Metroid.

339
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:22,450
Speaker 1: and then you know if you like that you should probably get Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 and Metroid Prime 3 and all the Gameboy Metroids and I can't think of a bad Metroid really.

340
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:26,350
Speaker 1: I mean some are better than others, but they're all good as far as I'm concerned.

341
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,372
Speaker 0: things of the day Now.

342
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:40,507
Speaker 0: actually last night when I saw this I didn't even watch a video yet.

343
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:43,639
Speaker 0: I basically Ran into Scott's room yelling.

344
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,704
Speaker 0: All right, I got my thing of the day.

345
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:45,367
Speaker 0: You got to see this.

346
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,136
Speaker 0: Oh my god This is like.

347
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:52,076
Speaker 1: I made this my number one on dig And I made it my number one.

348
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,580
Speaker 1: it cuz it's that great.

349
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,630
Speaker 0: what this is very simply is a gentleman are our girl?

350
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,820
Speaker 0: I didn't actually look up who did a Japanese person, obviously.

351
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,181
Speaker 0: Yes.

352
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,150
Speaker 0: Well, they might have just happened to have been using the Japanese ROM.

353
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:06,075
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure Japanese first.

354
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:10,165
Speaker 0: Anyway, this person has modded Super Mario World.

355
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,250
Speaker 0: They made custom levels in Super Mario World.

356
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:14,570
Speaker 0: They didn't change anything other than making custom level.

357
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:29,630
Speaker 0: That's the Super Nintendo one where you get with Yoshi and everything and the capes Yeah, and what they did is basically make a whole bunch of Rube Goldberg machines in the game Whereby a world will start and without any control input whatsoever.

358
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:37,565
Speaker 0: Mario will make his way from the beginning to the end Without dying and not just like oh he sits on a platform the whole way.

359
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:39,970
Speaker 0: This is awesome.

360
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:42,038
Speaker 1: You just have to see it.

361
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:52,660
Speaker 1: I don't know how much I can explain it Otherwise, but if you understand Mario at all you watch this and you'll see very quickly Why I made it my number one on dig.

362
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,945
Speaker 1: and oh my god.

363
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:57,590
Speaker 0: when I saw this last night I was it was hip I watched I think there.

364
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there are a couple of videos where he cheats and like he holds down a button at some point or something.

365
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,548
Speaker 1: but other than that most of them are.

366
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:08,885
Speaker 1: And it's like you think oh, there's only so many different mechanisms.

367
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:09,669
Speaker 1: He could come up with.

368
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,846
Speaker 1: no He keeps coming up with new mechanisms all the time.

369
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:13,610
Speaker 1: It's like holy shit.

370
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,696
Speaker 1: He came up with something different.

371
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,078
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

372
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:15,962
Speaker 1: He gave us something different.

373
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,450
Speaker 0: This is real impressive.

374
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,299
Speaker 0: It's impressive one because it's really cool what he sets up.

375
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:31,690
Speaker 0: It's impressive too because it shows you the Tolerances and the precision that is in that game Super Mario World because he sets these things up extremely precisely.

376
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,229
Speaker 1: Well, that's what makes you know That's it.

377
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:44,922
Speaker 1: Basically, I think the thing that with this video does for you is if you don't understand why some platform game and flash is kind Crappy and why Mario is awesome when on the surface.

378
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,930
Speaker 1: They both look like platform games.

379
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:55,977
Speaker 1: This will show you the reason that Mario games in particular are so far above and beyond other Jumping platform games.

380
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,330
Speaker 1: It's just the way the system the game works.

381
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:03,206
Speaker 1: It's just so far above and beyond what anyone else has tried to do.

382
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:08,996
Speaker 0: and three The idea the sheer idea of it of all right.

383
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:14,037
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a Rube Goldberg machine and Pre-existing video game.

384
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,301
Speaker 0: that's hot.

385
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:17,810
Speaker 0: that idea is solid platinum.

386
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,929
Speaker 1: Someone's got to try to do this with some other games.

387
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:29,923
Speaker 0: No Not only that the only thing I want to see because at first when I saw this I thought he set him up in The game without doing anything like in levels that existed.

388
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:31,148
Speaker 0: Oh, it's crazy.

389
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:31,810
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

390
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,846
Speaker 0: But then I watched the first one and I'm like, I don't remember that level.

391
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,978
Speaker 0: Oh But that does not diminish the awesomeness of.

392
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,690
Speaker 0: no it doesn't at all because what I'm asking for may be impossible.

393
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:42,930
Speaker 1: It's impossible.

394
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:45,401
Speaker 0: There might be some crazy game.

395
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:48,777
Speaker 1: Maybe some physics game Perhaps but not in Mario.

396
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:51,090
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is pretty badass and that's all I have to say.

397
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,155
Speaker 0: It's super badass.

398
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:52,858
Speaker 0: Check it out.

399
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:57,277
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is a Skit from Saturday Night Live.

400
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,108
Speaker 1: Let's not talk about Saturday Night Live for like 20 minutes here.

401
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:01,333
Speaker 0: No, no Let's just skip that.

402
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,840
Speaker 0: We'll probably do a show about it someday.

403
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:05,835
Speaker 1: Even though I didn't watch it that much in my life I watched a lot.

404
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:06,881
Speaker 0: I've seen like four different.

405
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:07,344
Speaker 1: All right.

406
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:08,329
Speaker 1: I said we're not gonna do this.

407
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:16,232
Speaker 1: So this sketch is a funny sketch called the first person in the world to ever dance ever so.

408
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:21,289
Speaker 1: obviously it cuts to two cavemen and you know that one of the cavemen is gonna dance at least.

409
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:28,192
Speaker 1: and Let me just say this is funny because they bring in an anachronism and you go Oh, man The anachronism.

410
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:35,833
Speaker 1: and then the dancing itself is funny and then there's another anachronism and that's the win To me.

411
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:36,415
Speaker 0: what did it?

412
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:44,774
Speaker 0: for me is that it's kind of like when I used to live with two cats in Poughkeepsie on the top of a mountain and I had a laser pen.

413
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,127
Speaker 0: and you know cat plus laser pen is like better than a DS.

414
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:48,689
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

415
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,060
Speaker 1: So two DS's.

416
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:55,410
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was But one of the cats could see the laser pen dot and one of them could not.

417
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,115
Speaker 0: The cat wasn't blind.

418
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:01,510
Speaker 0: It just could not see the laser pen dot and never reacted to it.

419
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:02,589
Speaker 1: Maybe it just didn't care.

420
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:08,092
Speaker 0: The thing is it reacted to flashlights and all sorts of other things and it reacted to a green laser pen Uh-huh.

421
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:13,736
Speaker 0: But anyway, so whenever I'd play with the laser pen, the one cat would be like, oh my god There's not.

422
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:14,242
Speaker 0: I go get it.

423
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:15,493
Speaker 0: Oh my god It's a dot.

424
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:20,889
Speaker 0: I gotta go get it and the other cat would just stare at that cat Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

425
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,173
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

426
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:28,836
Speaker 0: and the cat would always kind of walk over and like paw at the cat like stop it You're weirding me out just stop it.

427
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:33,150
Speaker 0: and that is exactly what the caveman's companion is doing to him while he's dancing.

428
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:38,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what he's doing right there because obviously the one caveman does not does not hear the music.

429
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:53,750
Speaker 1: I think what also makes this funny is how the a lot of people in this world they feel awkward dancing, especially when other people are not dancing and this sort of Takes a modern-day feeling and puts it in a caveman setting which is very entertaining.

430
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:05,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also kind of this inspirational message of if you hear music Metaphorically or not dance to it regardless of whether a caveman is throwing sticks at your feet or it's just funny.

431
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:06,446
Speaker 1: Cuz this is that an in live sketch.

432
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:17,770
Speaker 0: Yeah well Just this is one of those few SNL sketches that was just so perfect because the music starts coming in and I'm not gonna say What song it is, but it's the perfect song for this sketch.

433
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:23,209
Speaker 1: I'm sure half our listeners can actually name the song and half can't because I know the name of the song and rim doesn't.

434
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,382
Speaker 0: I Didn't actually know the name of the song, but I knew who did it.

435
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:26,590
Speaker 1: You didn't pronounce it correctly.

436
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,130
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't I know mostly because people have mp3 files that don't give you the accent on the last letter.

437
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:35,429
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I didn't realize there was an accent there until just now.

438
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:49,747
Speaker 0: Yep, but the look on the caveman who dances face when the music starts coming in and he realizes It's kind of like when the monkey in 2001 picks up that thing and realizes that he can hit other monkeys with it.

439
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,936
Speaker 0: Mmm It was that kind of moment.

440
00:31:52,278 --> 00:32:04,463
Speaker 0: But anyway, speaking of cavemen tonight we're gonna talk about the ancient Greeks because we have played a game that is basically a Perfect simulation of life in ancient ancient ancient Mediterranean cultures.

441
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:05,546
Speaker 1: Well, the game isn't.

442
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:09,865
Speaker 1: I was being funny Yes, but the game isn't specifically Greek, but it is.

443
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,473
Speaker 1: it is There's.

444
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:16,270
Speaker 1: no it's not a specifically Greek themed game, but it kind of fits the gameplay.

445
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,278
Speaker 0: It is very much early.

446
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:21,150
Speaker 0: early like Bronze Age if not earlier.

447
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:31,661
Speaker 1: Mediterranean culture like all the way up until airplanes like I might even say pre-dorian invasion Greeks Yep, all the way up until airplanes and trains and all that other kind of.

448
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,844
Speaker 0: but it doesn't really.

449
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,260
Speaker 1: it doesn't really but that on The board there's a picture of an airplane at the end of the game.

450
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,390
Speaker 0: now when I say that this is a perfect simulation of Life back then I'm gonna sum the game.

451
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:47,015
Speaker 0: The game is called tempus or temp this if you want to be funny because they write that you like a V and it's all Stylized.

452
00:32:47,298 --> 00:33:00,283
Speaker 0: Yep tempus if The game is basically you control a culture and your options throughout time in this culture are Sit around and think you know think about things.

453
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:06,474
Speaker 0: Yep make babies Yep, send those babies off to die in war Move around.

454
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:09,343
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah move the babies around usually with the objective.

455
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:14,510
Speaker 0: You can move around with or without war Yeah, but you're gonna have some war eventually and you can build cities.

456
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:25,126
Speaker 0: You can try to build cities But mostly you're gonna spend your time making babies moving them around and making babies moving babies making babies moving thinking about stuff Thinking think make move think make move.

457
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:25,408
Speaker 1: Yeah.

458
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,890
Speaker 1: So the way the game works, it's kind of awesome.

459
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,530
Speaker 1: The first awesome thing in the game is the map because the map you get to make the map which is super fun.

460
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,705
Speaker 0: Yes, there's a system where you have a bunch of these hexes and there's big blob.

461
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:45,050
Speaker 0: There are a lot like the pieces in Attica Yeah, and then there's big blobs of hexes and you go around and take churches putting them out there.

462
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,190
Speaker 1: So someone the first person puts out the first map tile and the second person puts at the second map tile.

463
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,452
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like a Strategy of.

464
00:33:53,833 --> 00:34:04,450
Speaker 1: I want to make it so that there's a good spot on the board for me and not good spots on the board For the other people, but if you're like going third you want to make sure there's gonna be three good spots.

465
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,298
Speaker 1: That way you get a good spot no matter what.

466
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:09,270
Speaker 0: the rules for placement are really really minimal and you can do a lot.

467
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,755
Speaker 0: You're just constrained by the board.

468
00:34:10,956 --> 00:34:17,842
Speaker 0: Yep, and I just got a point out that in our group the front row crew We have never played this game like the first time we played.

469
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:25,730
Speaker 0: of course the absolute Most crazy least likely most broken map is what we made every time.

470
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:34,810
Speaker 1: Yeah basically We try to make the silliest most Far out map instead of making a normal map where we just kind of put the tiles together nicely made for some interesting games.

471
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,840
Speaker 1: Did they also sort of made for some broken games?

472
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:45,750
Speaker 1: if if the map is made in a certain way Then you the person who gets to go and put their guys in the board first could have a huge advantage.

473
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:51,370
Speaker 1: You know, for example the first time we ever played I wasn't really thinking about the initial placement not thinking it was so important.

474
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:52,896
Speaker 1: It's stupidly important.

475
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:53,960
Speaker 0: I went first.

476
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,208
Speaker 0: He's like, this is the best spot and it wasn't.

477
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:56,690
Speaker 1: it was shit.

478
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:57,799
Speaker 0: well, it was the best spot.

479
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:06,090
Speaker 1: if no one else was playing I Guess but basically what happened was because the way the map was I'd never played before and they had.

480
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:12,724
Speaker 1: They just cut off huge sections of the board for themselves and I was stuck sort of in the middle Not being able to get around so much.

481
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:21,430
Speaker 0: it was great Make enough babies just got kind of goes raw and tries to bust through my lines and fails and then he goes And tries to bust through Alex's lines.

482
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,369
Speaker 0: But by then Alex has built up and Scott was weakened from fighting with me and it failed.

483
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:26,733
Speaker 1: That was the end.

484
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,558
Speaker 1: I learned my lesson in the future games.

485
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,020
Speaker 1: Yep.

486
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,246
Speaker 0: The game is really fun.

487
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:52,843
Speaker 0: I'll say right now I don't think it's a very enduring game in terms of being very indicative of these relative skills of players because the game in the end is Gonna come down to a lot of randomness, but it speaks Well of the game that I really really enjoy playing it Even though I feel like there's a lot of randomness that I can't do a lot about.

488
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:53,004
Speaker 0: Yeah.

489
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:54,930
Speaker 1: It's definitely a good game.

490
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,018
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say it's like some great amazing game.

491
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,231
Speaker 1: I do enjoy playing it depending on the mood, you know It's like.

492
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:04,710
Speaker 1: sometimes they'll be like I don't want to play tempest, but sometimes it's like yeah, let's play tempest.

493
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:14,486
Speaker 0: All right tempest is really the middle ground between for us at least a light game and a heavy game because It has a lot of the elements of a heavy game in all the decision-making.

494
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:30,350
Speaker 0: you have a lot of options There's a lot of rounds but at the same time it's a light game because while you have a lot of options a lot of decisions to make the Conflict resolution system and the results of the decisions you make are extremely straightforward and extremely simple to calculate.

495
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:36,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically the game was billed originally as being like hey a civilization game That is very.

496
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:39,810
Speaker 1: that doesn't take so long, you know, and everyone loves civilization games.

497
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:42,648
Speaker 1: So one that doesn't take so long is like holy shit.

498
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,521
Speaker 1: The civilization games usually take like five hours.

499
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:49,956
Speaker 1: if there's one that takes like less than two hours That's amazing and this does.

500
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:55,130
Speaker 1: it is a civilization game that takes less than two hours and in that it is awesome.

501
00:36:55,692 --> 00:37:01,090
Speaker 1: However, when you make a civilization game that only takes two hours something has to be cut back.

502
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:06,938
Speaker 1: So it does not contain everything that a full-on Civilization game has and thus is missing.

503
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,730
Speaker 1: it feels like it is missing something that the full civilization games do have.

504
00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:31,370
Speaker 0: So the basic gist of this game is that you know, there's the territory little hexes with a little You know different kinds of land like forests and agriculture and mountains or whatever and you start with some little discs which are your guys and you put them out there and every turn Every player gets a number of actions and you go around just clockwise.

505
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:32,956
Speaker 0: So I take my first action.

506
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:39,279
Speaker 0: Scott takes his first action Alex takes his first action Emily takes her first action I take my second action and we keep going around.

507
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:39,921
Speaker 0: now.

508
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:45,643
Speaker 0: the tricky thing is there are ways where sometimes People will have more actions than other people.

509
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,390
Speaker 1: dumb dumb dumb, that's how you win.

510
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:57,337
Speaker 1: I always try to get as many actions as I can because Even if I do things less efficiently than other people if I do more things Period when the game by the time the game is done.

511
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:58,781
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna win.

512
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:01,830
Speaker 0: now the actions you can take our thing.

513
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:12,140
Speaker 0: They're very very very simple and they come down to things like have ideas which is draw some cards and keep them in your hand or Make babies.

514
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:20,073
Speaker 0: put more guys out there but you can only do that on certain types of terrain and there's limits on how many guys you can put out or Move guys.

515
00:38:20,494 --> 00:38:25,888
Speaker 0: the slow laborious and terrible process of moving guys hex by hex around the map.

516
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:31,486
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it sucks moving guys or wage war and I love this.

517
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,412
Speaker 0: the conflict resolution I mean remember.

518
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:37,924
Speaker 0: earlier I said that this game kind of fills this niche for us of.

519
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:46,170
Speaker 0: we like the really hardcore games But not when we're really tired and we like to really like games sometimes and but not when we're all awake.

520
00:38:46,330 --> 00:39:03,064
Speaker 0: Tempest is like the perfect middle-ground game because it has all the decision-making and all the feel of a hardcore game But the decisions you make are simple and the conflicts arising from them are resolved Very very in a very straightforward and easy manner.

521
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:04,250
Speaker 0: and that's it.

522
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever has more guys wins, but you can use cards to help you end of story.

523
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:19,164
Speaker 0: Yep, so you can move guys around and it comes down to you have to decide what you want and spend your actions as efficiently As you can to get it all the while taking risks.

524
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:29,866
Speaker 0: things like alright I can move in next to Alex and grab some of his territory early But he might just attack me and if he has good cards, I'm fucked.

525
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,948
Speaker 0: I gotta take that chance though It's too good to pass up.

526
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:38,485
Speaker 1: Yeah Generally a lot of the feeling I get when I play the game is I want to do something But I don't want to.

527
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:46,569
Speaker 1: you know It'll take maybe more than one action to get it done usually when moving guys because as rim said Moving guys is very slow.

528
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:48,797
Speaker 1: So I'll move some guys am I?

529
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:56,970
Speaker 1: I'll have an end goal in mind of where I want the guys to be But the intermediate states because it's gonna take like two or three move actions

530
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:04,808
Speaker 0: And you only get like if you only get four actions in a turn and it takes you three Actions just to set up the thing you wanted to do.

531
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:11,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so I'm gonna spend a bunch of actions to make this thing happen that I want to happen.

532
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,590
Speaker 1: but all the intermediate states I'm vulnerable.

533
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:31,019
Speaker 1: So I got to figure out either a way to not be vulnerable or a different goal or something So that I don't take the chance of someone else just ruining what I'm doing in the middle of it for ruining like You know my whole turn and screwing up my whole game

534
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,881
Speaker 0: now on one

535
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:32,744
Speaker 1: hand that

536
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:37,958
Speaker 0: it kind of has this age of steam feel I'll get to that in a second in that the game.

537
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:44,398
Speaker 0: you can get so little accomplished with each action that it feels like just This war against the game.

538
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,303
Speaker 0: to get anything done.

539
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,690
Speaker 0: you want to get that land.

540
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:47,929
Speaker 0: That's in the next hex over.

541
00:40:48,492 --> 00:41:00,290
Speaker 0: You got to make a baby and move and move and move and then make another baby and move and it's gonna take you multiple turns to do it, but Everyone has the exact same limitations like everyone has to deal with the same crap.

542
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:04,926
Speaker 0: So while I feel like ah, I gotta waste four actions to get over there.

543
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:09,033
Speaker 0: Well, ah Scott has to waste four actions to do the thing He's trying to do.

544
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:18,130
Speaker 1: I kind of like this because when I'm when I play civilization, too I'm the kind of person who likes to not talk to the other civilizations or meet them for a long time.

545
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:25,695
Speaker 1: I just send out a bunch of settlers without worrying about it and build a nice big Empire and build a bunch of stuff and Then interact with the other people.

546
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:41,670
Speaker 1: so when you play a game like this and everyone is forced to go really slowly Even on a cramped board you sort of get to do some business before you have to worry about the other people Which is which is nice because it's like ah, I'm not suddenly attacked by a giant monster before I set up my stuff.

547
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:44,330
Speaker 0: Hooray, no, I said combat is really straightforward.

548
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,935
Speaker 0: It really just comes down to you don't want to.

549
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,422
Speaker 0: it's not a game like conquer everyone.

550
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:50,930
Speaker 0: combat is quick brutal and dangerous.

551
00:41:51,612 --> 00:42:00,089
Speaker 0: You could lose a lot of babies and all it is is if you have a stack of guys and you want to attack another Stack of guys or a city whoever has the most guys wins and that's it.

552
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:02,266
Speaker 0: And the only way to augment that is.

553
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:03,353
Speaker 0: we say, you know There's cards.

554
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,389
Speaker 0: when you have ideas you draw cards and you keep the card secret.

555
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,454
Speaker 0: cards serve two purposes.

556
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:18,470
Speaker 0: on one hand all the cards will match different terrain out there and in general in combat or in Innovation which we'll talk about last because that's the coolest part.

557
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,216
Speaker 1: That's what makes the game awesome.

558
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:24,710
Speaker 0: one card no matter what it says counts for one thing if it matches the territory.

559
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,815
Speaker 0: That's relevant at the time.

560
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:32,590
Speaker 0: So if I'm attacking a Plains all my Plains cards I can play to add plus one to my stack.

561
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:37,749
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's sort of random because when you have ideas you just get cards and you have no idea what they're gonna be.

562
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:47,929
Speaker 1: So you sort of in one hand you have to play on the board and then get enough ideas So that you have cards that will help you do what you want to do.

563
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:56,290
Speaker 1: But on the other hand you can have ideas and then sort of change your plan so that you can use your ideas To get the most effect on the board.

564
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:04,100
Speaker 1: Maybe there was a one strategy that be the best but all your ideas are for a different kind of terrain and they one Of them lets you do something special.

565
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,670
Speaker 1: So you go and do something else instead.

566
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:12,010
Speaker 0: Yeah Now at the same time the cards have this other purpose and that you can play them during your turn to do stuff.

567
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:18,170
Speaker 0: So in addition to just using them in combat instead there's cards that give you like a super bonus to defend.

568
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:31,365
Speaker 1: So you'll see sitting there with like a card and the card might say something like I don't know The religion one which lets you steal a guy from someone else All right But it's a forest and someone's attacking you in a forest.

569
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:47,956
Speaker 1: so you can either save this for later to religion someone which is awesome or Add one defense right now and it's like ah, I can't do both But sometimes you can do both like let's say you have a card that says add two to defense and it's a plains and you're Defending on a plains.

570
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:48,740
Speaker 1: Guess what?

571
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,449
Speaker 1: It adds three to defense on the plains.

572
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,707
Speaker 0: So the part of the game that I really want to talk about because this is what makes this

573
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:55,850
Speaker 1: is what makes the game Awesome

574
00:43:56,311 --> 00:44:05,590
Speaker 0: There is this innovation track because the game there's a track that everyone will go down from the top to the bottom and it lists All the limitations and abilities of all the players.

575
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:12,390
Speaker 0: So like the number of cards you get when you take ideas the number of babies you get when you do baby, right?

576
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:18,042
Speaker 1: So at the very beginning of the game, right if you make babies you make like one baby And if you have ideas you get one idea.

577
00:44:18,062 --> 00:44:21,357
Speaker 1: and if you move guys You can move like one guy one space.

578
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:22,161
Speaker 1: All right, and that's it.

579
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,610
Speaker 1: The technology is caveman technology.

580
00:44:24,975 --> 00:44:27,836
Speaker 1: You can't do a lot There's very little your guys can do.

581
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:35,661
Speaker 1: at the end of the game if you choose the action of say move people You can move like three guys five up to five spaces each.

582
00:44:36,002 --> 00:44:37,385
Speaker 1: You can make three babies.

583
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:39,050
Speaker 1: You can have three ideas.

584
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,958
Speaker 0: I think you can only ever make two babies.

585
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,469
Speaker 1: two babies, but you a lot more than one.

586
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, they all these attributes go up in the tech tree.

587
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:53,229
Speaker 1: So the higher technology you have when you spend an action the more you can do with one action.

588
00:44:53,330 --> 00:45:04,178
Speaker 0: now The really cool thing about the tech tree is that there can be Disparities in tech because the way it works is the tree goes down and every step of the way Has a kind of terrain next to it.

589
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:12,109
Speaker 0: and at the end of every set of turns before we do the next set We innovate we go to each player clockwise and we count how many?

590
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:17,126
Speaker 0: Tiles or how many hexes of the terrain that the next advancement requires.

591
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:18,290
Speaker 1: a let I have right?

592
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:25,418
Speaker 1: so let's say the next advancement is is trains which lets you move a lot of guys, right and We look at it and we say okay.

593
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:28,070
Speaker 1: It's forests who has the most forest?

594
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:36,629
Speaker 0: So we look at me and I have three forests and I have four Forests and Alex has one forest and two cities because cities count as anything.

595
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:40,483
Speaker 1: Yep So it's four three and three, but I have no cards.

596
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:42,250
Speaker 0: now see that's the other thing.

597
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:44,219
Speaker 0: I said you can play cards in combat.

598
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:49,310
Speaker 0: You can also play cards and innovating and The way it works and in combat is the same way.

599
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,241
Speaker 0: This is another one of the cool things that makes this game.

600
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:56,109
Speaker 0: when you play cards You declare how many you're playing and you don't show them.

601
00:45:56,572 --> 00:45:59,044
Speaker 0: so in the innovating part, let's say it's come to know.

602
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:02,995
Speaker 0: we all look at the board and Scott has three forests and I have four.

603
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:06,201
Speaker 0: I have three cards in my hand and Scott doesn't know what they are.

604
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:20,187
Speaker 0: I Have what four cities or four points toward innovation and I have played two cards which could be like anywhere from zero to four point.

605
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:21,813
Speaker 0: because there's no guarantee What card I played.

606
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:23,700
Speaker 0: I can play a totally irrelevant card.

607
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:28,943
Speaker 1: I lose the card, but I can bluff Yep, and then it's up to me to decide.

608
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,510
Speaker 1: Well, do I think he's bluffing?

609
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,449
Speaker 1: Am I gonna spend cards that might not do anything at all for me?

610
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,894
Speaker 1: What am I gonna do here?

611
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:42,558
Speaker 1: and then whoever has the most and if there's a tie it doesn't matter you both win Gets to advance on the track.

612
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:45,508
Speaker 0: So but you can only have a disparity of one at every given time.

613
00:46:45,548 --> 00:46:55,370
Speaker 1: Yes so what happens basically is every time Everyone goes up to the highest level that you're at currently and then whoever has the most jumps forward.

614
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:04,890
Speaker 1: So you people are either gonna be at the default level or one step up and there's no way to be one step up The entire game unless everyone else sucks.

615
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:10,210
Speaker 0: It's pretty much set up to where You're gonna have to look at the track and look at where you started and look at your cards.

616
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:15,168
Speaker 0: And like a really good strategy is to forego a couple of advancements to get the big one.

617
00:47:15,188 --> 00:47:17,609
Speaker 1: You really wanted Yep, so like I'll wait and I'll know.

618
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:24,530
Speaker 1: Alright, if I get if I advance now, I will get one more action than everyone else in the game.

619
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:28,341
Speaker 1: So that's way more important to me than that other advancement which would have.

620
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:29,826
Speaker 1: let me have one more baby.

621
00:47:30,107 --> 00:47:32,577
Speaker 0: now advancement happens No matter what the game.

622
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,910
Speaker 0: every round everyone advances.

623
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,642
Speaker 0: The question is just some people advance more.

624
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:39,550
Speaker 0: that round like everyone catches up.

625
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,116
Speaker 0: So that's how the game ends.

626
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:44,550
Speaker 0: you follow the tech tree to the end and then the game's over.

627
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:48,421
Speaker 1: But some people they figure out airplanes and some people don't.

628
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:49,323
Speaker 0: well airplanes.

629
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,670
Speaker 0: at the end is just there's one final tech advance.

630
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:55,725
Speaker 0: Whoever wins the last innovation gets three victory points, which is big.

631
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:56,990
Speaker 1: that's made the difference before.

632
00:47:57,271 --> 00:47:57,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has.

633
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,219
Speaker 1: I would have won except on time.

634
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,650
Speaker 1: Alex got the airplanes and I lost the game.

635
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:03,741
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I could really say about it.

636
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:05,289
Speaker 0: It's just it's really fun.

637
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:08,130
Speaker 0: It seems to kind of play out in three stages.

638
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:13,490
Speaker 0: We're in the first part of the game is like posturing and you set up and you decide what you're gonna do and yay.

639
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:20,994
Speaker 0: And then the second part of the game is the borders kind of stabilize as everyone gets out to the limits of their influence and power.

640
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,222
Speaker 0: and then there's the jockeying for control.

641
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,573
Speaker 0: and then the third phase of the game is Balls out.

642
00:48:26,754 --> 00:48:32,150
Speaker 0: everyone takes out the crazy strategy that they've been trying to secretly put together through the first two stages.

643
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:34,190
Speaker 1: Yeah I noticed it being a little different than that.

644
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:40,550
Speaker 1: I've noticed it being the first part everyone sort of gets ready and the second part everyone executes their crazy strategy.

645
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:40,891
Speaker 1: You know.

646
00:48:40,912 --> 00:48:45,290
Speaker 1: third part people just try to scrape up all the remaining points in the second part.

647
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:48,130
Speaker 0: It's not like the crazy hidden strategy It's just alright.

648
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:56,645
Speaker 0: I have now come into contact with Alex's civilization and Scott's civilization and the whole second part of the game is Dealing with that trying to move your guys around.

649
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:59,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what the Last part is.

650
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:02,365
Speaker 1: just there's only like ten points available left on the board.

651
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,890
Speaker 1: scrape them up if you can.

652
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,370
Speaker 0: The third part of the game is where maybe I should have been more clear.

653
00:49:06,772 --> 00:49:11,370
Speaker 0: The second part of the game is the standard fighting against other players moving around strategies.

654
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:15,950
Speaker 0: But it seems like the third part of the game is when everyone has at least one.

655
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:19,023
Speaker 0: Alright, I got this crazy idea.

656
00:49:19,244 --> 00:49:21,654
Speaker 0: Well, if I pull it off I'm gonna bust up.

657
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:34,803
Speaker 1: eventually happens is after everyone scrapes up the remaining points on the board There's still a little bit of game left and you you there's ways in which you can take big risks For possible reward because there's no other rewards to get.

658
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:36,350
Speaker 1: there's only so many rewards left.

659
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:42,450
Speaker 1: So people are willing to sacrifice things to get those rewards because you're not gonna use those resources anywhere else.

660
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,318
Speaker 1: Where are you gonna use them?

661
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:44,408
Speaker 1: There's no other place to go.

662
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:45,994
Speaker 0: Now this game.

663
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:51,770
Speaker 0: I mentioned before that the game feels like it's constantly holding you back a lot like age of steam.

664
00:49:52,452 --> 00:50:02,530
Speaker 0: Well, this game was designed by a man named Martin Wallace who is responsible for such games as age of steam Just team third edition age of steam expansion

665
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:05,713
Speaker 1: Railroad

666
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:09,049
Speaker 0: tycoon and I'm curious about this game called age of arguments, but I

667
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:12,276
Speaker 1: Gotta buy that game just for the game.

668
00:50:12,296 --> 00:50:14,624
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks super ghetto.

669
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,570
Speaker 0: Oh, it is super ghetto.

670
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:18,413
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

671
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:21,163
Speaker 0: I might have this is this ghetto is thing I've ever seen.

672
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:21,865
Speaker 0: It's kind of cute.

673
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:26,455
Speaker 1: Oh my Anyway tempest is.

674
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:37,990
Speaker 0: it's not the greatest game ever, but it's a pretty good game, especially if you like to make babies and Sit around and have ideas and throw babies at walls of death as you try to take over cities and fail.

675
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:49,838
Speaker 1: yeah, if you like civilization games, but you don't want to spend many hours and you're willing to sacrifice the folks, you know, the Complete fullness of a full-on civilization.

676
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:50,139
Speaker 0: You know what.

677
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:51,122
Speaker 0: I'll go one step further.

678
00:50:51,142 --> 00:51:05,703
Speaker 0: I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played all the beginner basic intro level German board games and you want a game that'll kind of Bring you into the more complex games without hitting you over the head immediately.

679
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game definitely does that that's for sure.

680
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,430
Speaker 0: This is a good transition between the carcass owns and the settlers.

681
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:16,250
Speaker 1: It puts on a friendly face, but there's more to it than that, but not so much that it'll scare you.

682
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,569
Speaker 0: It's not the Tigers and Euphrates in the Puerto Rico.

683
00:51:18,903 --> 00:51:19,391
Speaker 1: No It's not.

684
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:24,270
Speaker 0: but it'll prepare you for those games kind of in the sense that you'll get used to the mechanics.

685
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:28,510
Speaker 0: You got to play pretty much one of these games and then one of those wooden cube games and then you're ready.

686
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:34,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, this will help you out with sort of the the action mechanic, which is prevalent in a lot of games like to call and such.

687
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:36,537
Speaker 0: Alright, I think that's the end of that.

688
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:38,163
Speaker 0: there may or may not be a show tomorrow.

689
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:39,106
Speaker 0: Most likely there will.

690
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:41,033
Speaker 0: it's probably going to Be something special.

691
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:48,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, it all depends on if my dad suddenly flies into New York City tomorrow Depends on my work and their party.

692
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:54,450
