1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,768
Speaker 0: It's Monday November 21st 2011.

2
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:12,229
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:15,196
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,040
Speaker 0: how to get around the SOPA.

5
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:21,987
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,097
Speaker 0: This past weekend.

7
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:28,698
Speaker 0: We played a game.

8
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:30,720
Speaker 0: We have not played in many moons.

9
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,907
Speaker 0: Played the game called Shogun.

10
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:34,894
Speaker 1: Hey used to be called Shogun.

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,600
Speaker 0: It's like samurai sword.

12
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,649
Speaker 1: It's like three other games called Shogun.

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:51,640
Speaker 1: I know this is the Milton Bradley game master series samurai sword slash Shogun one of the finer Games in the genre better than axis and allies or risk or any of the oh.

14
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:59,290
Speaker 1: But there I did sort of finally fully realize the one fatal flaw in this game Which is it sort of has the same problem, and it is a minor problem.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,158
Speaker 0: the second to last loser chooses the winner.

16
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,250
Speaker 1: well It's sort of the same problem is counter-strike.

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,019
Speaker 1: right I go up to a guy and I go.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,084
Speaker 1: But a bit of but a bit of.

19
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:11,449
Speaker 1: but I came down to 99 health and then some guy gets a headshot on me Yo.

20
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:19,114
Speaker 1: And then some other dude just sort of go is shooting like a crazy guy Right all over the place in a stray bullet hits this dude in the foot.

21
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:24,473
Speaker 1: that guy gets a kill And I get bupkis even though I did 99 damage and that guy did one damage.

22
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:32,180
Speaker 0: granted in this case Scott You were doing okay, but I was pretty much the undisputed master of Japan.

23
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:34,373
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I'm pretty fucking early on.

24
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:44,048
Speaker 1: the thing that samurai swords does that's sort of cool is that if you kill someone's last daimyo you get their whole empire as now part of yours and That is usually.

25
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,720
Speaker 1: if you do that That's enough to win you the game because now you basically just double the size of your thing and you win immediately.

26
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,672
Speaker 1: So if so for example right Pete had three daimyo's.

27
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,598
Speaker 1: everyone has three daimyo's rim.

28
00:01:57,638 --> 00:02:00,265
Speaker 0: killed one Yeah, because he left it hanging out.

29
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,311
Speaker 1: then the general degree his other.

30
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,474
Speaker 0: I betrayed him.

31
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,460
Speaker 1: his other two were incredibly vulnerable.

32
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,380
Speaker 1: So I had to make a move on one of them because he just killed one of mine.

33
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:12,420
Speaker 1: So I destroyed one of his just boom it was totally wasted.

34
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:17,040
Speaker 0: Both have two daimyo's each, and I'm you also had two daimyo's.

35
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:20,620
Speaker 0: Well the thing is I only lost one because I was a dumbass.

36
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,393
Speaker 1: You killed Pete's final daimyo which allowed you to win.

37
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:29,760
Speaker 1: if I had killed Pete's final daimyo Which I was fully capable of doing I would have won.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,675
Speaker 1: But Pete chose to move his final daimyo to your side of the board.

39
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:34,799
Speaker 0: He made a very good gambit.

40
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,183
Speaker 0: you Pussy'd out.

41
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:40,772
Speaker 0: you had all your two daimyo's hidden in the corner in your basey area In forts.

42
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:45,573
Speaker 0: Yeah Meanwhile Scott's or Pete's daimyo went out and he went near me.

43
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:53,425
Speaker 0: because what you should have done is chased him sooner because if you've been More aggressive he would have been there and my daimyo and your daimyo would have been there And then it would have been.

44
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:57,000
Speaker 0: I probably would have ninja'd and or preemptively attacked your daimyo.

45
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:04,910
Speaker 1: Also, I do want to point out there was an extreme luck factor Twice and it got revenged twice.

46
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,870
Speaker 1: the odds of a successful revenge ninja are 1/3 Times 1/3 one out of nine one.

47
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,604
Speaker 1: so two times in a row the one out of nine chance Occurred one.

48
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:21,040
Speaker 0: I never used the ninja because ninja socks - there was a one out of it.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,847
Speaker 1: It was an eight out of nine chance.

50
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,172
Speaker 1: that would not have happened.

51
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,923
Speaker 1: and it happened two times God.

52
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:33,174
Speaker 0: both times you ninja'd me when I wasn't even going after but if I had Succeeded I would have gotten you.

53
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,300
Speaker 1: you would have been toast.

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,969
Speaker 1: I would have won either one of those roles succeeded.

55
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:37,792
Speaker 1: I would have won the game.

56
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:39,216
Speaker 0: I highly doubt.

57
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,240
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,492
Speaker 0: God you let me consolidate in those islands that basically fucked you from the.

59
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:47,469
Speaker 1: I couldn't because I was I all of my Starting cards on the other side of the board.

60
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:55,940
Speaker 0: so the real reason I won is because Pete Let me consolidate on those islands in return for me giving him some bullshit that I then took back from him anyway.

61
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,011
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, that's how that game goes.

62
00:03:59,031 --> 00:03:59,795
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

63
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:00,357
Speaker 0: It's Monday.

64
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:01,000
Speaker 0: It's news day.

65
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,273
Speaker 1: I just got one sort of crazy news crazy.

66
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:04,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of weird.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:14,260
Speaker 1: So people might not know this right but some companies Apple being the chief among them Right do not allow their products to be discounted under any circumstance.

68
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:24,100
Speaker 1: This is why even on the blackest of Black Friday's in the heart of blackest America Right, you will not see an iPod for even one dollar below manufacturers.

69
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:33,327
Speaker 0: This is bullshit and you'll see it a lot on Newegg and Amazon where they'll say like you'll see a product and it says Price can't be displayed because the.

70
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 0: basically the agreement is that they can't display the price and continue to sell products from that company.

71
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:51,060
Speaker 0: but They get around it by you click on it and it quote unquote Adds it to your cart and shows you the price and then gives you the option to immediately remove it from your cart But it prevents competition and that you can't search for those prices, right?

72
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,638
Speaker 1: Even even without the C pricing cart.

73
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:59,172
Speaker 1: BS right Apple has been known to where like if you were to sell.

74
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:07,380
Speaker 1: if you were to buy iPods from Apple because you're a Digital electronic store you buy a bunch of iPods from Apple and then you sell them for 10 bucks off.

75
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:10,520
Speaker 1: Apple would never sell you an iPod or any Apple product ever again.

76
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:18,960
Speaker 1: They blacklist you and you would never be able to stock their things ever not even little converti cables Because they would just cut you off because they never want anything of theirs to be sold at even a 1 cent discount.

77
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:26,372
Speaker 1: Best buy right now has MacBook Airs with C price in cart for $200 off for the 13-inch.

78
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,183
Speaker 1: Whoa It's crazy.

79
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,787
Speaker 1: Is this because Steve Jobs is dead?

80
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:32,409
Speaker 1: I don't know.

81
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:33,151
Speaker 1: They've also got.

82
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,335
Speaker 1: they've also got the 11-inch for $60 off.

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,046
Speaker 1: Here's what I was about to say pricing card.

84
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:46,680
Speaker 0: had I been a big distributor as in one that Apple couldn't just ignore I would have bought in bulk and then just discounted anyway and said alright.

85
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,354
Speaker 1: I think though I think Apple would have no problem being just like Best Buy.

86
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:51,920
Speaker 1: you're done never no more for you.

87
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,362
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

88
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,466
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

89
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:53,968
Speaker 1: I don't.

90
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,800
Speaker 1: they would be like we don't need you have our own stores, right?

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
Speaker 1: We don't give a shit about you.

92
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:01,779
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that if I were someone like Best Buy I would risk it.

93
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,953
Speaker 0: I would risk it if I had.

94
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:04,940
Speaker 1: that's a good short term.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,605
Speaker 1: But if you I mean if you did but you know get a big stock Short term would be really good.

96
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:13,640
Speaker 1: long term if you did if they actually pulled out on you would be zero.

97
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:21,140
Speaker 1: Thing is you could also Buy but in a bad economy in a holiday season not a bad time to blow your short-term load.

98
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:27,480
Speaker 0: You could also arrange for distribution of Apple products from gray markets and such to continue selling.

99
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, Apple might to go take it to court.

100
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's tough.

101
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,354
Speaker 0: That's real tough.

102
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:32,558
Speaker 1: They would do it.

103
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:33,160
Speaker 1: They got the money.

104
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,729
Speaker 0: I don't think they'd be able to pull it off though.

105
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,720
Speaker 0: Maybe the other thing you could do is If Best Buy does it everyone else realizes?

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,227
Speaker 0: Hey, I can do that once to small little stores.

107
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:48,222
Speaker 1: suddenly suddenly you go on an Amazon and it says see pricing cart MacBook half-off Right.

108
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:50,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I have a store, you know, I'm Best Buy now.

109
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:58,260
Speaker 0: I have a store in Amazon Messed by and I'm selling Apple stuff and then crest by and I'm selling Apple stuff.

110
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,164
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, another tiny news.

111
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:07,359
Speaker 1: right Amazon has a beta site where they I wish Amazon would do this more have specialized Amazon sites for specialized product categories.

112
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:15,629
Speaker 1: You can go to wireless.amazon.com and it's Amazon wireless beta which is an Amazon store only for buying phones and not for buying anything else.

113
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:20,113
Speaker 1: and They've actually got a whole bunch of Android phones for a penny.

114
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:21,137
Speaker 1: Just one penny.

115
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:24,200
Speaker 1: Come on You like the guys in the street?

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,783
Speaker 1: But yeah, you can actually get like phone X's Nexus Nexus Nexus I mean like Rolex.

117
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:34,288
Speaker 1: next for example the Droid razor, right if you get that with the contract from Verizon The phone is gonna make 300.

118
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,639
Speaker 1: I think right, you know with the subsidy and everything like.

119
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:42,260
Speaker 1: yeah They're not giving any discounts on the plans cuz that's just Verizon's plans, but the phone one penny.

120
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,950
Speaker 1: So you're saving $2.99 if you go to Amazon wireless.

121
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:46,973
Speaker 1: that amazon.com is.

122
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,220
Speaker 0: I'm in the middle of my cycle right now.

123
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:53,379
Speaker 0: I'm just probably gonna get iPhone and I got a great phone until 4g stops working.

124
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,373
Speaker 1: Thanks I'll be getting iPhone 5 in 2012.

125
00:07:56,373 --> 00:08:01,819
Speaker 0: most likely thing is Since I'm losing my 4g I have to upgrade at the end of my upgrade cycle.

126
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,740
Speaker 0: Mmm, I'm either gonna go iPhone or we'll see what droid has.

127
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:13,440
Speaker 1: Yeah The main thing is like even though some of these friends still has unlimited data Even though some of these Android phones are starting to look better and more usable and I'm very googly.

128
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,840
Speaker 1: So they would probably work out for me software wise and I could probably deal with the hackiness and such.

129
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:18,804
Speaker 1: There's not you know.

130
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,039
Speaker 1: main problem with them that I'm having is that they're too big.

131
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,130
Speaker 1: They're like a whole diagonal inch bigger than I got.

132
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,060
Speaker 0: you know, what the majority of Android phones are monsters bricks.

133
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got the Nexus s.

134
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,073
Speaker 1: that's why I'm probably gonna end up sticking with iPhone Unless someone comes out with a high quality like.

135
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 1: it's got to be access.

136
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,360
Speaker 1: It's got to be like high but Nexus s is already obsolete.

137
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:43,360
Speaker 1: So what I'm being a high-end best Android phone, but also has to be three and a half inches not four and a half.

138
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,345
Speaker 0: So here's what I'll do When it's time to upgrade.

139
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:53,426
Speaker 0: if there is an Android phone that has the same form factor as the Nexus s that is top of The line I'll stay Android.

140
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:54,330
Speaker 0: Otherwise iPhone.

141
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's looking anyway.

142
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,034
Speaker 0: I don't know why they're making the droid phone so big.

143
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:00,200
Speaker 0: who needs that much power?

144
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,728
Speaker 1: I think it says that I think what it is.

145
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:08,957
Speaker 1: They can't make the hardware part any smaller So they just cover it with a screen Whereas Apple basically fights and fights and fights.

146
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:20,044
Speaker 0: No Online a lot of people say like they like the bigger phone and people I talked to like I'd see people that's post purchase Liking, I don't know.

147
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:25,434
Speaker 0: I see people who are like they see someone else's big droid and they're like, oh man I wish I had a screen that big really.

148
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:29,426
Speaker 0: Yeah people you You have particular tastes in things.

149
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,913
Speaker 0: There's those people want other things.

150
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:33,598
Speaker 1: Is it seem you'll find SUVs.

151
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:34,240
Speaker 1: They're just stupid.

152
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,310
Speaker 1: It's not even a matter of taste.

153
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,340
Speaker 1: It's just stupid.

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,314
Speaker 1: Okay, let's move on to the real news the most important news of the month.

155
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:48,495
Speaker 0: We have not talked about this much But there's a bill in Congress, this doesn't matter if you're not in the u.s.

156
00:09:48,856 --> 00:10:05,849
Speaker 1: H well it will well, but HR 3261 and also known as SOPA or the stop online piracy act the Senate bill is protect IP Act Which is slightly older and still awful, but only like 90% as awful as 10% less awful But now awful.

157
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,999
Speaker 1: we can't have either one of these.

158
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:13,420
Speaker 0: I don't want to get too much into you know, exactly what's wrong with it because the entire internet is talking about it.

159
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,840
Speaker 0: But I'll put it this way if you haven't been paying attention The DMCA by comparison seems like a perfectly reasonable and rational compromise on copyright enforcement.

160
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:27,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when the DMCA came out we're like, this is the worst thing in the universe mostly the biggest thing.

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,187
Speaker 1: That's bad about the DMCA.

162
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,100
Speaker 0: Well, Google now gave us some evidence for this argument, too, right?

163
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:43,540
Speaker 1: but the number one thing that's wrong with the DMCA that you could say that's bad law right is That it outlawed like devices that were primarily user infringement, right?

164
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:55,260
Speaker 1: So it was like, you know, it basically outlawed breaking DRM Even if you were going to legitimately do something legal the other You couldn't break the DRM on your DVD Even if you're going to use the video on the DVD in a fair use.

165
00:10:55,361 --> 00:11:04,020
Speaker 0: There's a secondary problem that I think is just as important that According to Google the majority of takedown notices that they receive for YouTube are blatantly false.

166
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:11,520
Speaker 1: Yes The Google representative said this during the SOPA hearing before Congress under penalty of perjury because if you testify before Congress perjury.

167
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,600
Speaker 1: So, yeah crazy.

168
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:17,018
Speaker 1: Anyway, so but the DMCA looks reasonable next to sofa now.

169
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:22,975
Speaker 0: granted SOPA is in May is not actually as bad as the CBD tPA if you remember that.

170
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,780
Speaker 1: well, they're they're all equally awful.

171
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:30,137
Speaker 0: Well, the CBD tPA was gonna require basically hardware DRM and all digital devices.

172
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

173
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:55,537
Speaker 0: So SOPA in a nutshell Basically says that the government through courts Someone who has intellectual property who believes or claims that they are being infringed upon can get a court order to have the DNS of the site shut down Basically permanently and all service providers the entire DNS system has to accommodate this blacklist.

174
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,858
Speaker 1: Well these ones in the US Yeah.

175
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,188
Speaker 1: so the problems with this are a few number ones.

176
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:08,419
Speaker 0: blocking someone's DNS doesn't actually block them because you can just type their IP and So the law goes on to say that they also have to block access But doesn't say how?

177
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,060
Speaker 1: Right because they want to leave it up to ISPs.

178
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,144
Speaker 1: That's what they'll tell you.

179
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,333
Speaker 1: is they want to leave it up to ISPs and service providers?

180
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:16,585
Speaker 1: exactly the implementation deep Yeah, you know what?

181
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:17,131
Speaker 0: I'll tell you kids.

182
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,664
Speaker 0: There's two Implementations implementation.

183
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,876
Speaker 0: the first also block IP addresses, which we'll talk about.

184
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:32,980
Speaker 0: how to get around that to implementation to Deep packet inspection as in looking at the content of all the packets and figuring out what is going to the previously infringing site.

185
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 0: That is something that for the majority of smaller ISPs is a ludicrous requirement and for the large ones I mean, don't we hate China's firewall?

186
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,828
Speaker 1: It's so weird, right?

187
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,900
Speaker 1: I mean gee people are like surprised.

188
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:53,700
Speaker 1: It's like it's weird to see like people are so surprised at things The government is doing like oh my god Look at this and it's totally a Daily Show thing.

189
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,120
Speaker 1: Right you go and you watch a video of like Joe Biden talking about how like censorship is bad.

190
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:05,820
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, you shouldn't be doing a firewall China and then Right turns around and he's like, oh man this stuff is so awesome.

191
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:09,952
Speaker 1: It's like what you're the contradiction in the government.

192
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,520
Speaker 1: it exists and I'm like, yeah, that's par for the course.

193
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:15,434
Speaker 1: But it's weird to see these other people go like, oh my god.

194
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,660
Speaker 1: Look at this contradicting government.

195
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,920
Speaker 1: I'm like the Daily Show's been on TV for like over a decade showing you the same stuff.

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,248
Speaker 1: Why are you surprised every time?

197
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,319
Speaker 0: because you've got to get mad?

198
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,026
Speaker 1: Not gonna take it anymore.

199
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:28,170
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna.

200
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,720
Speaker 0: I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore.

201
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,069
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

202
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:36,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll get to that but Other issues with this bill.

203
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,840
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like you can say that this is the Republicans the Democrats.

204
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,200
Speaker 0: This is everybody a bipartisan initiative.

205
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:53,159
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the only ones who are against it are like the few cool people in Congress and or the Somewhat cool people and all the other ones are totally for Ron Paul's against it Ron.

206
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:00,640
Speaker 1: Obviously the number one guy we got in our side is a guy from Oregon, which is like the most open source of all states Ron Wyden.

207
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,424
Speaker 1: I think his name is.

208
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:08,800
Speaker 1: he's gonna go for a filibuster on the protect IP half and You can send in and fill out a form and he'll read your name because he needs something to read.

209
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,548
Speaker 0: so I believe he's gonna be up there saying such things as penis McMytear and Michael Hunt.

210
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,340
Speaker 1: nice, you know That's fights just gotta read something.

211
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:31,600
Speaker 1: I think what he should do is actually go and find like, you know websites that have just huge comment threads talking about sofa or You know all sorts of papers pretty much anything or just like letters that let's go one step further.

212
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,791
Speaker 0: What I would do is I would find a work a written work.

213
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:45,124
Speaker 0: That is a fan work some sort of like technically violating copyright, but yet is a good novel and so Fan fiction.

214
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,714
Speaker 0: basically find good fat and fiction and read it or you know, what just read.

215
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:53,600
Speaker 0: horrible like furry fanfic furry clappy, whatever fanfiction clappy.

216
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,003
Speaker 1: I love that.

217
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:56,746
Speaker 0: That's a there is.

218
00:14:56,866 --> 00:15:01,646
Speaker 1: there is no end to material because the internet exists and but it won't if this bill becomes a law.

219
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,132
Speaker 0: so We've been through this before with many laws.

220
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no point in reiterating the same things.

221
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,470
Speaker 1: we have reiterated this one for over a decade.

222
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:21,872
Speaker 0: it has a pretty decent shot of passing and Whereas the cohes and the CBD TPAs we were able to defeat and the DMCA was watered down to where as much as it sucks There are people.

223
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,086
Speaker 1: it's Tolerable, right?

224
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,100
Speaker 1: It's hardly because Google I'd like to see it go.

225
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,063
Speaker 1: I would not mind.

226
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 0: but Google via YouTube does a really good job of basically helping people go through the paperwork to you know.

227
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,725
Speaker 0: Fight bullshit take down notices.

228
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:35,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda.

229
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,274
Speaker 0: Yeah kinda they do better than I could have expected.

230
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:47,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this bill unlike all the other ones that we've seen Would be a disaster for the structure of the Internet.

231
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,436
Speaker 0: I'm a technology professional.

232
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 0: I'm a vice president of product management.

233
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:52,100
Speaker 0: I was a senior engineer on Wall Street for four years.

234
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,085
Speaker 0: You know, I have a degree.

235
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:55,229
Speaker 0: Scott has the degree.

236
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,040
Speaker 0: We're both scientists of commute of computers.

237
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,459
Speaker 0: This law will destroy the internet.

238
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:00,962
Speaker 1: It will.

239
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:05,340
Speaker 1: if this law passes and is implemented the internet will be broken in a really bad way.

240
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,600
Speaker 1: The number one way it will be broken is the destruction of DNS sec, right?

241
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,471
Speaker 0: So the way to be fair isn't really like implemented fully.

242
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:16,180
Speaker 1: it's they've already signed all the root thingies.

243
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,066
Speaker 1: They're ready to go.

244
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:19,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's if we can get it to work.

245
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,782
Speaker 1: You're fully.

246
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:24,620
Speaker 1: then it'll be so awesome and they put already so much work into doing it that it would basically throw.

247
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:25,092
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

248
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:31,371
Speaker 0: I was reading a talking point from a bunch of the people who are for this bill saying that DNS sec is Unimplemented and we don't need to worry about it.

249
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:32,035
Speaker 0: Sure.

250
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:32,820
Speaker 0: Those people are smart.

251
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,949
Speaker 0: They'll figure out a way around.

252
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,260
Speaker 0: the you know, no apply with the law.

253
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:35,887
Speaker 1: Here's the way.

254
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,568
Speaker 1: is the thing with DNS sec Right?

255
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:37,894
Speaker 1: is you?

256
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,260
Speaker 1: you know?

257
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,416
Speaker 1: Everyone knows if you listen our DNS episode DNS is the system that turns names into numbers.

258
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 1: you type in google.com.

259
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,219
Speaker 1: It turns it into an IP address so that you know where to actually go.

260
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:51,300
Speaker 1: But what if you were to say type in bank.com and instead of getting the numbers for your bank?

261
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,858
Speaker 1: You got some wrong numbers so you end up going to my server instead of the bank server even though your web browser or whatever using says bank.com.

262
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:00,324
Speaker 1: and Then what do you know?

263
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:04,520
Speaker 1: you just typed in your bank info into Scott Scott's website and now I have your bank info.

264
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:05,063
Speaker 1: Good job.

265
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,490
Speaker 1: This is why DNS is important.

266
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:19,720
Speaker 1: We need to make sure guarantee Cryptographically Mathematically that the the numbers you get for that name are the right ones because DNS relies on Trust and the trust goes up to basically the root DNS servers.

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:27,510
Speaker 0: we listen to the episode from our details, but Basically, you've got a trust DNS all the way back up to that route And even if people in the middle are you're wrong.

268
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,560
Speaker 0: the route can basically be the safe place.

269
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,168
Speaker 0: It can be the place that fixes everything.

270
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:34,740
Speaker 0: if you know a whole swath of the internet turned evil.

271
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:37,320
Speaker 0: The root DNS servers always know the way home.

272
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,345
Speaker 1: So for example, I set up a DNS server and I got all the numbers in there And they're all the right numbers.

273
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:44,280
Speaker 1: bank.com goes to the right number google.com goes to the right number.

274
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,840
Speaker 1: Right, then I if you do the math if your computer does the math to check the DNS sec, it'll thumbs up.

275
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,214
Speaker 1: Hey, this DNS server is totally chill and all these numbers are right You don't have to worry that you're actually going to the wrong server.

276
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:57,219
Speaker 1: that's gonna steal your stuff.

277
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,408
Speaker 1: But what if the government says yeah Scott?

278
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,732
Speaker 1: Hey on your DNS server there.

279
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:02,253
Speaker 1: Yeah.

280
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:02,955
Speaker 1: What's up government?

281
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,440
Speaker 1: Yeah that server you got there.

282
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:10,640
Speaker 1: I need you to change pirate bay.org to point at this other number because pirate bay.org is no good.

283
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,277
Speaker 1: So now my server's got the wrong numbers so it no longer checks out.

284
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,262
Speaker 1: So What it?

285
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,989
Speaker 1: but other people in other parts of the world.

286
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,020
Speaker 1: they have the right numbers, but you can't use their server.

287
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,334
Speaker 1: But now you basically you got rid of security instead of now.

288
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:26,338
Speaker 1: It's not gonna match up.

289
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,066
Speaker 1: So what can you do?

290
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:34,340
Speaker 1: Well, you can keep using my wrong server and tell your computer Yeah computer ignore it when the stuff is wrong and just do it.

291
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,447
Speaker 1: Anyway, that way I can.

292
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:42,340
Speaker 1: you know, my computer will keep working But then I'll just send you to Scott comm instead of bank comm and I'll fuck you over.

293
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:44,296
Speaker 1: Right, so you'd be trading.

294
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:50,677
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Look, it's harder for normal people to get to pirate bay, but normal people also now just lost all their banking.

295
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:53,169
Speaker 0: now more importantly Technological issues aside.

296
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,556
Speaker 0: I mean, why is this bad?

297
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:59,153
Speaker 0: because In the end, you know piracy and intellectual property.

298
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,880
Speaker 0: There are many arguments you made on both sides.

299
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,940
Speaker 0: We've been having this argument since the first mini file was uploaded to the internet will not reiterate the argument.

300
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,638
Speaker 1: We'll simply reiterate that we are not going to reiterate it.

301
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,379
Speaker 0: But the salient point here is that when it comes to that sort of thing?

302
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,640
Speaker 0: Regardless of whether or not you think we need stronger copyright protection weaker copyright protection need to make more piracy stop piracy.

303
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:23,439
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter where you sit.

304
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:33,920
Speaker 0: One of the most important aspects of America that we have left is freedom of speech That we have that you can speak freely that the government basically can't stop you from speaking.

305
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:45,672
Speaker 0: they can arrest you for very very very specific kinds of dangerous speech and the the Barrier to actually doing so is surprisingly immense.

306
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:54,698
Speaker 0: the courts almost always rule in favor of free speech but One of the problems of free speech is that you have to deal with people doing really horrible things.

307
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:57,467
Speaker 0: with free speech I mean hate speech all that sort of stuff.

308
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,560
Speaker 0: cyberbullying and all that stuff is kind of collateral damage of having free speech.

309
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,995
Speaker 0: We agree that free speech is so important to us that we're going to put up with all the bullshit that comes with it Except child porn except child porn.

310
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:09,578
Speaker 1: That's right.

311
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:29,359
Speaker 0: but in this case by Making a system where the government can basically shut down a website based on some copyright infringement we're destroying a ton of culture and a ton of DMCA where there's no reason not to believe that this is gonna be abused just as much.

312
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, even more.

313
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:36,379
Speaker 0: the collateral damage to free speech of a bill like this is far worse than any piracy could ever be.

314
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:37,783
Speaker 1: Yes, it is not.

315
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:43,558
Speaker 1: even if this bill right somehow actually did do good for the world at what cost?

316
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,360
Speaker 1: destroying the internet?

317
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:46,198
Speaker 1: Sorry, there is nothing worth that cost.

318
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,976
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

319
00:20:54,996 --> 00:21:12,179
Speaker 0: if you know me, you know I'm a fan of the particular kind of prank where the people who are pranked never really know that it's a prank like the weird stuff like going to a restaurant that has a little display outside with like bronze fruit or something at a border like around their menu and replacing a pair with a banana.

320
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaker 0: You know stuff that will make will weird someone out, but they'll never quite get the answer like they'll just wonder about it forever.

321
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,049
Speaker 0: Or it'll be this weird anecdote.

322
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:27,271
Speaker 0: They tell their friends like yeah, this weirdo whatever but This guy is doing the exact kind of thing.

323
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,740
Speaker 0: I like the rude roll-up prank.

324
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,340
Speaker 0: He's pretty clever and he has a lot of video of himself doing this.

325
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,548
Speaker 0: He'll drive up in a car and stop.

326
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:36,315
Speaker 0: some pedestrians rolled out his window and ask for help.

327
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,057
Speaker 0: ask for directions.

328
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:39,531
Speaker 1: common thing They'll give him directions because they're friendly.

329
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:47,228
Speaker 0: while they're giving him directions He just kind of rolls up his car window and looks away from just sits there Just to see what they'll do and beyond that.

330
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:48,292
Speaker 0: This is priceless.

331
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:52,123

347
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:43,720
Speaker 1: So that's weird.

348

Speaker 0: It's coming up in New York City.

372
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,480
Speaker 0: There's a thing called nerd night.

373
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,584
Speaker 0: Are we confirmed for that?

374
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,291
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, we're pretty much confirmed.

375
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:02,275
Speaker 0: We're going to present.

376
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:06,788
Speaker 0: we're going to be doing a 20-minute version of our old lecture.

377
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:07,892
Speaker 0: losing should be fun.

378
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,256
Speaker 1: This is 100% confirmed.

379
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:12,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if it's not whatever Okay, I'll issue a retraction.

380
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:13,850
Speaker 1: It costs money to go to this thing.

381
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,478
Speaker 1: I personally probably wouldn't pay to go.

382
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,628
Speaker 0: just being honest I don't pay to go to anything.

383
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:25,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, maybe I don't pay to go to anything because I can usually get a free press pass into anything.

384
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:29,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I still wouldn't pay for a nerd get-together in the city because there's so many free ones.

385
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:30,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll see.

386
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,280
Speaker 0: We've heard good things about this month.

387
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,100
Speaker 0: Many of our friends have been to these and/or presented at them and we were invited and it looks fun.

388
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,793
Speaker 0: So we'll be there and I'll see if we can video the thing.

389
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,621
Speaker 0: if they don't video it and get it up on the inner Tubes.

390
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:43,063
Speaker 1: Yep.

391
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:47,920
Speaker 0: Otherwise the book club book is two books double book club.

392
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,527
Speaker 1: A lot of people having trouble realizing this.

393
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:50,853
Speaker 1: you must read two books.

394
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:56,270
Speaker 1: The first book you must read is Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

395
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:57,875
Speaker 1: It is very short.

396
00:24:57,995 --> 00:24:59,520
Speaker 1: You should be able to read it in a night.

397
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:02,199
Speaker 1: I can read it in like two hours or even less, right?

398
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,999
Speaker 1: It's so short.

399
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,414
Speaker 1: Then you have to read a real book also by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

400
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,772
Speaker 1: that will take you a little bit longer to read But not that much longer.

401
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:09,399
Speaker 1: It's still short.

402
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:13,676
Speaker 1: It's just not one sitting short and that is Wind, Sand and Stars.

403
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:14,760
Speaker 1: at least that's the English title.

404
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:20,046
Speaker 0: And while you should buy these books, I'll just point out that PDFs are available everywhere.

405
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,431
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't care about you buying books.

406
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,936
Speaker 1: We care about your reading books.

407
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,000
Speaker 1: It's about reading books.

408
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:27,897
Speaker 1: It's the important part reading not audiobooking like some of you do reading.

409
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,794
Speaker 1: There are scientific studies that reading uses a different part of the brain.

410
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,220
Speaker 1: That is the part of the brain.

411
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,513
Speaker 1: We want you to exercise your exercise.

412
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:41,614
Speaker 1: you still get in the story But you're exercising a different brain part with the audiobook and that is not the goal.

413
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,648
Speaker 0: and last but not least Pax East is coming up.

414
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:49,909
Speaker 0: If you didn't get your hotel room already good If you're awesome, you're already going.

415
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,055
Speaker 0: Pax East is the same weekend as Anime Boston So double fucked if you don't have your hotel.

416
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,320
Speaker 0: Oh shit Registration is open.

417
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:09,000
Speaker 0: So if you're even thinking for a second that you might possibly go buy a goddamn badge now because they're gonna sell out Yep, but like today not tomorrow not all remember to pause this show.

418
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:17,160
Speaker 1: Get thee to a computer unless you're in a car in which case pull over to the side of the road and use your phone And buy the stupid ticket.

419
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:25,913
Speaker 1: Yes because you do not buy a ticket from a third party at all under any circumstance because it will be a Forged badge and they're gonna come down on you so hard.

420
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:27,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'll tell you what guys.

421
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:32,657
Speaker 0: Shortly ahead of Pax we're probably gonna put out a nice informative video on how to stop counterfeits because you know what.

422
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:40,417
Speaker 0: it is Way easy to spot the counterfeits and the more of you are out of a guy is selling them on the street for ridiculously low price.

423
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:42,106
Speaker 1: They're probably counterfeits.

424
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:43,072
Speaker 0: Well, it's a way to find out.

425
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:43,917
Speaker 0: just rip it in half.

426
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:44,581
Speaker 1: Yeah 9% chance.

427
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:45,507
Speaker 1: it's a counterfeit.

428
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 1: The only chance it's not is if some moron Sold their real one to that guy and he's probably gonna sell his counterfeit ones before he sells his real one.

429
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:57,540
Speaker 0: So yeah, and so SOPA.

430
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:04,115
Speaker 0: We already talked about this So we're not gonna talk any more about SOPA itself about the law about the activism any of that crap.

431
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:13,740
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm because we're nerds we're geeks and We personally in case this passes have contingency plans to not have to deal with the BS.

432
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:23,311
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen because while the pirate Bay dot org won't resolve anymore from us DNS Pirate Bay org is gonna keep resolving on my personal PC.

433
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:24,314
Speaker 1: It sure is.

434
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:29,391
Speaker 0: and if my ISP starts blocking me Well, there's some VPNs and some SSL that's gonna happen.

435
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:30,795
Speaker 1: Yep, but you know what?

436
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,340
Speaker 1: There's a much easier way to solve all these problems.

437
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:36,870
Speaker 1: Move to the Netherlands Joe's over or Canada.

438
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:39,057
Speaker 1: Well, the Netherlands has like awesome fiber for everyone.

439
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:40,020
Speaker 1: That's why I chose that place.

440
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,809
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I wouldn't mind moving to the Netherlands.

441
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:46,868
Speaker 1: I wish it were warmer than yeah, but you know just fucking move somewhere that's fucking fiber.

442
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:49,765
Speaker 1: and Story don't live in the US.

443
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:52,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do worry that SOPA might pass.

444
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:54,640
Speaker 1: I guess I'll plan to move.

445
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,086
Speaker 0: So, how do we get around this?

446
00:27:56,126 --> 00:28:01,123
Speaker 1: Well one if you decide that you can't leave the US for whatever reason What do you do?

447
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:04,335
Speaker 0: So the one thing is that China's really good at cracking down.

448
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:08,040
Speaker 0: I Do not think the US is gonna be that good at cracking down.

449
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 1: No, because it's not gonna be in China is a government censorship organization, right and the US it's gonna be companies Filing court thingies and sending notices and all sorts of bureaucracy of that nature.

450
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:26,500
Speaker 1: So there isn't going to be this central crackdown, you know thing that's like at the edge of the internet run by the government.

451
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:34,780
Speaker 1: It's gonna be ISPs and search engines obeying orders and doing and obeying those orders in whatever way they deem necessary.

452
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:37,593
Speaker 1: So it's you know, it's gonna be like, huh?

453
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,237
Speaker 1: How are we gonna do that?

454
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:40,525
Speaker 1: So all kinds of different things.

455
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:51,940
Speaker 1: so like something that might work like some easy way out that might work on Time Warner might not Work even on Time Warner in a different state or it might not work on files, but it works on cable vision.

456
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,119
Speaker 1: It's gonna be all crazy.

457
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,567
Speaker 0: So what do we do?

458
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,340
Speaker 0: first the way DNS works?

459
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,116
Speaker 0: You can google around for the details on how to do this But basically you should be running a DNS server in your house.

460
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:06,479
Speaker 0: If you're a nerd at all It's trivial to do and you'll learn a lot actually along the way.

461
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:16,780
Speaker 0: Now if you're using DNS server in your house What I recommend you do is set it up such that old records unless they're refreshed like hash records never expire.

462
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:23,800
Speaker 0: Yep, so if DNS for something gets blocked you know already know the IP address because you've been to that site before.

463
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,084
Speaker 1: So for example pirate Bay.

464
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:29,660
Speaker 1: today, I can go to my computer and I can type in a mactomatic computer, right?

465
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,282
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna do.

466
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:31,950
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do this right now for the good of everyone.

467
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:33,759
Speaker 1: dig pirate Bay org.

468
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:35,266
Speaker 1: Dig.

469
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:38,996
Speaker 0: You can use nslookup if you're on Windows.

470
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:39,840
Speaker 1: Oh, that's true.

471
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:43,540
Speaker 1: I actually have dig installed on the windows at work, which is why I would thought I could.

472
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:53,801
Speaker 1: Okay, the IP address of the pirate Bay is 194 dot 71 dot 107 dot 15. as of 708 p.m.

473
00:29:53,821 --> 00:30:04,141
Speaker 1: On November 21st 2011 Eastern Time us Right, so if they decide that they're gonna block pirate Bay, which is pretty much gonna go down immediately if this law passes Well one.

474
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:10,983
Speaker 0: you've already committed a crime if that law were passed because you provided the service of providing the name resolution of the you know To the infringing site.

475
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,335
Speaker 1: Oh, no, right and you type in nslookup pirate Bay org.

476
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,960
Speaker 1: You're actually gonna get different numbers.

477
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,899
Speaker 1: You're gonna get the numbers for some government server that has a takedown notice web server running or something like that.

478
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:26,580
Speaker 1: So what all you have to do is you just have to either put it in your host file.

479
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:41,834
Speaker 1: Or if you did like rim said and have your own DNS server that never forgets like an elephant and an elephant DNS Your elephant DNS server will still give you the old pirate Bay number and Only people using their isp's normal DNS servers will get the new number of the.

480
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:42,837
Speaker 1: that does that's wrong.

481
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:49,722
Speaker 1: So Yeah, and most people, you know have it will never change their DNS, but it is trivial to do So.

482
00:30:49,903 --> 00:30:52,339
Speaker 1: even complete doofuses can do this thing.

483
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:56,299
Speaker 1: It's really easy on all three operating systems to change your DNS.

484
00:30:56,781 --> 00:31:04,448
Speaker 1: In fact as an aside I found you can even change it on your router and then every computer in your house will automatically have It changed even phones and other things.

485
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:10,520
Speaker 1: Yeah via the DHCP server that is running on your router Yep, so you don't even need to like tell teach people to do anything.

486
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,242
Speaker 1: It's just like they'll come over to your house and like how come pirate Bay works at your house because I typed some numbers into My router.

487
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,793
Speaker 0: so phase two or maybe phase zero.

488
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,219
Speaker 0: Maybe it comes before so that may work.

489
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:22,100
Speaker 0: If anyone's gonna fight this it's gonna be Google.

490
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:25,119
Speaker 0: So you might want to just preemptively switch to Google's DNS.

491
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:31,860
Speaker 0: Oh because there's a good chance that They'll hold on to records longer and or fight for whatever they need to fight for.

492
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might not want to use Google DNS if you're not living in the u.s.

493
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,940
Speaker 0: Oh, but there's no danger of this bullshit.

494
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:40,204
Speaker 1: So cares?

495
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:44,200
Speaker 0: yeah, actually Europe has good coverage for Google DNS, that's true.

496
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:55,408
Speaker 0: But anyway, some European countries do have some censorships though I recommend doing that anyway, because lately I've actually been having a ton of problems with Verizon FiOS Periodically crapping out and I did some investigation.

497
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:56,813
Speaker 1: It's really fast when it works.

498
00:31:57,033 --> 00:32:04,493
Speaker 0: It turned out it was Verizon's DNS servers Mysteriously stop responding when I queried YouTube and pirate Bay and stuff.

499
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:06,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they start responding in later.

500
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,111
Speaker 0: So I switched to Google and that problem stopped happening.

501
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:11,154
Speaker 0: Awesome, huh?

502
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:12,158
Speaker 0: Funny that?

503
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:13,963
Speaker 1: yeah All right.

504
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:16,730
Speaker 1: So what if they don't just do this DNS blocking?

505
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,620
Speaker 1: What if they also do like IP blocking deep packet inspection?

506
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:21,685
Speaker 0: Well, those are two things.

507
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:34,500
Speaker 0: if they do IP blocking specifically then People who really want to provide their pirated stuff to the u.s Will start using dynamic IPS or you'll start going through proxies stuff like that.

508
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,580
Speaker 1: It'll basically be the same thing that Chinese people do to get to the real internet.

509
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,218
Speaker 0: It'll slow us down, but it won't stop us exactly and it'll be annoying.

510
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:47,820
Speaker 0: but Blocking IPS that'll stop like going to a website and downloading the content directly.

511
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,043
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, so like they turn off mega upload That's just.

512
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,067
Speaker 1: that's gonna be the end of that.

513
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,860
Speaker 0: but say they shut down pirate Bay and they block all the IPS.

514
00:32:56,021 --> 00:33:00,868
Speaker 0: They keep it like every time part Bay has a new IP address They find it and block it and there's no way around that.

515
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,320
Speaker 0: All right, you can use a proxy to get to pirate Bay.

516
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,823
Speaker 0: Just fine.

517
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,970
Speaker 1: because what if they start blocking all the proxies?

518
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,620
Speaker 1: they have to do it really fast because it's how fast can we switch?

519
00:33:11,162 --> 00:33:13,834
Speaker 1: It becomes a pain in the ass basically because it's got that whack.

520
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,380
Speaker 0: a little game is never-ending and impossible.

521
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,365
Speaker 0: But - it's it.

522
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,520
Speaker 1: but it's basically two people playing whack-a-mole against each other forever.

523
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,020
Speaker 1: So you have to basically keep changing the number in your proxy software thingy and they have to keep changing.

524
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:32,044
Speaker 0: No, because you keep your old IP - oh For the rest of the world DNS stops working.

525
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:41,281
Speaker 0: DNS still points at you except where the u.s Is minding that they break it not sure which is an interesting problem because you know, we talked about this before But

526
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:48,646
Speaker 1: the people running the proxies if the proxies get their IPs blocked the proxies have to keep moving and you have to keep Updating the proxy on your computer.

527
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:52,479
Speaker 0: These are really hard to find and block especially because most proxies are gonna use SSL.

528
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,839
Speaker 1: Everything you send to the proxy will be encrypted.

529
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:59,813
Speaker 1: So how's anyone gonna even know to send a takedown notice for the proxy?

530
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,740
Speaker 1: because they can be like take down this IP address.

531
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,663
Speaker 1: What's at the IP address?

532
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:10,420
Speaker 0: There isn't even a website there or anything and the majority and piracy will just move even further into the pirate Where it's peer-to-peer.

533
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,416
Speaker 1: Anyway, once you get that torrent file from Pirate Bay, that's it, right?

534
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:19,408
Speaker 1: They can't be blocking like Everyone's individual personal computers.

535
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:24,719
Speaker 1: This is mostly gonna be used for taking down sites Not my compute my IP address in my house.

536
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:30,404
Speaker 1: So once you get the torrent file and your torrents running that's all peer-to-peer and they're gonna have a really hard time doing anything About that.

537
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,572
Speaker 1: pretty much impossible.

538
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:32,217
Speaker 1: do anything about that.

539
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:36,659
Speaker 0: So say you want to go the next step and have your DNS keep working.

540
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:40,831
Speaker 0: Well, if this passes, I'm pretty much assuming that DNS is fucked.

541
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,659
Speaker 1: Anyway, there are people have already set up elephant DNS servers.

542
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,103
Speaker 1: That's the name.

543
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:44,629
Speaker 1: I'm calling it.

544
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,952
Speaker 1: Yep.

545
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,665
Speaker 1: I just made up that name Like that name.

546
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:48,768
Speaker 1: I just coined it.

547
00:34:48,969 --> 00:35:04,800
Speaker 0: So what you do and this goes back to a kind of deeper discussion we're kind of planning on doing a Thursday show about the general concept, but Trust networks are very important If you ever intend to do things where you need to coordinate among a number of people and not get caught.

548
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:07,355
Speaker 0: That is the most diplomatic way I can put that.

549
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:14,260
Speaker 0: Mmm So if you have are conspiring to do something, whatever it may be In the future, it's too late.

550
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,079
Speaker 0: If you need to do it now, you haven't already planned this it's too late.

551
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:21,000
Speaker 0: But if you have to do something down the road like this you plan now.

552
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,026
Speaker 0: You've got a network of trust network of friends.

553
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:29,547
Speaker 0: you exchange keys, you know one-time pads asymmetric keys Whatever kind of encryption you want to use.

554
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,320
Speaker 0: you exchange keywords you exchange IP addresses.

555
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:40,600
Speaker 0: You exchange all this information that is ready to be used to build a communications network on the fly Immediately in the vent of trouble, right?

556
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,990
Speaker 1: so there's one software that could be used to do this.

557
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:50,297
Speaker 1: that might be hard to set up but basically the Architecturally, it's exactly what you want and we could rebuild something like it quite easily.

558
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,380
Speaker 1: It was called waste.

559
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,880
Speaker 0: It was written by the guy who made nullsoft waste was ahead of its time and is a very important piece of software, right?

560
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,687
Speaker 1: But it was incredibly hard to use.

561
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:02,140
Speaker 1: So the way waste works is this I run waste on my computer.

562
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:08,019
Speaker 1: I create cryptographic public-private keys Which we have talked about in the show before goes to an old episode for how they work.

563
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:10,713
Speaker 1: You send your public keys to your friend.

564
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:12,240
Speaker 1: You tell your friend your IP address.

565
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:13,946
Speaker 1: He gives you his public key.

566
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:15,190
Speaker 1: now you connect.

567
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,695
Speaker 1: your two wastes are connected.

568
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:18,060
Speaker 1: You've shared public keys.

569
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,484
Speaker 1: You know each other's IP address.

570
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:25,364
Speaker 1: You can now chat and send files with your friend in an unbreakable Encrypted manner.

571
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:26,550
Speaker 1: It's so awesome.

572
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,654
Speaker 0: It's deniable.

573
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:34,440
Speaker 0: You can set it to Constantly send data at a rate and then if you send real data the rate doesn't change.

574
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:37,380
Speaker 0: So you're gonna slow yourself down significantly because you're picking the small rate.

575
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,412
Speaker 0: You're not gonna be blowing you a megabit up and down constantly, right?

576
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:49,220
Speaker 0: But there is no Trivial mathematical way to figure out if what is going over that connection is garbage or content.

577
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:55,528
Speaker 1: Yep, so then you get more friends in on this and more friends into this and everyone you create this, you know It's hard to do.

578
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,740
Speaker 1: you have to do footwork.

579
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,080
Speaker 1: You have to give people key files and exchange IP addresses.

580
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:11,970
Speaker 1: But it all if everyone just connects to someone in this web you build this mesh of encrypted deniable perfect trust and information sharing with the chatting and the file sharing.

581
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,523
Speaker 0: now a lot of people unbreakable a lot of people try to Kind of they.

582
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:21,049
Speaker 0: they have these visions where they want to take something like this and make it gigantic Or they want to make like a peer-to-peer DNS.

583
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,753
Speaker 0: That is gigantic.

584
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:23,400
Speaker 1: It breaks down because it's not fast enough.

585
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:24,847
Speaker 0: No, not because it's not fast enough.

586
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:27,720
Speaker 0: it breaks down because now it's no longer a circle of trust.

587
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:31,840
Speaker 0: It's an open system that can be trivially exploited by people who you know, basically betray.

588
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:39,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you go to a website and there's a list of IPs of people in the waste network and a list all the public Keys, it's okay to share the public keys, but it's still like.

589
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,759
Speaker 1: here's a list of all the IPs to connect to derp derp derp.

590
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,461
Speaker 1: Oh great.

591
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:43,183
Speaker 1: Thanks guys.

592
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:48,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, your network of trust is fucked the moment you trust anyone who themselves are untrustworthy.

593
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,560
Speaker 0: So This is more a more delicate thing.

594
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,108
Speaker 0: This is a balkanization of the internet in the short term.

595
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:59,627
Speaker 0: basically you and all the people you actually trust You know really really trust.

596
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:02,720
Speaker 0: you have a list of people, you know, and it lists people you're friends with you.

597
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,566
Speaker 0: No, you have a list of people you trust.

598
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:07,798
Speaker 0: These are the people you give an account on your personal PC to.

599
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 1: yeah.

600
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:13,113
Speaker 0: So you and only those people form your own network of trust.

601
00:38:13,514 --> 00:38:15,640
Speaker 0: and if every circle of nerds does that?

602
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:25,780
Speaker 0: Will basically route around this because every circle of nerds has at least one person outside of the u.s Who can provide real DNS for them and or all the other proxies they need, right?

603
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,999
Speaker 1: So for example, you could exchange, you know, the current IP address of the Pirate Bay on your waste network, right stuff like that.

604
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,490
Speaker 0: now in general you should do this.

605
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:50,065
Speaker 0: anyway, if you're nerds who ever plan to you know, Do big things because doing the footwork on this now sets you up for the future because once you know The FBI comes crashing down on you or once the government comes crashing down on you or you're in China and the government comes Crashing down on you.

606
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:58,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's already too late, but pretty much the tools available to you are Encryption which is the most important right peer-to-peer, which is the most important.

607
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:02,319
Speaker 1: if they're taking down centralized repositories of things, right?

608
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,987
Speaker 1: Backup DNS.

609
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:12,216
Speaker 1: So you have the IP addresses proxies so that you can route around things that need to be routed around and And that's pretty much it.

610
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,640
Speaker 0: in a way This law passing would not be good.

611
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:28,600
Speaker 0: It would ruin the internet for the short term but at the same time it would basically force all the circles of nerds who have the capabilities to do things like this to do it and Not to quote Star Wars or anything.

612
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,170
Speaker 0: But that is literally striking them down.

613
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,900
Speaker 0: so they become more powerful than we could possibly imagine.

614
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:42,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much because once the nerds all descend into the darknet with hamachi's and wastes and things like that There's basically no way to get them back out.

615
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, hamachi's VPNs and virtual lands and all this, right?

616
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,149
Speaker 0: Nothing is actually driven nerds in the u.s.

617
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,655
Speaker 0: To need this technology.

618
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:56,551
Speaker 1: people are based nerds Basically, you know, it's like nerds like convenience, you know So what they do and they want to stay hidden.

619
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:01,976
Speaker 1: those they use something like IRC Which is something normal people would never figure out how to use or news groups, right?

620
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:03,080
Speaker 1: So it's hidden.

621
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,343
Speaker 1: It's hard for normal people to see but it's still out in the open and if a government agent wants to look at it Well, they're fucking is.

622
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:09,487
Speaker 1: they're just had to know that it's there.

623
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:19,568
Speaker 1: if we actually hide further if they push us farther down We'll actually start using tools that are a huge pain in the ass So even less people will be able to use them.

624
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,580
Speaker 1: but those that do use them will be unassailable.

625
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:31,340
Speaker 1: Will be is basically like we're in the fortress or on the ramparts and we're like, yep Pretty safe up here, right and then some guys start climbing up and we're like shit.

626
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,891
Speaker 1: Let me actually go in the fortress and close the port colors.

627
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:35,297
Speaker 1: You ain't getting in.

628
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:35,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're down.

629
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,063
Speaker 0: We're down an issue.

630
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,668
Speaker 0: all you know where the fuck that is.

631
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:47,539
Speaker 1: It's pretty much game over once you close the port colors, so Learn how to close your port colors As you might need to go in there soon.

632
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,933
Speaker 1: stock up with the water and the food and the swords if you have to now.

633
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:56,461
Speaker 0: my recommendation again is to Make these plans with your friends now because one this might pass and you've got it You know.

634
00:40:56,501 --> 00:41:06,967
Speaker 0: be ready before it's too late and a good example of that if any of you saw the old classic movie hackers Which is basically the same movie as the craft They're both my cool thing.

635
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:10,680
Speaker 0: I wish it was actually that way even though it isn't for Wicca and hacking.

636
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:15,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, the matrix kind of fulfilled that same purpose that same niche market for hacking.

637
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,362
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's the matrix is good I think it was.

638
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:24,964
Speaker 0: cereal gets arrested and he says something to his friend as he's being arrested to the effect of Because remember he's being arrested.

639
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:26,007
Speaker 0: Everyone knows what he's saying.

640
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:27,934
Speaker 0: Hey, remember that place.

641
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:29,539
Speaker 0: I hid that thing that one time.

642
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:33,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't there's no way for that to mean anything.

643
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:39,798
Speaker 1: so they know Yeah, they know that the FBI now knows that he hid a thing and when they go to court They'll say he hid a thing somewhere.

644
00:41:40,823 --> 00:41:41,786
Speaker 0: He said remember that place.

645
00:41:41,826 --> 00:41:43,311
Speaker 0: I hid that thing that one time.

646
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:43,733
Speaker 0: Yep.

647
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:45,880
Speaker 0: That's a key word where you know.

648
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,140
Speaker 0: Like if I tell Scott, you know, so now I'm not gonna use any of my stuff.

649
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:55,679
Speaker 0: but if there are references I can make to things that Literally Scott is the only person in the world who would know what I was referencing and he would know exactly what to do.

650
00:41:56,001 --> 00:42:02,704
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you've got all that stuff set up ahead of time when you get arrested like cereal and you gotta hack the planet You're good.

651
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:05,780
Speaker 0: You know, that's all your friends get arrested at the same time.

652
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:21,330
Speaker 0: Then it's time for a radio free America, yep, this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
