1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,797
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 21st.

2
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:12,620
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,650
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,979
Speaker 0: Instead of telling you how to get into anime.

5
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:20,729
Speaker 0: We tell you how to get other people into anime.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:41,150
Speaker 0: So Emily must have not had any work to do today because actually she she decided What she tried to figure out what my name would be in kanji, wouldn't it just be like remove?

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:41,852
Speaker 0: Well, it is.

9
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:45,010
Speaker 0: it's remove and she you know pick what kanji and all the pronunciation.

10
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:49,750
Speaker 1: Pick a kanji that sounds like re and then another one that sounds like, you know how Japanese names work.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,861
Speaker 0: So what she chose and I think this is pretty cool.

12
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,450
Speaker 0: So remove can also be pronounced.

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,275
Speaker 0: Well, I'll get to that.

14
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:06,040
Speaker 0: the first kanji means advantage And the second one means rejoice or jubilation Which which is very fitting in German board games.

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,508
Speaker 0: So I guess I feel good about that.

16
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:09,230
Speaker 0: Plus it looks cool.

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,409
Speaker 0: The first one's like a sword with things coming out the top Always like the ones that look like little houses.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,012
Speaker 1: Those are the best.

19
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:20,710
Speaker 0: the second one is one of those million line kanji's with a million like square hedge lines.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,795
Speaker 1: How's the house looking?

21
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,397
Speaker 1: ones are the best.

22
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,370
Speaker 0: it's got a hat and then it's got like little tentacles coming out the bottom.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,260
Speaker 1: Well, technically is it good but it's pronounced.

24
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,850
Speaker 0: obviously remove but the other reading is Toshiyoshi.

25
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,192
Speaker 0: No now Toshiyoshi.

26
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:39,483
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know what toshi is but Yoshi's a green guy with a big tongue.

27
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,690
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so much cooler than that.

28
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:47,230
Speaker 0: So toshi yoshi is Actually the name of what?

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,010
Speaker 0: Yagu, toshi oshi was the founder of the Oari branch of the yagu shin kage ryu sword style in the early edo period.

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,572
Speaker 1: All right.

31
00:01:55,812 --> 00:02:00,488
Speaker 0: He was one of those grandmasters who was around at the same time of another famous Japanese swordsman.

32
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,150
Speaker 1: Yeah Musashi, they're gonna say yeah you juvie.

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:17,516
Speaker 0: So according to legend Musashi Miyamoto was in Nagoya and noticed a man Carrying himself in a way that befitted a great warrior and he asked this man without prompting Aren't you Lord?

34
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:23,198
Speaker 0: Yagu toshi oshi to which he replied I am aren't you Lord Miyamoto?

35
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:31,290
Speaker 0: Musashi to which he replied I am and Apparently they'd never met each other and they bonded through the fact that they were so badass.

36
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:42,397
Speaker 1: And that is the story that I have no citation for whatsoever Sounds like a made-up story, but it reminds me of that part in Fullmetal Alchemist where they They bonded through their muscles.

37
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,386
Speaker 0: That was one of the best scenes in Fullmetal Alchemist.

38
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,290
Speaker 1: That was a good part right there.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,177
Speaker 1: I have to say I think it's in the manga too.

40
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:50,630
Speaker 0: So I feel like I should start going by toshi yoshi.

41
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,014
Speaker 1: How about not?

42
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:55,064
Speaker 0: toshi yoshi don't know if you try that shit.

43
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,308
Speaker 1: Everyone's gonna call you Brandon.

44
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:56,750
Speaker 1: I think that's.

45
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:04,608
Speaker 0: It's weird how no one calls me Brandon except my like business contacts that are completely separated from my real life.

46
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:06,513
Speaker 0: Yeah And Tex.

47
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:07,578
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

48
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,140
Speaker 1: That's right.

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,860
Speaker 0: I always found it funny that someone who was called Tex Decided not to call me by my name.

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
Speaker 0: I think it isn't his name Tex I don't even you know.

51
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:21,225
Speaker 0: in all these years I never asked him if that was a nickname or if that was a real name.

52
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,389
Speaker 0: I've never seen his ID.

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,815
Speaker 1: Maybe that's his strategy.

54
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:27,770
Speaker 1: is that he's like if I'm the only one who can have a weird name, then I'll be the king.

55
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,622
Speaker 0: All right, lads from now on you're all calling me.

56
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,386
Speaker 1: That's it.

57
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,849
Speaker 1: That's his rejoicing advantage.

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,578
Speaker 0: Well, well there are other.

59
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:40,201
Speaker 0: I mean Nuri's name is not Nuri, but that does.

60
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:41,790
Speaker 0: no one calls her anything but nerd.

61
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,347
Speaker 0: I don't think half the people in the crew even know her real name, which I think is hilarious.

62
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:49,677
Speaker 0: I know sadly even worse Your mom in the forums.

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,257
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna reveal her secret identity, but Mrs.

64
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:07,250
Speaker 0: DeCoster Well the royal your mom Okay, but I knew her from an internet name and as an internet friend at conventions before I knew her real name.

65
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:15,600
Speaker 0: So for a long time after we became friends, I called her by her internet name in person Her non your mom internet name.

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,881
Speaker 1: Yes.

67
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,688
Speaker 0: Your mom is a much better internet name.

68
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:25,410
Speaker 0: I agree That's like the best because it it allowed for the most epic punning of anyone on the internet ever as far as I'm concerned.

69
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,997
Speaker 0: So, uh, that's all I got.

71
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,381

Speaker 0: So what do you have in the stupid anime news captain anime?

109
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,225

00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,508
Speaker 1: What was my anime news?

111
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:13,889
Speaker 1: All right.

112
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:16,360
Speaker 1: So check this out.

113
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,470
Speaker 1: Remember that whole.

114
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:18,614
Speaker 1: This is.

115
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:26,029
Speaker 1: this is not really an anime news the copyright news but there are all sorts of anime peoples getting up in arms about it because they're stupid right.

116
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:31,350
Speaker 1: and Finally, there's like a definitive word on it that I can trust so I could bring it up again.

117
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,076
Speaker 1: Remember that orphaned works action.

118
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:37,350
Speaker 0: I remember that in like 1995 when it was on the internet, right?

119
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,610
Speaker 1: Well, basically there's been recent uproar about the orphaned works action and there was a big uproar and then it went down a bit.

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,817
Speaker 1: But now it's rumbling again.

121
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:49,981
Speaker 1: I'm a rabble rabble rabble rabble You know, everyone was sort of one, you know, there are a lot of.

122
00:06:50,021 --> 00:07:03,745
Speaker 1: there was a lot of FUD going around about it you know and I was sort of like I was taking the stance that hey is a good thing because You know there's a lot of works out there that no one know even knows who owns these things.

123
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:18,006
Speaker 1: people who own them don't even know they Own them and they're not entering the public domain, you know, it's not really it's not good right and that there's all you know, basically you can't create anything because You don't know if you're infringing on something or not, you know, it's like

124
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:18,970
Speaker 0: even with video games.

125
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:34,200
Speaker 0: We have a lot of ideas about taking old Awesome, but forgotten video games and porting them to something or making a pair something fun with them but a lot of times and I actually tried to track down the copyrights of a few old games and I Couldn't find Jack,

126
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:34,684
Speaker 1: right?

127
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:41,250
Speaker 1: So You know, I was saying it was good and then all these artists were like saying no, it's bad people take all our shit.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,970
Speaker 1: Well the Larry Lessig if you don't know Larry Lessig is I don't know.

129
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,381
Speaker 1: I've mentioned him a lot of times on the show Mostly on Monday mostly on Monday and Thursday.

130
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:59,530
Speaker 1: Lawrence Lessig is like an ultra famous Super lawyer and he was until recently like a copyright guy and that was his focus like the Creative Commons stuff.

131
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,449
Speaker 1: That's all because of him pretty much.

132
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,730
Speaker 1: I mean there were other people too, but that that's his business right there and there's a Ted video.

133
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,049
Speaker 1: You can see him talk and basically you'll understand his whole deal from that.

134
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:23,705
Speaker 1: But He recently, you know sort of quit the copyright business of lawyering because he realized or he sort of came to the conclusion That he couldn't fix the copyright business if he couldn't fix the corruption in government.

135
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:25,650
Speaker 1: So now he's working on fixing corruption instead.

136
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,722
Speaker 0: I'm curious what will come out of that man.

137
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,170
Speaker 1: I'm very curious what will come out of it.

138
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,009
Speaker 1: He's a very smart man, but that's a very impossible problem.

139
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:34,605
Speaker 1: So what will be?

140
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,495
Speaker 1: Regardless of that he takes like one month a year off I think the month of May.

141
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:45,285
Speaker 1: so he wasn't around this month But despite that there was.

142
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:58,519
Speaker 1: in the New York Times There was an article by Lawrence Lessig a very short one, you know It's only like a little bit and where he talks about the recent orphaned works bill stuff Right, and he agrees with me in that.

143
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,161
Speaker 1: Yes.

144
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,585
Speaker 1: We got to get these orphaned works.

145
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,809
Speaker 1: So people can fucking use them.

146
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:02,270
Speaker 1: Good God.

147
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:11,446
Speaker 1: but He actually disagrees with the specific bill that's going on and after reading it I it's hard not to completely agree with them.

148
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,596
Speaker 1: pretty much What he points out is the way the bill works.

149
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:22,421
Speaker 1: now though as written is let's say rim made a song and like 1983 when he's one year old.

150
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:22,985
Speaker 0: All right.

151
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:23,489
Speaker 0: All right.

152
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,785
Speaker 1: Okay, the song is by default copyrighted to you, right and that's sort of been the way.

153
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,731
Speaker 1: that's the way it's been for a long Time.

154
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:36,029
Speaker 1: so people are used to this automatic copyright business, right now Let's say I wanted to use that song.

155
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:43,792
Speaker 1: all that is required of me to avoid getting sued is I have to do due diligence in order to make sure that no one Owns that.

156
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,847
Speaker 1: no one is, you know, maintaining this copyright and then I can use it.

157
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:54,590
Speaker 1: So basically what happens is, you know with that situation, you know, I'm sure they haven't like, you know explicitly define the due diligence yet.

158
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,357
Speaker 1: But someone goes like a library, you know or and you know pay someone or you know Does the due diligence they all?

159
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:04,070
Speaker 1: I didn't find anything and then they start using it, right?

160
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,930
Speaker 1: And then later on someone comes along as I say you did due diligence, but you still didn't find me here.

161
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,170
Speaker 0: I am what the fuck well then that I would argue that that simply wasn't due diligence.

162
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,070
Speaker 1: Well, I know but you know.

163
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,924
Speaker 1: The question is is you know, is there a better way than this due diligence thing?

164
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:25,650
Speaker 1: because and also, you know They haven't strictly defined what the due diligence is And he has a better solution anyway.

165
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,190
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really matter if you know what if the depth how good the definition due diligence is.

166
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:35,510
Speaker 1: His better solution is you get your copyright for an amount of time, right?

167
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:42,712
Speaker 1: And then if you want to keep it longer, all you have to do is file a form and pay $1.

168
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:49,389
Speaker 0: Actually that has been the the good idea that's been passed around for the last like 20 years in regards to copyright.

169
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,324
Speaker 1: that way I know but it's like that way right.

170
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:55,337
Speaker 1: if something is orphaned It's basically you just look up.

171
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,501
Speaker 1: did anyone pay the dollar?

172
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,070
Speaker 1: no, okay that the deal is really easy.

173
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,456
Speaker 1: Did anyone pay their dollar?

174
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:01,038
Speaker 1: Right?

175
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:01,762
Speaker 1: Is it this old?

176
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:02,545
Speaker 1: Did anyone pay a dollar?

177
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:03,549
Speaker 1: very easy to figure out?

178
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:05,872
Speaker 0: There's some.

179
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,218
Speaker 0: I mean, how long is the period?

180
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:07,981
Speaker 0: because what if I?

181
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,512
Speaker 1: well he's he said 14 years, but whatever All right.

182
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:16,760
Speaker 0: So 14 years, let's say I take a thousand pictures Alright, and I want to keep the copyright on all the things.

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,582
Speaker 0: I'm using them for stuff.

184
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:18,365
Speaker 1: Yep.

185
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,232
Speaker 0: I gotta pay $1,000.

186
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,283
Speaker 1: Yep, that's great.

187
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:21,890
Speaker 1: That is great.

188
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,137
Speaker 0: Yeah It's actually not that bad cuz one dollar.

189
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:28,395
Speaker 0: really we can even make it because what it does is you should be could make it Just ten cents.

190
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:29,079
Speaker 0: Basically.

191
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,668
Speaker 0: All you have to do is set up the effort.

192
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,716
Speaker 1: Of course I think the reason a dollar is good.

193
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,890
Speaker 1: is that sure it might add up if you have a lot of works, right?

194
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,790
Speaker 1: But any of the works that aren't actually producing money for you You're not gonna bother to pay the dollar and thus it's better for the public because we're gonna get all these.

195
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,378
Speaker 1: You know things that aren't you know, you know They're not valuable to.

196
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,290
Speaker 0: you get all the kind of second-tier work, right?

197
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,128
Speaker 1: Right the stuff that no one could you know thinks they can make money off of.

198
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,580
Speaker 0: But that is the point that people are gonna go crazy about.

199
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,950
Speaker 0: that is but those are the people who have no money.

200
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:10,095
Speaker 0: You're a flicker full of you know 10,000 pictures all marked with the most limited license they can put on there and then they want to keep their copyright for as long As they live plus a million years.

201
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though they're not making any money off of those things, right?

202
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,209
Speaker 1: It's like you're not making many off of it.

203
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:18,268
Speaker 1: You released it and you know you released it to where people can look at it.

204
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:22,208
Speaker 1: Hey now you sort of want to keep people from making remixes of it.

205
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:28,690
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz think if you did like no didn't release it anywhere to the public then no one can get it to infringe on your thing.

206
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:29,881
Speaker 0: You don't pay the dollar.

207
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:30,486
Speaker 1: I know right.

208
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,450
Speaker 1: The other thing he points out is that he makes some exceptions.

209
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,890
Speaker 1: He's like foreign country people like in foreign countries like shouldn't have to pay the dollar.

210
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,760
Speaker 1: They should have different rules because how are they supposed to know that they have to fill out a form and pay a dollar in The US, you know, it's it's sort of stuff like that.

211
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,382
Speaker 1: He points out.

212
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,946
Speaker 1: There's a couple other exceptions He throws in there, too.

213
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:57,200
Speaker 1: but I think you should if you're one of those people who is believing the FUD or Confused about the FUD surrounding the orphan works thing.

214
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,809
Speaker 1: You should read this New York Times article from the smart guy.

215
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,311
Speaker 0: So in some more directly anime related news hal Cali a Japanese band That's.

236
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,704
Speaker 0: where's the last time we paid for a convention?

237

244
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:57,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might have to get there pretty damn early But I feel really bad that I've never listened these people music, but I promise I will get mp3s right after the show.

Speaker 1: cuz like the second shot, you know, it's like the first shot was easy as TMR I was like a shoo-in, you know, the second one is sort of like.

252
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,030
Speaker 1: well, let's see how it goes.

253
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,004
Speaker 1: And I think if it goes I think it's really it's gonna be a successful monthly deal.

254
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,430
Speaker 0: that that would be way cool Yes, and also there's a website about a link to it.

255
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,275
Speaker 0: But if these events start taking off you can go to a samurai beat radio calm and they'll be kind of regular listings of all These things.

256
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,670
Speaker 1: Oh nice to get a website going.

257
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,854
Speaker 0: Well, they actually asked us to send pictures of ourselves to which we realize that Scott doesn't have any Presentable pictures of himself.

258
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:45,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a presenter.

259
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,721
Speaker 1: most of the pictures.

260
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:52,178
Speaker 0: I'm in like you're like it's like a wide shot Or you're flipping me off.

261
00:15:52,439 --> 00:16:06,033
Speaker 1: the best picture of myself is a picture We took two katsu kansa go and it was like me you In like Conrad and you go behind the table and I'm like off to the side wearing like my Metroid shirt Just like hey Don't you hate that?

262
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:11,895
Speaker 0: when like you find the one good picture you and I'm off to the side and I'm kind of small and you Can't recreate that moment.

263
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,320
Speaker 0: And if you zoom in it's too grainy.

264
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

265
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:21,090
Speaker 0: Well, the only picture of me I have this presentable is Probably not suitable for being used in a press capacity.

266
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:22,912
Speaker 0: Great.

267
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:30,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in my flicker and I'm kind of horrified that I was going through my flicker looking for pictures of myself And I forgot that I put those pictures up.

268
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:37,542
Speaker 0: and I was even more horrified that I don't enough Apparently found these pictures and both left comments.

269
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:39,470
Speaker 1: I gotta go take this out.

270
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,099
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

271
00:16:49,641 --> 00:17:01,020
Speaker 0: so I came across this and the main reason this is my thing of the day is because the song is Really really really catchy like it just got stuck in my head for the last week.

272
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:13,569
Speaker 0: It's kind of bad and you hear it and you go ah, ah, it's in my head And actually for a while like Emily was here and Scott was here and we're trying to figure out cuz it sounded really familiar We couldn't figure out what it was from right away.

273
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,336
Speaker 0: We're like, ah, I know this song.

274
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,419
Speaker 0: I've heard this song.

275
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,005
Speaker 0: Ah, did you hate it when that happens?

276
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's pretty rough.

277
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,076
Speaker 1: Then you hear a song.

278
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,180
Speaker 1: I heard this song.

279
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,746
Speaker 1: I've heard this song before.

280
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,071
Speaker 1: I don't know the name of it.

281
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,035
Speaker 1: I don't know who sings it.

282
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:26,999
Speaker 1: I don't know where it's from.

283
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,886
Speaker 0: But this song this video for one is pretty well done.

284
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,989
Speaker 0: I mean the animation quality.

285
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:40,916
Speaker 1: it's 3d is Actually really really natural and surprised standing far away from it and I'm like I can make that.

286
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,240
Speaker 1: and Emily's like no you can't.

287
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,520
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, I could I just need a little puppets and she's like, it's not puppets at CG.

288
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,685
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh I can't make that.

289
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,720
Speaker 0: you couldn't do that with puppets if I had the puppets already.

290
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:54,140
Speaker 1: They don't move very much, but their faces change constantly.

291
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,836
Speaker 1: If you've changed the face on a puppet all you do is you know, you take the eyes off you.

292
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,221
Speaker 1: it's like it's like mr Potato head.

293
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,791
Speaker 0: and how do you do that without moving it mr.

294
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,157
Speaker 0: Potato head and mr.

295
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:03,920
Speaker 0: Potato head moves.

296
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,893
Speaker 1: The puppets are really big and you but the cameras really far away.

297
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:07,757
Speaker 1: That's why they look.

298
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:10,768
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but the thing is it's very like.

299
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:11,931
Speaker 0: I guess the mood it's.

300
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,560
Speaker 0: the movement was more natural than that Final Fantasy movie.

301
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never actually saw that Final Fantasy movie.

302
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,672
Speaker 1: I just knew of it like it's it's.

303
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:23,160
Speaker 0: the animation is really good Even though like the characters seem like they don't move a lot.

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,949
Speaker 0: You might say oh, why would you say it's so good.

305
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,960
Speaker 0: It's so like stilted and blah.

306
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:35,760
Speaker 0: Well, the second link in my thing of the day is the kind of source to this video Which will let you kind of understand where this came from.

307
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,988
Speaker 0: You see there are two things at play here.

308
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,590
Speaker 0: one.

309
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,206
Speaker 0: The song is from sergeant frog One of the closers.

310
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:50,089
Speaker 0: cuz sergeant frog closers have like dances in them and the characters are just doing the dance From that closer to sergeant frog.

311
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:57,056
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm very well, but in addition to that The song itself is not the original song from that closer.

312
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:58,240
Speaker 0: It's a remix.

313
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:03,820
Speaker 0: It's a special remix because the voice that is singing is not actually a human being or anything.

314
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,069
Speaker 0: It's that vocaloid program.

315
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:18,240
Speaker 0: now if you don't know what vocaloid is It's basically a program where you can type in Lyrics and then assign notes to the lyrics and do other stuff and a fake idol will sing your song.

316
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,205
Speaker 0: Surprisingly well for you.

317
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:26,160
Speaker 1: a fake like, you know singing pop star idol not a fake, you know tiki idol.

318
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:30,655
Speaker 0: I don't know if I need to specify on a Wednesday night.

319
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:31,017
Speaker 1: Yeah.

320
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:31,499
Speaker 1: Yes you do.

321
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:33,219
Speaker 0: How many?

322
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,272
Speaker 0: anyway So the animations catchy.

323
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,705
Speaker 0: the song is catchy I point out.

324
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:43,160
Speaker 0: watch the girl in the upper left because she totally doesn't know the day.

325
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's that's my favorite part.

326
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,591
Speaker 0: I don't know.

327
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,440
Speaker 0: I like the girl in the upper right with her yelling.

328
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:48,364
Speaker 1: No, I like that.

329
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,409
Speaker 1: I like the can't dance one.

330
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,192
Speaker 0: It's just.

331
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:50,815
Speaker 0: it's really good.

332
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,337
Speaker 0: Check it out.

333
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:51,920
Speaker 1: It's cute stuff.

334
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:56,113
Speaker 0: It's also I point out not just ripped out of dig or college humor.

335
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:58,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so check this out already.

336
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,726
Speaker 1: This is totally ripped out of.

337
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:03,019
Speaker 1: uh, I forget where but it doesn't matter.

338
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,586
Speaker 1: Take your Lupin the third TV series opening animation.

339
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:12,579
Speaker 1: replace the Lupin gang with Metal Gear.

340
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,099
Speaker 1: That is my thing of the day.

341
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:19,057
Speaker 1: You probably saw this on the Internet's maybe already maybe not.

342
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,363
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter Really?

343
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:35,379
Speaker 1: Like I can tell that this is really funny and some of it is funny But because I don't really know Metal Gear was so well I don't get some of the jokes, but yeah, if you know Lupin and you know Metal Gear It's obvious that this is probably gonna crack you up.

344
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:46,557
Speaker 0: We're definitely well, we might get a little bit of hate for this but I remember when I played Metal Gear Solid 1 and I didn't really like it that much and it was an okay game from what I played.

345
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,200
Speaker 1: I didn't play enough.

346
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,728
Speaker 1: I mean, I should seek out the GameCube version.

347
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,290
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

348
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:59,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel as though I don't know If this might be one of those things were just mark sauce as from the previous generation of gaming much like the most recent VgCads.

349
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,807
Speaker 1: you like right you like Metal Gear 1.

350
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Metal Gear 1 is my favorite metal.

351
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:03,414
Speaker 1: Metal Gear 2.

352
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:08,189
Speaker 0: Oh my god Wait, wait, there was no Metal Gear 2.

353
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,072
Speaker 1: Oh, you're sorry.

354
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:10,437
Speaker 0: I have no son.

355
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:11,200
Speaker 0: That's right.

356
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,260
Speaker 1: How could I imagine such a fake thing?

357
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,656
Speaker 0: So I used the game genie to cheat at Metal Gear 2. cuz fuck that game.

358
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:20,639
Speaker 1: I thought it didn't exist.

359
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:27,339
Speaker 0: Well, I stopped playing with my mind and some game right this game and I cheated at it.

360
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:37,247
Speaker 0: And then I realized that I couldn't save my game because I couldn't die because the cheat code I used and And I'd already gone on halfway through.

361
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,954
Speaker 0: that game is impossible and stupid.

362
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,340
Speaker 0: That's like, oh my god.

363
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,166
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter.

364
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:41,570
Speaker 0: That's right.

365
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,966
Speaker 1: Red just made that whole thing up.

366
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:53,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Metal Gear 1 is our business, you know That game is nothing but a pack of cigarettes and a fist and a fist.

367
00:21:53,463 --> 00:22:06,035
Speaker 0: I love how later in the game you get that Trunch Dogs You get that transmitter like you get you get captured and then you get let go and you got this extra item now called Transmitter and I remember I got it and I was like, oh, what's that?

368
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,420
Speaker 0: - and I used it and it disappeared.

369
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:13,240
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh no, no, I gotta save it for whatever I use it for because it's obviously awesome.

370
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,957
Speaker 0: so I You know started again got to that point made sure I didn't use it trying to think about what it would do or when I was gonna use it.

371
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:28,100
Speaker 0: and for the rest of the game Every screen I went to the bad guys knew how it was there.

372
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,020
Speaker 0: They tried to kill me because you see the transmitter was a bug placed there by the bad guys.

373
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:37,711
Speaker 0: You were supposed to use it as in you discover and destroy it But I was too clever.

374
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,688
Speaker 0: I kept it For the whole rest of the game.

375
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:48,380
Speaker 0: I kept it and then my friend Joe said He basically told me in no uncertain terms that I was an idiot.

376
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,967
Speaker 0: That was the first I realized.

377
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:54,174
Speaker 1: thus is the way of the NES game.

378
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:55,860
Speaker 0: Oh man, remember those mazes?

379
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, which truck do I get on?

380
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:00,858
Speaker 0: All the time to move?

381
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:07,820
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, we got to do a show on Metal Gear one, I didn't play it enough really.

382
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can beat that game pretty quick.

383
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,032
Speaker 1: I've only played like maybe 20 screens of it.

384
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's actually kind of far.

385
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:15,468
Speaker 1: It's pretty far.

386
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,659
Speaker 0: No, it's not at all.

387
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,355
Speaker 0: That barely gets you into the first building.

388
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:19,859
Speaker 1: I know.

389
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:29,579
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we were thinking about reviewing Kazu no yo Jimbo tonight, which is kind of an older anime and it's not that old I mean, it's it's this millennium anime.

390
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,126
Speaker 0: Well, no it isn't.

391
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,471
Speaker 1: yeah, what year is it from?

392
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:38,308
Speaker 0: I might have maybe I think might have come out like 2001 I don't remember but this millennium anime.

393
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:41,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever that's still seven years ago.

394
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:43,519
Speaker 1: It came out when we were at an RIT.

395
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,160
Speaker 0: It must have been 2002 at least I'm guessing but it was in the early days before I was a run in the anime club.

396
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,500
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure anyway, cuz I remember I only watched one disc of it and you have the second one.

397
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,540
Speaker 1: So we're thinking we'll watch the second disc before we review the show.

398
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,820
Speaker 0: We got to give it at least a fair shake and I'm not sure if I'm gonna watch the rest.

399
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,660
Speaker 1: It's sort of a an ambiguous kind of show and it's I can't really tell if it's good or bad.

400
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:06,618
Speaker 1: So I need to watch some more.

401
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:15,780
Speaker 0: But as a result instead of reviewing something we're gonna you know Do the classic cop-out and have a have a topic in anime manga or comics.

402
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:21,560
Speaker 1: It's a little bit of a cop-out show because it's similar to a show we've done before but it'll also be kind of short.

403
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,006
Speaker 0: Hardly because it's late and I'm tired But it really a bunch of pizza.

404
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,475
Speaker 1: the episode also sort of has an agenda.

405
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:34,473
Speaker 1: in that we've realized People really don't seem to understand what we have to talk about.

406
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:35,255
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

407
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:45,150
Speaker 0: every time someone on the internet asks the question, you know, I Keep hearing about this anime thing, but I don't know much about it.

408
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,875
Speaker 0: Maybe I could get into it.

409
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:50,659
Speaker 0: What show Should I watch?

410
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is we did an episode on how to get into anime.

411
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:56,780
Speaker 1: So if you're asking that question.

412
00:24:57,221 --> 00:25:02,097
Speaker 1: You can go and listen to that episode that I guess it's an older episode of ours and it'll answer the question.

413
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:06,332
Speaker 0: the short answer However is watch the first DVD of cowboy bebop.

414
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:10,920
Speaker 0: if that doesn't do it for you watch Anything directed by a man named Satoshi?

415
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but despite us doing that episode, you know You think that episode would also right.

416
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:26,780
Speaker 1: if someone wanted to get their friend into anime They would just sort of interpret the instructions of how to get yourself into anime and transfer them to the friend.

417
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:29,800
Speaker 0: It asked watch cowboy bebop.

418
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:46,840
Speaker 1: Yes But apparently people don't seem to understand this and a lot of people on the internet when confronted, you know Anime fans when confronted with someone who is not an anime fan asking about anime Will tell them all sorts of stupid shit that makes them not anime fans.

419
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:49,460
Speaker 0: It seems like there's a bunch of different classes of these people.

420
00:25:50,708 --> 00:26:00,080
Speaker 0: There's the Old-school anime fan or the or the other way to put it is the anime fan who's otaku wang is bigger than your otaku wang.

421
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what he'll do is he'll name drop.

422
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:16,980
Speaker 0: He will say he'll always name either Shows that are not necessarily that great or weren't that well received but have a cult following Mostly from the late 80s early 90s or they'll name shows that there's no way you've seen them.

423
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Speaker 0: They've never been released in English anywhere.

424
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,600
Speaker 1: Well, I think with those people actually tend to do is they tend to be the older school fan, right?

425
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,653
Speaker 1: So they'll tell you to watch the show that they started on cuz like.

426
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,660
Speaker 1: well this show got me interested in anime.

427
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,804
Speaker 1: So look at you and just anime.

428
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:34,719
Speaker 1: so they always give you like a star blazers or a macross or something like that.

429
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,120
Speaker 0: But I think a lot of those people also Just they get I think they like the idea of giving the off answer.

430
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:51,333
Speaker 0: Like if you go into a thread where someone asked hey I don't get an anime and someone says watch cowboy bebop eska flown a Evangelion try gun the Akira movie, you know, they the same list Miyazaki's.

431
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,460
Speaker 0: and so she can yes, that's pretty much it.

432
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,423
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it right there.

433
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:59,500
Speaker 0: They always want to say something but someone else already said cowboy bebop at all.

434
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what they do is they think what.

435
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,171
Speaker 0: what can I say?

436
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,355
Speaker 0: That'll make me sound cool.

437
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,105
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Macross Do you remember love?

438
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:08,350
Speaker 0: and while that's a good movie?

439
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,797
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's quite forward.

440
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,580
Speaker 0: I guess an anime new.

441
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:11,865
Speaker 1: Actually, you know a lot.

442
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,897
Speaker 1: this is a side note, but a lot of those fanboys are all about.

443
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:15,620
Speaker 1: do you remember love?

444
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:16,684
Speaker 1: I don't like.

445
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:20,000
Speaker 1: I think the TV series is what you should watch and screw the compilation movie.

446
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,362
Speaker 0: I don't know.

447
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,013
Speaker 0: the compilation movie does its job.

448
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:24,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess It's not anyway, it's not like.

449
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:25,953
Speaker 0: it's a bad movie.

450
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:26,314
Speaker 0: I don't.

451
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:32,292
Speaker 0: Hey, whatever You're just you wanted to generate some hate mail.

452
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:34,080
Speaker 0: That's the only reason you said that you're home.

453
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,465
Speaker 1: I've said it before hoping.

454
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:37,855
Speaker 0: I've said before you said that is you're over.

455
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,180
Speaker 0: the Darryl Surratt is sitting there.

456
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:44,940
Speaker 0: I've told them before I know and he's sitting there right now going damn it Scott you said that again.

457
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:50,155
Speaker 0: Yeah I will see here in furious silence and then I'll watch this.

458
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:55,300
Speaker 0: to the North Star episode 78 Where I don't know if no one has some guy gets a head exploded.

459
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,270
Speaker 1: I so the other thing.

460
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,304
Speaker 1: a lot of people mistake when you know They'll be an anime fan.

461
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:04,640
Speaker 1: their friend who is not an anime fan will say hey, I'm interested in maybe trying some anime.

462
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,343
Speaker 1: What should I watch?

463
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:09,080
Speaker 1: that they'll tell their friend their personal favorite?

464
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:13,560
Speaker 1: Right, you don't tell someone else right your favorite anime.

465
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:14,587
Speaker 0: I mean, it's hard.

466
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:20,520
Speaker 1: if your favorite anime is cowboy bebop Then I guess you don't hear him telling people to start watching at Utena if they're not into anime.

467
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,211
Speaker 0: Yes, if someone has never heard of anime and they're asking me for suggestions.

468
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:27,200
Speaker 0: I do not say shoujo kakume Utena.

469
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,383
Speaker 1: No, that's rims favorite show.

470
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:33,280
Speaker 0: Well, it's as my love that show, but I think it's a tie between that and captain Tyler.

471
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,313
Speaker 1: Well, even so you don't tell people to watch either.

472
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,589
Speaker 1: one of those is the first show I barely tell anyone to watch.

473
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:41,755
Speaker 0: captain Tyler cuz while I love it You really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy captain Tyler.

474
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:45,688
Speaker 1: Yeah The earlier episodes work in an anime club.

475
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:48,295
Speaker 1: They hope the rest of the episodes don't work.

476
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,060
Speaker 1: So well, that's the right circumstances.

477
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:51,803
Speaker 0: They're kind of it's.

478
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:52,988
Speaker 0: there's their shows.

479
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:53,992
Speaker 0: that and not just that.

480
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:54,635
Speaker 0: but there's a lot like.

481
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:55,960
Speaker 0: Excel saga is a good example.

482
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:03,252
Speaker 0: I think it's a great show because when it came out like it the parody level was a Thousand times more parody than any anime I'd ever seen.

483
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:17,840
Speaker 0: that was parodying other anime yep, and it was hilarious and wacky and here's a zany kind of humor, but It's a show that if you've never seen anime it is not only incomprehensible But possibly stupid and frightening.

484
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:18,300
Speaker 0: Yeah

485
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:31,820
Speaker 1: I mean if you were to make a list of Like, you know if you're to rank every anime in the universe in order from you know Number one is the best possible show for a new fan and like number a billion is the worst possible show for a new fan.

486
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:44,159
Speaker 1: Excel saga would probably be the very last show on the list except for all the hentai has to just come after it And I guess the way I would say it is it's a show for the advanced anime watcher.

487
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:44,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

488
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:48,180
Speaker 1: it's not the show you start out with or at least the experienced anime watcher.

489
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:59,065
Speaker 0: I mean There's some shows that just they jump right into something that if you're not kind of already familiar with the tropes or the mores or They like the character arch types Lucky stars and the Haru.

490
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:03,780
Speaker 1: He's are not gonna work on someone who is a brand new to anime and hasn't watched a bunch already.

491
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:05,139
Speaker 1: So it's just not gonna happen.

492
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,948
Speaker 0: I guess the point there is what you really have to do if you want if someone else if you want them Who then they don't watch anime?

493
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,799
Speaker 0: to watch anime you want to spread your fandom?

494
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,683
Speaker 0: Remove yourself from the equation and think about things in terms of well There's two ways to look at it.

495
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:23,859
Speaker 0: one is what are the majority of people like like what are the most?

496
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,569
Speaker 0: Popular across the broadest spectrum of people.

497
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:33,187
Speaker 0: and that second part is key because while like bleach is crazy Crazy popular.

498
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:41,978
Speaker 0: It's crazy crazy popular among Certain specific groups of people and it's generally maligned or not enjoyed by most other groups of people.

499
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:49,220
Speaker 1: Yep But something like spirited away is enjoyed by almost everybody except Kalani except one guy.

500
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:57,838
Speaker 1: But I mean that is that is you know It's something just pretty much almost any human being of any age and demographic can find some joy in somewhere.

501
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,141
Speaker 1: almost It was like 99%.

502
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:06,560
Speaker 1: So if a random person comes up to you and says I want to get into anime Saying spirited away is something you should watch is not a bad answer.

503
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:15,214
Speaker 1: in fact I would always suggest using movies as opposed to TV shows as actions to anime because someone can get the whole thing in one shot.

504
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:19,840
Speaker 1: getting someone to watch a 26 episode TV series is much more difficult.

505
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:23,753
Speaker 1: Even a 13 episode is much more than even a 4 episode OAV.

506
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:27,125
Speaker 1: much more difficult than a movie Which is one and done.

507
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:33,749
Speaker 0: to get someone into anime at IBM once I had to Basically beat them over the head.

508
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:41,980
Speaker 0: I gave him cowboy bebop and they were like Five episodes and I was like, alright look just watch the fifth one.

509
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:45,771
Speaker 0: If you like that watch the first one.

510
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:50,887
Speaker 0: if you like that watch the rest and Finally watch the fifth episode.

511
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:54,399
Speaker 0: He was like, I'd never seen a cartoon where someone pulled a gun before.

512
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,538
Speaker 0: But sadly that's often the kind of angle you have to go at least with people who aren't.

513
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,623
Speaker 0: I mean There are people who just they know about anime They just don't watch it.

514
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:10,560
Speaker 0: and then there are people who just are unaware of the idea that animation is not a genre.

515
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,376
Speaker 0: That means shows for people under the age of two.

516
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:19,869
Speaker 0: Yeah so what you want to do is Empathize with the person figure out.

517
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,438
Speaker 0: All right, what do they like?

518
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:21,760
Speaker 0: ask them?

519
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,098
Speaker 0: What shows they like what movies they like if they like?

520
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,273
Speaker 0: Alfred Hitchcock like thrillers and they like every Alfred Hitchcock movie and that kind of thing.

521
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:42,251
Speaker 0: or like the old like Dean Coons books or any like sort of psychological thriller then give them a copy of perfect blue because it's just a thriller a Psychological thriller that happens to be animated.

522
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:48,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they're liking, you know Westerns and stuff then give them you know, the old try gun.

523
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:52,129
Speaker 0: if they're liking well Well, it depends because try gun starts out a little.

524
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,615
Speaker 0: I had to convince my dad.

525
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:58,350
Speaker 0: I was like dad seriously, trust me It's not that guy running around with donuts or whatever.

526
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:05,253
Speaker 1: No if they like, you know, like fantasy action You can maybe give them some slayers or some other, you know, you got.

527
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:07,200
Speaker 0: well again, that's one of those.

528
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,584
Speaker 0: What kind of fantasy do they like?

529
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:09,327
Speaker 0: are they?

530
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:13,340
Speaker 0: if they're busy if they're a D&D playing beer and pretzels?

531
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,049
Speaker 0: Let's go kill the dragons.

532
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:24,300
Speaker 0: They'll probably find slayers Hilarious probably if they're a. I'm a serious business dungeon master and I play serious business dungeons and dragons.

533
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,572
Speaker 0: The original lotus war is gonna kick their ass.

534
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:27,954
Speaker 0: They will.

535
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:28,777
Speaker 0: they will love that.

536
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:32,580
Speaker 0: they'll eat that up Yeah, so it's like then they'll murder you when they find out where it goes.

537
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:36,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you don't know the person you got to go the general route.

538
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,212
Speaker 1: You know stuff that almost anyone will like.

539
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 1: but if you do know the person Then or if you add you can always question them out - you say what do you like, you know?

540
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,970
Speaker 1: What kind of like, you know, what's your favorite movie?

541
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:49,220
Speaker 1: if they say, you know Blade Runner?

542
00:33:49,780 --> 00:34:00,578
Speaker 1: Maybe you could give them some Akira's or something or maybe some ghost in the shell action Yeah, or if they like a procedural cop dramas or things like that get him some standalone complex.

543
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,505
Speaker 1: Yeah It's pretty much.

544
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:05,959
Speaker 1: don't go around telling people it sucks.

545
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:09,840
Speaker 1: I don't like it, you know, if you're a big giant robot fan that that's great.

546
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,231
Speaker 1: You can like your giant robots.

547
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:13,264
Speaker 1: your giant robots are awesome But it's not the most.

548
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:17,943
Speaker 1: but if someone comes up to you and says I want to be an anime fan I'm thinking about it.

549
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:18,665
Speaker 1: What should I watch?

550
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,572
Speaker 1: Don't be like you should totally watch.

551
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,860
Speaker 1: get a robo because that will not work.

552
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,050
Speaker 1: No, you will turn them off of anime better.

553
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,040
Speaker 0: It's all about great King Mazen Kaiser.

554
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:39,134
Speaker 1: It's like you're gonna make a bad impression on them even if you know It's something that you like, you know, and I think another part of the problem Is that some of these people out there they know this.

555
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:42,125
Speaker 1: I'm not telling them anything new But they're thinking in their minds.

556
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,480
Speaker 1: Well, if they're not gonna like the giant robots, I'd rather have them not like anime.

557
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,992
Speaker 1: You know, it's like they don't want to make an anime fan.

558
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:50,500
Speaker 1: They want to make a giant robot fan.

559
00:34:50,580 --> 00:35:00,240
Speaker 0: I think that goes back into the same mentality that causes people to Name-drop instead of actually giving I guess useful recommendations based on a person's interests.

560
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:06,326
Speaker 1: This is actually something I've noticed in like reviews in general I mean serious reviewing.

561
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,312
Speaker 1: people don't seem to have this problem as much.

562
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:16,839
Speaker 1: but like people just giving sort of like their offhand Reviews and forums and blogs around the net, you know, people don't seem to be able to sort of.

563
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:36,265
Speaker 1: you know Review is an entirely subjective thing But people's don't seem to be able to separate like their personal, you know quirks and tastes in their review from the sort of actual, you know criteria critic Criticisms like.

564
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:47,220
Speaker 1: you know, if you say something, you know has ugly character designs, you know That's sort of a general criticism Like if it's drawn poorly or you know, it's skipping frames in the animation or something.

565
00:35:47,664 --> 00:36:00,360
Speaker 0: General criticism, but if it's just Escaflowne or something like and something designed by Amano or you just don't like it personally then I think the good reviewer says Well, if you're like me, you won't like these character designs.

566
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:07,140
Speaker 0: But if you're like if you're the kind of person who likes really really thin angular people then this is your show.

567
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,832
Speaker 1: I'm thinking more along the lines of you know, the people who are like.

568
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,580
Speaker 1: this show has no robots.

569
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:12,679
Speaker 1: Therefore it sucks.

570
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,883
Speaker 0: It's all the people who say this show has robots and therefore it's like someone on the forum said something to the effect of blah blah blah.

571
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:27,919
Speaker 0: ribbon Scott really loved those giant robot shows and I found that interesting because I actually dislike the vast majority of giant robot shows.

572
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:35,240
Speaker 0: In fact, I like the idea of a giant robot is way cool Yes, but I feel like I like it mostly in an ironic way like giant Robo.

573
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,139
Speaker 0: Well one that show is not what you expect and that's that's the time.

574
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,527
Speaker 0: I wouldn't call that a giant robot show almost.

575
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:42,290
Speaker 0: It's something special.

576
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:50,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like shows like Escaflowne It has robots in it, but it's not a giant robot show.

577
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,898
Speaker 0: In fact, it if anything it's a shoujo with shounen elements or shounen with shoujo elements.

578
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:57,440
Speaker 0: fantasy.

579
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:03,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there were a lot of people, you know when we start did our prince of the nothing thing They were like, yeah, I don't.

580
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,673
Speaker 1: I don't like fantasy books.

581
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,540
Speaker 1: I'm like what it's like.

582
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,591
Speaker 0: What do you mean you don't like fantasy book?

583
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:09,892
Speaker 1: Well, it's.

584
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:11,280
Speaker 1: it's like how do you write?

585
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like you just don't like the theme that's on top of the actual story.

586
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:16,545
Speaker 1: It's like how do you?

587
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:22,566
Speaker 1: I don't understand how people can have such sort of especially narrow Short-sighted sort of taste.

588
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:29,383
Speaker 0: I knew someone at RIT who loved the Star Wars novels, but hated Fantasy novels.

589
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:38,105
Speaker 0: then I was like I'm exact thing except I'll just replace the lightsaber with get Excalibur Exact kind of story.

590
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

591
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:39,670
Speaker 1: no, you know, it's.

592
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:40,894
Speaker 1: I think it's the same thing.

593
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:41,556
Speaker 1: We have video games.

594
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of like.

595
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:48,067
Speaker 0: a lot of people say oh, I like I hate science fiction But the only science fiction they know is Star Trek.

596
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,320
Speaker 0: They don't know about the Heinlein's and the Asimov's the speculative fiction.

597
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:51,864
Speaker 1: Yeah to them.

598
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:54,160
Speaker 1: It's like science fiction means spaceships.

599
00:37:54,642 --> 00:38:03,057
Speaker 0: No, not really, but at the same time inside his science there are people who also bother me where they say no It's only truly science fiction if it's an Asimov or a Heinlein's like.

600
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:05,740
Speaker 0: no Can have dumb speculative fiction.

601
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:08,583
Speaker 1: But it's like.

602
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:13,977
Speaker 1: a lot of people seem to only judge things and see things on the surface level like.

603
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:18,522
Speaker 1: how many times do we Like, you know we get two different video games, you know And like.

604
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:29,580
Speaker 1: we'll look at like Ikaruga and Gradius and we'll say those are two completely different games and someone else will look at him And say but they're both shooting spaceships and I'm like no one is a memorization game and what is a reflexes game?

605
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:35,396
Speaker 1: They're completely different and unrelated and that's sort of the same thing that happens here with anime and everything else.

606
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:45,619
Speaker 1: is we look through the surface You know, we look at say You know I'm trying to think of to cover and we judge the book by its cover, right?

607
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,233
Speaker 0: Right, of course The one thing I can say is the prince of nothing books the originals at least.

608
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:56,254
Speaker 0: there was nothing on the cover But some fancy script and the title and the author's name and now the cover has.

609
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,900
Speaker 0: now the cover has a picture of some guy.

610
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:04,140
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to think of two anime that have completely different themes on the surface level but are very similar underneath.

611
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:04,742
Speaker 0: It's guys.

612
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:09,278
Speaker 0: easier to find two shows that look like they're exactly the same but actually aren't.

613
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,954
Speaker 1: I guess Mmm, well like Evangelion looks a lot like wrote, you know other robot shows.

614
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:16,820
Speaker 0: It even starts like a giant robot show.

615
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:23,765
Speaker 0: Yes, well like interesting first episode and then it's well like this giant robot This one and this one.

616
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:24,527
Speaker 0: but big Oh.

617
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:29,080
Speaker 1: big Oh looks a lot like road even more like giant robot shows in Batman.

618
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:38,092
Speaker 0: big Oh is just a show where every episode the big Oh punches some other robot in the face But it's not even close to a giant robot show.

619
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,767
Speaker 1: if you look underneath the surface It's actually I.

620
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:45,596
Speaker 0: I guess that's the thing A lot of people would write off a show like big Oh because they're like, oh giant robots.

621
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,420
Speaker 0: That's anime crap.

622
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Speaker 0: But big Oh in my opinion and I'm dead serious here I think we did this is our first final thought show we did on big Oh a long time.

623
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,166
Speaker 0: Yeah it was a long time ago.

624
00:39:55,728 --> 00:40:00,364
Speaker 0: big Oh is one of the more meaningful more interesting and Deeper anime out there.

625
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,468
Speaker 1: like definitely like.

626
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:07,294
Speaker 1: in the top 15 or 20, I'd say I definitely say I mean plus There's also this shows out there.

627
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:07,819
Speaker 1: What was that?

628
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,587
Speaker 1: What the hell was the show with the?

629
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:16,744
Speaker 1: we're all that it looked like a normal cute happy evil cries of the Higurashi Higurashi.

630
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,208
Speaker 1: no, not good.

631
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:17,611
Speaker 1: Coronee.

632
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:20,605
Speaker 0: Yeah Emily reminded us.

633
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:20,987
Speaker 0: Yeah.

634
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,553
Speaker 1: So yeah that show.

635
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,100
Speaker 1: you can't be judging the shows.

636
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,432
Speaker 0: I remember the sad show because that was if I remember.

637
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:30,999
Speaker 0: we're you know, we pick a random anime like alright Let's watch episode one of something.

638
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:39,360
Speaker 0: so we Turn on this show and we see someone brutally beating someone else to death with a baseball bat and there's blood everywhere.

639
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,628
Speaker 0: We're like, okay kind of show is this?

640
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:46,008
Speaker 0: some kind of murder drama some kind of psycho drama Some kind of.

641
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,943
Speaker 0: it's not a magical girl unless she's shown it or shoujo bat, but That's not.

642
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:53,746
Speaker 1: you look at fancy.

643
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,636
Speaker 1: Lala you because a magical girl look like princess tutu.

644
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:57,680
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a magical girl.

645
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:06,677
Speaker 0: And yeah, I'm watching princess tutu now and while it is a magical girl show So is utenna in a lot of regards, but that does not mean it's on the same level as Sailor Moon.

646
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:13,580
Speaker 1: Cardcaptor Sakura Is a magical girl show straight up with no with no not much deep action going on.

647
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sailor Moon was pretty much just car.

648
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:17,700
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon was deeper than Cardcaptor.

649
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,516
Speaker 1: only a little More depends on which one you want.

650
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:28,381
Speaker 0: I think you're Underestimating the depth of Sailor Moon and overestimating the depth of Cardcaptor.

651
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:28,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

652
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:47,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is when you recommend anime to people who are not, you know into anime you need to a Suggest things that are popular to most people and not just your favorite because you actually want them to like anime Even if they don't end up liking the anime you like better they be an anime fan than not.

653
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:53,555
Speaker 0: now remember and like the Strategy here if you want to just think about it in terms of I'm gonna get them into this.

654
00:41:53,836 --> 00:42:01,088
Speaker 0: you start broad You show them Cowboy Bebop or some Miyazaki's and you say like check it out Animation is good anime can be good.

655
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:04,259
Speaker 0: and then you you you step it up a little bit like well you liked that.

656
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,800
Speaker 0: Well, this is a little bit more for the refined fat.

657
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,042
Speaker 0: This is you know The next step.

658
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:19,185
Speaker 0: check this out and you and you start them on Cowboy Bebop and you end them on Great King Mazin Fist Kaiser Joe, right Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

659
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:23,700
Speaker 1: and you gotta ask him you got to figure out what their personal taste is in other things.

660
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,613
Speaker 1: You know do they what books they like what comics they like what movies?

661
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,240
Speaker 1: and then you can find anime.

662
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,945
Speaker 1: They're very similar to those.

663
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:35,460
Speaker 0: the only anime John the only genre you're really not gonna find an anime is Western style horror.

664
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:36,566
Speaker 0: You really don't see that.

665
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:39,280
Speaker 1: No, you're gonna find weird Asian horror, which I actually prefer.

666
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends actually what I really like.

667
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:43,070
Speaker 1: the bug boy.

668
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:49,696
Speaker 0: what I was about to say is I really like the quirky Asian Quote-unquote horror like I really like Kataro.

669
00:42:49,796 --> 00:42:54,380
Speaker 1: the guitar was good I like it's our own and I. I was just actually right before we did the show.

670
00:42:54,741 --> 00:43:02,750
Speaker 1: I was looking at my shelf and I saw the bug boy and I remembered how much I like the bug boy So happy in the ocean I liked it.

671
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,780
Speaker 1: the best part is me is going down the slide at the playground.

672
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:22,191
Speaker 1: And Then lastly you have to put your personal tastes aside And examine the shows below the surface level to determine what kind of show they actually Are and not you know, what kind of show I mean.

673
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:22,733
Speaker 1: beard to say.

674
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:30,681
Speaker 0: you say you meet someone who isn't an anime But like the idea of giant robots beating each other to death like just the sets the rocks off and that's what they like Like.

675
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:34,560
Speaker 0: oh man, you're telling me I can see giant robots fighting.

676
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:44,720
Speaker 0: You don't want to show them Ava cuz it's gonna start with giant robots fighting and then it's gonna turn into this Philosophical rant fest and they're gonna get confused and wander away and probably hate you.

677
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the person who needs some ghetto robos.

678
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:54,480
Speaker 0: Yes that some rust hurricanes up in some the messenger's ease or maybe or the same deal.

679
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:55,824
Speaker 0: They like giant robots.

680
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:57,550
Speaker 0: Don't show them giant robot.

681
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:03,420
Speaker 0: It might be confused because the name giant robo You figure if someone likes giant robots.

682
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:09,114
Speaker 0: But no that show is not about what you think it's about and the robot cries and no man.

683
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:09,595
Speaker 1: Yeah.

684
00:44:09,895 --> 00:44:12,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Don't know.

685
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:13,862
Speaker 0: I think that I think we've met our point Well enough.

686
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:14,565
Speaker 0: the.

687
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:20,105
Speaker 0: the catalyst for this show was that someone asked in the forums at one point What should I watch to get into anime?

688
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:26,965
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna be honest pretty much every suggestion that people gave in that thread was just Horrible.

689
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:32,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there was a lot of them were good shows But that's not how you convince someone to like.

690
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:40,191
Speaker 0: your thing is by showing them the like the weirdest or the most Extreme or the most inside examples of your thing.

691
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,640
Speaker 0: you start broad and then you narrow down.

692
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:54,089
Speaker 1: Yep, you know I do find it interesting though a lot of the old-school fans They all a lot of them came in like through the sci-fi's, you know The Akira's the Matsumoto's the Robo tech macross.

693
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:59,434
Speaker 1: is that you know, that was really like the big original draw I think Including myself.

694
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:06,647
Speaker 0: Yeah Well there I mean there was a lot of all the niche fandoms kind of had a lot of overlap in terms of if Nerds and geeks get together.

695
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:13,554
Speaker 0: nerds and geeks tended to like very specific things And now we're having this kind of flowering of geek or Renaissance man.

696
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:14,076
Speaker 1: Yep.

697
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,773
Speaker 1: Oh So this is how we can make more anime fans people.

698
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,640
Speaker 1: you want more anime fans not less, right?

699
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,744
Speaker 1: Okay, so do what we say.

700
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:35,118
Speaker 0: so again in case you forgot cowboy vbop Evangelion eska flown a try gun Miyazaki anything directed by Miyazaki or Satoshi khan or poker poker.

701
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:37,286
Speaker 1: Oh, so Poker Rose is a great.

702
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,720
Speaker 1: Oh, man, you can't really you can't be pretty much no matter who it is.

703
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,135
Speaker 1: You can't go wrong saying this is your first anime because the pig in the airplane.

704
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,120
Speaker 0: We got a review poker.

705
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,969
Speaker 1: Oh, so I only watched it twice.

706
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,014
Speaker 1: It was a while years ago.

707
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,200
Speaker 0: I've seen it like seven times.

708
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,769
Speaker 1: I got a two times man.

709
00:45:51,112 --> 00:46:03,560
Speaker 1: I see a thing is like I think is might still be my number one Miyazaki But like pork erosos always like right on top of it and I think if I watched pork erosos, it might jump ahead again.

710
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:06,124
Speaker 1: I don't know hard to say it's a tough I think.

711
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:07,830
Speaker 0: what the deal with pork erosos?

712
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,320
Speaker 0: if you want to show it to someone is it because it's older?

713
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:15,075
Speaker 0: You can play up the one it still got all the charm of like a Ghibli movie.

714
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:18,303
