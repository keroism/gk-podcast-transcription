1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,120
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, January 12th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,440
Speaker 1: Tonight, we begin our ongoing in-depth series on how to attend conventions.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,818
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:25,000
Speaker 0: So, today at work, I spent about half my day working on our forums.

5
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:30,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, people might have noticed because there was a lot of posting going on while you were fiddling with them.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,199
Speaker 0: And if you didn't notice, that's because you're not on our forums and you should be.

7
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the forums are really hopping.

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,000
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not just saying that to try to get you to go.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,379
Speaker 1: There's actually a lot of people there posting about the show.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you want to, you know, discuss the things we talk about with like-minded people, you should probably go to the forums.

11
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,120
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun, and the more people, the merrier.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,980
Speaker 1: Plus, we added, well, Scott added, avatars.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,341
Speaker 0: Avatars.

14
00:00:54,442 --> 00:01:01,240
Speaker 0: I think it's a lot better than the PHPBB avatars, which are like, they get really big and they stick out into the page.

15
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:06,480
Speaker 0: I don't know, I always think that people use way too big ones, and they're not uniform, and they're all kind of ugly.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,081
Speaker 0: The worst?

17
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:11,300
Speaker 1: Have you ever been on just those unmoderated forums that are out there in the cesspool of the internet?

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:11,972
Speaker 1: Yup.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,419
Speaker 1: The ones that don't have restrictions on like, SIGs?

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,633
Speaker 1: I've seen SIGs that were a full 640x480 like, flash animation.

21
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:21,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't take that stuff.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,374
Speaker 0: So, our avatars just use these cute little 32x32 pixel dealies.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,760
Speaker 0: Other things I added to the forum besides avatars are a few new themes.

24
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,019
Speaker 0: There's a blue theme and a red theme that are new.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're thinking about putting the blue theme or some derivative of it on the main site.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, that way the forum will appear to be seamlessly integrated with the actual site, which could be kind of cool.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,220
Speaker 0: I made the blue theme the default because I think it looks better than the default default theme.

28
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:54,660
Speaker 0: But if you really want the original default theme, it's still in there and you can switch it in your account settings or whatever.

29
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:01,300
Speaker 1: Also, due to popular demand, meaning three people complained about this, there is now a link back to the site from the forum.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:17,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might not be obvious, but now in the big white title that says "Front Row Crew Forums" at the top of the page, if you click on that, it'll take you back to frontrowcrew.com, which you should be going to anyway, even if you, you know, get the podcast via some RSS somewhere.

31
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,358
Speaker 1: Even though not that many do, compared to the people who just download the MP3.

32
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:29,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, but everyone visit frontrowcrew.com and there's actual, like, posts in the blog and other information for you that you should check out.

33
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,360
Speaker 0: And the forum.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,047
Speaker 1: Yep, and regarding that, I just have one quick question.

35
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:37,080
Speaker 1: Whoever's using Winamp to listen to this, like, straight off the feed, I'm curious how you're doing it.

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:46,940
Speaker 1: Because I look at all my feed statistics every couple days, and of all the different readers that it says, like, contact the RSS and download the files, one of them is Winamp.

37
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:50,000
Speaker 1: One all alone, and it downloads every single episode.

38
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:51,720
Speaker 0: Hmm, I wonder.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just curious about that.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,077
Speaker 0: Because I don't think Winamp has a podcatcher in it.

41
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,159
Speaker 1: Unless someone made a plugin that does it.

42
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:57,720
Speaker 0: Maybe.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 1: I don't know, I haven't used Winamp since I switched to Linux.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,954
Speaker 0: I use it, but I only play MP3s in it, and that's it.

45
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,100
Speaker 0: And not often, either.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,140
Speaker 1: I mean, I used to use it for Shoutcast, and I know if you give it a URL of an MP3, it'll just play it, so.

47
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,467
Speaker 0: Another small change I made to the forum.

48
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,420
Speaker 0: You'll notice on the top left, after you sign in, there's a little pull-down menu.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,889
Speaker 0: And you can change the categories in this little menu.

50
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:27,980
Speaker 0: And that way, if you click on the technology category, then only the technology stories will appear.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,720
Speaker 0: And it's easier than clicking on the categories tab, and then clicking on the category you want.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,751
Speaker 0: You can just use the little pull-down menu.

53
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,697
Speaker 0: It makes it a little easier to use.

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,940
Speaker 1: You can see now that there's a lot of discussions going on in there.

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, now that there's three pages of posts, it's a lot easier to filter out the categories using this pull-down on the side than...

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,640
Speaker 1: Now, along with this, we're probably going to add some more categories at some point.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,920
Speaker 1: Because I noticed there aren't that many categories that are useful yet.

58
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll add more categories.

59
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be a problem.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have a really burning desire for us to add a specific one, let us know and we'll think about it.

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,380
Speaker 0: Or maybe we'll just start a new thread, Category Request Thread.

62
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:05,896
Speaker 1: Yep.

63
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,288
Speaker 0: The last thing I added is Private Messaging.

64
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,160
Speaker 0: But it's not private messaging like on PHPVB or whatever.

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,898
Speaker 1: It's really cool.

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,343
Speaker 0: It's much better than that.

67
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:18,760
Speaker 0: I thought it's called Whispering, actually, which is very appropriate to how it works.

68
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,260
Speaker 0: Basically, when you start a new discussion, you can type in someone's username on the forums.

69
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,480
Speaker 0: And it'll auto-complete the usernames in case you forget them.

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,571
Speaker 0: So just start typing a letter and the rest of it will appear.

71
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,040
Speaker 0: You know, like Google Suggest or whatever.

72
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:37,760
Speaker 1: So I swear to God, if anyone takes the name "Rim" with like a "D" at the end of it, I'll kill you.

73
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,624
Speaker 0: Yeah.

74
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:46,080
Speaker 0: And then, you know, set your subject and type your message and you can start your own private discussion with somebody.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Speaker 0: And the only people who can see it are you and that other person.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,340
Speaker 1: Now, cooler, you can do that within another discussion.

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:01,620
Speaker 0: Right, so let's say me, Rim, Joe Blow, and Joe Schmo are having a discussion about... Anime.

78
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,403
Speaker 0: Anime.

79
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:06,600
Speaker 0: And Joe Blow and Joe Schmo start having a fanboy rant, right?

80
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,140
Speaker 0: In the middle of that discussion, I can send a whisper to Rim.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Speaker 0: I type in "Rim" when I... I reply to it just like I would reply to any message.

82
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,056
Speaker 0: But in the whisper box, I type "Rim" and I say, "Wow, these two guys are huge

83
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:20,638
Speaker 0: fanboys.".

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,319
Speaker 0: That'll put a message in that discussion, but only me and Rim will see it.

85
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,780
Speaker 0: And those Joe Blow and Joe Schmo won't see it when they go and look at that discussion.

86
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,040
Speaker 1: I guess the technical turn is side-channel communication.

87
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:40,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're literally whispering to one other person in the discussion without anyone else seeing it.

88
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:41,600
Speaker 0: It's way cool.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, play around with the forum.

90
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,976
Speaker 1: And obviously, let us know if you find anything broken.

91
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:46,840
Speaker 1: We'll fix it right away.

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think anything's broken now.

93
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,500
Speaker 0: I've pretty much fixed it all.

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,800
Speaker 0: Alright, and since we pushed the forum a little bit too much, let me push the rest of our stuff.

95
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,906
Speaker 0: You can email us feedback.

96
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:02,360
Speaker 0: Email still works, and, you know, especially if you're not a forum-type person.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,819
Speaker 0: You just want to talk to us or something like that.

98
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we used to get, you know, not really negative feedback, but constructive criticism.

99
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:12,019
Speaker 1: And we seem to have addressed all the complaints because they stopped coming in.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,580
Speaker 1: Yep.

101
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, so send emails of any sort, audio feedbacks, you know, or anything like that to geekknights@gmail.com.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,423
Speaker 1: Call our phone number.

103
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:28,300
Speaker 1: I mean, if you call it and you leave us a message that's even halfway crap, we'll probably play it and then respond to it in some way.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, the phone number is, I'm going to put it on the website eventually when I redo the blog part.

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,440
Speaker 1: 508-677-0300.

106
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,240
Speaker 0: 508-677-0300.

107
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:46,965
Speaker 1: So, moving on with the news.

108
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:52,040
Speaker 1: We talked a lot about the new Mac Intel PCs coming out.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Speaker 1: And now there's a lot of questions as to whether or not they're actually going to be able to run Windows.

110
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,639
Speaker 1: And the short answer is, no one knows.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,540
Speaker 0: The story is, is that right now, PCs with, you know, normal Intel AMD processors, whatever, have a BIOS in them.

112
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,279
Speaker 1: Basic input/output system.

113
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:11,820
Speaker 1: Right.

114
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,584
Speaker 1: That's all that stuff.

115
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:15,420
Speaker 1: you see when the computer boots before Windows or Linux starts.

116
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,735
Speaker 1: You know, hit F1 and then there's all these options.

117
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:18,400
Speaker 1: you don't understand.

118
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:20,058
Speaker 0: That's all that stuff.

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,608
Speaker 0: Basically, Apple doesn't use BIOS.

120
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,560
Speaker 0: Apple uses Open Firmware, which is more advanced by far.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,725
Speaker 0: BIOS is really, really old and crappy.

122
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,740
Speaker 0: It's just so standard and old that we keep using it instead of switching to something new.

123
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,220
Speaker 0: There's something even newer called EFI, which is something Intel invented.

124
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,240
Speaker 1: Extensible Firmware Interface.

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,283
Speaker 0: Yeah.

126
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:46,960
Speaker 0: They invented that for those Itanium chips, actually.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,740
Speaker 1: Which is, isn't that what's in the MacTiles?

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,688
Speaker 0: That is what is in the MacBooks.

129
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,600
Speaker 0: That, with the Intel Duo whatever chips.

130
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,540
Speaker 1: Now this raises a big question because Windows Vista supposedly is going to support this just fine.

131
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,729
Speaker 1: But Windows XP 2000, 98, 311, not a chance.

132
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,325
Speaker 0: Nope, those do not support it.

133
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:16,600
Speaker 0: However, Windows XP 64-bit edition supposedly does support EFI.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Speaker 1: Of course, that ray of hope is shattered immediately by the fact that these aren't 64-bit processors.

135
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Intel Core Duo is not a 64-bit processor.

136
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,778
Speaker 0: So, the question is, will somebody, will, you know, Windows 2000 XP might just work.

137
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,400
Speaker 0: We don't even know.

138
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:39,900
Speaker 0: If they don't work, will somebody create some sort of patch or mod to make them work?

139
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,128
Speaker 0: I say probably yes, definitely.

140
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,217
Speaker 0: Will Linux work?

141
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,040
Speaker 0: Almost certainly.

142
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:55,720
Speaker 0: But it could be that you just can't run Windows 2000 XP and that you will need to have Windows Vista to run on these Apple Books.

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,599
Speaker 1: And keep in mind that it's not 100% that Windows Vista will work.

144
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:10,680
Speaker 1: Because Phil Schiller, the Apple guy who, the only one who responded to this so far, said that they don't sell or support Windows itself, but at the same time they're not preventing anyone specifically from using Windows.

145
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,815
Speaker 1: So they're not trying to keep Windows off, but they're not trying to make Windows work.

146
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:15,819
Speaker 1: They're just kind of ignoring it.

147
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:25,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically it might work, and it's a pretty good bet that it will, but I wouldn't actually put any money down.

148
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:29,140
Speaker 1: See, I would kind of put money down because I point out two things.

149
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:37,460
Speaker 1: One, EFI, at least in its raw form, but no one knows if they're going to implement this on these specific boxes, can fully emulate BIOS.

150
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:41,033
Speaker 0: Oh, see I read something like that somewhere and I was a little confused.

151
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,600
Speaker 0: So it can emulate BIOS.

152
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,061
Speaker 1: Yes.

153
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:48,381
Speaker 1: However, we don't know if these will do it or if that emulated BIOS will work 100%.

154
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,659
Speaker 1: Because Windows relies on the BIOS more than you'd think.

155
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:58,319
Speaker 1: Two, the reason I'll bet that any Windows is going to work is that one, Grub works just fine with EFI.

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,526
Speaker 1: Two, Grub can boot Windows just fine.

157
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:04,730
Speaker 1: Case closed.

158
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:08,177
Speaker 1: Because once Windows boots, it's fine.

159
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:09,560
Speaker 1: It just has to boot.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,502
Speaker 0: Really?

161
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,420
Speaker 0: It doesn't use the BIOS after it boots?

162
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:18,580
Speaker 1: Not to the point, basically once you get it booted, as long as the hardware abstraction layer is okay, it's going to work.

163
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 1: Now the question will be if the old versions of Windows include a hardware abstraction layer that can handle whatever proprietary bits might be in these MacTel boxes.

164
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, see that's my question.

165
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,580
Speaker 0: It's something no one seems to be addressing.

166
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,409
Speaker 0: These Macbooks have things like the Express slot.

167
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,040
Speaker 0: They have things like the built-in on-motherboard Wi-Fi and USB.

168
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,345
Speaker 0: No, not USB, Bluetooth.

169
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,991
Speaker 0: That's part of the MacBook.

170
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,679
Speaker 0: They have all kinds of Mac stuff in them.

171
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:53,057
Speaker 0: Windows has a lot of drivers, but does it have drivers for that stuff?

172
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:53,620
Speaker 0: Will it work?

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,160
Speaker 1: Now I could see Microsoft specifically going out of their way to add all that to Windows Vista.

174
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,316
Speaker 1: Because, hey, they'll make money selling Windows to people who own Mac hardware.

175
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:01,940
Speaker 1: It's a win for them.

176
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,760
Speaker 0: No, because anyone who's using Windows on Mac hardware totally is not paying for a new copy of Windows.

177
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,640
Speaker 1: I don't know, those people already dropped a couple Gs on a laptop.

178
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you usually have to shell out $250 for Windows.

179
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,035
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see discounts or something.

180
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:19,539
Speaker 1: You never know.

181
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,561
Speaker 0: Maybe.

182
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,393
Speaker 0: I just really don't think Microsoft wants to sell Apple hardware.

183
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,640
Speaker 0: They want to sell hardware that has Windows on it already.

184
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but consider the markup they make when they actually sell Windows in a box.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,900
Speaker 1: I mean, Dell pays, I think, $30 or $40 for Windows, but it's $300 if you go to the store and buy it in a box.

186
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:40,049
Speaker 0: I think the store makes most of that money.

187
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,380
Speaker 0: I don't really think Microsoft is raking it in there.

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,081
Speaker 1: I don't know.

189
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:43,925
Speaker 1: I don't know who buys those.

190
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:48,140
Speaker 1: I mean, I bought a Windows 2000 box in the year 2000.

191
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,740
Speaker 0: I can only see buying one of those in an absolute drop-dead emergency.

192
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:57,511
Speaker 0: You absolutely need a valid Windows CD and CD key.

193
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,740
Speaker 0: You can't get one any faster than going to Staples.

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,187
Speaker 0: You don't know anyone who's got one.

195
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,074
Speaker 0: You can't pirate one.

196
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,440
Speaker 0: All the internets are real slow.

197
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:16,199
Speaker 1: I mean, back in the day, when Windows 2000 came out, I built my computer like the week before that, and then I bought Windows 2000 at the store like the next day.

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,377
Speaker 0: Oh, alright, yeah.

199
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,472
Speaker 1: And back then, you couldn't pirate it.

200
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:20,320
Speaker 1: Now you can pirate it.

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,063
Speaker 0: I bought Windows 98 SE.

202
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:30,540
Speaker 0: I had 95B from already, but I got a 98 SE CD just because 95 couldn't play some of the games I was buying.

203
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,830
Speaker 1: You know, I never had any 95 after A.

204
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:33,649
Speaker 0: Wow.

205
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:37,180
Speaker 1: I used Windows 95 A, and then I had Windows 2000.

206
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,361
Speaker 0: Hmm.

207
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,368
Speaker 0: I had 95B, then I had 98 SE, and then I got 2000 way later.

208
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,240
Speaker 0: And then I got XP for free from school, legally.

209
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:56,660
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember when you got Windows 2000, or when you first really used Windows 2000, and you, the staunch Microsoft hater, admitted that it was in fact a fairly decent product.

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,136
Speaker 0: It was better than Windows 98, is what I said.

211
00:12:59,337 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 0: And it is.

212
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:01,724
Speaker 0: That's about all I said.

213
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:08,659
Speaker 0: Because Linux still just, I was using Linux, I've been using Linux for like seven years, or even more, I don't know, since high school.

214
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Speaker 0: But it was never good enough to be my 100% of the time operating system until like two or three years ago.

215
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,520
Speaker 1: Yup, because I remember I tried, you gave me a copy of Mandrake, and I tried to install it on this extra computer I had, and it installed, and it was just kind of terrible.

216
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:30,880
Speaker 0: You know, the thing was, is that like at the time, Mandrake didn't seem terrible because I had been using Red Hat.

217
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,225
Speaker 0: And relative to Red Hat, it was great.

218
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:45,020
Speaker 0: You know, and it's basically, it wasn't great enough for me to use it all the time, but I also got to think that in college I was playing a lot of PC games, a lot of Steam, a lot of Counter-Strike.

219
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,407
Speaker 0: True.

220
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,779
Speaker 0: So that had a strong effect on it.

221
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:53,960
Speaker 1: I mean, we would literally come home from class like every day, and then just start playing Counter-Strike for like four hours.

222
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:13:55,522 --> 00:14:02,140
Speaker 0: But I did use Linux in college for all of my work, and then my last two years I was pretty much using Gentoo only.

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually, it was weird, but despite the fact that I was in IT, we used Windows a lot more than we used Linux.

225
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:16,760
Speaker 1: Because most of our labs were Windows like Active Directory, Windows Domain, crap, because all the Linux stuff was kind of easy, and they didn't spend much time on it.

226
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
Speaker 0: I had a lab partner do all that, and I did all the Linux stuff.

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,819
Speaker 1: See, I was the lab partner who did all the Windows stuff, and then the other guy did all the Linux stuff.

228
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,980
Speaker 1: Of course, now I use Linux exclusively.

229
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,220
Speaker 0: So for my Think of the Day, I got the video that disappeared from Google Video yesterday is back.

230
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:43,720
Speaker 0: It's basically a video of three guys at a comedy festival singing a song that's kind of funny.

231
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't as funny as I expected anything like that to be, but at least the topic hit close to home.

232
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,360
Speaker 0: Very close.

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

234
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:53,072
Speaker 0: Watch it.

235
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,419
Speaker 1: So my thing, you know how whenever they bring games over from Japan to America, they always Romanize them or localize them?

236
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:09,719
Speaker 1: Like, they'll change the cover, they'll change translation things, they'll take out the cultural jokes that Americans wouldn't get, they'll make the game easier, you know, that sort of thing.

237
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,980
Speaker 1: Well, here's a site that shows the opposite, what they do to games that come from America to Japan.

238
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:18,879
Speaker 1: And they do a lot of the same things.

239
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:24,580
Speaker 0: Well, the biggest thing it shows is the changing of the cover art of the packaging.

240
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,079
Speaker 1: Which was a lot more than you'd expect for some games.

241
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,119
Speaker 0: The biggest one, I think, was this, uh, what was the name of the game, like, Seduki or something like that?

242
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:35,380
Speaker 0: I don't know.

243
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,038
Speaker 1: Yo, some RPG.

244
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,812
Speaker 0: Some RPG.

245
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,779
Speaker 0: But the American cover had, like, this hot CG, obviously CG babe on it.

246
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:53,240
Speaker 0: And the Japanese cover had this hand- well, looked like hand-drawn, anime-style RPG-looking character of the same babe.

247
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,759
Speaker 1: Who I thought was a lot more attractive.

248
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
Speaker 0: I thought it was very much a better looking cover.

249
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:08,100
Speaker 0: Most of the Japanese covers, I think, were either equal but different to the American covers, or just better looking with brighter colors and they were happier.

250
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,619
Speaker 0: I think the biggest example was the Ratchet and Clank ones.

251
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:18,620
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because the American ones were these crappy CG, like you see on the front of every stupid third-party game for every system ever.

252
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:22,700
Speaker 1: And in Japan, there were these funny, anime-type drawings.

253
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in the American covers, there were, like, these angry guys.

254
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,114
Speaker 0: It was an angry cat guy.

255
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,039
Speaker 0: I don't know what he is, but he's an angry guy.

256
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,500
Speaker 0: He's angry.

257
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,539
Speaker 1: He's angry with a gun.

258
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,526
Speaker 0: But on the Japanese cover, he's, like, smiling and he's like,

259
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:34,766
Speaker 0: "Weeeee!".

260
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,579
Speaker 1: Same game in Japan, happy soldiers chilling on a beach.

261
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:46,383
Speaker 0: Yep.

262
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:52,077
Speaker 0: And even though it's the same exact game when you actually play it, except, of course, for the translation, you know, it's 99% the same game.

263
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,600
Speaker 0: But they changed the cover so much because, you know, I guess what appeals to the different cultures and different sides of the ocean.

264
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,138
Speaker 0: But the Japanese covers actually appeal more to me than the American ones do.

265
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:13,599
Speaker 1: I find that interesting, but I note that our taste in games seems to vary greatly from that of most mainstream gamers in America.

266
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:17,180
Speaker 1: We're like the old-school Nintendo-Japan types.

267
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:18,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,920
Speaker 0: I do think, though, that they greatly underestimate how big those types of Japanese games would sell here, and they should really bring more of them over.

269
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think they'd appeal to a wide audience, but I think the audience they do appeal to, namely people like us or people who listen to the show or people who go to, like, anime cons, you know, us types, I think we would more than make up for that.

270
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 0: We would definitely make up for it.

271
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,396
Speaker 0: And, you know, you just don't have to print so many of them.

272
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,179
Speaker 0: I keep saying this.

273
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,985
Speaker 0: Katamari came over.

274
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,820
Speaker 0: They only printed, like, a few copies per store.

275
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:59,440
Speaker 1: And yet, I mean, you all know I've talked about my coworkers in my office periodically, and to say that they're fuddy-duddies, and I hate using that word, it's kind of an understatement.

276
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,219
Speaker 1: They all know what Katamari is and love it.

277
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:02,940
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:09,160
Speaker 0: So, all those other things that are like Katamari that you're keeping from us, Japan, send them on over ASAP.

279
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:11,520
Speaker 0: Alright, so, yeah.

280
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,680
Speaker 1: So, we decided to start another ongoing series.

281
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,540
Speaker 0: Well, it might just be a two-parter, I'm betting.

282
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,478
Speaker 1: At least a two-parter.

283
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:22,820
Speaker 1: We could possibly stretch into three, because this is a subject we could rant on a lot for a number of reasons.

284
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,565
Speaker 1: But basically, conventions.

285
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:31,600
Speaker 1: Anime cons, gaming cons, trade conventions, Linux conventions, all sorts of conventions.

286
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,932
Speaker 0: It's convention season starting about now, I think.

287
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,620
Speaker 0: OhioCon just happened, right?

288
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,142
Speaker 1: Yep.

289
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,879
Speaker 1: And it's not too long until KatsuCon.

290
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:39,361
Speaker 1: Yep.

291
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:46,140
Speaker 0: So, we're gonna prep you all, especially those people who, if you haven't been to a convention, you're thinking about going.

292
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,900
Speaker 0: If you haven't been to a convention not thinking about going, maybe you'll think about going, because you should.

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Speaker 0: Maybe you're a convention veteran, and, you know, it doesn't matter.

294
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:06,140
Speaker 1: Now, I hope we don't sound like condescending, or like we're explaining this stupidly, but I guess, to put it lightly, we've been to a lot of conventions.

295
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,080
Speaker 0: We're, what you could say, grandmasters of convention skills.

296
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,320
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not the old man who has 40 Otacon badges.

297
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,639
Speaker 0: That guy's scary, oh my god.

298
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy has like, he wears this armor of badges from all the cons.

299
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,100
Speaker 0: I don't think he wears it anymore, but I recognize the guy, and I still see him there.

300
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,701
Speaker 1: Yep.

301
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:27,660
Speaker 1: But, the main reason that we want to do this is that we have a lot of friends, and like all of us go to conventions.

302
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,000
Speaker 1: Like, we go to Otacon, you know, 22,000 geeks, and we run into a lot of people we know.

303
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:43,300
Speaker 1: And it seems like almost every other group of people we run into has some sort of drama, or problems, or they had issues with the convention, and it made it a less fun experience overall for them.

304
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:57,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much anyone I meet, even like just hearing complete strangers talk to each other, I just hear a lot of people with some sort of problem, or someone will complain about a convention sucking, and they might even recognize that it was their fault.

305
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,940
Speaker 0: But it was still, they could have had a better time, but they didn't, because they didn't do something, or they didn't know something that I knew, and could do, and could have told them to do.

306
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:18,580
Speaker 1: And, I mean, the main thing is, it started out, we start, we're like, we go to a convention, just a few of us in a room, and every year, some of the people who had drama would decide, hey, we want to stay with Rim and Scott, because their room is awesome, and they don't have trouble.

307
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:28,260
Speaker 1: So, every year we've had more and more people stay with us, and for like this coming Otacon, I've already got three whole rooms booked in the Renaissance just for us.

308
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Speaker 1: And we've had people, like we had a group of people ask us after the last Otacon, hey, can we stay with you guys, because it sucked last year staying with these other people.

309
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:38,056
Speaker 0: Wow.

310
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,717
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,219
Speaker 1: So, I guess all I'm trying to say is we know what we're talking about when it comes to this.

312
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:48,020
Speaker 1: We may not know about viruses, Pete and Lisa and all you people in the forums.

313
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know about conventions.

314
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,380
Speaker 0: We are convention experts.

315
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,420
Speaker 0: So, the first thing you have to know about a convention is, should you go to it or not?

316
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,300
Speaker 1: And, a lot of people really don't, like they say, oh, I want to go to a convention, but they don't really think about what they would actually do at it.

317
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first thing I look at when I'm looking at a convention is location and guests.

318
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,860
Speaker 1: Mostly location, because the number of hours it takes you to get to a con is really going to affect whether or not it's worth it to go.

319
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,680
Speaker 1: I mean, driving an hour to a crappy con is not as bad as driving nine hours to a crappy con.

320
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:36,340
Speaker 0: If this is a convention less than an hour away, it really doesn't matter how crappy it is, even if it's as bad as it could possibly be, it's probably worth going.

321
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,299
Speaker 0: Just because, you know, you'll get something out of it.

322
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:46,840
Speaker 1: Because when we lived in Rochester, I used to do a lot of work with the anime club where we'd go and like show anime at other cons in the area.

323
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,700
Speaker 1: So, we'd go to these little gaming cons and sci-fi cons like Astronomicon and Unicon, and they weren't the greatest cons.

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,780
Speaker 1: They were kind of small, but they were like 40 minutes away and it was a lot of fun.

325
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,680
Speaker 0: But if those were like two hours away, not a chance.

326
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:08,300
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, something like PAX almost has enough draw to get me to cross the entire country to go to it.

327
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we had had money, we probably would have gone this year.

328
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:15,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, we seriously considered going all the way to Seattle from New York.

329
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,620
Speaker 1: Just to hang out with a bunch of nerds and geeks for a weekend.

330
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, because their convention was going to be so amazing.

331
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,190
Speaker 0: I mean, look at the concert they had lined up.

332
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,920
Speaker 0: Damn, mini bosses, MC Frontline, holy crap.

333
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,160
Speaker 1: Now, if you've never been to a con before, you really want to pay attention to what's going on at the con.

334
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Speaker 1: Because for someone who's never been to one before, you want to do all the stuff.

335
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:39,778
Speaker 1: So what matters the most usually is what stuff there is to do.

336
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:47,760
Speaker 1: But if you start going to them a lot, to the point that you've done all the stuff there is, you really don't care what the convention's doing.

337
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,540
Speaker 1: You just go because it's an excuse to hang out with your friends in this unique setting and meet new people.

338
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,799
Speaker 0: That's pretty much how it is.

339
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,960
Speaker 0: I mean, once you've seen one cosplay, you've seen them all.

340
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,960
Speaker 0: And once you've seen one music video contest, you've seen them all.

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,020
Speaker 0: And once you, you know, had one Giant Land party, you played them all.

342
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:13,280
Speaker 0: And sure, it might still be fun to do it again, but it's not, it's like once you, when you go to your first convention, all you want to do is do all these things you've never done before.

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,598
Speaker 0: And then after a few cons, you're like, "I done all that," and you're looking for something new, but there won't be anything new.

344
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,239
Speaker 0: The only way to get something new is to go to a different type of convention, but eventually you run out of those too.

345
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:31,060
Speaker 1: So don't be the person who goes to, like, their ninth Otacon and sits in the room all alone complaining that there's nothing cool to do.

346
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:35,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta, you know, you start out doing all the cool things, but then it's still cool.

347
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,760
Speaker 0: Some people, a lot of people just stop going to them, they've noticed.

348
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,620
Speaker 0: But we keep going because, you know, we make our own fun, you know?

349
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Speaker 0: I mean, Nintendo DS helped a little bit.

350
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, quite literally, we go to Otacon every year, and we do almost nothing at the con.

351
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,720
Speaker 1: We barely, I mean, we don't go in any panels.

352
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,019
Speaker 0: I think we went to one panel.

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I ran that one panel.

354
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:56,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Speaker 1: And we watch, like, we watch one closing ceremonies type thing.

356
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:05,440
Speaker 0: I spent more time in the live-action Asian cinema room than any other single room.

357
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:09,160
Speaker 0: Like, I might have spent equal time there and the dealer's room.

358
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,959
Speaker 1: I spent most of my time just hanging out.

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I was hanging out, oh, most of the time total for the whole weekend, hanging out.

360
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Speaker 0: But most of the time at con events was, you know, dealer's room and that room.

361
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:30,180
Speaker 0: You know, it's, and, but newbies, they go to every single freaky panel, and they go to every single, you know, all this, you know, wacky stuff.

362
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,180
Speaker 0: That, I guess, gets old pretty quick.

363
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,800
Speaker 1: So I guess just think about what you want out of the con, and then see if the con will provide it.

364
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,480
Speaker 1: I mean, if you want to see the biggest gathering of geeks in all the world, go to Otacon.

365
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,020
Speaker 1: Because Otacon, while it's an anime convention, is the closest thing to a pan-geek convention you'll ever find.

366
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,039
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

367
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,960
Speaker 1: If you want gaming, find a gaming convention, because it'll be nothing but playing games with cool people all night long.

368
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,335
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of UberCon.

369
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:56,779
Speaker 1: I go to.

370
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,600
Speaker 1: I used to go to Michicon, but I don't live in Michigan anymore.

371
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,538
Speaker 1: I went to GenCon once, and if you can ever get to GenCon and you're a gamer, try it.

372
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,960
Speaker 1: But if you're not really into games, GenCon's not worth it.

373
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,840
Speaker 0: There's also a con I just discovered recently called Essen in Essen, Germany.

374
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,829
Speaker 0: And that's the pinnacle of German board game.

375
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,140
Speaker 0: amazingness that I will go to probably once in my life just to go.

376
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd love to hit that.

377
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,379
Speaker 0: I think I'll just have a trip to, you know, Europe and just happen to have it while Essen is going on.

378
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:34,740
Speaker 0: You know, it's not really worth it to go to Essen, from all this way across the world, but it is worth, you know, if you're on a trip from Europe, you know, why not?

379
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:44,180
Speaker 1: Now, what we're talking about really applies to all cons, but almost all of our examples are going to come from anime conventions, just because those are what we go to the most.

380
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:44,753
Speaker 0: Yeah.

381
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,180
Speaker 1: I mean, I go to gaming conventions, Scott doesn't so much, but they're almost the same.

382
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,560
Speaker 1: Trade conventions are a little different, but don't worry about that.

383
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,800
Speaker 0: I've been to a lot of trade conventions, actually, in the food and technology related areas, and job related areas, so I can talk about those a little bit.

384
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,380
Speaker 0: But they're sort of a different beast, because they're not about entertainment, they're about someone trying to sell you something.

385
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,740
Speaker 0: So you're basically just walking around to booths looking at products and services and people advertising to you.

386
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not going to run into, like, a gaggle of cosplayers with DSs, like, running to a DDR tournament at a thing like that.

387
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:19,479
Speaker 0: No, you're not.

388
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:27,900
Speaker 1: And, actually, we went to one Linux convention, called Pinguacon, in Novi, Michigan, and I gotta say, that was fairly badass.

389
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think any other--from what I can tell based on the website and who's been to these things and the kind of events they've had, I don't think that any other instance of Pinguacon has lived up to the one we went to, so I'm really glad we went when we did.

390
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it was with that one Pinguacon, but we hit solid gold.

391
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,099
Speaker 1: Neil Gaiman was there and told us a story.

392
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,479
Speaker 1: That I slept through.

393
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:50,499
Speaker 1: Scott fell asleep while he was telling it.

394
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:51,071
Speaker 1: Oh god.

395
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,960
Speaker 0: It was a cool-- It was so sad.

396
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,998
Speaker 1: It was a cool Detective Cthulhu story, too.

397
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, he said, "Alright, I'm going to tell you a cool Detective Cthulhu story,".

398
00:26:59,376 --> 00:26:59,717
Speaker 0: and I'm like,

399
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:00,320
Speaker 0: "Alright!".

400
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,450
Speaker 0: And then he's like, "I tried to tell this story at another con, and I didn't finish.

401
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,457
Speaker 0: We're going to see how many minutes it takes to tell this story.

402
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,439
Speaker 0: I'm going to finish it no matter

403
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:08,600
Speaker 0: what.".

404
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,004
Speaker 0: So I'm like,

405
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:09,914
Speaker 0: "Alright!".

406
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,576
Speaker 0: Then I start hearing the beginning of the story, and I'm like,

407
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 0: "Alright!".

408
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:13,960
Speaker 0: And then I fell asleep.

409
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:19,217
Speaker 0: And then when I woke up, and he's like, "Well, it takes exactly 40-something minutes to read that story," and I said,

410
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:19,619
Speaker 0: "Fuck!".

411
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,388
Speaker 1: "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

412
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:21,651
Speaker 1: fuck!".

413
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:27,220
Speaker 1: Plus, it was just, it was weird, because also, Steve Jackson was there, and he wanted to play a board game with us.

414
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I didn't even realize it was him.

415
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:34,955
Speaker 0: Like, we were just playing Puerto Rico in the lobby, and this kind of scruffy guy walks up, and he's like, "Hey, I kind of want to play that,".

416
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:36,679
Speaker 0: and I'm like, "Alright, maybe we'll hook up later,".

417
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:37,220
Speaker 0: you know, whatever.

418
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,869
Speaker 0: And then our friend-- Someone comes over like a minute later, they were like, "Dude, that was Steve Jackson,".

419
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,853
Speaker 0: and I'm like, "No way.

420
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,198
Speaker 0: What are you talking

421
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:43,620
Speaker 0: about?".

422
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,960
Speaker 1: And then we go to a panel, and there's Steve Jackson talking about Steve Jackson games.

423
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,525
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh,

424
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:47,891
Speaker 0: shite!".

425
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:54,360
Speaker 0: But then for a geek fable, we'll tell later, because of that fable, we didn't actually play with him.

426
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could've.

427
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,280
Speaker 1: We were all set to do it, but something happened.

428
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:00,100
Speaker 0: Well, that's a geek fable for another time.

429
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,695
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

430
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:09,180
Speaker 0: So, once you decide if you're going to go to any particular convention, you have to decide who you're going to take with you.

431
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:12,259
Speaker 1: This is probably the single most important decision you can make.

432
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,339
Speaker 1: One bad person in your group of people going to a con can ruin it.

433
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,667
Speaker 0: And, you know, there are things you can do.

434
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:25,300
Speaker 0: if you happen to take a bad person, or, you know, someone might turn bad.

435
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,239
Speaker 0: Like, someone who might be a good person, like, might get sick or something.

436
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,240
Speaker 0: No matter how bad it makes you feel, you have to drop that person like a rock.

437
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:38,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, not to sound cold-hearted, but if someone's dragging you down, cast them away.

438
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,619
Speaker 1: Because there are some people who go to a convention and, for whatever reason, just can't handle it.

439
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:50,240
Speaker 1: And they're probably not trying to make you have a bad time, but they're going to make you have a bad time.

440
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,540
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do about it except to leave them alone in the room.

441
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're spending a lot of time and a lot of money to go to a convention, you know, no matter which one it is.

442
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 0: Even if it's, like, ten minutes away from your house and it costs five bucks to get in, if you're spending more than, like, a day there, you know, or even if you're only spending a day, you don't want that one day ruined, you know?

443
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:17,020
Speaker 1: I mean, I went to--Scott missed this one, but I went to Anime Central with a bunch of my friends, and we always threw crazy parties there, because we had another friend who got the Presidential Suite.

444
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,620
Speaker 1: And we had, like, it was expected that we had a crazy party.

445
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,780
Speaker 1: And me and my friend Luke, we would, like, tend this non-alcoholic anime-themed bar, because the room had a frickin' bar in it.

446
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,940
Speaker 1: So we made funny drinks like the Southern Belle Dandy, you know, stuff like that.

447
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,396
Speaker 1: It was cool.

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,640
Speaker 1: But we're getting ready to set up for the party, and there's a guy asleep in the little bar area.

449
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,180
Speaker 1: And we try to move him, and he got all mad, and he was trying to explain that he needed sleep and he was tired and he was sick, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

450
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,260
Speaker 1: So you guys can't have a party, 'cause I need to sleep.

451
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,360
Speaker 1: Well, guess who slept in the hallway while the rest of us had a party?

452
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:57,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, not that, you know, I can't, I can understand where the guy's coming from, because if I was sleepy and sick, I would feel the same way and probably make the same blah blah blah blah blah.

453
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:07,900
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you know, Akan is the time of ultimate fun, and no one should have to suffer except for the person who is, you know, doing badly.

454
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:18,680
Speaker 1: I mean, in terms of ultimate fun, basically the way we schedule Otakan, which is like the pinnacle of our year when it comes to the convention season, it's like there's all these little cons that lead up to Otakan.

455
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,220
Speaker 1: Then we usually spend the entire week after it at one of our good friend's beach houses recovering from the freaking convention.

456
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,019
Speaker 1: Like the day after the con, we pretty much just pass out for the whole day.

457
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:46,420
Speaker 0: So, when deciding who to take with you to a convention, you wanna bring with you people who are reliable, they're going to pay, whatever, you know, the cost is, and they're not going to be an anchor that drags you down and makes things unfun for others.

458
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,860
Speaker 1: Be especially wary of couples that are going through the throes of breakup.

459
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,380
Speaker 0: Mmm, very dangerous.

460
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,740
Speaker 1: Yes, generally unstable people, you know, people who just, like Scott said, unreliable people.

461
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 0: But, at the same time, bring as many people as possible.

462
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:13,240
Speaker 0: The more you bring, the cheaper it will be, and at the same time, if you have a ton of quality people, that's how you get awesome, awesome parties and awesome craziness going on.

463
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,693
Speaker 1: I mean, this year we brought, what, 15 people, 16 people with us?

464
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:17,545
Speaker 0: Yup.

465
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:24,240
Speaker 1: And across two rooms, we had like 16 people, and then we had like 20 other people scattered in other rooms.

466
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,379
Speaker 1: We had like this giant posse of doom.

467
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,440
Speaker 1: Mmm, giant posse.

468
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,340
Speaker 1: Some people in the other peripheral groups had some drama, which we'll probably tell that story at some point, either today or next Thursday.

469
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,119
Speaker 0: Mmm, oh, that story, okay.

470
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of stories, because all our friends have drama, and we- This is why conventions are so great, because that's where you get all the stories from.

471
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say more than half of our stories are from conventions.

472
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,260
Speaker 0: And thinking about conventions, think about how much time we spend at conventions compared to time not at conventions.

473
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Speaker 0: The fact that there's more stories there than anywhere else, that just shows you why conventions are so awesome.

474
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:01,960
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess if you've never been to a convention, the main thing about them is that, like, look at your normal life.

475
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,919
Speaker 1: You probably know a bunch of geeks around you, but not that many.

476
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,679
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of normal people in the way.

477
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,800
Speaker 1: Imagine if you were in a small town for a weekend, and the only people there were geeks.

478
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:22,400
Speaker 1: The only people there were cool people who are a lot like you and have similar interests, and you can just geek and yell and scream and dress up and do crazy things with no one caring.

479
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,599
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's what it is.

480
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:25,397
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

481
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,019
Speaker 0: And that's why you can't let anyone drag you down.

482
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:31,998
Speaker 0: And if you're someone trying to drag others down, just cut it out.

483
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,639
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're not having a good time, you're upset.

484
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:43,260
Speaker 0: If you're trying to bring other people down, you're the asshole, not the people saying "get away from me" and not being sympathetic.

485
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,500
Speaker 1: Because we've had both types.

486
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:49,740
Speaker 1: I mean, we had a friend once who came to a convention, she was having a really good time, but she actually got sick.

487
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:50,580
Speaker 0: Actually.

488
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,160
Speaker 1: And there was no fault of her own, she was sick.

489
00:32:53,444 --> 00:32:54,173
Speaker 0: And we did feel bad.

490
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,026
Speaker 1: But she did the right thing.

491
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:03,840
Speaker 1: There was nothing we could do to help her, so she stayed in the room and recuperated, and we brought her food occasionally and made sure she was doing okay.

492
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,720
Speaker 1: But she went out of her way to make sure that while she was sick, she didn't hurt anyone else along the process.

493
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:11,820
Speaker 0: And that's the way to do things at a con.

494
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,480
Speaker 1: Yep, which brings back to bring quality people.

495
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:18,280
Speaker 1: If your friends are quality, they won't screw you just because they're having a bad day.

496
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,140
Speaker 0: Alright, the next thing you gotta worry about at a con is registration.

497
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:31,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, basically it used to be the conventional wisdom, and this is like only three years ago, if that, where you didn't want to pre-register.

498
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,240
Speaker 1: Because often the pre-registration line was slower and longer.

499
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:39,340
Speaker 1: Now, at least for anime conventions, this is not the case.

500
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,579
Speaker 1: And in fact, many of the big anime conventions sell out.

501
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,380
Speaker 1: Yup.

502
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,479
Speaker 1: Otakon sold out this year.

503
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

504
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,739
Speaker 1: I voted NekoCon.

505
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,168
Speaker 1: KatsuCon, it almost sold out.

506
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,296
Speaker 1: I don't know if it actually did sell out.

507
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:51,780
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

508
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,260
Speaker 0: A lot of cons are having caps on their registration because they're selling out.

509
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:01,120
Speaker 0: So, pretty much if you don't pre-register, you're not, you're gonna have a very hard time getting in.

510
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:10,780
Speaker 0: And a lot of them have things like Thursday registration, where if you pre-register, then you can get your badge on Thursday, which is a great idea, even though you have to pay one more night in a hotel.

511
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,793
Speaker 0: You spend that many more hours having fun at the con.

512
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,579
Speaker 0: It's totally worth it.

513
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,920
Speaker 0: But you have to really, with registration, you have to consider two things.

514
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,188
Speaker 0: Pre-registration usually gets you a discount.

515
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,739
Speaker 0: You have to look at how big that discount is versus how much money you have.

516
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,978
Speaker 0: You know, if it's really significant to get that pre-registration discount, go for it.

517
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,426
Speaker 0: The second thing is how big the con is.

518
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:36,659
Speaker 0: If the con is crazy huge, pre-registration's probably a good idea.

519
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:43,159
Speaker 0: If the con is a little local con with, like, less than a thousand people or so, it doesn't really matter.

520
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,487
Speaker 0: You just show up and you pay.

521
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,172
Speaker 0: Who cares?

522
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,078
Speaker 0: No one really does.

523
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaker 0: Whatever.

524
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,005
Speaker 0: And just make sure you do register.

525
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:54,560
Speaker 0: A lot of people, if you screw up registration, you could end up taking a long trip to nowhere.

526
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:56,099
Speaker 0: That's never good.

527
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:56,781
Speaker 1: Yep.

528
00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:03,360
Speaker 1: And in terms of registration, think about money, because this all costs money, and you're gonna have to, if you run out of money, it's bad.

529
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,059
Speaker 1: Because we actually ran out of money at a convention once.

530
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,600
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the worst thing that can happen.

531
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first Otacon we went to, we didn't really know what to expect, because our first convention, our first anime convention, was OhioCon.

532
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,120
Speaker 1: And while I've heard OhioCon is a lot better now and is fairly awesome, when we went, this was like the worst convention ever.

533
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,420
Speaker 0: It was the first convention, anime convention I went to.

534
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the first anime con I'd ever gone to, too.

535
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:29,700
Speaker 1: And we went with a bunch of people.

536
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,260
Speaker 0: I think it was the second OhioCon ever.

537
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:32,142
Speaker 1: It was.

538
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:39,120
Speaker 1: And it's really hard to describe without going into excruciating, painful detail why it was so bad.

539
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Speaker 0: We'll talk about it later.

540
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do a whole show on that OhioCon.

541
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:45,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but let's just say that it wasn't the greatest experience.

542
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,889
Speaker 1: So when we decided to go to Otacon, we didn't know what to expect.

543
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,718
Speaker 1: We didn't think that Otacon would be as insane as it was.

544
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:52,400
Speaker 1: We had no idea.

545
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:04,720
Speaker 1: And we show up, and I spent like, I had like $60 with me after the hotel, and I paid my $50 for a registration, and I had $10 with which to live the entire weekend and cover gas home.

546
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,348
Speaker 0: Wow.

547
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

548
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,739
Speaker 1: We drove home without the air conditioning on to make sure we had enough gas.

549
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:12,520
Speaker 0: Oh, is that the one where I got lost in the woods?

550
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:21,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I fell asleep in the back of the car and you were driving, and then I woke up and you guys were in like the middle of the woods with an empty tank of gas and no lights, no street signs.

551
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,040
Speaker 0: That was great.

552
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:24,949
Speaker 1: See, what did I tell you?

554
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,820
Speaker 1: We have so many stories just because of these conventions.

555
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, the next thing is transportation to the con.

556
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,062
Speaker 0: Transportation is real tricky.

557
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:40,751
Speaker 0: If you live, I'd say more than five hours away, look into trains and planes.

558
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:47,980
Speaker 0: If you can't afford trains and planes, you might want to reconsider going to this convention unless it's crazy huge and crazy awesome.

559
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,833
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean people literally drive and fly and train from all over the world to Otacon.

560
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:57,300
Speaker 1: They don't come from all over the world to like Michicon.

561
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,920
Speaker 1: So if you're flying eight hours to Michicon to see like 200 other people, you probably made a mistake.

562
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:12,720
Speaker 0: But just when you consider the distances, don't drive if it's too far because really no convention is worth the pain of that driving.

563
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,511
Speaker 1: Well, honestly, the furthest I've ever driven for a convention is.

564
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,580
Speaker 1: I drove from Rochester, New York to Chicago for Anime Central.

565
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,120
Speaker 0: That's not so bad.

566
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,760
Speaker 1: It took 12 hours because the car broke down on the way.

567
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much the limit.

568
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,800
Speaker 0: And the con has to be pretty big to get you to do that.

569
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,505
Speaker 1: Yep, it was well worth it.

570
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:34,880
Speaker 1: We're going to do a whole show on stories from cons because I just realized how many I have.

571
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we could probably do a whole bunch of shows on stories from cons.

572
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:48,240
Speaker 1: Now, if you're going to take a train, and this really only applies to people in the Northeast Corridor and Amtrak, because in the rest of the country, as far as I'm concerned, Amtrak does not exist.

573
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:49,085
Speaker 0: It does.

574
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:50,420
Speaker 0: It's just slow and random.

575
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,610
Speaker 1: It's not worth it unless you live in the Northeast, like pretty much anywhere around D.C.

576
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,534
Speaker 1: or the New York area or Pennsylvania.

577
00:37:57,554 --> 00:37:58,356
Speaker 1: Amtrak's fine.

578
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:00,220
Speaker 1: Anywhere else, no.

579
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:11,060
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you might want to check it because sometimes you'll get lucky and there will happen to be a train that does exactly what you need, like Florida to, I don't know, somewhere.

580
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,585
Speaker 0: You know, like North Carolina or something like that.

581
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,888
Speaker 0: Because there are trains that do that.

582
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:19,560
Speaker 0: But just check and if there isn't a train that's like perfect, don't even bother.

583
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:27,420
Speaker 1: But the main thing with trains is to book, well one, look at the websites constantly and book like seriously six or seven months in advance.

584
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,468
Speaker 1: Because the next time we went to ASEN, we decided driving is stupid.

585
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:33,490
Speaker 1: We're going to take Amtrak.

586
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,294
Speaker 1: And we took a 12 hour Amtrak.

587
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,300
Speaker 1: But it was only like 60 bucks because we got some crazy deal.

588
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,045
Speaker 1: If you don't get a crazy deal like that, you might be better off flying or driving.

589
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:49,540
Speaker 1: Flying is always real tricky because for a convention, you usually bring a lot of stuff with you and bring even more stuff back with you.

590
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,440
Speaker 1: And the conventions are never actually near an airport.

591
00:38:54,421 --> 00:39:02,040
Speaker 0: One thing to note is that Otacon kind of is okay to fly to because they have a post office at the con and you just mail things to yourself.

592
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,440
Speaker 0: So instead of carrying them home on the plane, you just mail your stuff home and then get on the plane with whatever you want.

593
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,504
Speaker 0: But that's very, very, very rare.

594
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:13,128
Speaker 0: And Otacon is the only con I know of that has that.

595
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:20,060
Speaker 0: So don't fly to a con with a bunch of crap if it's not really, really worth it.

596
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:25,109
Speaker 1: Driving is your best bet because you really want to bring a lot of extra stuff to the con just in case.

597
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,460
Speaker 1: Extra pillows, extra blankets, extra towels, which we'll get into when we talk about how to overstuff a hotel room.

598
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,226
Speaker 0: Oh god.

599
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:32,339
Speaker 0: I think that's next.

600
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,702
Speaker 1: Yup, yup.

601
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:36,632
Speaker 1: But transportation, most people drive to cons.

602
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,560
Speaker 1: And there are a number of things to be aware of.

603
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:47,880
Speaker 1: First of all, once again talking about reliable people, be real wary of who you're driving with and whether or not they're prepared to go.

604
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:51,987
Speaker 0: You gotta make sure, number one, perfect directions.

605
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:58,100
Speaker 0: If your directions aren't flawless, I wouldn't get in a car with someone who wasn't 100% sure they knew exactly where they were going.

606
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,970
Speaker 1: I mean if you're going in a carpool, make one person the directions person.

607
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:05,500
Speaker 1: And they give everyone the same directions and there's a cell phone in every car.

608
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,944
Speaker 0: And make that person responsible.

609
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:14,153
Speaker 0: So if anyone gets lost, make sure you know who to blame when things go wrong.

610
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,960
Speaker 0: If the directions are bad, make sure you give that person what for.

611
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:26,171
Speaker 1: Because when we plan conventions, I guess part of the reason we have such success and a lot of our friends have had trouble is that we actually sit down and plan.

612
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:32,360
Speaker 1: Pen and paper specifically, duties are assigned and responsibilities and blames are laid.

613
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:36,266
Speaker 1: Like we have a thing we always say, like Scott says he's going to do something.

614
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:37,868
Speaker 1: I say, "Alright Scott, that's all

615
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:38,108
Speaker 1: you.".

616
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,131
Speaker 1: We're serious about that.

617
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:45,940
Speaker 1: That means whatever consequences come of Scott's action, they are his to deal with and his to take blame for.

618
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:54,216
Speaker 0: It's basically like, "Alright, you can try that crazy thing, but I don't have confidence in it so you're taking full responsibility if you want to go for

619
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:54,356
Speaker 0: it.".

620
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,040
Speaker 0: That's what all you means.

621
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,952
Speaker 0: So when someone says all you, a lot of times you're just dissuaded from even doing it at all.

622
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,060
Speaker 0: Of course it's great when you do it and it works and the other person does it.

623
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,780
Speaker 1: Now regarding that, I highly recommend that you don't try to caravan a bunch of cars together.

624
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:15,820
Speaker 0: That's a very, very bad idea.

625
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,284
Speaker 1: Now there are a number of reasons for that.

626
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:22,760
Speaker 1: One, I have an anecdote that is fairly detailed and gives you a good picture of exactly what can go wrong.

627
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:26,360
Speaker 0: I think telling the anecdote actually just gives all the stuff we want to say.

628
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically we were going to Otacon.

629
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,516
Speaker 1: It was the first Otacon we went to.

630
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the first one.

631
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,340
Speaker 1: And this con, because the hotel screwed off, it was just a disaster from the start.

632
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,805
Speaker 1: But we were going to drive on our own.

633
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:47,858
Speaker 1: Everyone was going to meet us at the hotel room that we all had and we decided that, "Alright, we'll all go on our

634
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,019
Speaker 1: own.".

635
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,149
Speaker 1: But a bunch of our friends said, "No, we should carpool together.

636
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:51,831
Speaker 1: It'll be fun.

637
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:54,079
Speaker 1: We'll stop on the road and we'll hang out and blah blah

638
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:54,279
Speaker 1: blah.".

639
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:56,724
Speaker 1: So we agreed that, "Alright, fine.

640
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,669
Speaker 1: We're going to leave at X time.

641
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:02,518
Speaker 1: You can follow us if you want, but once again I'll note that I

642
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:02,879
Speaker 1: speed.".

643
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,266
Speaker 1: And when I say I speed, I speed.

644
00:42:06,286 --> 00:42:12,560
Speaker 1: I mean, I quite literally go about 100 miles an hour in the left lane as fast as I can go down the entirety of a freeway.

645
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:20,559
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of people, whatever you want to say about speeding, we can talk about that in another podcast because we're going to put you down so fast.

646
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:29,340
Speaker 0: The point is, is that every minute you're saving by speeding, going 100 miles an hour or more, is another minute at the con.

647
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,890
Speaker 0: And the ticket is worth it.

648
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:33,920
Speaker 0: Especially, you know, it doesn't matter.

649
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:41,160
Speaker 1: I mean, it really adds up because I used to drive a lot between Detroit and Rochester and if I sped, I'd make it in about four hours.

650
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:44,359
Speaker 1: If I drove the speed limit, it took about seven hours.

651
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,279
Speaker 0: Three hours is worth a lot of my...

652
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially when you're only going somewhere for a weekend.

653
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

654
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:52,244
Speaker 0: So, whatever.

655
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,087
Speaker 1: They say, "Alright,

656
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:53,429
Speaker 1: fine.".

657
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:54,935
Speaker 1: I said, "Alright, we're leaving at 6, 6

658
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:55,035
Speaker 1: AM.".

659
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:58,255
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Alright, meet us at our house and then we'll

660
00:42:58,295 --> 00:42:58,375
Speaker 1: go.".

661
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,151
Speaker 1: So we show up at their house at 6 AM, ready to go.

662
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:04,699
Speaker 1: We expect them to get in their car and come with us.

663
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:09,260
Speaker 1: Not only are they not awake, but they have not packed.

664
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,424
Speaker 0: Great.

665
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:10,680
Speaker 0: Great.

666
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,104
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

667
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:16,440
Speaker 1: So, you know, being reasonable people, we waited and that was our first mistake.

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,180
Speaker 1: We should have cut loose immediately.

669
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,248
Speaker 0: We should have just said, "Oh, you're not ready.

670
00:43:20,288 --> 00:43:21,896
Speaker 0: We thought you'd be ready at 6 and you're not.

671
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:22,499
Speaker 0: Well, see

672
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:22,579
Speaker 0: ya.".

673
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:22,850
Speaker 0: Boom.

674
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,319
Speaker 0: That's what we should have done.

675
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:24,840
Speaker 1: Yep.

676
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,843
Speaker 1: Just remember this.

677
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:34,740
Speaker 1: Whenever there's a problem, unless you have a reason to help the person, like they're your good friend or you screwed up, like it's your fault that they're having a problem and not their own fault.

678
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,399
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

679
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:40,120
Speaker 1: But if it's their own fault and they're going to detract from the con, you really got to cut loose.

680
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,010
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

681
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,000
Speaker 1: So we waited and they finally get all their stuff together and then one of them decides to lead us to the freeway.

682
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,840
Speaker 1: Well, he didn't know how to get to the freeway and led us in the middle of nowhere.

683
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,720
Speaker 1: Great.

684
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,582
Speaker 1: Great.

685
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:56,860
Speaker 1: So I passed all of them, flashed my Brights and my Flashers and followed me and I took everyone to the freeway and then we're going.

686
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,603
Speaker 1: So we're on the freeway.

687
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,856
Speaker 1: I get up to about 75 and one of them calls us.

688
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:02,660
Speaker 1: Slow down.

689
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:05,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:07,159
Speaker 0: We're probably not going to slow down.

691
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:07,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

692
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:12,900
Speaker 1: So we slowed down a little, but we kept inching up and they eventually followed us around 75.

693
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,820
Speaker 1: Even though I really wanted to be going about 100, but they wouldn't follow and whatever.

694
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,520
Speaker 1: So then finally, we're about an hour and a half on the road and all of us have to pee.

695
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,208
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

696
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:24,819
Speaker 1: So we decide to stop and pee.

697
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,609
Speaker 0: Stopping and peeing is okay, but make it quick.

698
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,720
Speaker 0: Stop at the rest stop, go and pee, get out.

699
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:35,560
Speaker 1: So while we're stopped and peeing, people in the other cars decide they want to stop at this little diner there and eat breakfast.

700
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,752
Speaker 0: It's not even like a diner that I would eat at ever.

701
00:44:38,772 --> 00:44:39,956
Speaker 0: It was like a trucker diner.

702
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:40,780
Speaker 0: It was kind of scary.

703
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but two, it's real important to remember that you really shouldn't stop on your way to a convention.

704
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:48,879
Speaker 0: Unless you absolutely have to.

705
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:57,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, don't stop and eat breakfast on the way because you're much better off getting to the con and then hanging out with a bunch of people and eating breakfast or lunch with them.

706
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:07,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you're really, if you're going early in the morning, which is what you're probably going to do because you're going to take the day off work, you pack the night before, you wake up at the crack of dawn.

707
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:17,420
Speaker 0: If you need food, eat a breakfast at home or go to a diner like right in your hometown, then get in the car, get on the highway and go and do not stop until you get there.

708
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 0: And then once you're there and you get into the hotel and all that nice stuff, then you can go eat and hang out with people.

709
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:27,680
Speaker 0: You know, it's a lot more fun than eating with people on the road in some crummy place.

710
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,580
Speaker 1: So the three cars are at this diner and they all say they want to eat.

711
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,932
Speaker 1: So there are three of us in my car and we all agree that, all right, we're cutting the rope.

712
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:37,914
Speaker 1: Goodbye.

713
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:38,615
Speaker 1: Good luck.

714
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:39,538
Speaker 1: You have the directions.

715
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:40,500
Speaker 1: We get back on the road.

716
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,712
Speaker 1: They are all pissed at us.

717
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:43,296
Speaker 1: And you know what?

718
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:43,740
Speaker 1: That's fine.

719
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,759
Speaker 0: We ended up getting there.

720
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,198
Speaker 1: Three hours before them.

721
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:49,605
Speaker 0: Three hours.

722
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:50,347
Speaker 0: And you know what?

723
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:53,640
Speaker 0: Those were convention hours because it was a Friday, right?

724
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,268
Speaker 1: Yup.

725
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,831
Speaker 0: So we ended up getting three more hours of convention than they did.

726
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:01,900
Speaker 0: They pretty much didn't get any convention whatsoever on Friday.

727
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,286
Speaker 1: Because we got there at noon.

728
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:09,260
Speaker 1: We checked into the hotel, which is a whole other story because the hotel was almost a disaster.

729
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll tell that story another time.

730
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:22,240
Speaker 1: Yes, but we check into the hotel and then a bunch of our friends who are already in town call us and we all got together and got like breakfast, lunch at a bagel place and hung out and got our badges and had a good time for three hours.

731
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:30,980
Speaker 1: And then they showed up three hours later, miserable and hungry and tired and they'd missed the con and they hadn't had their food yet and they didn't have their badges or anything.

732
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,699
Speaker 0: And being illogical, they blamed it on us.

733
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

734
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,925
Speaker 0: Don't blame your own failings on someone else.

735
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:44,600
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, while we might feel sorry for you that, you know, yeah, you didn't have a fun time and that sucks.

736
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:47,448
Speaker 0: It's not our fault that you didn't have a fun time.

737
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:50,959
Speaker 0: It's your fault and we're not going to let you drag us down, you know.

738
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, this dragging down thing, I think we've pretty much hammered it in.

739
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we see it happen to so many people.

740
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:03,140
Speaker 1: I mean, we've got some friends who when they hear this, they're probably going to call in and be like, oh, this happened to me, blah, blah, blah.

741
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,560
Speaker 1: And they'll tell you a story that's even worse than the ones we've been telling.

742
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard stories about people going to cons with like people from school or with different groups.

743
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:27,820
Speaker 1: We're talking like fistfights in the rooms, molestations, money and food and jewelry being stolen, hotels not having the rooms because the person didn't actually get the reservations, people getting lost and actually not making it to the con.

744
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't let anyone drag you down.

745
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,860
Speaker 0: I think we've hammered it in.

746
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,760
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the primary lesson here.

747
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,823
Speaker 0: The next thing is your hotel.

748
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:47,760
Speaker 0: Now, you're going to want to, depending on where the con is and how full it's going to be, you have to get the hotel well enough in advance to make sure you actually get a room.

749
00:47:48,200 --> 00:48:01,258
Speaker 1: Now, for Otacon, Katsu, not so much KatsuCon, but for Otacon, Anime Central and Anime Boston and NekoCon, I'm not kidding when I say that six months in advance is probably the latest.

750
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:02,360
Speaker 1: you want to think about this.

751
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:03,662
Speaker 0: Yeah.

752
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:06,490
Speaker 0: Now, for a hotel, you're going to want to look at price.

753
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:10,240
Speaker 0: You're going to want to look at proximity to the con.

754
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:26,460
Speaker 0: If it's far away from the con, it's probably not the greatest idea because you won't be able to easily walk back and forth in case you really have stuff that you need to move around or you suddenly need to change clothes or maybe you're a big cosplayer, you want to change your costumes and stuff.

755
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,734
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what kind of con it is too because some cons run 24/7 and some cons don't.

756
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:40,899
Speaker 1: And two, a lot of people use the logic of vacations where you pick the crappiest, cheapest hotel room because all you're going to do is sleep in it.

757
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:47,020
Speaker 1: But honestly, at cons, despite how much fun you're having, you're going to go back to the room more often than you think to just chill with people.

758
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,820
Speaker 1: And you really want the room to not be a cesspool.

759
00:48:51,602 --> 00:48:56,900
Speaker 0: The other thing is, hotels will always tell you this room has an occupancy of blah, alright?

760
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:05,860
Speaker 0: Basically, while you can get in trouble for breaking that rule, lie to the hotel and tell them you have whatever the maximum occupancy is.

761
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,076
Speaker 0: So if it's a four people room with a double bed, say you have four people.

762
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:09,760
Speaker 0: Just tell them that.

763
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,180
Speaker 0: But bring as many people as you can fit in there comfortably and divide the price among you.

764
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,084
Speaker 1: Now, it really depends on the hotel.

765
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:24,800
Speaker 1: Like, the Renaissance Hotel in Baltimore, where we usually stay, I'm not kidding when I say that their normal room can comfortably sleep eight.

766
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:29,558
Speaker 1: And it can sleep ten if you're a little younger and a little spryer.

767
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,920
Speaker 1: And one big trick is that if you've got a lot of people, instead of getting a suite, get two rooms and ask for them to be adjoining.

768
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,366
Speaker 1: And you can open the little door between the two rooms.

769
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:43,500
Speaker 1: You wouldn't believe how much more space that actually ends up giving you.

770
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:44,805
Speaker 0: It's great.

771
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:46,680
Speaker 0: You can even get, like, three rooms adjoining.

772
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,667
Speaker 1: That's what we did for this coming Otacon.

773
00:49:48,707 --> 00:49:50,253
Speaker 1: We have three rooms adjoining.

774
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,220
Speaker 1: It's gonna be nuts.

775
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:52,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

776
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:57,148
Speaker 0: Now, if it's a smaller con than Otacon, usually they're cons in hotels.

777
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:03,200
Speaker 0: You're probably gonna want a room in that hotel because then you can keep going back to it all the time and you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

778
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:09,620
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you can cram more people into the room because a lot of people are probably gonna spend all night hanging out in the con.

779
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:10,121
Speaker 0: Yup.

780
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:16,040
Speaker 0: And, you know, like at Otacon, you pretty much have to leave the con, go back to your hotel, and sleep at night.

781
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:16,670
Speaker 1: Yup.

782
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,473
Speaker 0: For the cons with the hotel room in the con, usually your hotel room turns into a party room at night.

783
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:24,956
Speaker 0: There isn't a lot of sleeping going on.

784
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:26,780
Speaker 0: It just turns into, like, a stuffed storage bin.

785
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,360
Speaker 0: So you don't need to get as big a room when you have something like that.

786
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:29,821
Speaker 1: Yup.

787
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:35,120
Speaker 1: Though if you actually want to throw a party in your room, like, not just people are hanging out, but we are having a party.

788
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,059
Speaker 0: Public, you know, with public admittance.

789
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:43,300
Speaker 1: We're gonna do a separate bid on that another day because we've done it many times and we can tell you exactly how to do it.

790
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,447
Speaker 1: And let me just say that it is not for the faint of hearted.

791
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:51,260
Speaker 1: It is not easy, it is not trivial, you will get screwed, but it might be fun anyway.

792
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,560
Speaker 0: You have to get the biggest room you can.

793
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:02,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you have to expect to spend money, and you have to be the kind of person who has no trouble lying through their teeth to a police officer.

794
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:09,534
Speaker 0: Now, so, to get a hotel room, figure out the best hotel proximity and price.

795
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,600
Speaker 0: Figure out how many rooms you're gonna need.

796
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,280
Speaker 0: Make sure you call well enough in advance, you know, for the con, because the hotels will be sold out for big cons.

797
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,219
Speaker 1: I mean, Otacon, three of the hotels are already sold out.

798
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:22,412
Speaker 0: For what, August?

799
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,620
Speaker 1: Yes, for this coming August.

800
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,860
Speaker 0: That's eight months away.

801
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,040
Speaker 1: In fact, two of the hotels sold out within two weeks of the con ending last summer.

802
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,533
Speaker 0: So it was twelve months prior.

803
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:33,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

804
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,856
Speaker 1: There were people calling hotels at the con for the next year.

805
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:38,860
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding.

806
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:48,680
Speaker 0: So, get them well enough in advance, make sure that you call the hotel, like, let's say you order the room four months in advance.

807
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,080
Speaker 0: Call them two months later to make sure and confirm the rooms, then call them the week before the con and confirm the rooms.

808
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,200
Speaker 1: Yes, and even then, when you get there, check in and confirm what you're getting.

809
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:04,320
Speaker 1: Because remember when I said that when we showed up three hours before our friends and we checked in, the hotel was a disaster?

810
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:07,620
Speaker 1: We checked in, and they gave us the key to our room.

811
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,920
Speaker 1: Now, we had ordered a giant suite, because we had, like, twelve people come.

812
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,100
Speaker 0: With an upstairs and a downstairs.

813
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,917
Speaker 1: Yes, this hotel room has two stories inside of it, and it had, like, these utenna windows.

814
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:16,580
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

815
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,599
Speaker 1: So we go to our room, and we open it, and it's just a tiny little room.

816
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,519
Speaker 1: What the hell?

817
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:26,837
Speaker 1: So we go back to the front desk, and we're like, "Alright, bitches, we ordered a

818
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:27,279
Speaker 1: suite.".

819
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,419
Speaker 1: And they're all, "Yeah, suite, uh, sold out, uh, we're

820
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:32,700
Speaker 1: dumb.".

821
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:34,027
Speaker 1: And we're like,

822
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:34,148
Speaker 1: "Great.".

823
00:52:36,104 --> 00:52:37,639
Speaker 0: They ended up giving us, uh...

824
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,660
Speaker 1: They gave us the guest suite, like the presidential whatever suite, for a discount.

825
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:47,080
Speaker 1: And they worked it out with us, because we were a large group of angry people who was going to raise hell.

826
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:52,979
Speaker 1: But I'll warn you that if something like that screws up, the hotel is not obligated to serve you in any way.

827
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,040
Speaker 1: Hotels are not obligated to keep your reservation.

828
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,319
Speaker 1: So keep on them and make sure you've got it.

829
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically be an ass to the hotel, and keep pushing them and pushing them to make sure that what you have is right.

830
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:12,660
Speaker 0: And there should be someone in your group who's the designated hotel-doing person, which is probably the most responsible person.

831
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,900
Speaker 1: Now, make sure, one, that that person has a credit card.

832
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,639
Speaker 1: Because you have to secure the room.

833
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:21,980
Speaker 1: And if you have multiple rooms, you have to secure them all separately.

834
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:26,780
Speaker 1: And we actually have to split that between two of us, because I only had one credit card.

835
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,119
Speaker 1: And because of various things on it, it could only secure one room at a time.

836
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,339
Speaker 1: Because they reserve a lot of money on your card to reserve a room.

837
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,659
Speaker 1: Because they're worried about breakage and such.

838
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,140
Speaker 1: Now, as for paying for the room, basically, there are two ways to look at this.

839
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:48,380
Speaker 1: We trust our close friends completely, so we don't make them pay right away at all, whatever.

840
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,240
Speaker 1: We just trust that they'll give us the money, and they all give us the money.

841
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 1: If there is any shadow of a doubt whatsoever, and even if they're close friends, make them pay in advance.

842
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,760
Speaker 1: Either before you book the room in cash, or make them pay before you let them into the room.

843
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:10,660
Speaker 1: Because if someone's unreliable, and they don't pay you right away, they're never going to pay you.

844
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:17,000
Speaker 0: And you'll just end up having to pay hundreds of dollars to this hotel room, and someone else stayed in it for free on your bill.

845
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:18,859
Speaker 0: That's not good.

846
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,440
Speaker 1: Be wary of people who just say they might come, and then they show up, and they want a place to crash.

847
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,800
Speaker 1: Because that means they don't want to pay you anything, but they want to use your shower and bed.

848
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:30,620
Speaker 1: Now, we've never actually had this happen, but a lot of our friends have.

849
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,720
Speaker 1: So this is just kind of a warning to, even though you might all be friends, work out the money ahead of time.

850
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:39,360
Speaker 1: Because it's real easy to lose friends over stupid things like money.

851
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:47,500
Speaker 0: Yep, so, checking in, you get to the hotel, you go right to the desk, you say you want to check in, you get your keys, you go to your room, you put your stuff in it.

852
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,114
Speaker 0: You make sure that, you know, you keep count of people in the room, you keep track of those keys.

853
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,260
Speaker 0: Holy crap, you keep track of those keys.

854
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,980
Speaker 1: Yes, if the wrong people have your keys, they'll disappear, and you can't get into the room, and you're fucked.

855
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:08,540
Speaker 0: Make sure that whoever actually paid for the room, the hotel person, you know, whoever's the most responsible guy, he's got to have a key, whoever it is.

856
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,623
Speaker 0: Two?

857
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,337
Speaker 1: Usually, you might think, "Oh, I'll give the key to the two most responsible

858
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:13,658
Speaker 1: people."

859
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:16,120
Speaker 1: Or the two people who are, like, running the event.

860
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,244
Speaker 1: That's always me and Scott.

861
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:23,660
Speaker 1: So, it's kind of stupid for both of us to have keys, because we're both usually together at the con.

862
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,760
Speaker 1: Great, so make sure you spread the keys out in a way that will inconvenience the key holders the least.

863
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,780
Speaker 1: Like, if someone is a diabetic, or someone has asthma, or someone has a reason to go to the room often, they should have a key.

864
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:44,080
Speaker 0: And, let's say there's, like, three people that are pretty much going to hang out with each other at the con, give one of those three people a key.

865
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,664
Speaker 0: The most responsible of the three people a key.

866
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:54,840
Speaker 0: You know, because, you know, they'll probably be going back to the room together, and, you know, if they're not going to split up, then why give them two keys?

867
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:04,180
Speaker 1: Now, we used to have a lot of stuff to say about, like, radios, or how to keep in touch with people, or rendezvous points, but honestly, that's made completely moot by cell phones.

868
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,500
Speaker 0: Cell phones and Nintendo DSes pretty much eliminate any need for that.

869
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone we knew had a cell phone, and we all just call each other.

870
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:19,480
Speaker 1: Now, the one drawback of that is that, at least for us, pretty much, my phone rang about every fifteen minutes for the entire convention.

871
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:31,920
Speaker 1: I just, like, I just set it to mute, and then I'd look, and, like, ten people have called me, trying to get into the room, or trying to find out when we're going to eat dinner, or telling me that they found something cool, or, yeah.

872
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,049
Speaker 1: That's just my rant.

873
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:34,139
Speaker 1: That's not actually anything useful.

874
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,960
Speaker 0: I get just about as many calls at cons, just from other people at the con, all over the place, doing stuff.

875
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,622
Speaker 0: "Where are you?

876
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:40,565
Speaker 0: Let's meet up and eat.

877
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:42,491
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, you have to come to this event.

878
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:43,634
Speaker 0: You know, this is going on.

879
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:44,376
Speaker 0: Do you want to do this?

880
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:45,460
Speaker 0: Oh, I saw something

881
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:45,600
Speaker 0: crazy.".

882
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,301
Speaker 0: Well, I

883
00:56:46,321 --> 00:57:05,400
Speaker 1: guess the warning there is that, if you want to be the people like us, the ones who organize this for your group of friends, because someone has to do it, or you're going to have drama, be wary that your friends, while they're your friends, will become energy leeches, and will draw all of your energy, efforts, and attention for much of the con, managing them.

884
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,067
Speaker 0: It's a good thing that, most of the time, the conventions are loud, and I can't hear my phone ring.

885
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:15,460
Speaker 0: So I just, I don't pick it up, not because I don't want to, but because I just don't, I really don't hear it sometimes at the con, which I guess is good.

886
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,486
Speaker 0: You know, because then I pick it up later, and I go, "Oh, someone called

887
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:19,048
Speaker 0: whatever.".

888
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:23,240
Speaker 0: You know, and usually it's not super important, and if it is, they'll call again and again.

889
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,820
Speaker 1: Now, we went real long, so we're going to wrap this up for now, but we're going to start up, where this is going to be a series every Thursday until we finish this.

890
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:37,620
Speaker 0: I think we might finish it next week, we're going to talk about what to do actually when you're at the con.

891
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:44,920
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm also, next week, I want to talk about specifically how to cram a lot of people in a hotel room without getting kicked out, and without having a problem.

892
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,779
Speaker 1: Because there's a lot of info there.

893
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:47,371
Speaker 0: Yep.

894
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:54,420
Speaker 1: Alright, so stay tuned next week, tell us your funny con stories, we'll probably play them if they're funny enough.

895
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:57,147
Speaker 0: And have fun if you're going to any convention soon.

896
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:02,720
Speaker 0: I think the next con I'm going to is probably going to be the New York City Comic Con in the Javits Center in February.

897
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:10,560
Speaker 1: Yep, and I'm going to be at Katsu Con, and I may or may not be on a panel, and if I'm not on a panel, I have a friend who's definitely going to be on a panel.

898
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:11,699
Speaker 0: Alright, awesome.

899
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,789
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
