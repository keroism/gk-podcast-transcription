Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight the post historic internets.

4
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,072
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:33,080
Speaker 0: ah Weekend in Rochester wow is it cold?

6
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:43,594
Speaker 0: It was sunny and 60 degrees when I left beacon in the morning and by the time I got to Syracuse suddenly the Sun disappears and the snow starts.

7
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:51,840
Speaker 0: sounds about right yep But there's like eight new buildings at RIT, and I hung out with I think the last people I know in Rochester.

8
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,748
Speaker 1: Any good new games at the Millennium or anything?

9
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:58,100
Speaker 0: actually I saw a bunch of games that I kind of want to own.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,928
Speaker 0: I just didn't feel like buying them.

11
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:02,700
Speaker 0: remember that Mesopotamia game where you carry the sticks and the rocks.

12
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:04,066
Speaker 1: I don't want that game.

13
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:05,052
Speaker 0: It was kind of fun.

14
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:06,559
Speaker 1: I wouldn't pay for that.

15
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:10,900
Speaker 0: It's a good game to get people into gaming.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,423
Speaker 0: It's just not.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,856
Speaker 0: it's a game that if I played it one or two more times.

18
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:14,600
Speaker 0: I think I'd solve it.

19
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,005
Speaker 1: I'm not good with them.

20
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:16,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

21
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:22,105
Speaker 0: I did ask the guy about that dune game, and he pretty much said ha ha ha I'm going for it on eBay.

22
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:23,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, how's that auction going?

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,311
Speaker 1: I don't know.

24
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:27,480
Speaker 0: yeah, but one game that is in town.

25
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:40,508
Speaker 0: I was over at hammer girl and Luke has the new initial d arcade game Initial d4 with widescreen LCDs and 3d graphics like actual better 3d graphics And the game is a lot more realistic.

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:48,079
Speaker 0: as in my strategy of hit the breakdown shift turn the wheel all the way To the left and then all the way to the right causes me to fishtail and crash.

27
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:49,305
Speaker 1: Sounds about right.

28
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,254
Speaker 0: I have to actually I think counter-steer.

29
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:51,736
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

30
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,383
Speaker 0: I only played it twice I have no idea.

31
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,876
Speaker 0: I crashed into every wall, and I need to go to the dive Ella's.

Speaker 1: I know me too, but it's the same.

48
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:03,752

Speaker 0: We're setting up one of those Open offices.

54
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:24,500

55
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,871

Speaker 0: I like VI.

59
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:40,300
Speaker 0: I actually usually you know what I realized just now that it's not a joke I use VI more than I use any other word processing application.

60
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:48,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think number two is the editor in the forum, and I think number three is WordPress editor Gmail Gmail.

61
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,160
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I don't use the pot it takes me like two seconds to make the post here.

62
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,547
Speaker 1: No, I know anyway.

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,732
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway, so uh Scott What do you have in the news?

64
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,759
Speaker 0: you know tech news?

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,563
Speaker 0: Tech news day.

66
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,007
Speaker 1: I don't have any tech news.

67
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:05,278
Speaker 1: what I have is sort of a tech geek bite kind of.

68
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,079
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know what else to call it now.

69
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:17,916
Speaker 0: I feel like this should be a show and we do also feel like it should be Probably going to more depth because we have some ideas and how to remedy this ideas that would probably turn into IPOs someday.

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,914
Speaker 1: IPOs are no good anymore because of Sarbanes-Oxley.

71
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,180
Speaker 1: It's all about getting bought.

72
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could be and getting VC and get bought.

73
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,945
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyway We're not gonna reveal those ways.

74
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:36,052
Speaker 1: some big company with mad money can take care of your Sarbanes-Oxley as opposed to you having to Take care of it on your poor ass self before you go IPO.

75
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:44,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah anyway I think the sensationalist dig headline were we to have the full show about this would be is dig dead.

76
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,286
Speaker 1: Question mark exclamation point.

77
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:54,202
Speaker 0: maybe something like we did before about the dig democracy and the slash job Shitstorm Autocracy.

78
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:57,209
Speaker 1: yeah, anyway, I'm done with dig.

79
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:06,840
Speaker 1: I removed dig from my Google RSS reader and I'm just not gonna pay attention to dig anymore because I got an account there.

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,745
Speaker 1: I'll probably keep that.

81
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:20,316
Speaker 1: I might have to go and look you know to see if that maybe there's something I dug that I want to remember or something like that, but for the most part I'm ignoring dig now as opposed to using it more than any other website.

82
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:28,729
Speaker 1: because uh It you back in the early days a dig and hey was better than slash dot and just pretty much every story that showed Up on dig was something.

83
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:29,516
Speaker 1: I was interested in it.

84
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:34,338
Speaker 1: now pretty much everything on dig is useless shit, and I don't care anymore.

85
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:42,428
Speaker 0: and Scott said that and I thought but but dig it's it's not perfect and it's kind of shitty now But it's still the best we've got.

86
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:55,729
Speaker 0: and then I thought back to like the last month And I thought about where I'd gotten my news from and where I'd been reading things And I realized that I had not gotten anything other than a few Kind of lame things of the day from dig.

87
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,188
Speaker 0: in like four months every news I've talked about I got from somewhere else.

88
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,518
Speaker 1: everything on dig now is just Ron Paul.

89
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:06,195
Speaker 1: OMG Crazy conspiracy theory.

90
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:13,614
Speaker 0: OMG It's a video of gnome Chomsky who I really like But I don't need there to be a page of like eight gnome Chomsky videos.

91
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:17,905
Speaker 1: sensationalist BS OMG Something you knew about already.

92
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,912
Speaker 1: OMG OMG OMG

93
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:27,440
Speaker 0: yeah, and I used to back in the day I made the comments on dig useful to me and by doing the way I did this was that I pretty much blocked

94
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:28,403
Speaker 1: anyone

95
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:32,996
Speaker 0: who ever said anything stupid or ever misspelled more than one word or didn't capitalize.

96
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:38,992
Speaker 0: I ever and Now I can't keep up the last time I went to a conversation.

97
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:46,557
Speaker 0: I realized that I had to block Every single post that I had read and then I stopped reading the comments on dig.

98
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:55,820
Speaker 1: yep so now what I'm doing is I'm gonna use my Google Reader a lot more and I got Kick kick dig out, and I'm gonna go.

99
00:06:55,921 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 1: I'm going I'm watching all these feeds, and I'm getting more feeds And I'm kicking other feeds out And I'm basically gonna start managing my feeds and I'm gonna go and get some you know feeds from sort of not not just blogs Which I you know I have like the engagement feed in there and the boiling boiling feed.

100
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,220
Speaker 1: But I'm also gonna go and like get feeds of people's deliciouses, or you know people's blogs.

101
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,952
Speaker 0: Well, I've noticed this trend in my head.

102
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,780
Speaker 0: I mean look at zero punctuation.

103
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:23,845
Speaker 0: He's a man if we talked about him a lot on Tuesday But he does these.

104
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:49,620
Speaker 0: he talks about video games, and I've found so far that I agree 100% with everything that he has ever said relating to video games that I'm aware of and As a result I tend to seek out his opinion on things And I feel like if I could just look at his delicious or whatever he used I could probably find things I was interested in without all the crap a lot more readily than I could on dig.

105
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:53,631
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean even looking at zero punctuation itself.

106
00:07:53,711 --> 00:08:00,038
Speaker 1: right I could have the dig feed which gives me 200 crap stories And the link to zero function every week when it becomes available.

107
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:07,079
Speaker 1: zero Punctuation zero punctuation, or I can just subscribe to zero punctuation speed and get whenever he puts something up.

108
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,847
Speaker 1: Oh, I do well.

109
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:09,148
Speaker 0: Let's see.

110
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,860
Speaker 0: I'm on the front page of dig right now the dig technology.

111
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,940
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go to the straight up just front page of dig and see if there's anything interesting.

112
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:17,584
Speaker 1: That isn't bullshit.

113
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,250
Speaker 1: if it's a lie or bullshit.

114
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,385
Speaker 0: you got to count it out right, so I'm now at the Absolute front page of all of dig.

115
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:35,376
Speaker 0: this is according to dig the current zeitgeist of the democracy of the Internet and the top one Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor shot fighting for his life.

116
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:42,559
Speaker 0: Oh Thank you for telling me what the AP wire told me and Fark told me earlier today that I don't really all right.

117
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,280
Speaker 1: I mean it's sad or whatever, but I don't care.

118
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,669
Speaker 0: Oh a video of some bar trick grade Google announces.

119
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,434
Speaker 0: Google body search already knew about that.

120
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,218
Speaker 0: the benefits of garlic.

121
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,550
Speaker 0: Yeah Do blondes make us do okay?

122
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,112
Speaker 0: That's great.

123
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:57,899
Speaker 0: Should you trust your doctor?

124
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:03,035
Speaker 1: Great yes, yes, you should as long as they're a real doctor.

125
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:04,699
Speaker 1: Yes, you should trust them.

126
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:11,060
Speaker 0: Oh one good thing talking about that sniper who killed five hundred and five Soviet soldiers during the Winter War.

127
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,935
Speaker 0: I already knew about that, but I guess if I didn't know about that.

128
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:14,358
Speaker 0: That'd be cool.

129
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:18,580
Speaker 0: Extreme Alpine speed paragliding I saw that like a month ago.

130
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,092
Speaker 0: Female sex tourists great.

131
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:26,515
Speaker 0: That's just news that The seven habits of highly effective assholes.

132
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:27,519
Speaker 0: that sounds fun.

133
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:29,562
Speaker 0: It's just.

134
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,248
Speaker 0: there's nothing here that interests me at all.

135
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,156
Speaker 1: No not absolutely nothing.

136
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:34,280
Speaker 0: even King said something.

137
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,096
Speaker 0: Oh, here's a headline all in lowercase.

138
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:37,820
Speaker 0: great.

139
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,289
Speaker 1: Yet, I realized basically what happens.

140
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,580
Speaker 1: is you want when you go on the internet, right?

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,667
Speaker 1: There's a so much content You can't possibly get it all and I could do.

142
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,620
Speaker 1: I mean I could do talk about this for as long as I could.

143
00:09:52,101 --> 00:10:01,414
Speaker 1: Only some of that content you care about and each person each individual human being cares about a different Subset of the total amount of content.

144
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,714
Speaker 1: if there's a million stories Maybe each person cares about ten of them right and for each person.

145
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:14,599
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a different ten stories They care about but if someone's similar for example me and rim Nine of our stories that we care about might be the same.

146
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:21,274
Speaker 1: So the thing with dig is that looking at the front page at least right you're.

147
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:26,500
Speaker 1: you're not seeing only the stories Other people like you care about at least not anymore.

148
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:36,080
Speaker 1: you're seeing the stories that everyone in the whole freaking dig cares about and You're basically getting the front page is sort of a one-size-fits-all.

149
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,389
Speaker 1: It's like everybody.

150
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:46,200
Speaker 1: all these different people Thousands and thousands of different people who all care about different things are all dished out the same top stories.

151
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:50,307
Speaker 1: Well, no It should be different top stories for each person person cares about something different.

152
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 0: cool with that because otherwise you do have the problem if Everything is customized just to you with the balkanization where you'll never be exposed to anything.

153
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,560
Speaker 0: That might have been cool that you didn't think you were interested.

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,099
Speaker 1: Well, you need to work something out where you know, it shows something.

155
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,628
Speaker 0: You know what worked before.

156
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:15,730
Speaker 0: I mean, I hate to say something like this Before people really knew about dig and when dig was relatively small and The only people were on dig were while they had a lot of varied interests.

157
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:19,620
Speaker 0: They were mostly the early adopter kind of innovator.

158
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:20,859
Speaker 0: Hey, it's the new thing.

159
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:24,880
Speaker 0: It was the kind of people who used orca back in the day, you know before Facebook.

160
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,191
Speaker 1: The kind of people are using like the pounds in the Twitter and stuff now.

161
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:49,532
Speaker 0: and as a result while I saw a lot of Things that I didn't think I was interested in Almost everything on dig was interesting because interesting people were digging up interesting things and it was the kind of Everything interesting in the world would hit there because of that wide group of people would find the interesting things Now and dig was a slash a slashdot.

162
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,708
Speaker 0: dig was a snapshot of I guess The the global mind of all those interesting people.

163
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:03,459
Speaker 0: now dig is a slashdot of the I guess The main hump of the internet a lot more people use it's the lowest common denominator.

164
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,506
Speaker 0: not yet It's not the lowest common denominator.

165
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:06,168
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

166
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,860
Speaker 0: No, it's kind of like you've got the leading a low common denominator.

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,141
Speaker 1: You've

168
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:28,728
Speaker 0: got the leading edge and then you've got the like early hump and then you've got the big hump when like a lot of People use it and then the trailing line of you know Dads and uncles and people who watch Fox News are using it and then there's you know The end run which is like great-grandpa finds out about it because the grandson showed him something.

169
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:41,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, and We're at the big hump now and as a result, it seems like the stories on dig are a snapshot of just a Lot of really stupid people to put it really bluntly and I feel bad saying that.

170
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:45,567
Speaker 0: but at the same time most of the stories on diggers sensationalist crap.

171
00:12:45,627 --> 00:13:01,791
Speaker 0: or they're outright wrong or they're old or there's like eight stories that are identical and the same people dig everything up and It's like dig isn't selecting interesting content for me any better than say Random searches of Google News did a year ago monkeys with typewriters.

172
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically Google dig is not working for me anymore.

173
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:13,980
Speaker 1: You no longer solves the problem at once sort of solved and I am headed towards Hopefully greener pastures, even if they might take a little bit more effort on my part.

174
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,690
Speaker 0: I think our greener pastures is to make our own thing.

175
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:27,896
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe but for now, it's Basically RSS feeds of all sorts of things and hopefully I can find Interesting people would do delicious things often and get their feeds from their.

176
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,142
Speaker 1: delicious is Right.

177
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:34,333
Speaker 0: So there's the story on slashdot from Bruce Schneier's blog.

178
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:41,399
Speaker 1: Bruce Schneier is the expert on security They and that is the expert on security period.

179
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,880
Speaker 0: now I didn't get a chance to read the article, but I think the discussion it brings up is more interesting.

180
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:50,910
Speaker 0: it's called everyday copyright violations and It seems to according to the summary.

181
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:59,200
Speaker 0: I read kind of talk about the idea that Copyrights are so complicated and so just kind of out of touch with the reality of the world in general.

182
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:13,533
Speaker 0: Just the way the laws work that in the course of a day an average person especially on the internet Will violate and just just illegally violate countless copyrights all the time Even doing things that they wouldn't even think are illegal wouldn't?

183
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:17,367
Speaker 0: it's not even like oh I stole this music But just little basic things.

184
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:25,380
Speaker 0: I mean people forget the idea that if you ever write anything It's copyrighted immediately whether you show anyone in the world or not.

185
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:33,720
Speaker 0: If I write like a little tiny half of a story in an email to Scott Theoretically Scott can't just republish that without citing me.

186
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:41,789
Speaker 0: He can't just take that and finish the story and then publish it on his own because I have the copyright I can't even like forward it to someone else.

187
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:53,580
Speaker 0: technically there's all sorts of rules about this and I think the gist of it is that Copyright law needs to change to deal with the fact that information travels a lot faster now than it used to.

188
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not even talking about piracy here.

189
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,143
Speaker 1: we are talking about.

190
00:14:56,404 --> 00:15:04,085
Speaker 1: you know, this is sort of like, you know that there's all sorts of those crazy laws that you read about like Can't do can't you know?

191
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:11,960
Speaker 1: have this certain kind of animal in the town square on a Thursday and you read and you go Oh, that's so funny that they have all these wacky laws.

192
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,920
Speaker 1: You know from way back when or for whatever crazy reason or maybe someone's just pulling a joke in the town council, right?

193
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 1: But copyright law is sort of become a joke law.

194
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:32,457
Speaker 1: It is impossible to live and to operate within modern society without violating this law numerous times a day and it did.

195
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:37,009
Speaker 1: law is just that Silly and crazy and this is really the fundamental problem.

196
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,838
Speaker 1: Forget about your piracy's and your music industry business model.

197
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,382
Speaker 1: this and that We had.

198
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:44,430
Speaker 1: the laws that are behind this stuff.

199
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:54,698
Speaker 1: No matter what else you want to say about them are Fundamentally broken in a million different ways and I don't really see much of a solution besides Throwing them all out and starting again now.

200
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:03,099
Speaker 0: it doesn't mean we have to give up the idea of giving content creators some control over their creations or some ability to Make profit or anything like that.

201
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:13,536
Speaker 0: It just means that the laws as they stand even if you agree with what they're trying to do Can't really work because the way they are written is not good.

202
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,620
Speaker 0: We're in the same situation.

203
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,684
Speaker 0: we are with speeding in a car in the US.

204
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:22,562
Speaker 0: where go to any average freeway in the United States and 90% of the cars are speed.

205
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:33,940
Speaker 0: speed limit is 55 or 65. unless you live somewhere sane like Michigan or Arizona where it's 75 or 80 and You know speed limits 55 to go faster than that is to break the law.

206
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:39,743
Speaker 0: Yet when I get on that road, the slowest car is going like 80 Yeah, something like that.

207
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:47,469
Speaker 0: and it's actually unsafe for me to go less than the average speed and as a result Everyone's speeding and I'll pass a cop.

208
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,281
Speaker 0: I'm going 85 speed limits 55.

209
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,669
Speaker 0: Everyone's going 85. cop doesn't care.

210
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,145
Speaker 0: but theoretically if he wanted to he could just pull out into the road Drive at the speed of everyone else.

211
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,772
Speaker 0: Just pick a random guy for whatever reason decide.

212
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,217
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give him the gigantic ticket.

213
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:07,036
Speaker 1: I Want to make money for the state cuz that's my job or just I don't know.

214
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 0: I'm bored.

215
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:17,858
Speaker 0: Anytime there's a situation where People are breaking a law and they don't feel that they're breaking a law or a lot of people are breaking a law.

216
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:19,969
Speaker 0: You really have to examine the law.

217
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,099
Speaker 0: I'm not saying or a law is unenforceable.

218
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,646
Speaker 0: I'm not saying get rid of the law.

219
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:28,026
Speaker 0: I'm not saying give up on the idea of speed limits issue

220
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:35,196
Speaker 1: of whether copyright is is a good idea or a bad idea We're not even talking about that right now or that's not even an issue

221
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:50,040
Speaker 0: because I think Speed limits are a good idea Except when a speed limit is set so low compared to what people actually drive That you've effectively criminalized everyone on the road thus giving you the excuse to pull over anyone you want in any time.

222
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:57,083
Speaker 1: but Regardless the point is the way the law is written is just crazy and it's impossible Not to break the law.

223
00:17:57,103 --> 00:18:02,136
Speaker 1: if you have a law that is impossible not to break like don't?

224
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:03,540
Speaker 1: we had a law don't breathe.

225
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:10,305
Speaker 1: That's sort of like the copyright law right now basically says Don't do anything.

226
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:14,780
Speaker 0: I mean it makes it illegal to do things that shouldn't be illegal.

227
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,650
Speaker 0: And like I said, we're not talking about stealing people's music.

228
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,500
Speaker 0: I'm talking about really really basic things.

229
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:22,327
Speaker 0: Oh, I just noticed here.

230
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:24,194
Speaker 0: All right, this is another thing.

231
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,580
Speaker 0: I don't like about the internet lately.

232
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:29,009
Speaker 0: I guess it's not lately, but all right slash shot everyday copyright violations.

233
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,054
Speaker 0: schnayers pointed out this stuff.

234
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:32,378
Speaker 0: go to schnayers blog.

235
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,544
Speaker 0: Oh He didn't actually write this.

236
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:38,357
Speaker 0: He just pointed at this article by John terrain Ian.

237
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:42,390
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Well, I trust anything schnayer points at anyway, so I do.

238
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,260
Speaker 1: that link sort of gives it an element of trust.

239
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:50,540
Speaker 0: It does but at the same time I feel like they could have just linked directly to the original article.

240
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that would have been nice too.

241
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,194
Speaker 0: But at the same I mean, it's not like.

242
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:55,600
Speaker 0: schnayer even adds much commentary.

243
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:56,968
Speaker 0: He says quotes.

244
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,019
Speaker 0: I think this is the extent of what he said.

245
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:05,660
Speaker 0: The point of the article is how simply by acting normally all of us are technically lawbreakers many times over every day.

246
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:09,480
Speaker 0: When laws are this far outside the social norms, it's time to change them.

247
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:15,272
Speaker 0: So if you listen to us talking about this you have listened to me and Scott talk about an article on slash shot.

248
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,659
Speaker 0: that talks about an article on Bruce schnayers blog.

249
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:28,640
Speaker 0: that Talks about an article written by a man named John terrain Ian things of the day.

250
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:34,160
Speaker 1: So I've been having problems lately is that I want to listen to more of my music.

251
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:39,678
Speaker 1: but I've got like 10,000 musics and and a lot of its unsorted.

252
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,827
Speaker 0: Scott Yeah, stay on top of it.

253
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:42,912
Speaker 0: Like the rim did?

254
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:44,620
Speaker 1: you didn't stay on top of it?

255
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,300
Speaker 1: You just had about you all your unsorted music deleted on a lot of hard drive that died.

256
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:52,120
Speaker 0: The thing is that the unsorted music that got deleted was less than a gigabyte.

257
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, the answer my unsorted music is about half.

258
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, and my sorted music is sorted in a way.

259
00:19:59,351 --> 00:19:59,834
Speaker 1: I don't like.

260
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,220
Speaker 1: I want it sorted in a better way.

261
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,540
Speaker 1: So it's really just no good all around.

262
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,226
Speaker 1: But anyway, I was looking around for you know, pretty much every solution to this problem I know about.

263
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,114
Speaker 1: there isn't anything.

264
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:15,880
Speaker 1: I didn't know But I did discover something just now that's maybe has a use.

265
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:19,593
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem to fit my bill exactly, but it might have a use for someone else.

266
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:29,320
Speaker 1: It's called gin Zora Gin Zora and what this does is you get yourself MySQL or some sort of database?

267
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:40,625
Speaker 1: And you get yourself a web server Right a little Apache or a lighty or something and on that same computer or at least, you know accessible by that computer you have your music.

268
00:20:41,269 --> 00:21:24,173
Speaker 1: so you set this up and What you've let's say I got all my music and the web server on the same computer all right, and it's on my local network and Someone comes into that into my house with a laptop and they open up their laptop and they connect to my wireless and they open up a web browser they type in the name of that computer that has all the music and the web server and they're presented with this web interface that allows them to search through the music and if I want to I can even let them play the music and if I want to I can even set it up where that computer is playing the music and they can change which music the computer is playing like some sort of jukebox and For many people I imagine this would be quite useful.

269
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:28,692
Speaker 1: for me not useful But for other people I could see this happening.

270
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:30,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still just kind of holding out.

271
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,777
Speaker 0: I think if those rumors of 13-inch MacBook Pros are true, which you know, there's no way to tell.

272
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:42,280
Speaker 0: I ignore rumors But if they're true, I'll probably just buy that and then use iTunes.

273
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:53,479
Speaker 1: Yeah I tried over the weekend to import all my music from my computer through a Samba share to iTunes and it Mostly kinda sort of worked.

274
00:21:54,183 --> 00:22:04,907
Speaker 1: But it still doesn't solve any of my problems except for now I can get music onto my iPod if I bother to sift through 10,000 tracks and pick out music.

275
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:09,600
Speaker 1: or I guess I might have to start making some sort of dynamic smart playlists something.

276
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:15,940
Speaker 1: but even those won't work perfectly because the Information up on them the ID threes and stuff is not complete.

277
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:24,520
Speaker 1: So see and if any failed to download the album artwork Like I said get album artwork and it got a few thousand album artworks and then it sort of hangs It doesn't get anymore.

278
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,180
Speaker 0: See I tell it not to do those things because it just kind of it always seems to slow things down and cause problems.

279
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,966
Speaker 1: So I wanted to get the album artworks.

280
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:34,317
Speaker 1: part of the coolness of of using an iPod or whatever.

281
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:35,180
Speaker 1: is you get the album?

282
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:46,100
Speaker 1: Artworks there so you can more easily get a you know A visual cue as to what the hell you're listening to and you can also go in the cover view and sort of you know Quickly scan through all the covers and they'll be like, ah, that's what I want.

283
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:54,500
Speaker 1: It's a lot faster than reading all that text looking for a name Even though you can search for the name with the search box in the top, right?

284
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:02,119
Speaker 1: Sometimes I might forget the name and remember the image especially since I got 10,000 music tracks And I only remember so many of them.

285
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:15,151
Speaker 0: I guess I'm lucky in one regard that just because of the way I organize my music I really just use the file system and to this like I while I may not have listened to all of it recently I might not remember a specific song.

286
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:20,537
Speaker 0: if I have any piece of music I have I could find pretty much immediately because I know where it would be.

287
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:27,540
Speaker 0: I have music I don't even know I have well see here's the thing I will not if I download music if I don't listen to it within a reasonable span of time.

288
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,353
Speaker 0: I just delete it because I obviously didn't want it.

289
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:33,963
Speaker 1: Yeah Music I do want it's just I don't know I don't.

290
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:36,880
Speaker 1: I don't know I want it because I don't even have time to listen to it.

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,120
Speaker 0: Well, see I only get things that I already know I want and I find out I want these things from games like guitar hero.

292
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,744
Speaker 1: Here's an example, right?

293
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:45,348
Speaker 1: I knew I wanted some buckethead.

294
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:48,516
Speaker 1: So I downloaded every buckethead album there.

295
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,140
Speaker 0: I did that with muck, right?

296
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,873
Speaker 1: So now I haven't listened to all that I don't even and some of it I don't even like.

297
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:56,580
Speaker 1: but what do I do?

298
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,292
Speaker 1: I got like these 30 albums.

299
00:23:58,332 --> 00:23:59,340
Speaker 1: Some of them aren't even albums.

300
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,775
Speaker 1: Some of them are like some guy cobbled together some live tracks bootleg from a concert.

301
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:07,380
Speaker 1: Another thing is like some cobbling of a foreign single.

302
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:09,307
Speaker 0: Honestly, I tend to.

303
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:19,951
Speaker 0: I've decided at this point that it's so easy to get music that I'll go for quality over quantity and if I can't easily categorize or if I just don't think I like or anything I'll just delete it and forget about it.

304
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,777
Speaker 0: now worry about it.

305
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:24,680
Speaker 1: So I've already downloaded it and download it again is is more work.

306
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:34,680
Speaker 0: I probably won't download it again because there's so much music out there that if I miss one or two good songs or even good Albums here and there I've still got more to listen to than I have time to listen.

307
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:34,901
Speaker 0: So

308
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:45,177
Speaker 1: the thing is I really I really because the the fact that my music is such in a state of disarray is Preventing me from listening to any of it because it's so difficult to get any to listen to right and

309
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:48,088
Speaker 0: I can't make fun of You because the only solution

310
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,860
Speaker 1: it's like if it was sorted I could listen to it very easily.

311
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:59,849
Speaker 1: well, the only solution really was either we need AI that'll just do it or It's like hey, I was trying to use music brains Which is the closest we have to AI.

312
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:13,285
Speaker 1: that will just do it and it works for the most part but it still requires a lot of manual labor on my part and Even then it screws up a lot of things and I end up with a lot of files that just have a crazy Batshit names because music brain screwed up.

313
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:19,730
Speaker 0: the solution Sadly is for the last decade to have constantly kept up with your music collection.

314
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:26,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I basically I can go through and sort it all out You know back in time and tell yourself to organize your.

315
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:27,389
Speaker 0: goddamn you.

316
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,565
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is I sort of got a whole bunch of too much at once.

317
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,071
Speaker 1: You see that was the thing It's like.

318
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,117
Speaker 1: even I was keeping up.

319
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:36,550
Speaker 1: so, you know, I got like two gigs at once.

320
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,629
Speaker 0: You know what saved me right when I had the urge to download Infinite music before that urge went away and now I only download what I like again.

321
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:50,474
Speaker 0: I had the old computer and I couldn't put more hard drives in it and I was afraid to turn it off or open it Because it might break.

322
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:51,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had bit torrent.

323
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,088
Speaker 1: I was at RIT and I had plenty hard drives.

324
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:53,350
Speaker 1: face.

325
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, I left our dangerous combination.

326
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,030
Speaker 0: I went for that like half a year with no internet.

327
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:01,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that sabbatical from the internet is what.

328
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,590
Speaker 1: that was the time when I got all the music.

329
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,804
Speaker 0: That was the time when I organized everything I had left.

330
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:09,822
Speaker 1: that wasn't organized Yeah, and the other thing is I would sit down and just organize it all.

331
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:26,590
Speaker 1: but I feel like there are other things I want to do like podcast and You know make programs and learn things and then reads books and then play video games and Feel like sorting the music is way low on my list of priorities.

332
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:29,907
Speaker 1: So it's like not gonna get done and it's only gonna get worse.

333
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:30,489
Speaker 1: But what do I do?

334
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,990
Speaker 1: I guess I could pay someone to sort it all out.

335
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,660
Speaker 1: But then would they do it right?

336
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,310
Speaker 1: would they do it the way I want would they?

337
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:38,067
Speaker 1: It's so bad.

338
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:41,349
Speaker 1: Anyway, see a Jin Zora is my thing of the day.

339
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:48,270
Speaker 1: So if anyone is wants to like let you can let everyone who comes into your house Listen to all your music on their laptops.

340
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:57,342
Speaker 1: Or you can have some sort of computer plugged into a stereo and let people in your house with computers Connect to that and then sort of change the music.

341
00:26:57,402 --> 00:26:58,850
Speaker 1: or you can just you know, do it for yourself.

342
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:03,638
Speaker 1: You know if you have a computer plugged into a stereo you go upstairs You might want to change the song.

343
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:08,665
Speaker 1: you can do it from any computer in the house Just poop or even like from your phone if it has a wireless.

344
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:12,910
Speaker 1: or maybe you have one of those Nokia sort of tablet II things and it's got the wireless.

345
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:19,636
Speaker 1: If it's got a web browser and it can connect to your local network and connect to the computer running the Jin Zora You can control it.

346
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:27,866
Speaker 0: So so in the spirit of dig I decided that I would just go to the front page of dig and pick the best thing there in the videos.

347
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:37,383
Speaker 0: Wow and See cuz I remember back when I used dig in the early days I'd go to dig videos and easily two-thirds of the things there were cool.

348
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaker 0: And now I'm looking through and Pretty much the choice was between a kangaroo playing with itself And a video that I've not only already seen but has already been a thing of the day.

349
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,595
Speaker 1: Which video is that?

350
00:27:50,897 --> 00:27:52,886
Speaker 0: the one about the guy paragliding?

351
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:59,426
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, anyway Kangaroo plays with himself while man is interviewed is the win.

352
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:04,502
Speaker 0: and it is Exactly that it is a kangaroo playing with himself while a man is interviewed.

353
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:07,190
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a himself kangaroo not a herself kangaroo.

354
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:12,106
Speaker 0: He's using the motion that I think is universal among males that have digits.

355
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,654
Speaker 0: All right It's kind of funny.

356
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:22,856
Speaker 0: I'll give it that but I've already seen many videos of animals masturbating while once you've seen a monkey It's what else is there to say?

357
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,722
Speaker 0: or that one cat or that one?

358
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:25,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.

359
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:26,287
Speaker 1: Okay.

360
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, right rocket.

361
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:31,749
Speaker 0: So tonight we're going to finish our two-part series on.

362
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:43,650
Speaker 1: It's not really on Google as much as it is on sort of like The history of search engines or like the web and searching and how it's changed and whatever.

363
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:51,670
Speaker 0: so where we left off Google had appeared and Pretty much anyone smart used it realized that it was better than every other search engine in the world.

364
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,284
Speaker 1: Yeah started using the web had been around for years.

365
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:59,730
Speaker 1: people were using the web But people had a hard time using the web seriously because all the search engines were shit.

366
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:04,970
Speaker 1: I mean, I actually remembered today that there were sites like, you know, I get what was it called before?

367
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,414
Speaker 1: It was called about calm.

368
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:09,605
Speaker 0: I don't even remember everything - or was that something else?

369
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,130
Speaker 1: No, everything - is something else.

370
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:21,450
Speaker 0: I'm looking it up right now actually because I honestly really never use those sites though I used to have a little cool plug anything Where I could like right-click on a word and it would tell me stuff about that word.

371
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:23,178
Speaker 0: But then that turned into spyware.

372
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,123
Speaker 0: That's right.

373
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:24,405
Speaker 1: It was.

374
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,369
Speaker 1: it was mining Co.

375
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,024
Speaker 1: Mining Co was the website.

376
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:28,810
Speaker 0: I never used that.

377
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:34,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the logic behind mining Co which became which is now about calm sounds very cute.

378
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:35,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

379
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:36,720
Speaker 1: It's sort of funny.

380
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,090
Speaker 1: It's like you think dig mining Co.

381
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:41,912
Speaker 1: Anyway, that site which is now about calm and I'm attempts I'm gonna say it.

382
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:46,810
Speaker 1: originally the idea behind that site was there would be different pages about different things.

383
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:55,042
Speaker 1: So you would go to say the video game site and there would be a guy who was the video game guy And you'd see his face at the top with some.

384
00:29:55,122 --> 00:30:02,086
Speaker 1: you know his name and he Manually managed all the content at that site and it was back in the day.

385
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:04,475
Speaker 1: This is worthwhile because Searching sucked.

386
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:20,108
Speaker 1: So you'd go to mining Co and you would say I want to know about Fishing and there would be a page with a guy who was a fisherman who knew about fishing and he would make all these Pages and content about fishing and that's what would be.

387
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:38,630
Speaker 0: you know I almost wonder if in the long run before we have good AI or you know web 3.0 the semantic web if We'll go back to that sort of thing Where the only way to really really get good interesting content that you want is to find other people you trust or?

388
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,677
Speaker 0: Authorities and just go everywhere.

389
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:41,240
Speaker 0: They point you.

390
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,356
Speaker 1: Well, you can go to about calm if that's what you're looking for Or you can just come to me.

391
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,162
Speaker 0: I'll point you in the direction.

392
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:55,330
Speaker 1: All right, anyway, yeah But the internet the web at least was was pretty not so good at finding the information you wanted when you wanted it.

393
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,893
Speaker 1: it was sort of just like you would go and click on links and go from place to place in search of entertainment and Mostly misguided.

394
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:12,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly entertainment - I mean back then they really were trying to sell to parents and people like Yeah The internet where you can do all your research and everything.

395
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,470
Speaker 0: all those other ways to do in research obsolete as basically impossible.

396
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:18,821
Speaker 0: You couldn't do research for dick on the internet back then.

397
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:22,856
Speaker 0: you couldn't find anything worthwhile or Citable or is it?

398
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,130
Speaker 1: you could but it's just extremely difficult.

399
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,310
Speaker 1: You were better off going to the library and I still went to the library in those days.

400
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,752
Speaker 1: I did too.

401
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,981
Speaker 0: In fact, I still used a card catalog.

402
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:57,130
Speaker 1: Yep, and then Google came around and everything changed because Google unlike previous search engines was actually useful and If you wanted to know something or you wanted to find a page about something you could type in what you wanted into Google without having to type a bunch of complicated shit and What you wanted would very likely be on the front page and as time went on it only got better.

403
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:59,309
Speaker 0: So where did Google come from?

404
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,172
Speaker 0: How did it?

405
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,396
Speaker 0: where did you just appear from?

406
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:06,157
Speaker 0: because it kind of at least to people who didn't already know about it just appeared Out of nowhere.

407
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:10,150
Speaker 1: I mean like I said on the last show I mean I was using Yahoo, which is the best at the time

408
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:13,831
Speaker 0: I use Yahoo and if Yahoo didn't find it I used Lycos Yeah,

409
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:31,228
Speaker 1: and at the bottom of the page it said, you know after a time I mean originally Yahoo was powered by Yahoo and then it was powered by something else And then it said Yahoo powered by Google and after a while I eventually just clicked on the Google and it took me to Google and I started using that and I realized it gave me the Same search results only better.

410
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:38,730
Speaker 0: So Google as it were was founded by two men Sergei Brin and Larry Page.

411
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,114
Speaker 1: You probably know that already.

412
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:49,167
Speaker 0: Yeah a long long time ago less than ten years ago I think they were incorporated in 1998 Yeah.

413
00:32:51,112 --> 00:33:01,530
Speaker 0: And there were students at Stanford University and if you want to know more just read the Wikipedia because I don't think you really want Boring history lesson, but it is interesting to note the name of Google.

414
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,010
Speaker 0: I mean now it's kind of synonymous with searching.

415
00:33:04,111 --> 00:33:13,329
Speaker 0: I mean a lot, you know how people say Oh, well the name will be diluted like Kleenex Kleenex kind of D branded and became a generic term for a lot of band-aid and scotch tape.

416
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,761
Speaker 0: and yeah, but Google I mean the way when people say like oh I Google something.

417
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:24,565
Speaker 0: Google used to really worry about that because you know People are using the word Google to mean search on the internet.

418
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:28,502
Speaker 0: that will Invalidate our trademark over time.

419
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:33,409
Speaker 0: No when people say to Google something They mean very literally to use Google to search for it.

420
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:34,422
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much.

421
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:45,717
Speaker 1: But also it's generally can say at least as far as I see it It's considered a good thing when your brand name becomes, you know an actual regularly used word I mean like, you know, it could.

422
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:51,050
Speaker 1: I think the the calling, you know, I mean nowadays We don't people don't say Xerox so much anymore.

423
00:33:51,170 --> 00:34:00,501
Speaker 1: But you know when people call when people were photocopying and say you sang Xerox as into photocopy I think that sold Xerox a lot of copiers.

424
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,890
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it also sells band-aid a lot of band-aids.

425
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,337
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure band-aid sells.

426
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,950
Speaker 1: a brand-aid brand sells more than the other brands.

427
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,753
Speaker 0: All right, you know what?

428
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,141
Speaker 0: because all the information is right here.

429
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,670
Speaker 0: I am gonna just gonna read a paragraph or two from Wikipedia.

430
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:18,248
Speaker 0: So if anything here is wrong and it looks like it's all right as far as I can tell This doesn't get it all out of the way.

431
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:29,030
Speaker 0: to paraphrase and quote Wikipedia Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to PhD students at Stanford University.

432
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:39,449
Speaker 0: They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationship between websites could produce better results than existing techniques Which ranked results according to the number of times a search engine appeared on the page?

433
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:47,598
Speaker 0: Their search engine was originally nicknamed back rub because the system Back links to estimate a site's importance.

434
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:57,956
Speaker 0: a small search engine called rank decks was already exploring a similar strategy convinced that the pages with the most links to them were Paraphrase paraphrase more relevant.

435
00:34:58,398 --> 00:35:02,430
Speaker 0: They tested their thesis as part of their studies laid out the foundation for the search engine.

436
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:10,037
Speaker 0: Originally, it was used that they used the Stanford University website with the domain Google.stanford.edu.

437
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,211
Speaker 0: the domain google.com was registered in September of 1997.

438
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:23,830
Speaker 0: They incorporated in September of 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California where everything awesome happens And then they IPO'd sometime later.

439
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:31,720
Speaker 0: They originally wanted to call it Google, you know, Google with an O as per the number But someone else already had that name and wouldn't give it up.

440
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:34,830
Speaker 0: Uh-huh and everything else really doesn't matter.

441
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:41,790
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, the point is is that the way Google worked is you know back in the day?

442
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:51,729
Speaker 1: You would search your video games and the page that would show up at the top of say AltaVista would be the web page that said video games video games video games video games video games video games video games.

443
00:35:52,834 --> 00:36:03,990
Speaker 1: When you searched on Google for video games It would find it a website that happened to have the word video games on it And it would find the website that had the most links to it.

444
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:14,850
Speaker 1: So if let's say a hundred people were linking to my website about video games and a thousand people linked to rim sites about video games Rim site would show up first and my site would show up next.

445
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:25,290
Speaker 1: So the idea was that if a site had more people linking to it, it would be a more popular website, and people don't link to websites that are, you know, video games, video games, video games, video games, video games.

446
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,650
Speaker 1: They link to real websites, and the more people link to something, the more people think that site is useful.

447
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:38,750
Speaker 1: Therefore, Google, in its early days, before anyone was trying to game the system, worked wonderfully.

448
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:51,310
Speaker 1: You would type in "video games," and the most popular video game site in the world would be right at the top, and that would be what you were looking for, and there weren't so many websites, so that was probably exactly what you wanted, every time.

449
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:57,630
Speaker 0: Another thing that really made Google stand out back then was that they have, and to this day, they claim to still have it.

450
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:04,508
Speaker 0: It's probably a little different internally now that they're a publicly held company, but their motto has always been, "Don't be

451
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:04,848
Speaker 0: evil.".

452
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:06,150
Speaker 1: Do no evil?

453
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

454
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,966
Speaker 0: So a lot of other search engines, think about it.

455
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:11,950
Speaker 0: I control the search engine.

456
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:22,530
Speaker 0: I can do whatever I want, put whatever sites I want in it by whatever means I want, and other people, especially people who want to make money, really care if they show up as number one or number a thousand.

457
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:30,730
Speaker 0: What if I just offered, kind of semi-secretly, where people could buy the number one or the number five spot in my search engine?

458
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,155
Speaker 0: I remember,

459
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:42,848
Speaker 1: in fact, a search engine that was around back in the day, way back in the late 90s, that specifically advertised the fact that, "Hey, we are a search engine where you pay to get in the

460
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:43,190
Speaker 1: search."

461
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:54,143
Speaker 1: And it was, "Whoever pays the most gets to the top for a specific term, and this way, we'll have the best results, because the only people who will pay will be in there, and as we know, they're real sites.

462
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:56,088
Speaker 1: They're not around

463
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,549
Speaker 1: anymore.".

464
00:37:57,372 --> 00:38:08,870
Speaker 0: But Google never did that, and if they somehow did, which is highly unlikely, it never affected the content of the site, because consistently, the number one thing or the number two thing was exactly what I wanted.

465
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,570
Speaker 0: And it wasn't video games, video games, video games.

466
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:17,130
Speaker 1: Google does a lot of things, and some people argue, they say they are doing evil, you know, such as with their China business.

467
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, Google, the least evil.

468
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,930
Speaker 0: Look at what Yahoo's been doing in China.

469
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:32,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, Google, you know, the privacy stuff is not perfect, but you could argue whether Google has done no evil or some evil, but it's kind of hard to argue that Google's done a lot evil.

470
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,928
Speaker 1: They have done less evil than every other company of that size ever.

471
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:53,010
Speaker 0: Considering that both myself and Scott, who are relatively paranoid in the world of protecting our data and just technology in general, I trust Google with a lot of my personal information, and Google can read all of my email.

472
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:59,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the same time, though, personally, I kind of do worry about it more than, I guess, not at all.

473
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:09,239
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, it's sort of like eggs are already in the basket situation, where it's like, "Well, they already can fuck me, so why not?

474
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,528
Speaker 1: If I give them more information, it's not going to make a

475
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:11,949
Speaker 1: difference.".

476
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,761
Speaker 0: I trust Google enough to give them all this data.

477
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:16,944
Speaker 0: I don't trust them totally.

478
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,950
Speaker 0: I trust very few things in the world completely.

479
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:23,730
Speaker 0: But I trust Google enough to handle almost all of my personal communication.

480
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:31,070
Speaker 0: And I trust them enough with the ability to read every email I ever send and every document I ever write, for the most part.

481
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:40,930
Speaker 0: And I guess one reason is, I'm not arguing this at all, but personally, the worst thing Google could ever do to me is tell the truth about me.

482
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:48,610
Speaker 0: And I'm not really ashamed of anything I've written, so I'm not going to make the, "Well, if you haven't done anything wrong, then you've got nothing to worry about" argument.

483
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,769
Speaker 0: But I will make the argument that there's nothing Google could do to me.

484
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, me either.

485
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,770
Speaker 1: I'm not worried.

486
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,090
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they could take all my money.

487
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:56,914
Speaker 0: They could.

488
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:58,569
Speaker 0: They could publish my credit card numbers.

489
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:02,710
Speaker 1: They could just go to my bank website and take my money out.

490
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,070
Speaker 0: They could put all my email up, and then they could publish my address and probably my work schedule.

491
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:12,510
Speaker 0: And it wouldn't be that out of the realm for them to publish How to Get a Key to My House.

492
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:13,392
Speaker 1: Probably not.

493
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:37,110
Speaker 1: Regardless, in general, Google search itself, you know, not the ad words or anything like that, but they have always and consistently throughout their almost 10-year history done everything in their power to keep that search being the best search for people who are searching for information, and better than every other search engine I've ever used, and it still is that way.

494
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,210
Speaker 1: If you want to find something on the internet, you type it into Google.

495
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,116
Speaker 1: Odds are you're going to find it.

496
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:45,470
Speaker 1: You're not going to find dead links so much, you know, very often.

497
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,510
Speaker 1: You're not going to find bad stories very often.

498
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:52,210
Speaker 1: The vast majority of the time, you're going to find the best link.

499
00:40:52,350 --> 00:41:01,749
Speaker 1: In fact, someone did a study where what they did is they, you know, they gave people sets of search results, right, without telling them which search engine the search results were from.

500
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,850
Speaker 0: I would bet a lot of money that I could tell what search engine, as in Google or not Google.

501
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:07,270
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,210
Speaker 1: And they told them what the search term was, and the people decided which set of search results were the best.

503
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:16,690
Speaker 1: And Google won about half the time.

504
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,970
Speaker 1: So for every search engine, all the major search engines, Google was the best half the time.

505
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:23,069
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

506
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:26,730
Speaker 1: One beating all the others half the time.

507
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:27,649
Speaker 1: That's damn good.

508
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:34,930
Speaker 0: Now we could talk about how Google makes money and ad words and AdSense and all that, but I think like that sort of thing could be a separate show altogether.

509
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,950
Speaker 0: I don't want to go too long.

510
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,510
Speaker 1: I want to talk about how Google made the Web useful and how it changes the way we use the Web.

511
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:47,910
Speaker 0: And I mean, if we just go along that tack, Google made effectively the best searching that exists right now.

512
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:51,550
Speaker 0: And it's not perfect, but nothing's perfect.

513
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:58,350
Speaker 0: It's far and away clearly the best search engine out there, at least in the English speaking world.

514
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:58,706
Speaker 0: Yeah.

515
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:00,089
Speaker 1: But think about this, right?

516
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:05,110
Speaker 1: The Web right before Google was just a mess of stuff.

517
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:08,810
Speaker 1: It wasn't really that useful or anything like that.

518
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,630
Speaker 1: And regardless of what Google's trying to do for itself, for the Web as a whole, they've made it useful.

519
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:19,870
Speaker 1: I mean, you couldn't have no dig without Google because who would find a thing to post a dig?

520
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:28,250
Speaker 1: You couldn't have Wikipedia without Google because who could search to do the research to write the Wikipedia article to find the sources to link to in the Wikipedia article?

521
00:42:29,152 --> 00:42:35,050
Speaker 1: None of these things that we have on the Web today that we sort of take for granted that are separate from Google entirely.

522
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,849
Speaker 1: You don't realize they depend on Google.

523
00:42:38,393 --> 00:42:40,170
Speaker 1: If we didn't have Google, you wouldn't have any of this shit.

524
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,910
Speaker 1: You had nothing.

525
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:45,689
Speaker 1: The Web would just be this useless mess without a search engine backing it up.

526
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:51,330
Speaker 1: It'd be like going to the library without a card catalog or with a card catalog that was messed up and half of it was wrong.

527
00:42:51,795 --> 00:42:52,649
Speaker 1: How would you deal with that?

528
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,790
Speaker 1: The library would be useless.

529
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,490
Speaker 1: You couldn't find the book you wanted unless you were crazy and looked through every shelf.

530
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,810
Speaker 0: This isn't just a let's filet Google session because it could have been anyone.

531
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:04,038
Speaker 0: It's not so much that Google, Google, Google.

532
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,768
Speaker 0: It's that someone, anyone made a search engine that was good enough to allow everything we wanted to happen happen.

533
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,828
Speaker 1: Google just happened to be that search engine.

534
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:16,250
Speaker 1: It could have been any search.

535
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:18,350
Speaker 1: It could have been more than one search engine at once.

536
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,210
Speaker 1: It could have those what he said, those wrecks people, whatever they could have.

537
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,168
Speaker 1: They could have come out with their thing just as well because they were thinking along the same lines.

538
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,850
Speaker 1: There could have been two competing search engines that were just as good.

539
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,970
Speaker 1: And then who knows what happened?

540
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:32,749
Speaker 0: Actually, it might have been even better if that had happened.

541
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:39,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is, is that someone made a search engine that actually worked, thus changing everything.

542
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:43,770
Speaker 1: And we would be way back in the gutter if no one had done it.

543
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,448
Speaker 1: And Google just happened to be the ones who did it.

544
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:48,790
Speaker 0: So beyond searching, where is Google going?

545
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,168
Speaker 0: I don't want to do a lot about this because, again, that could be like the third part if we wanted to do it.

546
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:54,789
Speaker 0: You know what we use Google for.

547
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:57,250
Speaker 0: But Google has been going in a lot of directions.

548
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,310
Speaker 0: They have Google Maps, which gives awful directions.

549
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:04,250
Speaker 0: But in terms of looking at a map is probably the best thing out there, hands down.

550
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,250
Speaker 1: And also is really good at telling you what businesses are nearby.

551
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:07,885
Speaker 1: Yes.

552
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:15,709
Speaker 0: And Google Docs, I always kind of mistrusted any sort of web based application for a long time.

553
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,250
Speaker 0: But Google made one good enough to where I use Google Docs for almost everything I write.

554
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,150
Speaker 0: Except for, you know, VI stuff.

555
00:44:23,491 --> 00:44:29,810
Speaker 1: But mostly because after leaving, you know, college, I use a lot less, you know, word office app.

556
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,815
Speaker 1: I don't really use.

557
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:33,168
Speaker 1: I could live without any open office or M.S.

558
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:33,788
Speaker 1: office.

559
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,567
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not writing papers like I used to.

560
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, not writing papers.

561
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:39,330
Speaker 1: I deal with one spreadsheet a month.

562
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,810
Speaker 1: And the only reason I don't deal with that spreadsheet in Google spreadsheet is because it's too big for Google spreadsheet to handle.

563
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:45,630
Speaker 1: So I use numeric.

564
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,550
Speaker 1: But other than that, I don't word process anything.

565
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:50,190
Speaker 1: If I do, it's like a blog entry.

566
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,890
Speaker 1: I do it in a text editor in the blog editor.

567
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:53,697
Speaker 1: Right.

568
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,350
Speaker 1: You know, so I don't really need an office application that's big and slow.

569
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,489
Speaker 1: Google Docs does more than what I need.

570
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:01,869
Speaker 1: Yep.

571
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:02,868
Speaker 1: And there it is.

572
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,258
Speaker 1: And it allows me to share things I make with other people easily, especially if they're all.

573
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:13,270
Speaker 1: And most of the people I want to share with are also using Google Docs and Gmail, making it really easy.

574
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:22,330
Speaker 0: I think that's the big thing right now that Google is offering to us is just this online collaboration is so easy now because, I mean, one, we have our Google for domain.

575
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,430
Speaker 0: So, you know, all our front row crew is actually Google behind the scenes.

576
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:35,388
Speaker 1: If you email us geeknight@frontrowecrew.com, I actually go to mail.frontrowecrew.com, which is Gmail, and I log in there and it's Gmail.

577
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:41,370
Speaker 0: But I can collaborate and share my calendars and my documents and all that stuff.

578
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:42,369
Speaker 0: And I can schedule things.

579
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,710
Speaker 0: And I use Google calendars a lot.

580
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,370
Speaker 0: And I used to never bother with calendars.

581
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,550
Speaker 1: I didn't use a calendar anything.

582
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,850
Speaker 1: Like I kept trying to use different calendars and I never stuck with one.

583
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,329
Speaker 1: But Google calendar I actually use.

584
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:54,946
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

585
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,447
Speaker 1: I use Google Reader for my RSS.

586
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:06,108
Speaker 1: And the thing is, Google, if you really look at their business, they're sort of unsuccessful at everything except for their search engine and Gmail.

587
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,790
Speaker 1: They try a lot of other stuff, and most of it is just sort of they're trying stuff and it's not working out so well.

588
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,209
Speaker 1: The maps is kind of working out.

589
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:20,009
Speaker 0: But if you look at it from a business perspective, the only thing that works is the fact that they sell text ads and they make a lot of money off of that.

590
00:46:20,252 --> 00:46:21,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's really it.

591
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:23,670
Speaker 1: Google tries to do a lot of things.

592
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:29,670
Speaker 1: They're doing more and more things every day, like they're doing this Android cell phone thing and they're doing all sorts of stuff.

593
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,270
Speaker 1: And none of it really works from the business perspective.

594
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:43,090
Speaker 1: But what ends up happening is they do make a lot of stuff that is useful for people and it makes lives better on the net and no one else really.

595
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:51,290
Speaker 1: Maybe because Google just has the resources and has the manpower and the brains and all that stuff to pull it off and no one else can really compete.

596
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:59,030
Speaker 1: But they just happen to be the company that makes all these things that make the web more and more useful.

597
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:06,969
Speaker 1: They took the web from shit and they turned it into gold and they're slowly polishing that gold and perhaps making some platinum, too.

598
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:13,350
Speaker 1: And other people are helping, like Wikipedia did a lot to help out and some other people and YouTube.

599
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:14,889
Speaker 1: But Google owns YouTube now.

600
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:23,270
Speaker 0: So, yeah, you know, there are a lot of people who are Google detractors, a lot of people who really, really hate Google or complain about Google all the time.

601
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:28,236
Speaker 0: And all I really have to say is that a lot of these people seem to not really understand it.

602
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:37,570
Speaker 0: Or more importantly, Google does not serve their purposes and their purposes nine times out of ten are contrary to the desires of the majority of people on the Internet.

603
00:47:37,895 --> 00:47:38,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

604
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:47,090
Speaker 0: And I mean, most of the people who complain about Google say, ah, Google fucked me in my SEO scheme or Google knocked my page rank down and now I can't sell my ads.

605
00:47:47,636 --> 00:47:48,289
Speaker 0: But think about it.

606
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:49,086
Speaker 0: That hurts you.

607
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:57,150
Speaker 0: But for most of the people who are using Google, you know that the people like us, from a pure consumer perspective, that does nothing but make Google better.

608
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:14,328
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're trying to get your stuff up on Google, that's you know, if I search for something related to what your page is about on Google and I get results and I'm happy with those results and your page is not a part of those results, Google's doing a good job.

609
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:21,629
Speaker 1: And it's very likely that your page is at least no better than it's probably worse than the result I got.

610
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,870
Speaker 1: So just because you're upset because you're not, you know, less people are visiting your site from Google.

611
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:33,346
Speaker 1: Well, the people who are searching for stuff are happier because they're not finding your shit and it's better for us.

612
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:49,690
Speaker 1: And if you want to if you are want to change Google to benefit yourself, you're basically saying is you have no problem making the Web worse for everyone else, making it more like it was in the late 90s and making it shittier and less useful.

613
00:48:49,810 --> 00:49:04,010
Speaker 1: You're basically saying that's like saying that you should go into the card catalog in the library and replace, you know, get rid of all the cards that talk about, you know, podcasts and only put in one card for podcasts as geek nights.

614
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:09,590
Speaker 1: And you'd be happy with that, even though it makes the library shittier for all the actually looking for books about podcasts.

615
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:17,849
Speaker 0: Now, if it weren't Google, like let's say suddenly Microsoft search started giving me better results than Google.

616
00:49:18,696 --> 00:49:19,670
Speaker 0: But let's say it happened.

617
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,649
Speaker 1: Let's say it did happen.

618
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:28,910
Speaker 0: The technological people like myself and Scott and people we would we even know as much as I love Google, it's only because they do me good.

619
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:36,569
Speaker 0: And if Microsoft were better tomorrow, I would be using MSN search tomorrow immediately without any looking back.

620
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:38,650
Speaker 1: It's not just the quality of the results, though.

621
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,190
Speaker 1: It's also the interface, the speed of the results.

622
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:43,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's other factors.

623
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,470
Speaker 0: MSN or Yahoo or anything became better.

624
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:52,050
Speaker 0: I would not hesitate to use them immediately and without any sort of qualms.

625
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:58,910
Speaker 1: No, but see, actually, the thing is, is like even if they became better, it's like I'd have to find out that they were better.

626
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:04,770
Speaker 1: And the only way I would find out that they were better is if Google started sucking to where it was no longer serving my purposes.

627
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:10,584
Speaker 1: Like as long as Google kept doing the job, I'm already using it and sort of the momentum of using it.

628
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:12,630
Speaker 1: I wouldn't move away.

629
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,250
Speaker 1: You know, I'd only move away and like go check.

630
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:20,890
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even check Yahoo or MSN to see if they were good unless Google didn't live up to the task.

631
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:30,170
Speaker 0: Well, see, that that is the inherent interesting issue of kind of the low ceiling and that all right, I'm searching for sandwiches on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

632
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:36,750
Speaker 0: Let's say Yahoo gives you five good sites that PB&Js and two of them are SEO crap.

633
00:50:37,211 --> 00:50:38,750
Speaker 0: And MSN gives me four good pages.

634
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,289
Speaker 0: And the fifth one is SEO crap.

635
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,929
Speaker 0: And Google gives me four good ones.

636
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,075
Speaker 0: And the last one is just.

637
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:50,330
Speaker 0: it's about like people having sex with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which isn't exactly what I wanted, maybe.

638
00:50:50,810 --> 00:51:02,370
Speaker 0: But in that case, it doesn't matter what search engine I use, because if any one of those things I clicked on told me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and it was good enough, I succeeded.

639
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,908
Speaker 0: And I don't care what I used.

640
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,349
Speaker 0: I only care about the results.

641
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,570
Speaker 0: And Google just has the best odds of giving me good results right now.

642
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:16,430
Speaker 0: And it would take a lot for Google if Google would have to not give us enough to do what we want for us to switch by us.

643
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,830
Speaker 0: I mean, pretty much anyone.

644
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:26,250
Speaker 1: Back in those late 90s days, I would search for something on one search engine, not find it, go search on another search engine, maybe find something a little better search on different search engine.

645
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:30,328
Speaker 1: They'd all completely different results nowadays and search on search different search engines.

646
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:31,949
Speaker 1: It's not even something I would think of.

647
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,650
Speaker 1: I mean, I search on one search engine and either find it or I don't.

648
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:40,769
Speaker 1: And if I don't find it, it's probably ludicrously difficult to find and switching search engines.

649
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:44,770
Speaker 1: I mean, I might try something else, but that's really not going to help.

650
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,990
Speaker 1: I, you know, I generally refine my terms and then I get what I want.

651
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:56,490
Speaker 0: And I've never in recent memory searched for something on Google, not found it and then found it from another source at any point in the future.

652
00:51:56,872 --> 00:52:00,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just and I really if I can't find it on Google, I feel like it's not worth finding.

653
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:10,890
Speaker 1: The only time I can't find it is if I'm looking for like I remember a specific page and I'm trying to find a specific page again and I forgot to bookmark it or delicious it or whatever.

654
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:14,810
Speaker 1: That's the time when Google can fail me and it becomes pretty hard.

655
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:21,890
Speaker 1: It's like go and find, you know, the blog or whatever that I found the thing on and then search on that blog, usually with Google.

656
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,510
