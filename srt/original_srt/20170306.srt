1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,463
Speaker 1: It's Monday March 6th 2017.

2
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,473
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,420
Speaker 1: It's a tech news roundup.

4
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:23,718
Speaker 1: Let's do this Because we haven't done a Monday show yet this year.

5
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:30,701
Speaker 0: I somehow haven't done a Monday show this year and also we haven't done a tech news roundup since March 2016.

6
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,090
Speaker 0: So it's okay to do one again.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,700
Speaker 1: It's like every year right around March.

8
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:38,471
Speaker 1: We can't come over the Monday show and then one of us says hey Why don't we just do a tech news roundup?

9
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:43,060
Speaker 0: It's like oh, we just did one But it's like I actually know he did one last year that clock never ring.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,534
Speaker 1: Well, actually no that clock rings every year in March.

11
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:53,560
Speaker 1: Yeah So, I guess that means we won't do a lot of news in the beginning because we're all our news is in the second half.

12
00:00:53,962 --> 00:01:03,478
Speaker 1: So I guess the biggest news we could do this now is the cloud bleed Because I saw a lot of people freaking out about that on the internet and I realized that most people don't seem to understand What the hell I was all about.

13
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:15,235
Speaker 0: So essentially and people people tend to freak out like when something is technically whatever even though that's not actually, you know I mean this one is pretty like I would change my passwords if I were.

14
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,448
Speaker 0: you doesn't hurt to change your password anyway, even if nothing's happening.

15
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,071
Speaker 0: and

16
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:34,325
Speaker 1: the other danger is if you because you know Basically, the real problem wasn't so much the exploit but the fact that because browser well not browsers But because networks and caches and all these other things search engines were caching a lot of the data It wasn't just oh.

17
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:42,840
Speaker 1: you had to know about the exploit and get the data like as the transactions were happening You could often go back and just get the data.

18
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,098
Speaker 1: so while the odds are low the odds are higher than you might expect or basically what happened.

19
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,236
Speaker 1: so Cloud flare is a service that seemed like a really good idea when I first heard of it.

20
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:57,820
Speaker 1: until I looked into how it works It is still a really good idea to a degree.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,940
Speaker 1: The problem is the way it's set up is half the time and actually I found an article that will summarize it.

22
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:11,160
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna go into all those details here But I looked into using it for some stuff not too long ago because I mostly knew what it did and it works great.

23
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:18,340
Speaker 1: Unless you're doing SSL then they have an option called like flexible SSL.

24
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:27,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't use that which but that's the only one that you can use cheaply Where basically what it'll do is they have an SSL certificate for your site.

25
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:36,615
Speaker 1: So when people connect to your site, they actually it redirects your domain to their servers with their SSL And then it goes through them to your server.

26
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:37,679
Speaker 1: It does caching and whatever.

27
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:42,252
Speaker 0: But but that if you do this your site doesn't have SSL sitting.

28
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:48,552
Speaker 0: the connection between you and cloud flare is not encrypted Yep, and someone could spy on that part and see what's going on.

29
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:53,400
Speaker 1: So even worse if you do that Yeah, it's just unencrypted to your actual website.

30
00:02:53,561 --> 00:03:00,751
Speaker 1: So you're kind of almost lying to your users saying yeah dog we got SSL SSL but it's just not all the way end-to-end.

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,980
Speaker 0: It's just between the user and the end that they're hitting.

32
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:08,160
Speaker 1: So if you do it, they have another way to do it where you can actually put an SSL certificate on the other side.

33
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 1: So you've got your SSL certificate to cloud flare and then cloud flare has their SSL certificate to your users.

34
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:18,740
Speaker 1: But then you have to 100% trust cloud flares security.

35
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:21,493
Speaker 0: You can do it where it's just your SSL all the way through.

36
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 1: that cost a ton of money.

37
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:28,999
Speaker 1: They do not let you use that normally and even then you have to give them your private key to make that work.

38
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:30,711
Speaker 0: I didn't know about that.

39
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,760
Speaker 1: How else would you do it Scott?

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,351
Speaker 1: How could it be your certificate on their server without the private key?

41
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,180
Speaker 1: because they can't just pass the messages through.

42
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:42,000
Speaker 1: They have to actually inspect the messages to be able to cache them and do all that other crap.

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,128
Speaker 0: How does a router pass the packets from?

44
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,036
Speaker 1: the router doesn't have to inspect the packets.

45
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,120
Speaker 1: It just passes the packets.

46
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,327
Speaker 1: Cloud flare doesn't pass the packets.

47
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:53,400
Speaker 1: Cloudflare has to know like what website they're accessing and what data is there.

48
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:54,920
Speaker 1: So we can do like the caching.

49
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:59,540
Speaker 0: You don't use caching on SSL and load balancing happens in a lower.

50
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:04,440
Speaker 1: That's the whole point of cloud flare is the caching and the reverse proxy and all that nonsense.

51
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:08,264
Speaker 0: You can do that part but with using SSL You can.

52
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:11,813
Speaker 0: you can do a lot of stuff just not on the HTTP layer.

53
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:12,956
Speaker 1: now with cloud flare.

54
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:16,434
Speaker 1: cloud flare service Basically puts a man in the middle.

55
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:26,420
Speaker 1: in your SSL You either give someone your private key or you've got separate SSL on one side and the other side Or there's only SSL on one side and not the other side.

56
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:35,339
Speaker 1: So basically independent of all that the vulnerability as best I can tell was just in cloud flare servers.

57
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,586
Speaker 1: So it didn't matter how you're doing it.

58
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:55,152
Speaker 1: They could basically do something like heart bleed and just get your clear text password Mmm, so yeah, if you type the password into a site that uses cloud flare Which is a huge chunk of the internet because a lot of people just click and say yeah I'll point my DNS a cloud flare because it's free and it's great.

59
00:04:55,172 --> 00:05:04,607
Speaker 0: No, we use our DNS a cloud flare But we just don't use the cloud flare cloudy part because you know the SSL Mmm, you don't use their like SSL stuff.

60
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,193
Speaker 0: No, but there are DNS server.

61
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,007
Speaker 0: No, they're a DNS server for Come.

62
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:25,608
Speaker 1: yeah, they offer a lot of services But if you if the website was connected to via SSL and cloud flare combined there was a long period of time where people could just get your stupid password and even worse say Oh, I'm just using two-factor the share.

63
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:34,534
Speaker 1: if you set up your two-factor while this was happening Theoretically someone could have gotten the shared secret for your two-factor and compromise that I theoretically.

64
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,276
Speaker 0: but it's not like.

65
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:39,280
Speaker 0: even if you take advantage And went to the cloud flare servers started collecting data.

66
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,147
Speaker 0: It's like you couldn't.

67
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,648
Speaker 0: how could you?

68
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:42,010
Speaker 0: you couldn't.

69
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,354
Speaker 0: it's like I had a search engine.

70
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:44,900
Speaker 0: we could search through this stuff, right?

71
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,996
Speaker 1: Well, you could to a degree because I like give me rims password.

72
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:49,699
Speaker 0: Here it is.

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,825
Speaker 0: Doesn't work like that quote.

74
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:58,062
Speaker 1: the bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it was cached by search Engines.

75
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,168
Speaker 1: you didn't have to know.

76
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:10,520
Speaker 1: you could go back and search for interesting stuff Which it doesn't increase the chance that your data was leaked But it increases the chance that if your data was leaked and someone was interested they could get it and that data like everyone who?

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,363
Speaker 1: Cares about this data?

78
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:12,787
Speaker 1: has it all meanwhile.

79
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:16,500
Speaker 0: There isn't one single instance of anyone using anything from this attack.

80
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:17,544
Speaker 0: Well, you wouldn't know.

81
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:18,870
Speaker 1: how could you know?

82
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:20,236
Speaker 0: how could you know?

83
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,060
Speaker 0: huh suddenly?

84
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,176
Speaker 0: I can't log into my account and it's a website that uses cloud flare.

85
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,164
Speaker 0: That is the account I can't log into.

86
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:27,705
Speaker 1: one.

87
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:29,632
Speaker 0: my password got changed so one.

88
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:35,320
Speaker 1: most people like if you're gonna exploit something like this Usually you do it all at once later in an automatic fashion.

89
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,046
Speaker 1: I mean You don't just want off something.

90
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:41,420
Speaker 1: very few people are trying to hack an individual person and are using this kind of crap.

91
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:48,620
Speaker 1: The moral is if you're gonna use a service like cloud flare, then you should learn exactly what it does.

92
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:51,960
Speaker 1: So when you wake up in the morning, you see on Twitter that cloud flare is trending.

93
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,639
Speaker 1: You're like, oh at least you know What actually happens and what the actual danger is?

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:11,556
Speaker 1: Because it's actually kind of an esoteric and difficult to explain problem with a lot of pieces involved Things of the day.

95
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:15,006
Speaker 1: So, uh, you might remember a long time ago.

96
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:19,617
Speaker 1: There was a certain Fake documentary about NASA.

97
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,480
Speaker 1: That was pretty funny.

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,372
Speaker 1: It was a long aging old thing of the day, but This.

99
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:33,213
Speaker 1: so there's this door monster to YouTube account and they've been making among other things these short pretty funny little skits about Civilization 5.

100
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:36,385
Speaker 0: didn't you use them as a thing of the day already so long a while ago.

101
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:37,870
Speaker 1: I found one skit.

102
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,384
Speaker 1: It's really sure you got a rerun thing of the day now because basically run all that culminated into this is like a way good video.

103
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:55,049
Speaker 1: and basically what they did is they made a Documentary in that style just like the old thing that we did and it is a documentary of a civilization 5 war.

104
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:58,687
Speaker 1: And this is some choice comedy right here.

105
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:00,821
Speaker 1: You just got to watch it.

106
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,029
Speaker 1: This is just really good.

107
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:14,263
Speaker 1: My head is off to these guys I don't know what I can tell you just like you get the quotes from the leaders like Gustavus Adolphus Forming new cheese land next to the whales and then the Ottomans declaring war on them.

108
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:19,074
Speaker 1: That's good stuff, buddy, Foxton You should watch this.

109
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:24,494
Speaker 1: it's like five minutes long and it is in that style of a documentary All right.

110
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:29,147
Speaker 0: So here's another war documentary a Star War Documentary.

111
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:33,119
Speaker 0: And basically when I saw the title for this videos I think I saw.

112
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,129
Speaker 0: I forget where I saw the link.

113
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:40,690
Speaker 0: I said I basically my mind was like that's lame and cheesy like anyone could come up with that idea.

114
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:51,330
Speaker 0: They're gonna execute poorly and it's gonna be some corny internet garbage that I don't like, you know Just usually like that shallow nerd garbage like the kind of person who likes it is the kind of person who buys a loot box.

115
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,799
Speaker 1: Well like those movie fault videos.

116
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:57,230
Speaker 1: They're like, here's the hundred things wrong with this movie And they're all actually really poorly researched and kind of dumb, right?

117
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,410
Speaker 0: It's gonna be one of those like, you know mainstream nerd garbage things.

118
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kind of stuff you see at comic-con out of mag fester packs anyway.

119
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:13,930
Speaker 0: but no, this is super super well executed of You know pretty easy a lame-o idea and because they executed so well.

120
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:15,629
Speaker 0: It's funny.

121
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:32,483
Speaker 0: So what this is is they took most slash all of the scenes in Star Wars new hope Episode four in which r2d2 appears and they removed his And they put in Actual voice acting saying were dialogue.

122
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:34,530
Speaker 0: that completely fits with the scene.

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,436
Speaker 0: Appropriately, I feel like it fits.

124
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:41,068
Speaker 1: r2d2 is the personality I perceive for r2d2 pretty well, too.

125
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,762
Speaker 0: Maybe I mean it's good enough to be a good video.

126
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,750
Speaker 1: How do you think he is what it comes down to?

127
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:48,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, he's.

128
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,103
Speaker 0: so it's pretty good.

129
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:58,050
Speaker 1: in the meta moment The book club book is Frank Herbert's Dune because we never actually read that whole stupid thing and they're gonna gonna talk about it.

130
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,990
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm all the previous book club book was Rebecca.

131
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,341
Speaker 1: You should read that book and watch the movie and then listen to our podcast.

132
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,450
Speaker 0: It was a book club book odds.

133
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,253
Speaker 0: Are you should read it?

134
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:08,677
Speaker 0: There's been a weird there.

135
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:09,380
Speaker 0: bad ones though.

136
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:14,016
Speaker 1: The Kingkiller Chronicle may not be your style I mean, we don't do too many.

137
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:15,804
Speaker 0: It's not this millions of good books.

138
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:17,190
Speaker 0: It's not hard to always go back and read.

139
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,219
Speaker 0: It's not hard to always pick a good one.

140
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,370
Speaker 0: If we only do like two or three one or two a year.

141
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:28,707
Speaker 1: We are going to be on Friday this week at PAX East.

142
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,728
Speaker 1: oh shit Ah my god.

143
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:38,770
Speaker 0: Like that is if you're probably gonna listen to this Monday episode on a Tuesday and it's gonna be Wednesday Thursday On Thursday will be in Boston.

144
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:40,978
Speaker 0: It will be packed.

145
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:41,219
Speaker 0: Is there?

146
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,370
Speaker 1: is there a pre packs gaming like just like last year in that side?

147
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,866
Speaker 1: Not even looked at what's going on at PAX because we were just at PAX.

148
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:49,910
Speaker 0: remember that side room.

149
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,530
Speaker 0: It's in the corner of the West on the bottom on the aloft side.

150
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the same place as last year, which is good because we're staying at the aloft But we're going to be there for the entire weekend.

151
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,084
Speaker 1: and on Friday at 6 p.m.

152
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:09,310
Speaker 1: In the bumblebee theater We are doing a brand new panel play dirty to win and you might think it's not brand new.

153
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,470
Speaker 0: It's mostly the same as I played away.

154
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:23,700
Speaker 1: No so it was mostly the same and I slowly rewrote the entire thing to the point that now it is a lot more dirty to win Mmm, and it gets into basically we.

155
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:32,482
Speaker 1: it starts with like put poop on the table So everyone runs away and then you technically well, I didn't even think about terrorism I should put in like no baguette fart.

156
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:33,890
Speaker 1: farting is a strategy.

157
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,117
Speaker 1: Farting is a real good strategy.

158
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,442
Speaker 0: actually be that guy.

159
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:38,326
Speaker 0: So no one wants to play.

160
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,129
Speaker 0: they all run forfeit.

161
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,413
Speaker 1: you Extend the game forever.

162
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:42,135
Speaker 1: make Monopoly go.

163
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:47,450
Speaker 1: but we progress through varying levels of monstrous ways to win games.

164
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,597
Speaker 1: To decide where the line is 109 slides for 60 minutes.

165
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:54,397
Speaker 0: Let's go But you made too many.

166
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:58,780
Speaker 1: so now cuz that whole bit at the end Remember, we have a nice bit of just a bunch of words Ted style.

167
00:11:59,161 --> 00:11:59,985
Speaker 1: Mmm.

168
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,310
Speaker 1: It's gonna be an interesting panel.

169
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,854
Speaker 1: It's brand new.

170
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:02,882
Speaker 1: We've never done this anywhere.

171
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:05,461
Speaker 1: I Keep coming up with good ideas for the panel.

172
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:06,629
Speaker 1: the more we talk about the panel.

173
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:14,497
Speaker 0: So I mean the ways to play dirty are nearly a Myriad way.

174
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,150
Speaker 0: turtling up when you're ahead at the end.

175
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,895
Speaker 1: Yeah playing or the draw.

176
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:22,165
Speaker 1: if you can't win force it so that nobody wins.

177
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,050
Speaker 0: injured the other team on purpose.

178
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, just cheat.

179
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,030
Speaker 0: just straight-up cheat, but all the different ways to cheat.

180
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,513
Speaker 1: Well, the two.

181
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,580
Speaker 1: there's two kinds of cheating.

182
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:34,541
Speaker 1: I realized in the end there's Conventional cheating and blatant cheating.

183
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:40,828
Speaker 1: conventional cheating is like, you know If you ain't cheating ain't trying like that kind of stuff like push the rules to the limit.

184
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:46,958
Speaker 1: rules don't say a dog can't play baseball or Rules say you got to catch me or it's not cheating.

185
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:55,560
Speaker 1: Mmm, but then there's cheating like I just keep taking money When you're not looking at monopoly like that, that's a different class of cheating and you didn't count my money So you don't know.

186
00:12:55,744 --> 00:13:00,242
Speaker 1: yeah Like and I feel like that is a big line like in a board game.

187
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:06,979
Speaker 1: if you just break the rules in a complicated German Board game where it's hard for anyone to notice Arguably, you're not even winning the game.

188
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,910
Speaker 1: You're winning because you're not playing the game.

189
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:16,369
Speaker 0: You're in the marathon and you skip you take a bus Yeah, and then you go back after the marathon and use like a bike so that your path looks right.

190
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:21,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, it should be a good panel because it's gonna be mostly ad-lib.

191
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:23,250
Speaker 1: the slides are just the backing and we'll see how this.

192
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,222
Speaker 1: I also did some formal research.

193
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,610
Speaker 1: I learned about fast and frugal heuristics.

194
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:38,310
Speaker 1: Subscribe to my youtube channel because not only my stream in overwatch and streaming this geek nights episode right now But I've been uploading a whole bunch of our old board game reviews as standalone things.

195
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:42,790
Speaker 1: Also subscribe to Scott's YouTube channel because he's playing that Zelda game on the switch.

196
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:43,473
Speaker 0: I'm just.

197
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,690
Speaker 1: I'm just playing Zelda with his sweet new streaming rig that we've been talking about.

198
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,642
Speaker 0: I got a thing like this is website restream.io.

199
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:57,641
Speaker 0: It lets you stream to YouTube and twitch And it works so great.

200
00:13:57,762 --> 00:13:58,345
Speaker 0: and it's free.

201
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,289
Speaker 0: and it works so good.

202
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:06,315
Speaker 0: I'm surprised at how great it works and it even lets you stream to more places at once if you want to but I only Do YouTube into it?

203
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you have to go to YouTube or twitch and watch me play Zelda.

204
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,084
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter whichever one you like better until yet.

205
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,050
Speaker 1: It's like cloudflare.

206
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,825
Speaker 1: You're just gonna put it to this site and trust the site to stream it out there.

207
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:16,790
Speaker 0: It's working great.

208
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,613
Speaker 0: It's like I was.

209
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:17,975
Speaker 0: I was.

210
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,542
Speaker 0: I know how well it works.

211
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:19,763
Speaker 0: cuz

212
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,994
Speaker 1: I've been looking into because we got a semi Project where we give

213
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:26,927
Speaker 0: you one RTMP and then they send it to a whole bunch of other RTMPs

214
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:37,250
Speaker 1: got a project we're working on where I need a lot of dynamic motion graphics during a stream and I feel like the right way to do that is to do it in-house for a lot of reasons.

215
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:44,863
Speaker 1: But there are a lot of services that will do that shit for you by sending your stream to an RTMP Destination and they'll add the shit and restream it.

216
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,250
Speaker 1: So I've been looking at all that stuff late.

217
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:46,391
Speaker 1: I

218
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,148
Speaker 0: feel like that sort of thing you want to do locale

219
00:14:48,872 --> 00:15:03,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then like it I see why most people do it that way and I think it's because you have to be pretty technically Proficient enough to like make a web service that respond like that provides a web page That ends up providing the graphics that you're controlling with a program and that kind of stuff.

220
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:04,348
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

221
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:08,540
Speaker 1: But uh, yeah Anyway, I'll see you guys at PAX.

222
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:11,030
Speaker 1: and the only other reason you might want to subscribe to my youtube.

223
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,110
Speaker 1: Is that someone pointed out?

224
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:19,509
Speaker 1: That now that overwatch you can just run servers like you can you spin up a custom server and do stuff.

225
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:29,810
Speaker 1: There are a lot of custom servers like a scary number of them that appear to be 18 plus roleplay no killing allowed What.

226
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,676
Speaker 0: yeah, you know FPS.

227
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:36,872
Speaker 1: so like 12 people are on a server and I guess they ironically roleplay overwatch fanfic I don't know.

228
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:40,486
Speaker 1: So I'm curious to all of you out there.

229
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:49,407
Speaker 1: I'm just asking this Should I or should I not Join one of these servers and live stream as I put on my robe and wizard hat.

230
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:55,696
Speaker 0: All right Well, I mean everyone what anyone who's listening is either not gonna say anything or say yes Right.

231
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:56,810
Speaker 0: No one cares if you do it.

232
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,336
Speaker 0: They just won't watch if they don't want to care.

233
00:15:58,376 --> 00:15:59,461
Speaker 1: but I've got would it?

234
00:15:59,581 --> 00:15:59,822
Speaker 1: would it?

235
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,610
Speaker 1: should I put in that effort?

236
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,075
Speaker 1: Like should I go poke?

237
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,530
Speaker 1: someone just gave me five dollars on this on the stream?

238
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,640
Speaker 1: I'm assuming that Shawn wants me to do it.

239
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,590
Speaker 0: Don't they have something better to buy with that five dollars?

240
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,117
Speaker 0: You could have got a bacon egg and cheese.

241
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:18,076
Speaker 0: Well now you rather see rim in a robe and wizard Shawn You just gave me five dollars.

242
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:18,760
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do it.

243
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,432
Speaker 0: I Set up the thing.

244
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,442
Speaker 1: what I just I'll give us money to say stuff.

245
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:25,164
Speaker 0: Stop doing that.

246
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,010
Speaker 1: He said it's this is so exciting.

247
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,803
Speaker 1: I guess I'm doing it.

248
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:32,187
Speaker 0: People got no lives here.

249
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,850
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things I can do in the server.

250
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:38,690
Speaker 1: So it's not just robe and wizard hat but what if I just start killing people?

251
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,972
Speaker 0: They just let you.

252
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,579
Speaker 0: they'll probably just kick you off the server.

253
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta get so I gotta escalate at the right level.

254
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,059
Speaker 1: This will be you know, I wonder though.

255
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:46,983
Speaker 0: How come we don't have it.

256
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,489
Speaker 1: So someone just said no, don't do it.

257
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,537
Speaker 1: How come we don't said he watch it?

258
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,485
Speaker 0: How come we don't I'm doing it.

259
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:58,570
Speaker 0: How come we don't have a Way for the game server to stream itself, right?

260
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,790
Speaker 0: Why do I got like stream for my low like a spectator like the server itself has a spectator, right?

261
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,944
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, like if you're at say if you're at a Counter-Strike tournament, right?

262
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:10,410
Speaker 0: There's there, you know, this is God.

263
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,137
Speaker 1: He says no, he's got nothing better to buy.

264
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,348
Speaker 0: So just send me all your money.

265
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:20,064
Speaker 1: then Literally all of it to me not rim You because you keep shit all over these.

266
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:20,930
Speaker 1: send us money stuff.

267
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,237
Speaker 1: They're gonna send it to me and not you.

268
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:24,530
Speaker 0: but he says he doesn't need any of anything to buy.

269
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,148
Speaker 0: So send all your money better to buy.

270
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,942
Speaker 0: There's nothing better than I guess I'm in a robe and a wizard hat.

271
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:33,415
Speaker 1: then me in a robe and a wizard hat on an 18+ only erotic.

272
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,501
Speaker 0: you could buy me a beach house to live in.

273
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:37,225
Speaker 1: How does that benefit them?

274
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:38,709
Speaker 0: They could come and visit.

275
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:44,689
Speaker 0: I Guess I don't know the real Would be thankful for the beach house.

276
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:50,110
Speaker 1: The real problem is I feel I suddenly understand those YouTube shouty men.

277
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:55,230
Speaker 1: Because imagine if you're just sitting here shouting into the internet and people keep just giving you money to shout louder.

278
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,303
Speaker 1: I see why they're the way they are now.

279
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why they way they are.

280
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:05,677
Speaker 0: You should see that the two on Twitch like basically every time they get a donation or a subscriber Like they're like, oh, thank you.

281
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:13,701
Speaker 0: So and so it's like, you know, they're like, oh my god, you know, like they're basically Pretend, you know being super nice and fan servicing all the people who give them money.

282
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,570
Speaker 0: and they keep getting money because someone is so dumb.

283
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,470
Speaker 0: They think it's worth paying like five bucks to have some guy read the one line of text.

284
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:30,903
Speaker 1: You wrote out loud to all the people watching the stream and someone else someone else in the stream Who said don't do it now change their mind and please blood ninja us.

285
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,468
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess I'll do it.

286
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,830
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a tech news roundup.

287
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have any tech news.

288
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:41,530
Speaker 1: I just went to slash shot and just started going backwards chronologically.

289
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:48,757
Speaker 0: That tech news is probably at least like a month old, but Scott we're doing Commentary not news, whatever.

290
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:50,081
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

291
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:50,763
Speaker 1: It's not news.

292
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,492
Speaker 1: Find me a better aggregator of tech news That's just.

293
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:58,149
Speaker 0: you know there I mean literally any tech news aggregators better than slash that these days.

294
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:01,921
Speaker 1: Well slash shot actually is probably the best tech news aggregator in my opinion.

295
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:08,710
Speaker 1: The problem is the comments went from useful to Not useful to holy shit.

296
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,227
Speaker 1: The people who comment on slash dot are pretty much nothing but 40 year old.

297
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,151
Speaker 0: that guys I mean.

298
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,160
Speaker 0: what tech news sites are left in gadget?

299
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,270
Speaker 0: Yeah is gizmodo still around?

300
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:17,730
Speaker 0: I don't know.

301
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:21,482
Speaker 1: But those sites always get the same and actually those are the verges around.

302
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:28,447
Speaker 1: all those other sites seem to link primarily To things that are that are way less tech news than the slash shot stuff.

303
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:33,350
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm All right, I'm just gonna go through these in a semi random order.

304
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,510
Speaker 1: So yet another hidden backdoor was found in a bunch of Chinese Internet of Things devices.

305
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,561
Speaker 0: Yeah, internet things devices are insecure.

306
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,210
Speaker 0: if I bought one, I wouldn't plug it in the internet.

307
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,743
Speaker 0: You know what I was looking at 4k TVs just to see what the deal was.

308
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:50,269
Speaker 0: no not getting one anytime soon Maybe like a few years from now.

309
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:57,939
Speaker 1: I was looking similarly because my TV is as old as when we moved into this apartment Yeah - - cuz pretty much that we moved into apartment.

310
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,103
Speaker 1: you buy a new TV.

311
00:19:59,143 --> 00:19:59,504
Speaker 0: That's right.

312
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,430
Speaker 0: That's the way RT and beacon.

313
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:15,690
Speaker 1: So in beacon we had the 1974 color RCA and we said yeah, that's way too bad of a TV anyway, so When we oh actually that reminds me of a tech news, that's actually good anyway.

314
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,413
Speaker 0: So I was looking at the 4k TVs.

315
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:20,737
Speaker 0: literally all of them are smart TVs.

316
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:23,698
Speaker 0: You can't get a not smart one and It's like damn it.

317
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:30,441
Speaker 0: I just want a dumb Monitor basically, but as long as you can turn off the Y or K monitor That's that big cost like a fortune.

318
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,010
Speaker 0: the smart TVs are cheaper.

319
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,330
Speaker 0: So basically you just have to turn off all the don't give it an internet connection.

320
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,637
Speaker 0: Yeah Don't let it connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

321
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:38,360
Speaker 0: and only.

322
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,930
Speaker 1: you don't like trip by accident and like while you have an ethernet A cable in your hand and accidentally plug it.

323
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:47,470
Speaker 0: I just use the TV part of it only and ignore all its smart garbage functionality.

324
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,941
Speaker 0: But the problem is all that smart functionality like.

325
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,770
Speaker 0: there was a Sony one that look kind of nice.

326
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,235
Speaker 1: It's the kind of stuff people want.

327
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,870
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz they don't have another real boxes connected to their TVs like our people anyway.

328
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,290
Speaker 0: Well thing is but it's like it's running Android.

329
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,570
Speaker 0: It's like well, even if you never connect to the internet or use any of that crap.

330
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:06,663
Speaker 0: It's like well, you had to boot the thing into stupid Android.

331
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,310
Speaker 0: It doesn't just turn on like on.

332
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:10,280
Speaker 0: It's like got a boot all this software.

333
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,520
Speaker 1: It's like ah so Trustwave Discovered the back door in double tech double take.

334
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,995
Speaker 1: it looks like they make VoIP products mm-hmm, so This is interesting.

335
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:31,070
Speaker 1: because I just bought like the cheapest like tiny portable Wireless mouse in the world on Amazon just because I just want a wireless mouse for like playing sieve on a plane on my laptop.

336
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,539
Speaker 1: Because doing it with the touchpad on a flight.

337
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,586
Speaker 1: That's more than a few hours is not comfortable.

338
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,097
Speaker 0: if you touch the screen No, that's not comfortably.

339
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:41,144
Speaker 1: they're playing save with the touchpad actually really sucks.

340
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:42,027
Speaker 0: not the touchpad.

341
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:42,770
Speaker 0: touch the screen.

342
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,897
Speaker 1: No, that's just as bad.

343
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:44,381
Speaker 1: I've done it.

344
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:44,864
Speaker 1: It's not.

345
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:45,710
Speaker 0: how is that bad?

346
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,472
Speaker 1: It's way less.

347
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,382
Speaker 0: touch the unit you touch where you want them to go.

348
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,125
Speaker 0: you touch the city.

349
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:49,829
Speaker 0: you touch the building.

350
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,332
Speaker 0: you want to Go.

351
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,829
Speaker 1: cuz I move my hand way less with a mouse.

352
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:57,286
Speaker 1: I play a lot of sieve, but I came.

353
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,210
Speaker 0: where do you even put the mouse?

354
00:21:59,031 --> 00:21:59,534
Speaker 1: On the tray?

355
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:02,189
Speaker 1: cuz I fly premium economy and I get this giant ass seat to sit in.

356
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:04,661
Speaker 1: Also my laptop's tiny.

357
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,468
Speaker 1: they'll totally just fit.

358
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:08,290
Speaker 1: I Only need an inch in any given direction.

359
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:19,406
Speaker 1: But now I realize the thing came and I looked at it And I am NOT a hundred percent convinced that if I plug the tiny USB dongle that came with this thing into my computer That it's not just gonna malware me.

360
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:24,025
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna play with it cuz it's a to be as Chinese knockoff nonsense.

361
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:25,290
Speaker 0: plug it into some other computer.

362
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:42,390
Speaker 1: I'm gonna plug it into a computer and try to do some gonna poke around with it, but Really guys Anything that's an Internet of Things thing is probably Has on purpose back doors, and if it doesn't it almost definitely has not on purpose back door, right?

363
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,110
Speaker 0: I mean, it's perfectly fine to get something that is a computer, right?

364
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,790
Speaker 0: I mean like my rice cooker is a computer, but it's not the kind of computer that like runs software.

365
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:52,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't have Android or something on it, right?

366
00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:01,498
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not like a full operating system in there that can be and it doesn't have an internet connection that could be manipulated From afar or it doesn't need updates.

367
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:05,490
Speaker 0: Like it's like yeah, we want the functionality that's involved with those things, right?

368
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:18,024
Speaker 0: You know people talk about the refrigerator like you can check to see if you have eggs as a camera, you know stuff like that and those are useful features, but Those devices because they're running like this, you know, they're never updated.

369
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,147
Speaker 0: They're not maintained.

370
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,010
Speaker 0: You're not update.

371
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,434
Speaker 0: You know this.

372
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,090
Speaker 1: so it's even a more fundamental problem.

373
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:29,822
Speaker 1: Security is already an afterthought in most technology things Because you it's hard enough to keep your real computer secure.

374
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,270
Speaker 0: that's running Windows and is super maintained and up-to-date.

375
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:37,690
Speaker 0: How are you gonna take care of the security on your refrigerator unless the company that made the refrigerator is super on top of it?

376
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,413
Speaker 0: Which they aren't.

377
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:41,690
Speaker 1: and the reason they're not is because there's no money in that if you're doing a new thing.

378
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, we sold everyone a refrigerator to fancy features.

379
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:47,230
Speaker 0: What's the point of updating the software in their refrigerators?

380
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,974
Speaker 0: No one gives a fuck.

381
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,130
Speaker 1: you make money by adding a new feature.

382
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,065
Speaker 1: Like if they add a feature of your fridge you can put this out what you eat.

383
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:55,310
Speaker 0: you put that in a later model.

384
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,614
Speaker 0: There's no point updating the.

385
00:23:56,634 --> 00:24:01,410
Speaker 1: your fridge figures out what you eat and auto orders to keep your groceries refresh like forever.

386
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:02,735
Speaker 0: Sure, you don't need to add that to.

387
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,250
Speaker 0: people have already bought fridges and aren't gonna replace them for years and years and years.

388
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,330
Speaker 1: Well, no because you can make it a service you can still make money with it.

389
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,946
Speaker 0: My point is that if you get people to subscribe to their fridge, I know I'm knowing.

390
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:13,758
Speaker 1: way more fundamental.

391
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:19,611
Speaker 1: the problem is Providing that feature can make you money Sick.

392
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:29,810
Speaker 1: adding security to something cannot make you money because people don't give a shit and don't understand Making something secure cost way more than adding the feature.

393
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,050
Speaker 0: Also, it generally happens to a lot of these internet of things like your frigerators and whatnot.

394
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,936
Speaker 0: Is that this insecurity?

395
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:42,019
Speaker 0: somebody will basically take it over and turn it into a bot and it'll still do everything You thought it did perhaps slower.

396
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:47,594
Speaker 0: I know noticeably or unnoticeably But as far as you know You don't even realize that it's.

397
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:52,410
Speaker 0: it's like sending spam or trying to hack into stuff while it's also checking.

398
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,437
Speaker 1: Modern malware is not stupid.

399
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:56,323
Speaker 1: It's like a good virus in a person.

400
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,410
Speaker 1: a good virus in a person doesn't kill you immediately.

401
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,235
Speaker 0: It's like herpes.

402
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got a spread as far and wide as it can.

403
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,895
Speaker 0: It's like you don't have.

404
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:03,418
Speaker 0: you know.

405
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:04,645
Speaker 0: have the flu or you just die.

406
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:06,835
Speaker 0: You got herpes Yeah, and you can't.

407
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,679
Speaker 0: it's hard to get rid of.

408
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,626
Speaker 1: so I guess the moral is.

409
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:10,610
Speaker 1: anyone listening to the show?

410
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,774
Speaker 1: You probably already know.

411
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:20,650
Speaker 1: but no matter how great a feature sounds on any internet of things thing You got to be real fucking cynical about the security of those things.

412
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,192
Speaker 0: Basically don't plug anything into the internet unless it's something like that You take like.

413
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:28,224
Speaker 0: the only things I have that connect to the internet are actual computers.

414
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,690
Speaker 0: Nope phones and tablets.

415
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:31,456
Speaker 0: I don't connect anything else to the internet.

416
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,085
Speaker 1: I have what I have a nest camera.

417
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:35,370
Speaker 0: I have a live wedge.

418
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:40,230
Speaker 1: Yep, I do have a nice camera, which yes could be hacked or something, but I use it as a rabbit.

419
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I don't connect my camera.

420
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,344
Speaker 0: My camera could theoretically direct Directly connect to the internet and like upload straight to Flickr.

421
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:48,450
Speaker 0: I've never gotten it to work.

422
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,670
Speaker 0: I tried once but and I was like wait, why the fuck would I do?

423
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,210
Speaker 0: So I just connect it to my phone and do that, right?

424
00:25:56,551 --> 00:26:00,669
Speaker 1: Or like my sonos that you gave me that thing is not connected to the internet except you get its data.

425
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:03,607
Speaker 0: But actually that's the thing that has to be connected.

426
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:09,150
Speaker 0: the internet Yep, but I don't know if that actually is capable of like running services.

427
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,154
Speaker 1: Well, here's the difference.

428
00:26:10,274 --> 00:26:17,102
Speaker 1: The main thing is that that thing at least is not accessible from outside of my network Like the thing that controls.

429
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,330
Speaker 1: it connects locally.

430
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:19,376
Speaker 1: I can't control.

431
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,829
Speaker 1: I can't turn the thing on from outside of my house.

432
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:26,830
Speaker 1: It is one way unless my router lets something come back in or it does some tunneling.

433
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:32,910
Speaker 0: That is interesting that but you like the apps does connect like the sonos service and then send instructions down.

434
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,292
Speaker 0: I don't know.

435
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,570
Speaker 0: The thing is I don't know if the speaker itself can run services, right?

436
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,717
Speaker 0: Those are the things that to worry about.

437
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,715
Speaker 0: your TV has enough CPU and such that it could run services Whereas I don't think that speaker can.

438
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:51,030
Speaker 1: also things that connect to the internet or things that run a service that you can connect you from outside.

439
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,296
Speaker 1: Basically, you just got to know what the thing does.

440
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:59,321
Speaker 0: if you don't know if you don't know enough don't do it Alright, so next on this list of random.

441
00:26:59,361 --> 00:26:59,864
Speaker 0: So I got.

442
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:00,708
Speaker 0: I actually have a tech news.

443
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:01,210
Speaker 0: I'd have a link.

444
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,323
Speaker 0: I just remembered it cuz I read it this morning.

445
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:04,570
Speaker 1: Alright, let me find your tech news.

446
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,696
Speaker 1: I can put it in the list of links.

447
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,042
Speaker 0: So basically right?

448
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:08,590
Speaker 0: No one's making CRT's anymore.

449
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,357
Speaker 1: Oh that was on slash shot.

450
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:11,100
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

451
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,750
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't see it on slash that it's not somewhere else.

452
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,696
Speaker 0: So I don't need slash.

453
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:15,642
Speaker 0: that's got a telly.

454
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:16,830
Speaker 1: slash shot is the aggregator.

455
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:21,549
Speaker 0: Anyway, so no one's making CRT's anymore, right and you might want to make a CRT.

456
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,706
Speaker 1: You know, you still can what the death of CRT displays means for classic arcade machine.

457
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:26,328
Speaker 0: Yeah that one.

458
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:32,322
Speaker 0: Yeah Just cuz it's on slash that me you're saying.

459
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:34,350
Speaker 0: oh it's on slash that therefore slash that is good.

460
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:35,722
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's on other websites.

461
00:27:35,762 --> 00:27:42,370
Speaker 0: I don't need slash that Alright find another website that has the website where I saw it wherever it was cuz clearly I saw it and clearly I didn't read.

462
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:45,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, you told me that you couldn't find any tech news.

463
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,887
Speaker 1: No, obviously that website sucks at finding tech news.

464
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:53,817
Speaker 0: Anyway so No one's making CRT's.

465
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:55,504
Speaker 0: the all the CRT factories are closed.

466
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:56,810
Speaker 1: There's a separate story.

467
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:58,123
Speaker 1: Actually, I can I can turn this.

468
00:27:58,163 --> 00:27:58,789
Speaker 1: we get another news.

469
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:08,047
Speaker 0: anyway to make a CRT you need to wind the tube and it's this complicated process and Basically like no one who knows the people who are good at it.

470
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,493
Speaker 0: or yeah It's like no one can do this.

471
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:12,001
Speaker 0: basically the no one can like.

472
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:14,610
Speaker 0: the skill of doing this is almost lost completely.

473
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:28,418
Speaker 0: So right now there's a place that's like supplies for arcade machines and like they're all out of certain sizes of TV of CRT and when they run out, that's it You're gonna have to like.

474
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:35,228
Speaker 0: if you have a broken CRT you're gonna like need to find someone who will rewind the tube or something and you might not be able to find anyone.

475
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:41,338
Speaker 0: and basically, you know, you're gonna have to resort to just using an LCD and Losing the classic.

476
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,331
Speaker 0: how it's supposed to look and work function.

477
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:52,589
Speaker 0: already a lot of emulators have a lot of capabilities for Me to make it look like a CRT even though it's on an LCD.

478
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,111
Speaker 1: Well, like, you know drop every other scan line Like.

479
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:58,670
Speaker 1: there's a lot of ways you can make it look like it would have looked in the old days.

480
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,946
Speaker 1: But I have kind of a total counterpoint to that there.

481
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:06,810
Speaker 1: on one hand There's the idea that you want to recreate the experience of what those games were like and there is a purpose for that.

482
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:14,508
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we will be able to recreate that experience in museums even without CRT's with a combination of LCDs.

483
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:20,750
Speaker 0: or you know As long as we have a CR one CRT left to look at which we do right to copy how it affects.

484
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:23,389
Speaker 0: You know cuz like there's that little bit of burn in so you get the blur.

485
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:31,404
Speaker 1: There is also an argument to be made that a lot of those effects Were not desired by the people who made the games in the first place.

486
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,429
Speaker 1: They were just stuck with it.

487
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,277
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna talk.

488
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:37,490
Speaker 0: but also people took advantage of those effects to make games.

489
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,958
Speaker 0: Look, it's like Atari games racing the right.

490
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,529
Speaker 0: and if you make them if you just make them solid else like gun on the NES Yeah, I won't work on any modern thing.

491
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like yeah, even if you get an LCD and try to make it work, it won't work, right?

492
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:56,065
Speaker 0: We need CRT's to preserve certain experiences, but I'm confident we will eventually lose them all there are.

493
00:29:56,145 --> 00:30:05,172
Speaker 0: there are already efforts That have been going on for at least like 10 plus years to preserve video games and I'm sure and it's like, you know But like.

494
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:05,858
Speaker 1: here's a good example.

495
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:10,450
Speaker 1: when you preserve a film Ideally you go further and restore the film.

496
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:17,917
Speaker 1: So like removing film grain from ancient films with modern technology is actually a better Preservation than the original.

497
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:20,324
Speaker 0: but you're making it look like it was when it was new.

498
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,432
Speaker 0: the film grain is cuz he got busted And old.

499
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:24,745
Speaker 0: but CRT's that's what it looked like when it was new.

500
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:29,852
Speaker 1: Yep Don't degrade Here's a bet.

501
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,356
Speaker 1: Here's a weird like third way to look at.

502
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:41,689
Speaker 1: imagine taking imagine if we used algorithms to take old original vinyl recordings and Recreate the data that was lost by the fact that vinyl is garbage.

503
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:47,170
Speaker 0: We don't need to do that because the original oh you're talking about things that recorded directly to vinyl.

504
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:57,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in the old days, which is most music from a lot of eras of music people like I'm talking about I was thinking I thought about I was thinking about like music made in a studio that was just distributed on vinyl.

505
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,790
Speaker 0: Right, but the original recording was on like take, you know big old tape wheels.

506
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, well even then what it was removing is we have the tape reels.

507
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:12,730
Speaker 1: We don't need the removing the artifacts of the creation of old media to get a more true But less authentic experience.

508
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:16,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's an interesting world there.

509
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,310
Speaker 0: The point is we run out of CRT's right?

510
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,089
Speaker 0: Also, if you learn how to wind to CRT, which is I don't know where you're gonna learn this from.

511
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,064
Speaker 0: There's just YouTube videos, but I mean, it's not that easy.

512
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,350
Speaker 1: No series are paid today.

513
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:31,470
Speaker 1: So there was a separate story and I'm gonna look forward cuz I just won't link to it.

514
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:38,156
Speaker 0: You can make a business out of this basically and be the guy who takes care of that and charge each person who asks for A lot of money.

515
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:45,508
Speaker 1: You'll eventually be the old guy in the museum Who's like the wizard with the ancient technology right like every owner of the busted CRT will come to you.

516
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:50,698
Speaker 1: so TVs basically all of America.

517
00:31:50,758 --> 00:32:01,924
Speaker 1: America like everyone had TVs like in the 90s We had sort of like this peak TV and actually I saw an article saying that the number of televisions per home is Declining at a constant rate now.

518
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:02,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, you only need like one.

519
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:07,118
Speaker 1: Well in the old days like when I was a kid right like I almost In the living room.

520
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:11,710
Speaker 0: I almost thought about getting one in the bedroom on the wall So I could lay in bed, but it's like laying in bed with the iPad.

521
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,273
Speaker 0: It's just fine.

522
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:13,861
Speaker 1: So I was thinking about mounting.

523
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:25,869
Speaker 1: when I when I do the refresh of all these monitors I'm take this monitor put it here vertical get a new monitor to put here horizontal and take a third monitor and stick it there Because when the hockey games on Emily, I'll watch it there while we're both working on shit.

524
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:32,250
Speaker 1: You need more screen because the other solution is I'm streaming the pirate stream here and Emily's streaming the fire again.

525
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,297
Speaker 0: You're gonna pay that much for hockey.

526
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,581
Speaker 0: You could just pay for fucking cable.

527
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:43,410
Speaker 0: I'm not paying for cable and be cheaper than I refuse Even if it's the cheapest option you refuse on principle.

528
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,970
Speaker 1: The cheapest option is still way more expensive if you add up a few months.

529
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:53,536
Speaker 1: I'm just saying cuz I can't just most of the services to just pay for hockey won't show me Rangers games No, because you live in New York.

530
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:57,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could use a like a VPN deal and go outside, you know and then

531
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:15,169
Speaker 1: yeah, but that's way more of a pain than going to the pirate stream that you and I both use because it's but Basically peak TV, you know when I was a kid There was a CRT in my bedroom CRT in my brother's bedroom CRT in my parents bedroom Giant CRT in the living room and the old TV was in the family room.

532
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:18,263
Speaker 1: We yeah, we also had a black and white TV in the basement.

533
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,372
Speaker 1: We had to do an old VCR We had.

534
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:22,924
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, we increased our TVs over time.

535
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:29,123
Speaker 0: right in the earliest days All we had was one Tiny black and white TV in the dead and that was it.

536
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:31,010
Speaker 0: and then that one moved to the kitchen.

537
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:34,050
Speaker 0: We got a big old one in the day up and then my parents got one in there.

538
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:36,510
Speaker 0: You keep cascading and then we got one in our room.

539
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:40,250
Speaker 1: Actually, the youngest sibling is the second oldest TV and the oldest one is in the basement.

540
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:57,330
Speaker 0: but it's like we always had like a tiny TV in the kitchen that was pretty much only used for morning show while eating breakfast Jeopardy and then like world news whatever as during dinner and then the main TV and then a TV in every bedroom.

541
00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:58,394
Speaker 0: And that was it.

542
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:04,727
Speaker 0: but like other people that we knew had that many TVs plus one They would add one like in the basement area, right?

543
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,835
Speaker 0: Like basically double living room.

544
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:12,889
Speaker 1: We only had our basement one had a VCR and an Atari 2600 plugged into it in the basement.

545
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:23,465
Speaker 0: Mmm, I was actually we had a but nowadays you only need one because if you're not in you know The main room where every people are gathering and watching probably got a tablet.

546
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:28,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need one in the kitchen You don't need you anymore right because you got phones.

547
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:33,869
Speaker 0: you don't need one in your bedroom anymore You only need one in you know, the main main room.

548
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,850
Speaker 1: But anyway, the whole point of all that was that we hit peak TV in the 90s and now everyone replaced their screens with modern LCDs.

549
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,049
Speaker 1: What happened to all those TVs because they are really hard to deal with.

550
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:51,688
Speaker 0: If you go if you go like various like recycling and dump places, I usually in a pile.

551
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:51,788
Speaker 1: Yeah.

552
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:52,791
Speaker 1: Yeah They are.

553
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,777
Speaker 1: so they are all in piles.

554
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:55,880
Speaker 1: because basically what happened?

555
00:34:56,322 --> 00:35:09,954
Speaker 1: there was one company and there's a few other companies They're trying to this too that were buying either the rights to or the actual inventory of all those TVs Because they were studying how to safely recycle them and get you know Useful shit out of given

556
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,009
Speaker 0: to the arcade guys if they're the right size and shape but if they're not they don't want

557
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:13,110
Speaker 1: them.

558
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,761
Speaker 1: So they're TVs like, you know in living rooms.

559
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:23,456
Speaker 1: They're not that weird like the naked ones that were but anyway It turns out there is no economically viable way to recycle them.

560
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:27,149
Speaker 1: and now they're all in warehouses and that company's fucked and No one knows what to do.

561
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,950
Speaker 1: There's all these warehouses filled with millions and millions of these things and they're trying to buy so many.

562
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,010
Speaker 0: You could have just bought a few to figure out how to recycle because they were buying them for the pipeline.

563
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:40,149
Speaker 1: They're basically they were buying a futures contract to do this.

564
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:41,353
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I I would.

565
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:47,089
Speaker 0: I would buy a few like 10 and figure out how to do it first and then start buying a After I figured it out.

566
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:51,710
Speaker 1: So our friend Sean who actually promised us that he is not that guy and he gave me a really good reason as to why.

567
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,409
Speaker 1: They're all in an ally and an alley behind some shit town in Texas.

568
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:58,850
Speaker 1: But they're all actually in warehouses.

569
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:03,763
Speaker 1: They're in these warehouses and the warehouses are toxic waste dumps.

570
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,830
Speaker 1: now because they'll see it because CRT's are toxic.

571
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:07,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know why they're toxic?

572
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,219
Speaker 0: Because the paint on the inside of the tube.

573
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:20,529
Speaker 1: No, it's mostly because like a chemical coating on there There's the chemicals there's all the chemicals but there's also the fact that the glass has a huge amount of lead in it.

574
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:27,214
Speaker 1: That kind of glass has a lot of lead and because there's no good way to get the lead out The cost

575
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:28,218
Speaker 0: of the lead out

576
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:40,038
Speaker 1: and the cost of safely recycling them Basically destroyed any value in the rest of the components, but because they're toxic waste You can't just put them in a landfill.

577
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:41,162
Speaker 1: So now you're fucked.

578
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:41,884
Speaker 1: No one knows what to do.

579
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,490
Speaker 1: It's this giant crisis.

580
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:46,956
Speaker 0: Sure Can't think of what to do.

581
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:47,881
Speaker 1: They don't work.

582
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:48,988
Speaker 1: They're just TVs.

583
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:51,413
Speaker 0: Mmm, why don't you?

584
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,419
Speaker 0: they still watch TV right?

585
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,161
Speaker 0: some of them?

586
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:58,728
Speaker 0: Yeah give them to people like in the poorest places They don't even have any T on a TV.

587
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:01,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what would happen there?

588
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,856
Speaker 1: I think that would just be a scam.

589
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,636
Speaker 0: and if those poorest places would become landfills just give it to them for free if it Works.

590
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,399
Speaker 1: Yes Landfills that's what they would become plus works.

591
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,390
Speaker 1: what it's a TV from the 90s the fuck you gonna plug into it.

592
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:14,736
Speaker 0: They could broadcast TV.

593
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,825
Speaker 0: what analog broadcast TV will give them.

594
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:22,018
Speaker 1: Sega Genesis is also Alright moving right along on the tech news.

595
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,509
Speaker 1: There is a bill in Congress in the US called the active cyber defense certainty act.

596
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:34,421
Speaker 0: active cyber defense certainty ACD CA.

597
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:36,870
Speaker 0: All right This sound like a bad.

598
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,470
Speaker 0: I mean the Congress of the United States doesn't know shit about technology and it's a really it's in a bad state right now.

599
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:43,974
Speaker 0: Imagine as being good.

600
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the problem with our government?

601
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,750
Speaker 1: is that the problem with our government about the problems?

602
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:57,730
Speaker 1: Regarding technology is that independent of any bad decisions or Hitler inclinations that are given might have the people who run in government?

603
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,774
Speaker 0: Don't know shit about technology.

604
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:00,602
Speaker 1: No one in government knows anything about technology.

605
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:02,210
Speaker 1: I mean remember the CBD tPA.

606
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:05,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the CFAA From the 80s.

607
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:15,950
Speaker 1: this will amend that but one thing that it purports to do Which is an interesting concept and I want to talk about the concept instead of the specifics of the bill.

608
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,069
Speaker 0: Specifics you're not a lawyer.

609
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:25,310
Speaker 1: No Because even if I did I'm pretty confident that the bill probably has a lot of language about analog computers steam engines.

610
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:37,054
Speaker 1: It would grant the rights to victims of cyber attacks to engage in not merely passive countermeasures but active Countermeasures.

611
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,901
Speaker 0: so who counts as a victim?

612
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,709
Speaker 1: so say someone is.

613
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:50,088
Speaker 0: So here's here's an example if I have a Facebook account and somebody brute forces the password and logs into it Am I am I a victim or is Facebook a victim or both?

614
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,453
Speaker 0: Or not?

615
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:57,381
Speaker 1: an interesting question in and of itself in that in that aspect I would guess that Facebook would be the one who was able to return.

616
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,026
Speaker 0: so Facebook would be allowed to.

617
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,917
Speaker 0: if they were able to Do two ways this was happening.

618
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:05,510
Speaker 0: They could cyber attack the person who was attacking them legally.

619
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,576
Speaker 1: So so the proposal includes caveats.

620
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:18,204
Speaker 1: quote victims cannot take actions that destroy data on another person's computer Pause physical injury or create threats to public safety.

621
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,849
Speaker 0: Oh someone actually thought this through.

622
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:20,190
Speaker 0: good job.

623
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,216
Speaker 0: So I can't.

624
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:23,450
Speaker 0: but I thought you weren't gonna tie by the specifics of the law.

625
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:25,070
Speaker 0: But clearly someone was thinking about something.

626
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:32,829
Speaker 1: Well, cuz the act of countermeasures means say you're DDSing me and I find the IP address of your botnet I can DDS you back and it's legal.

627
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,299
Speaker 0: Wow, that's just great for the internet.

628
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,129
Speaker 0: just you know ball the bandwidth even more DDS.

629
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:38,938
Speaker 1: What's the alternative?

630
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,949
Speaker 1: if there's a serious attack against you though?

631
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 0: Go and find out where they are, what do you mean?

632
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,822
Speaker 1: where they are?

633
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:47,489
Speaker 1: So you're getting attacked by a DDS.

634
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,536
Speaker 1: There's millions of IPs coming at you.

635
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:49,897
Speaker 0: Yep.

636
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:53,810
Speaker 0: Well if I'm allowed to do countermeasures, I'm not allowed to destroy data, right?

637
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,520
Speaker 0: Yep, but I am allowed to strike back.

638
00:39:56,701 --> 00:40:00,597
Speaker 0: Yep, and you didn't really all you said were things I'm not allowed to do which is so far.

639
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:03,350
Speaker 0: It's not allowed public to public safety.

640
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,597
Speaker 0: You cannot bomb their building.

641
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:13,109
Speaker 1: I won't do that or cause physical injury physical injury to people Theorists, so I guess I could docks.

642
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:15,738
Speaker 1: That could be part of my active countermeasure.

643
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,323
Speaker 0: So I can't cause physical injury to people.

644
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:18,868
Speaker 0: I can't destroy data.

645
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:23,895
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, so I guess I could destroy Network connectivity, right?

646
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:25,241
Speaker 0: Well, here's what I would do right.

647
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:30,789
Speaker 0: I could for example if I find out You know, even if it's a DDoS computers all over the place, right?

648
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:37,251
Speaker 0: I could go to each and every place that this DDoS is coming from like let's say it's for coming from ten houses in the Neighborhood.

649
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:38,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know just theoretically right.

650
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:43,670
Speaker 0: go to each of those ten houses and just smash those computers, but not the hard drives.

651
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:50,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, just I won't destroy the data on the hard drives I'm just gonna smash their computer or cut their internet cable outside their head.

652
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:50,652
Speaker 1: Go to that.

653
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,185
Speaker 1: cut the cut the Fios cable and every house.

654
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:58,210
Speaker 0: I won't hurt any people I won't cause any public damage, but I can still bust into their house and smash their fucking computer.

655
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:07,742
Speaker 1: Anyway, because we got a lot of other tech news the I guess the question that we should answer right now is our active countermeasures Justifiable and are they and should?

656
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:08,728
Speaker 0: are they useful?

657
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:09,130
Speaker 0: is the real?

658
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:13,582
Speaker 0: If they're effective then yes, we should definitely make them leave.

659
00:41:13,622 --> 00:41:15,810
Speaker 1: I've actually always been an advocate of countermeasures.

660
00:41:16,051 --> 00:41:20,530
Speaker 0: I think it depends on depending on the attack and the you know, what's going on?

661
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:26,210
Speaker 0: They may actually just cause more harm like fighting a DDS of the DDS just hurts the whole internet doesn't right?

662
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,351
Speaker 0: It's?

663
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:27,054
Speaker 0: you're not really?

664
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,339
Speaker 1: but imagine and are you really?

665
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,950
Speaker 0: is that gonna discourage people from DDS thing?

666
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,390
Speaker 1: I don't think here's a better example say someone hacks into my network at work.

667
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,989
Speaker 1: I'm at work do my thing and the the IDS goes off and we find out someone SSH is in who wasn't supposed to.

668
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:43,777
Speaker 1: someone has Hacked in or networking of some shit.

669
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:45,989
Speaker 1: All right, I can hack them back.

670
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,429
Speaker 1: Hmm I think that's totally fine.

671
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:53,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's that I would argue that kind of thing I I because and only they'll get in trouble.

672
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:59,909
Speaker 1: see I mean in the real world Like I do believe you can you submit the evidence in court after you hack into them?

673
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,216
Speaker 1: So here's the thing in the real world.

674
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:07,530
Speaker 1: if I believe that people have a basic right to self-defense in that But it must be proportional.

675
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:12,530
Speaker 1: So like if someone punches me and I can't get like I can you shoot them in the face with a gun?

676
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:20,186
Speaker 1: Now if they were trying to kill I bet you can't use lethal force unless you think Like there is a real danger of you know, similar force being used.

677
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:25,190
Speaker 1: proportional response I feel like because humans are not physically in danger.

678
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:30,430
Speaker 1: The proportional responses can be much greater in cyberspace.

679
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:36,570
Speaker 0: I think that this kind of law is the kind of thing where like it won't matter too much.

680
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:44,648
Speaker 0: What's gonna matter a whole bunch is when we actually have a cyberpunk dystopia and you're in cyberspace And it's like someone's actually ghost in the shelling you you can.

681
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:46,495
Speaker 0: it goes well this matter a lot too.

682
00:42:46,836 --> 00:43:00,222
Speaker 1: when say Google runs some Internet of Things thing and Say that Internet of Things thing gets attacked by some shadier Internet of Things things Google can fucking shut that botnet down.

683
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:00,844
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

684
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:02,410
Speaker 1: I think that's fine.

685
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:07,211
Speaker 1: All right, let's move on to So.

686
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:15,175
Speaker 1: the FCC wants carriers to block robocalls from sprucing spoof numbers, I thought he hated regulation, mr Pie, he didn't like.

687
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:17,765
Speaker 0: he didn't like regulation, but now he's regulating what's going on, man.

688
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:18,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's going on?

689
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,521
Speaker 0: So this doesn't seem like you guys sticking to your principles there.

690
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,405
Speaker 0: Oh, I did.

691
00:43:22,826 --> 00:43:23,550
Speaker 1: Oh, it's almost like.

692
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:25,670
Speaker 0: It's almost like you don't have any principles.

693
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:31,050
Speaker 1: Get money, but you this is a problem that for some reason I don't experience.

694
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:35,676
Speaker 1: I think it's just because my phone number is like way upstate and Like.

695
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:39,610
Speaker 1: it's real old and not that many people have it, but I don't get robocalls ever.

696
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,745
Speaker 0: I've gotten actually more lately.

697
00:43:44,711 --> 00:43:46,922
Speaker 1: Everyone I know has been the internet like.

698
00:43:46,942 --> 00:43:47,786
Speaker 1: this is a problem.

699
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,312
Speaker 0: phone numbers I think I like.

700
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:53,730
Speaker 0: it's only been like like this year and late last year that suddenly I've gotten a bunch.

701
00:43:53,851 --> 00:44:05,537
Speaker 1: But actually it's because if phones get used less It is easier to Purchase in bulk abilities to send phone calls Through various exchanges.

702
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:10,505
Speaker 0: The other thing is that what I've been doing is when I pick up the phone for some unknown number I don't say anything.

703
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:17,984
Speaker 0: Nope I don't even say hello and then I hear that it's quiet and no one's saying anything and I'm like aha I got you and then hang up but my Google Voice number.

704
00:44:18,085 --> 00:44:19,250
Speaker 1: I turned on the Google spam stuff.

705
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,442
Speaker 1: But the problem is email.

706
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:34,777
Speaker 1: at the same problem the phone numbers are getting the problem that email got in its like middling early days and email solved it by Super aggressive spam filters, but you can't spam filter a normal landline or cell number Like.

707
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,988
Speaker 1: there's no easy way to do that.

708
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:44,630
Speaker 1: So people can't defend themselves and yet you can't just turn off your phone number Because you still need phone numbers for stuff in the real world.

709
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,970
Speaker 0: I think the phone company should be you know, whatever phone company you have.

710
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:55,146
Speaker 0: So my case like Verizon Wireless, right what they should be doing is basically Whitelisting and blacklisting phone numbers on a global level.

711
00:44:55,207 --> 00:45:05,310
Speaker 0: Yes, right It's like they should basically if a brand if a phone number tries to call anyone with a Verizon fellow cell phone For example, and that phone number has never called a Verizon cell phone ever.

712
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:09,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, then they shouldn't let that call go through period right?

713
00:45:09,346 --> 00:45:16,990
Speaker 0: Even if it's a real person They should have a Verizon operator or Verizon computer pick up and see what happens on that phone call.

714
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,415
Speaker 0: Does it say anything?

715
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:18,997
Speaker 0: Is it like a?

716
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:31,050
Speaker 0: you know, someone's saying hello phones need to do what emails did I mean, it's like prove that you're a real person making calls and then alright We're gonna allow this number to call people on Verizon and then you can start calling.

717
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:37,810
Speaker 1: Well like those honeypot email addresses in the old days put a honeypot email out and if there's even if anyone emails it Ban that domain forever, right?

718
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,670
Speaker 0: And if there's even one robo call for that number up that number is just gone forever can never make a phone call to anyone.

719
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,696
Speaker 0: Verizon ever again the end.

720
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:44,159
Speaker 0: Yep.

721
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,090
Speaker 1: The problem is we don't have any of these tools.

722
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:46,754
Speaker 1: The phone companies.

723
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:49,390
Speaker 1: don't give a shit and look at this rule.

724
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,624
Speaker 0: You can report spam texts really easily, but you can't report much.

725
00:45:52,644 --> 00:45:54,090
Speaker 0: you can't report robo calls.

726
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:56,542
Speaker 1: So the all the rules would allow.

727
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:57,828
Speaker 1: this is how bad it is.

728
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:10,779
Speaker 1: They're not allowed to block phone calls Generally, yeah, all this rule would allow is for them to block phone calls where the caller ID is obviously spoofed Mm-hmm because caller ID is Trivial to spoof.

729
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:12,268
Speaker 1: it has been from the beginning.

730
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:15,661
Speaker 1: Yep There is a sort of real caller ID, but you don't have access to that.

731
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:20,146
Speaker 1: No, so, uh, yeah, I This is one of those rules.

732
00:46:20,956 --> 00:46:27,848
Speaker 0: If I get a spam text I can basically copy and paste that text and send it to text it to Verizon at this number.

733
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:30,403
Speaker 0: the spam number it's whatever number is SP a.m.

734
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:31,934
Speaker 0: and They go.

735
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,049
Speaker 0: Oh, we got a spam text and then they shut that shit down.

736
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:42,035
Speaker 0: But there's no way for me to like if I get a robo call for me to send that phone number to Verizon and say Hey, this was a robo call.

737
00:46:42,356 --> 00:46:43,119
Speaker 0: Why don't they have that?

738
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,046
Speaker 0: I can't report spam on a robo call.

739
00:46:45,087 --> 00:46:45,829
Speaker 0: Why isn't that a thing?

740
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,064
Speaker 1: Partly because the rules prevent them from doing a lot of things.

741
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I can report spam on a text.

742
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:56,923
Speaker 0: I should be able to report spam on a call You know and then it that should be like they can collect that data.

743
00:46:56,943 --> 00:47:01,670
Speaker 0: when people report spam on calls They could just be a report spam button in the phone app on your phone.

744
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,536
Speaker 1: I think the what's gonna happen.

745
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:17,519
Speaker 1: my guess is that by the time there is in any regulation That will solve this problem phone numbers will no longer be in common use probably kind of like how the volume on Advertisements was only recently dealt with on TV.

746
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,184
Speaker 1: It's gonna be the same thing.

747
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:19,545
Speaker 1: Hmm.

748
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:21,490
Speaker 1: Wow, this shows been going on for a while.

749
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,694
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm gonna get through all these newses.

750
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,978
Speaker 0: All right, good.

751
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:31,446
Speaker 1: Uber has been using a secret program Grayballing to identify the name of the program is great.

752
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:35,046
Speaker 0: So so Or is grayballing a thing that I don't know what it is?

753
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:36,713
Speaker 1: grayballing is a thing What's grayballing?

754
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,298
Speaker 1: so, you know blackballing right?

755
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:39,442
Speaker 1: you blackball someone?

756
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just don't let them.

757
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:43,890
Speaker 0: you know It's like you'll never work in this town again.

758
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:49,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, blackballing is when you were put on a semi official or at least like reasonably agreed-upon.

759
00:47:49,590 --> 00:48:01,189
Speaker 0: Right, so like I fire you from my restaurant But now none of the restaurants in town are hiring you it and they refuse to because you've been blackballed by the whole Cartel like fan conventions, like if you pull some shenanigans at a con that I work at.

760
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:03,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not going to any con ever.

761
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a blackball list.

762
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:08,670
Speaker 1: all the people who run conventions share the names of people who are bad news.

763
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,342
Speaker 1: We have a list that we pass around.

764
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:10,483
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

765
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:23,149
Speaker 1: So grayballing is when you basically do that sort of thing With data or you basically you set up some sort of like soft or deniable way around it.

766
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:25,905
Speaker 1: The way you uber was doing it is.

767
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:26,790
Speaker 1: it's a concrete example.

768
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,233
Speaker 0: Are they trying?

769
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:27,997
Speaker 0: were they trying to black?

770
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:30,250
Speaker 0: they were trying to customers or drivers?

771
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:38,830
Speaker 1: They were trying to prevent law enforcement and regulators from Getting uber to work in places where uber is banned.

772
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:41,315
Speaker 1: So they would figure out.

773
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:45,430
Speaker 0: so if you were in a banned place where uber is not allowed to you were a normal person.

774
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:47,050
Speaker 1: They totally let you hail an uber.

775
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:54,437
Speaker 1: But if they figured out that you were probably a regulator or an investigator the uber would say sorry We can't come and pick you up in this area.

776
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:57,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, the uber would basically say yeah, there's no one driving in this town.

777
00:48:57,632 --> 00:49:01,133
Speaker 1: sorry, dude, hmm and They got caught.

778
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:10,066
Speaker 1: finally and a quote uber is using a tool called gray ball To work to identify requests made by certain users and denied them service.

779
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:13,534
Speaker 1: according to the report They basically.

780
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:26,549
Speaker 1: the service was ostensibly to prevent people who have harmed uber users or actually worked for their Competitors and we're trying to harm their network, but they realized they could pretty trivially figure out who was trying to regulate them.

781
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:28,838
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

782
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:32,330
Speaker 0: I mean all these taxi companies even lyft and whatever.

783
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,495
Speaker 0: They're all bad.

784
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,650
Speaker 0: all of them and over is just the worst by a million.

785
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:45,339
Speaker 1: Cabs are great cabs are also shitty, but these services are Dangerous to the health of basic economic forces.

786
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:45,761
Speaker 0: Yeah.

787
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:57,737
Speaker 0: I mean there's a bunch of rules that cabs have to follow right and basically uber and all these other people can run their business only works because they're ignoring all these regulations and the Enforcement hasn't cracked.

788
00:49:57,757 --> 00:50:00,830
Speaker 0: like if you wanted to they could just like arrest everyone driving an uber.

789
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:05,197
Speaker 0: They could because they're all breaking the law by not, you know There's certain things that cab has to do.

790
00:50:05,277 --> 00:50:07,707
Speaker 0: it has to pick you up if you right if you wanted to.

791
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:09,354
Speaker 0: it has to take You where you want to go.

792
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,710
Speaker 0: it has to charge a certain rate and that rate never changes no matter what?

793
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,687
Speaker 0: you know if it changes it changes for all the cabs at once and it's a big fucking deal.

794
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:19,966
Speaker 0: and Basically the ubers and lifts and all these they just ignore all those rules.

795
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:20,529
Speaker 0: They don't have to pick up.

796
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,302
Speaker 0: They can't get in trouble for not picking up handicapped people.

797
00:50:23,322 --> 00:50:25,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like all these kinds of rules They're just ignoring.

798
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:28,270
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, if I ignore all the rules I could open up a restaurant.

799
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, I won't let the health inspector in I'll just put out poison food.

800
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:31,884
Speaker 0: I'll make it.

801
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:33,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll just load it up with sugar.

802
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:37,764
Speaker 1: They're also mostly being subsidized by venture capital, which is the only reason why they're even that cheap.

803
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:41,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not even making profits They're just you know, someone else is paying.

804
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:42,748
Speaker 1: so so yeah.

805
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:54,990
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is that that's an interesting problem in the modern era that semi-regulated industries can Basically use data to figure out who the cops are and not let the cops into the club.

806
00:50:55,311 --> 00:51:00,064
Speaker 0: Not once have I ever taken an uber or lyft or anything and nor will I.

807
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:06,730
Speaker 1: I rode in an uber that someone else hailed Once cuz I was on a work trip, but I refused to hell one and I won't use it when I travel on my own.

808
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:09,039
Speaker 0: No, I'll just get a real cab wherever I am.

809
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,990
Speaker 0: Even if it's more money or a hat or a hassle or whatever.

810
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,380
Speaker 1: alright That Amazon outage.

811
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:16,670
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a big one.

812
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:24,061
Speaker 1: Yeah That affected me but only indirectly because yeah like oh no Some of my storage first like some UAT environments wasn't working.

813
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:31,170
Speaker 1: I can live but it affected Atlassian Which I use for a lot of ticketing and documentation and stuff.

814
00:51:31,552 --> 00:51:34,530
Speaker 1: So some of my stuff was unavailable or slow for a while anyway.

815
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:40,446
Speaker 0: So basically Amazon is what one of Amazon's many web services s3, which is storage, right?

816
00:51:40,786 --> 00:51:42,110
Speaker 0: See store things there.

817
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:46,348
Speaker 0: It's like a infinite hard drive and you can make as many as you want and they don't cost a lot of money.

818
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:47,447
Speaker 0: geek nights Is backed up there?

819
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:54,690
Speaker 0: And they didn't lose any data cuz it's like super guaranteed not to lose data and that's pretty well guaranteed.

820
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:57,699
Speaker 0: But it was down and inaccessible for quite a while.

821
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:07,130
Speaker 0: and because so many other services relied on it those services in turn Went down or had issues Including the Amazon the I mean the Amazon status page.

822
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:11,925
Speaker 0: It could it couldn't tell you that s3 was down because all the green and red check marks were stored at s3.

823
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:16,698
Speaker 0: Yeah Also that Amazon status page has always been shitty.

824
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:23,703
Speaker 0: it never updates fast enough like they'll be down and it'll have all green check marks Yep, and then like it'll show red when it only came back up.

825
00:52:23,743 --> 00:52:30,290
Speaker 0: No and then our an hour later It'll have like a yellow check mark saying oh, we're good and it's like this should have just down hard and it's like.

826
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:37,709
Speaker 0: It's like I would have put that red check mark up like an hour ago, and they went to yellow after you know anyway.

827
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:44,013
Speaker 0: so basically the reason it happened is because someone was typing in some commands and they took down.

828
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:51,308
Speaker 0: they were taking down some servers to update them or whatever and they took down too many and then they had to restart and the restart took too long.

829
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:58,664
Speaker 1: and so on one hand The reality of technology is people are gonna make mistakes like that.

830
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:00,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you cannot prevent them.

831
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,916
Speaker 1: They will always happen.

832
00:53:02,398 --> 00:53:08,750
Speaker 1: You're measured by how well you plan for Mistakes that are difficult to plan for and how well you recover from them.

833
00:53:09,072 --> 00:53:18,430
Speaker 0: The most interesting thing was basically there was a Subsystem of s3 and they took down too many servers in that subsystem at once and that'll cause the failure.

834
00:53:18,932 --> 00:53:22,610
Speaker 0: They said in there, you know post whatever like the oops.

835
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:34,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've written a lot of those in my life and it's basically said we're putting in a new system that basically looks at all the subsystems and Always keeps them at a minimum number of servers up.

836
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,030
Speaker 1: That is a very good kind of change.

837
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:46,730
Speaker 0: So like even if you type the wrong thing and say like turn off all servers in the subsystem It'll only turn off so many and won't refuse to turn off any more because that would bring it down.

838
00:53:47,051 --> 00:53:49,381
Speaker 1: That is exactly the right kind of response to that kind of.

839
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:52,094
Speaker 0: so I'm like, oh, that's pretty clever I should do that

840
00:53:52,375 --> 00:54:02,563
Speaker 1: that you've got actually part of my job for my whole life Not just now but every company I've worked for except one that that one was shitty is doing you know qualitative risk analysis and that kind of stuff.

841
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:08,706
Speaker 1: and one of those things is When there's a problem, I would get the report that is like here's what went down.

842
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:15,310
Speaker 1: Here's the root cause Here's the effects and I would just sit down with a group of people and try to come up with clever ways.

843
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,635
Speaker 0: That's exactly what they did.

844
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:17,981
Speaker 0: That's how tech business works.

845
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:18,563
Speaker 0: It's like oops.

846
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:19,507
Speaker 0: We had an oops guys.

847
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,612
Speaker 0: All right fix the oops Oh my god.

848
00:54:20,652 --> 00:54:21,335
Speaker 0: Okay, you fixed it.

849
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:21,576
Speaker 0: Good.

850
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:27,599
Speaker 1: All right, baby's first mistake would be to lock down Access to those commands and all that kind of.

851
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:28,000
Speaker 0: now I know.

852
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,410
Speaker 0: and then they have a meeting and like what how did we oops?

853
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:34,040
Speaker 0: Alright, how do we prevent this oops from happening again?

854
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,103
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

855
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:36,187
Speaker 0: Oh good idea.

856
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:36,668
Speaker 0: Let's do that.

857
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:37,030
Speaker 0: done it.

858
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:38,254
Speaker 0: That's how you go.

859
00:54:38,435 --> 00:54:39,740
Speaker 0: Yep, and they do that.

860
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,089
Speaker 0: but one time also the whole internet was done.

861
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:44,601
Speaker 1: So one time there's a long time ago.

862
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:49,725
Speaker 1: I was doing like this early morning thing We had a new server up and that server just handled all our monitoring.

863
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,890
Speaker 1: It was like the monitoring server.

864
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:52,326
Speaker 1: It was a brand new ish.

865
00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:00,450
Speaker 1: we had the old monitoring server that we shut down because we'd moved to the new and the new ones up and The server was new and something was not working a hundred percent, right?

866
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,189
Speaker 1: I was gonna set up some monitoring for thing didn't work.

867
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:20,487
Speaker 1: So I start tighten type in shown and some stuff Because I'm changing the ownership of some files to do a thing and I type forward slash and I'm about to type the full Absolute path to a thing and I end up just flubbing it and it starts chowing the entire computer.

868
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:22,694
Speaker 0: Mmm Load the backup.

869
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:23,597
Speaker 1: Yep.

870
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:26,990
Speaker 1: Well, so load the backup would not happen quickly.

871
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,037
Speaker 1: No for obvious reasons.

872
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:30,402
Speaker 0: You have more than one computer.

873
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:32,750
Speaker 0: Why is any system just one computer?

874
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,221
Speaker 1: Well, so it's one computer per data set.

875
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:36,729
Speaker 1: There's a to explain.

876
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:38,918
Speaker 0: Basically, you know redundancy.

877
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:40,846
Speaker 1: So there's there was tons of redundancy.

878
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:46,425
Speaker 1: Okay, however Basically, it happened so quick that I couldn't you know you it's.

879
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:47,830
Speaker 0: it's like a nuclear redundancy.

880
00:55:48,252 --> 00:55:52,789
Speaker 0: Just turn that computer off and unplug it and then well, it's another one will take over different levels.

881
00:55:52,829 --> 00:56:04,310
Speaker 1: redundant You know, you always have your time to recovery and like all the different metrics Not every system needs an immediate time to recovery like immediate come back online Like if I mess up a web server, which has never happened.

882
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:09,912
Speaker 0: But if it did I would probably just shut it down and then remove it from the load balancer and then make a brand new One.

883
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:16,210
Speaker 1: Yep, if I needed that Yeah, any any sort of like redundant load balance systems if anything goes wrong kill it.

884
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:19,381
Speaker 1: In fact, there's a if you're doing like high availability stuff.

885
00:56:19,602 --> 00:56:21,790
Speaker 1: There's an acronym Stonyth, you know Stonyth?

886
00:56:23,052 --> 00:56:24,859
Speaker 1: No, shoot the other node in the head.

887
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:40,586
Speaker 1: The idea is if you have a replication pair and There is any ambiguity as to whether or not you should fail over when in doubt Fail over and fucking shut down the other one no matter what state it's in to guarantee.

888
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:44,015
Speaker 1: There's only one head node Stonyth, okay.

889
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,387
Speaker 1: I think we do one more news and then we've got an hour.

890
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:51,161
Speaker 1: So, let's see Let's see, we could do the loneliness thing we could do.

891
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:54,774
Speaker 1: Oh, this is an interesting one Let's see.

892
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:55,701
Speaker 1: We can talk about Russia.

893
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:56,508
Speaker 1: What do you want to talk about?

894
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:01,584
Speaker 0: Streaming asides have more subscribers anything but so just pick something a fast-food mess.

895
00:57:01,624 --> 00:57:05,747
Speaker 1: restaurants are actually getting the robots now robots delivering groceries.

896
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:07,416
Speaker 1: The FBI does.

897
00:57:07,637 --> 00:57:08,000
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

898
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,623
Speaker 1: Let's do this one.

899
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:12,942
Speaker 1: the FBI Dismissed a child porn case that it was doing.

900
00:57:13,585 --> 00:57:14,309
Speaker 1: you want to know why?

901
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,929
Speaker 0: Because so they found someone who was actually child porn pedo Yep.

902
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,014
Speaker 0: And they were gonna.

903
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:23,146
Speaker 0: they brought him to court and said you pedo we're gonna put you in jail pedo man.

904
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:23,929
Speaker 1: the court.

905
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,760
Speaker 0: and then They said you know what actually pedo man you go free.

906
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,170
Speaker 0: So the why the fuck would they do that?

907
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,575
Speaker 0: Also, who's the pedo man?

908
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:31,339
Speaker 0: Let's go mess him up.

909
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:35,094
Speaker 0: So in the court case, right the court, of course He committed a cyber crime.

910
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:38,970
Speaker 1: We can retaliate needs evidence about the custody of the information, you know.

911
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,896
Speaker 1: How did they get the information?

912
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:40,519
Speaker 1: How'd you get this guy?

913
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,752
Speaker 0: You know, uh, he went to this He.

914
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:44,440
Speaker 0: we've set up a fake child porn website.

915
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,510
Speaker 1: trials have to be fair, right?

916
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,427
Speaker 1: Do you agree that in the court system the trial has to be fair?

917
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:49,688
Speaker 1: how?

918
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:58,250
Speaker 1: yeah So in the course of the trial the court wanted to find out how they got this data from this tour?

919
00:57:58,351 --> 00:57:58,814
Speaker 1: No, didn't?

920
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:04,964
Speaker 0: they just like oh, oh there was a tour node That's really a porn guy was using tour because he's smart.

921
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:05,807
Speaker 0: So they didn't.

922
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:06,690
Speaker 1: I'm assuming it's a key.

923
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:07,684
Speaker 1: It's almost always a dude.

924
00:58:07,704 --> 00:58:08,110
Speaker 0: It's all right.

925
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,905
Speaker 0: So they didn't like go to the dude's house and find child porn on his computer.

926
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:11,609
Speaker 1: So they caught him.

927
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:12,354
Speaker 1: They did.

928
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:25,570
Speaker 1: well, I'm not gonna the whole deal's a story but essentially the court was like you got to tell us how you got this evidence and the FBI was like No, because if I tell you then they'll fix this exploit we know about in tour.

929
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:29,566
Speaker 0: So they dropped the case instead and just let the child porn guy go this.

930
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,870
Speaker 1: Yes, because otherwise they would give up their tour exploit.

931
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,910
Speaker 1: So the takeaways are the FBI has a tour exploit that's still in the wild.

932
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:41,584
Speaker 0: Well now that everyone knows this aren't all the child porn people gonna stop using tour?

933
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:43,010
Speaker 1: and then what else they're gonna use?

934
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:46,370
Speaker 0: I mean is aren't there other orders real good?

935
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:47,990
Speaker 0: I don't know how good it is.

936
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:56,482
Speaker 0: I've never really trusted it because basically the way tour works is like people set up these tour nodes and you're basically doing like there's a multiple VPN situation.

937
00:58:56,543 --> 00:59:02,810
Speaker 0: effectively, right and You know, it's like encrypted and anonymous other than you know from the tour node to you.

938
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,703
Speaker 0: But it's like any tour node that's compromised can give you away.

939
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:12,370
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it depends To you have to trust the tour node that so that it won't fuck you.

940
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:16,384
Speaker 0: Oh, we could do a whole show on tour and I basically don't trust and it.

941
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:17,227
Speaker 0: but it's like I don't need.

942
00:59:17,548 --> 00:59:21,599
Speaker 1: I'm not doing child Poor if it's working correctly seems to work well.

943
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:28,181
Speaker 1: and but for this exploit, I don't think the FBI could have gotten this guy Mmm, but at the same time I'm not using tour.

944
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:30,269
Speaker 1: All right, so Scott, here's a question for you.

945
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:36,810
Speaker 1: If they fix this exploit and the CP guys are totally gonna get away with it, is that fine?

946
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:49,170
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean that argument comes down to if there is good encryption good If good deniable encryption is within the reach of normal people child porn shitheads are gonna get away with their shit.

947
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:50,127
Speaker 1: What do we do about that?

948
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:51,792
Speaker 0: Really?

949
00:59:51,812 --> 00:59:57,068
Speaker 0: I mean the main thing should be focusing on the people who actually are hurting the children.

950
00:59:57,088 --> 00:59:59,676
Speaker 0: Yep, right It's like I think we should arrest them first.

951
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:01,502
Speaker 0: and the guy who's just you're.

952
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:08,690
Speaker 0: so I want to arrest the guy who's downloading Picks too, but let's just get the guy who's actually, you know taking the pics first.

953
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,753
Speaker 1: So what are the guys taking?

954
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:14,970
Speaker 0: I feel like the FBI, you know goes to the low-hanging fruit of the people downloading the pics first.

955
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:15,833
Speaker 0: Right.

956
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:20,970
Speaker 0: Yep, and regardless it's like as much as that sucks that you know.

957
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,482
Speaker 0: There's a technology that lets you get away with crime.

958
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:28,141
Speaker 0: It's like yeah Well, it sucks at this gravity too that prevents you from flying.

959
01:00:28,242 --> 01:00:29,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's just reality.

960
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,530
Speaker 0: You just have to accept it.

961
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:34,004
Speaker 0: You can't fight reality if encryption exists and these things can be done.

962
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:41,030
Speaker 0: You can't like Outlaw gravity and something everyone flies can't put clipper chips and all our technology, right?

963
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:41,615
Speaker 0: It's like it.

964
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:44,834
Speaker 0: reality is reality Laws don't change it.

965
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:47,742
Speaker 0: You have to deal with reality in the best way possible.

966
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,690
Speaker 0: Even if reality makes things not happy.

967
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:54,790
Speaker 1: And I guess that's enough tech news for a tech news roundup.

968
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,550
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

969
