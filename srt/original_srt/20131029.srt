1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,256
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, October 29th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:10,657
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:11,519
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,722
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:20,699
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about Burning Con 5?

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,721
Speaker 0: Pentec or whatever?

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,005
Speaker 0: The most recent Burning Con.

8
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,350
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,007
Speaker 0: Little late getting going on the show tonight due to a jackass.

10
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:49,217
Speaker 0: Because it's live and people live here long enough and use the subway enough, you'll start to recognize that they tend to be very circumspect and/or generic when they announce why there's a problem on the subway.

11
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,564
Speaker 0: They'll say, "Train traffic ahead of

12
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:51,826
Speaker 0: us."

13
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:54,637
Speaker 0: Or, "Due to an incident at another

14
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:55,099
Speaker 0: station."

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,343
Speaker 0: Or, "A police

16
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,286
Speaker 0: investigation.".

17
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:07,219
Speaker 0: But occasionally, you'll have the person who either is new, or angry, or fed up, or has a sense of humor who will tell you what actually went down.

18
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,404
Speaker 0: And today, that happened to me.

19
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:14,848
Speaker 0: Took me like an hour to get home, but I'm going to get on the subway, and I take the 45 up to Grand Central.

20
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:21,919
Speaker 0: And I go down, and when you walk down the subway stairs, you see a huge crowd, which is usually a warning sign that something's fucked up.

21
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:26,040
Speaker 1: Well, a larger crowd than usual for that time and place.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,831
Speaker 0: When I say large crowd, I mean a newly large crowd.

23
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:33,149
Speaker 0: Not the expected thousand people, but more than a thousand people on the platform.

24
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:42,580
Speaker 0: So I kind of fight my way down there, and I look around, and then the thing must have just happened, because there's an announcement, and a train comes back into the station on the other track.

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,284
Speaker 1: Backwards?

26
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:45,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is always... Yeah, trains.

27
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:46,328
Speaker 0: So an announcement comes on.

28
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:48,420
Speaker 1: The only thing worse than that is the garbage train.

29
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:53,419
Speaker 0: Oh my God, the garbage train is the scariest thing, especially if you don't expect it.

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,169
Speaker 0: It's like seeing a skeleton when you didn't expect to see a skeleton.

31
00:01:57,474 --> 00:02:05,347
Speaker 0: So the train comes back, and then they make an announcement that seven trains are all holding in station, which is kind of...

32
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:09,139
Speaker 1: Not seven trains, but the trains with the number seven on them.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,197
Speaker 0: Yes, the seven trains in New York City, the seventh line.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,659
Speaker 1: It's not like the eighth train got passed.

35
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:34,405
Speaker 0: So then another person comes on and says, and I'm paraphrasing here, "Due to a jackass on the tracks, all seven train service is suspended while the police go try to a police investigation at Fifth

36
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:34,887
Speaker 0: Avenue.".

37
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:43,456
Speaker 0: As best I can tell, someone got into some sort of altercation, and then jumped down on the tracks and ran off into the tunnels.

38
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:47,648
Speaker 0: So they cut the power so the police could go chase this guy.

39
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:58,201
Speaker 0: I don't know if that was resolved, but simultaneously they start announcing that passengers would be advised to go take the N, Q, R, or E service to Queens.

40
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:08,071
Speaker 0: And yeah, it turns out the E was not running due to an unrelated problem, and the R was not fully running to an unrelated problem.

41
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:18,143
Speaker 0: What this meant was that there were only two trains that go where I wanted to go, and tens of thousands of people per half hour who want to go in the same direction.

42
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:33,694
Speaker 0: So imagine the tunnels that have the stairways that go to all these subways in Grand Central, so full of people that you literally cannot move, because people are trying to go in both directions, and the news is not quite disseminated yet.

43
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:46,262
Speaker 0: So a wall of people trying to get on the 7 confronted with a wall of people trying to get away from the 7, and then a wall of people trying to get back to the 7 after being told the E wasn't running, not aware that the 7 is also not running.

44
00:03:47,165 --> 00:04:01,126
Speaker 0: Long story short, I climbed the side of a stairwell, like on the railings, to get past a crowd and shimmied my way up an escalator on the edge to shove my way onto an N train, and that's how I got home.

45
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,970
Speaker 0: I was very proud that I made it home, because the crowds behind me were immense and starting to get smelly.

46
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:20,959
Speaker 0: Also, bonus points for jackass playing music so loud on the 59th street N platform that no one could hear the announcements, and extra bonus points for the old lady who starts yelling at him to shut up with his goddamn music.

47
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,025
Speaker 0: So that was my commute home.

48
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,895
Speaker 0: That's my openy bit on Geek Nights.

49
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,244
Speaker 1: I also took the NQ and it just went straight here.

50
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:32,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, the NQ was just running, like there wasn't anything wrong with it.

51
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,985
Speaker 1: No extra crowd, no problem.

52
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:38,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, the issues were all on the other trains, and it takes a while for things to cascade out.

53
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,455
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's Tuesday, we're back from Burning Con.

54
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:44,778
Speaker 1: Burn it up.

55
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, a non-hurricane interrupted Burning Con for once.

56
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:56,577
Speaker 1: Did you know that, speaking of trains, did you know that today the Brooklyn R and also I think the Rockaway trains are running free?

57
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:57,680
Speaker 1: Free rides?

58
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,904
Speaker 0: I did know that.

59
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, there you go.

60
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,416
Speaker 0: Due to the fact that about one year ago New York got fucked by a hurricane, and we still haven't repaired most of the damage.

61
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:10,521
Speaker 1: Kind of wish there was a hurricane, not because I want anything to get fucked the fuck up just because I want to stay home.

62
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:20,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of nice to stay home for that week, partly because we live in a place that one, high ground, two, no substantial damage, three, didn't lose power or internet at any point.

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm on the third floor.

64
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,589
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

65
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,534
Speaker 1: You can flood the fuck.

66
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:31,646
Speaker 0: Not only are we on the third floor, but our building has exceedingly high ceilings, so we're actually like four and a half stories up effectively.

67
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,980
Speaker 1: It's like, for a flood to reach me, you need some biblical shit.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,690
Speaker 0: And our building is on the high ground.

69
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:45,462
Speaker 0: The evacuation center for serious flooding, like where everyone in this part of Queens would go, is the same city block as my apartment building.

70
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:49,661
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine is like on the border between like, if you look at the map of different levels of danger.

71
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have zones.

72
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:53,260
Speaker 0: They have zones that are like, at what point are you fucked?

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:02,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically I'm in the, like across the street is one zone worse than me, and across the street the other direction is like one or two zones worse, and mine is like the one zone better.

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,622
Speaker 0: I'm weird.

75
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,471
Speaker 1: It's like literally across the street is worse.

76
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:11,614
Speaker 0: Where we are right now is the Mad Max zone, because if where we are got flooded, then it's Mad Max in New York City.

77
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:11,975
Speaker 1: Sure.

78
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:13,520
Speaker 1: Anyway.

79
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,461
Speaker 0: Anyway.

80
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,506
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some games.

81
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:23,439
Speaker 0: All right, so I had the privilege at PAX, thanks to our good friends Ro and Jeremy, this is going back a ways, to play Castellan, the Steve Jackson game.

82
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,748
Speaker 1: That's a game we saw at PAX years ago.

83
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,033
Speaker 1: I think PAX East I first saw.

84
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,482
Speaker 0: I was sold purely on the pieces.

85
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:30,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, I looked at the game.

86
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:31,268
Speaker 1: and what is the game?

87
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:39,381
Speaker 1: It's castle towers, castle walls, and little castle bits, and I'm like, the game where you build castles, shut up and take my money.

88
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:39,803
Speaker 1: I love castles.

89
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,108
Speaker 0: Don't even care how the game works.

90
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:46,309
Speaker 1: Don't even give two dams, build castles, A plus game, best game ever, build castles.

91
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:53,681
Speaker 0: So yeah, I think I might've mentioned this briefly on the show, but I played it, and I've looked into it further, and I've read other people's play reports.

92
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:54,423
Speaker 0: Don't buy it.

93
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,368
Speaker 0: It is a bad game.

94
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:00,217
Speaker 0: It is actually a really bad game.

95
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,722
Speaker 1: I don't get to build castles.

96
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:07,340
Speaker 0: Now here is why, because actually a good friend of ours who has the same taste in games.

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,626
Speaker 1: I should make a good castle building game.

98
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:14,681
Speaker 0: And the same, it's our friend Pete whale shark in the forums.

99
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:19,620
Speaker 0: He said something to the effect of I paid $25 for Castellan and it was definitely worth it.

100
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,984
Speaker 1: You only played the two player?

101
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:33,402
Speaker 0: Now, it might be worth it if you like fiddly, random bullshit games or games that are literally impossible to play effectively without pissing off the person across the table.

102
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,051
Speaker 0: Here are the problems with Castellan.

103
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:39,055
Speaker 1: One, it is just dots and boxes.

104
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,948
Speaker 0: It breaks down mathematically the same way.

105
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:49,085
Speaker 0: The heuristics are basically the same right down to the long chains.

106
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:53,922
Speaker 0: Whoever is forced to take action first blows their load and then the other player just wins.

107
00:07:54,324 --> 00:08:01,887
Speaker 0: The game, you have literally three options in terms of how you want to play this game, and one of those options is illusory.

108
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,776
Speaker 0: It only exists if your opponent is dumb.

109
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,406
Speaker 0: Option one, take your turns really quickly.

110
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,197
Speaker 0: Try to just play by the seat of your pants.

111
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:19,667
Speaker 0: Make the game as unstable as possible and hope that your opponent takes a cue and also moves quickly and that you're anticipating a little bit ahead of them.

112
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,225
Speaker 0: A smart opponent will take their goddamn time on their turn and that won't work.

113
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,852
Speaker 0: Option two, take your goddamn time.

114
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:29,419
Speaker 0: Fully analyze the entire game.

115
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,963
Speaker 0: state every turn.

116
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:31,625
Speaker 1: Takes forever.

117
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:34,513
Speaker 0: Because that lets you win.

118
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:35,094
Speaker 0: It works.

119
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,140
Speaker 0: The game is fully analyzable.

120
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,104
Speaker 0: It's perfectly symmetrical.

121
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,094
Speaker 1: Wait, but what if we both do that perfectly?

122
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,782
Speaker 1: Does player one win or player two?

123
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:44,976
Speaker 0: That I did not determine because it was not worth the effort.

124
00:08:45,016 --> 00:09:01,280
Speaker 0: What I did determine was that the only way to play effectively is to analyze based on the cards you can see, the cards your opponent has already played, and the state of the board, every possible combination of options you could make for the rest of the game, which is theoretically possible.

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,227
Speaker 0: There aren't that many cards.

126
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:08,570
Speaker 1: So we should write an AI where when you play against it, it just crushes you horrible every single time.

127
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,908
Speaker 0: An AI, much like with dots and boxes, could be written that was highly effective at this game.

128
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:29,140
Speaker 0: Or option three, which is what you're actually doing when you play this game, act randomly, completely randomly, until you hit the point where you can calculate the entire rest of the game and then follow your calculation.

129
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:29,962
Speaker 1: Without a lot of effort?

130
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:30,705
Speaker 0: Yes.

131
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,538
Speaker 0: And then it's not a matter of who's better at the game.

132
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,785
Speaker 0: It's a matter of who figures out who won first.

133
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:49,105
Speaker 0: The game is dots and boxes in every possible meaningful way, and it presents no interesting questions, no interesting decisions, and part of this is because the way the game works is.

134
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:57,271
Speaker 0: you can sort of take as many, like play as many cards as you want on your turn, and the game moves until you've run out of your cards.

135
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:12,549
Speaker 0: So you can blow your load, kind of like how in dots and boxes you fill in and start doing one of those entire chains, where you get like 10 in a row, but then you've blown your load and your opponent can then blow his load freely because you've already blown your load.

136
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:14,596
Speaker 0: It's dots and boxes.

137
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,602
Speaker 0: There's no reason to play this game.

138
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:23,702
Speaker 0: It's not fun unless you play randomly and consciously decide to not seriously try to win.

139
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:36,483
Speaker 0: It might be fun if you have an egg timer and you force everyone to take no more than one minute on their turn and build in a consequence for failing to move by the end of that one minute.

140
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:45,290
Speaker 0: Maybe, or something similar, but I don't see anyone actually doing that, and I don't think it would actually be a fun game.

141
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,865
Speaker 1: You need to come up with a game that is fun that just has castles because castles...

142
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:53,563
Speaker 0: Yes, the pieces are so great, and I can imagine a lot of games that would use these pieces.

143
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,246
Speaker 0: So I'll say this.

144
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:59,907
Speaker 0: If you design games or have aspirations of doing so, go ahead and buy Castellan.

145
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,297
Speaker 1: Just to get some pieces to build other games with?

146
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,000
Speaker 0: Top notch.

147
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,693
Speaker 0: But don't play Castellan unless you really fucking like dots and boxes.

148
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:08,235
Speaker 0: All right.

149
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,283
Speaker 1: So I also played some games.

150
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,095
Speaker 1: There's a new place that opened up in New York City.

151
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,024
Speaker 1: I kickstarted it called The Uncommons.

152
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:18,200
Speaker 1: They're trying to make snakes and lattes in New York, which is... I support that.

153
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,734
Speaker 0: Yes, it's hard to do in New York for a lot of economic reasons.

154
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,243
Speaker 1: It's just south of Washington Square Park.

155
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,367
Speaker 1: Location's pretty good.

156
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:29,312
Speaker 1: The actual place it's in doesn't have a ton of space, but it has enough, and the tables they have are really good.

157
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,577
Speaker 1: It's well lit.

158
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:31,240
Speaker 1: It's quiet.

159
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,305
Speaker 0: Wait, actually well lit?

160
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:37,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good place to play a board game if you get a seat.

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is not a lot of seats.

162
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:41,149
Speaker 1: This is a moderate amount.

163
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:47,609
Speaker 1: Anyway, so part of the thing I kickstarted was I got a ticket to the opening night.

164
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:55,721
Speaker 1: I think it was sold out because they had a number of backers equal to the number of seats, but it seems like a lot of people didn't show.

165
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,973
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people might not actually live here.

166
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:05,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was wondering if I was even going to see anyone I knew there, but buddy Matt was there, so we played a bunch of games.

167
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:06,404
Speaker 1: All right.

168
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:15,844
Speaker 1: You know, I could talk about a lot of them, but I think I'm going to save them for later, but there's one that I think is only Geek Byte worthy, and that is called Dungeon Dice, I believe was the name of it.

169
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,769
Speaker 0: Dungeon Dice.

170
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:18,872
Speaker 1: Let me take a look.

171
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,198
Speaker 1: It comes in like...

172
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,349
Speaker 0: Dungeon Dice relaunch, collect dice, and bash.

173
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:25,830
Speaker 0: This game?

174
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:28,978
Speaker 0: I got it up on my screen.

175
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:29,419
Speaker 0: That game.

176
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,443
Speaker 0: What I'm pointing at right now.

177
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:32,029
Speaker 1: Didn't look like that.

178
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,997
Speaker 0: Okay, that's the game, Dungeon Dice.

179
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:36,125
Speaker 1: Okay, well, maybe it looked different.

180
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,070
Speaker 0: Okay, captain.

181
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:39,179
Speaker 0: I'm not going to edit anything out here, so...

182
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,464
Speaker 1: What was the name of this thing?

183
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:41,565
Speaker 1: What?

184
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:43,971
Speaker 1: Oh, it is called...

185
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,996
Speaker 0: Dungeon Dice?

186
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,480
Speaker 1: No, Dungeon Roll.

187
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:48,723
Speaker 0: Okay.

188
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:49,547
Speaker 1: Dungeon Roll.

189
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,576
Speaker 0: So there is another game called Dungeon Dice.

190
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:55,772
Speaker 1: Yes, it's definitely Dungeon Roll, which comes in a little treasure chest, right?

191
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:56,755
Speaker 1: Yes, 100% Dungeon Roll.

192
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:07,624
Speaker 1: So, Dungeon Roll, which I just said the name of 20 times in a row, is pretty bad, but the theme is so good.

193
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,190
Speaker 1: So here's how this works.

194
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:14,109
Speaker 1: You have this treasure chest, and you take the dice out, and this white dice and black dice.

195
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,123
Speaker 1: The white dice are the good guys, and the black dice are the bad guys.

196
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:21,001
Speaker 1: And inside the treasure chest are a bunch of little cardboard bits that are the treasure.

197
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:21,924
Speaker 0: Alright.

198
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:26,056
Speaker 1: And on your turn, you basically, it's a little, it's a lot like Yahtzee.

199
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,591
Speaker 1: On your turn, you roll the white dice, all of them, once.

200
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,400
Speaker 1: You don't get to re-roll any of them.

201
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:35,831
Speaker 1: On the white dice are a bunch of different kinds of, you know, heroes.

202
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:41,329
Speaker 1: Champions, fighters, mages, rogues, and sometimes scrolls also.

203
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,296
Speaker 1: And you just, that's your party.

204
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,524
Speaker 1: You roll it once, that's your party to go in the dungeon with.

205
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,093
Speaker 1: You go to level one of the dungeon.

206
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:51,404
Speaker 1: The person to your left rolls one black die.

207
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:53,811
Speaker 1: It might show up like goblin.

208
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,676
Speaker 1: It might show up treasure.

209
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:57,782
Speaker 1: It might show up who knows what, right?

210
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:01,797
Speaker 1: And you have to send someone in your party to deal with it.

211
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,322
Speaker 1: So let's say it rolls goblin.

212
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:09,758
Speaker 1: Well, any hero can defeat any one monster, but each hero has a specialty.

213
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:14,674
Speaker 1: So for example, a fighter can kill one of anything or any number of goblins.

214
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:21,981
Speaker 1: So if you go down to level three of the dungeon and the guy rolls and it comes up three goblins, well, one fighter can take care of all of that.

215
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:25,811
Speaker 1: Or a mage and a rogue and something, right?

216
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,413
Speaker 1: You get the idea.

217
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,944
Speaker 1: So level one, he rolls goblin.

218
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,209
Speaker 1: You have to kill all the monsters.

219
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,495
Speaker 1: You can't continue level two.

220
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,583
Speaker 1: So you pick one of your guys to kill the goblin.

221
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:35,426
Speaker 1: Okay, next.

222
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,358
Speaker 1: He rolls two dice, a skeleton and a treasure chest.

223
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,130
Speaker 1: You send one guy to kill the skeleton, one guy to kill the treasure chest.

224
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,139
Speaker 1: And notice you're losing white dice.

225
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,576
Speaker 1: Each level you spend white dice to kill off the black dice and continue.

226
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:58,432
Speaker 1: You don't have to open the treasure chest, but if you send the guy to open the treasure chest, then you get to reach in and get treasures, which are usually more guys, right?

227
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:00,016
Speaker 1: And sometimes they're XP.

228
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:11,315
Speaker 1: And basically you keep going further and further down the dungeon until, you know, every time you beat all the guys, you can say I'm stopping and you get one XP for every level you have completed.

229
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:17,197
Speaker 1: If you say I'm gonna keep going and you die, you get no XP because you spent all your guys, right?

230
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:17,759
Speaker 1: They didn't make it.

231
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:19,783
Speaker 1: And that's how it works.

232
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,993
Speaker 1: So it's thematically that works, right?

233
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:27,784
Speaker 1: The mechanic perfectly, 100% matches the theme.

234
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,330
Speaker 1: You have a party of guys.

235
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,398
Speaker 1: You go down fighting into the dungeon.

236
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:32,382
Speaker 1: You go deeper and deeper.

237
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,973
Speaker 1: There's more and more bad guys, less and less good guys.

238
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:39,131
Speaker 1: And eventually you give up and run out with all the treasures you've got and experience you've gained.

239
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:41,923
Speaker 0: So Yahtzee torchbearer without roleplaying.

240
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:42,385
Speaker 1: Yes.

241
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:58,983
Speaker 1: And then the next person, after you're done, the person to your left rolls the hero dice and the person to his left or his or her left then rolls the evil dice and you keep going around until everyone goes on three delves and whoever has the most experience after three delves wins.

242
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,387
Speaker 1: It's 100% solitaire.

243
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:05,464
Speaker 1: What the other people do doesn't matter except did they get more experience than you?

244
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,794
Speaker 1: So it actually matters on your final turn.

245
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:16,483
Speaker 1: For example, I was on my final turn and basically I could go one more level, but the odds of me surviving that one more level were basically nil.

246
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:20,156
Speaker 1: But with the amount of experience I had, I did not have enough to win.

247
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:23,892
Speaker 1: So I had to take ridiculous odds on that third one and I kept going.

248
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:26,565
Speaker 1: And of course I died, but it didn't matter because I wouldn't have won anyway.

249
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,413
Speaker 1: And that's the only interactivity in the whole game.

250
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,722
Speaker 0: So it's not worth playing.

251
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,510
Speaker 1: It is not worth playing at all.

252
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:42,115
Speaker 1: It's just really cool to see how the mechanics of this Yahtzee went so well with the idea of a typical dungeon delve.

253
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:46,089
Speaker 1: It is uncool in that there is no reason to ever play this ever.

254
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,620
Speaker 1: Yes, there is no reason to ever play it ever.

255
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,466
Speaker 0: Well, I guess there is the reason.

256
00:16:51,486 --> 00:17:02,213
Speaker 1: if you don't already have a good Yahtzee game such as Yahtzee Roll Through the Ages, Skyline, etc.

257
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:02,975
Speaker 1: King of Tokyo.

258
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:06,143
Speaker 1: If you don't already have a good Yahtzee game, Zombie Dice.

259
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:10,138
Speaker 0: Oh, and by the way, if you own 5D6, you have Yahtzee already.

260
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:10,460
Speaker 0: No kidding.

261
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,180
Speaker 1: If you don't already have Yahtzee, this could be the one Yahtzee you have and it would be okay.

262
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,681
Speaker 0: Huh.

263
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:23,801
Speaker 0: You know, maybe the reason to play this game is if you're a developer of games who is young.

264
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:24,789
Speaker 1: You won't need to buy this.

265
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,304
Speaker 1: You just learned everything you need to know from this listening to me.

266
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:28,348
Speaker 0: Hopefully they did.

267
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,795
Speaker 0: Maybe they need to viscerally feel it.

268
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:30,860
Speaker 1: Watch it on YouTube.

269
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,249
Speaker 0: Touch fire to find out that fire bad.

270
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,631
Speaker 1: Sure.

271
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:38,251
Speaker 1: It does come in a really cool treasure chest, so the manufacturing of the game is already pretty good.

272
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,417
Speaker 0: So this and Castellon.

273
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,488
Speaker 0: High production values on everything but the game.

274
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,495
Speaker 1: The production value wasn't high.

275
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,391
Speaker 1: It was just this cardboard treasure chest full of dice and cardboard.

276
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,236
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's just cool.

277
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:46,819
Speaker 0: It's not high production.

278
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's well designed.

279
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:49,708
Speaker 1: It's not well made.

280
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:50,532
Speaker 1: No.

281
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:51,897
Speaker 1: It was average made.

282
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:52,800
Speaker 1: It wasn't poorly made.

283
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,676
Speaker 1: It wasn't like the treasure chest was like, "What an awesome

284
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:55,998
Speaker 1: chest.".

285
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:56,781
Speaker 1: It was just like, "Oh, look.

286
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,003
Speaker 1: It comes in a cardboard chest.

287
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:58,263
Speaker 1: That's

288
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:58,584
Speaker 1: sweet.".

289
00:17:58,865 --> 00:17:59,185
Speaker 1: Okay.

290
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,620
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

291
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,948
Speaker 0: I got a little cluster of things here.

292
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:13,065
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put them in a big thing on Tumblr instead of making a ton of things of the day.

293
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:17,444
Speaker 0: Way long time ago when we used to do four nights of geek nights a week.

294
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:18,910
Speaker 1: What kind of crazy people do that?

295
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,124
Speaker 0: For many years before we realized how people with no lives.

296
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,370
Speaker 1: You don't live in a city.

297
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,038
Speaker 0: How soul crushing that was.

298
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,926
Speaker 0: You see that thing I linked to about reverse commuting?

299
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:30,902
Speaker 0: How people our age are more and more if they don't live in New York.

300
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:35,182
Speaker 0: Reverse commuting because all the jobs are in the burbs but they want to live in the downtown.

301
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:38,074
Speaker 1: My cousin has lived in New York and she worked in New York.

302
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,907
Speaker 1: She got forced to reverse commute because they moved her job.

303
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:41,429
Speaker 1: Yeah.

304
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,816
Speaker 1: She doesn't want to work out there.

305
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,583
Speaker 1: They moved the job to the burbs.

306
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:45,045
Speaker 1: Exactly.

307
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,915
Speaker 0: But people used to want to live and work in the burbs.

308
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:51,711
Speaker 0: People our age want to live in the city and work wherever there's jobs.

309
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:55,609
Speaker 0: So they'll live in the city even if that means commuting to work in the burb sucks.

310
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,427
Speaker 1: She always lived in the city and she did work in the city and she forced her out.

311
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,356
Speaker 0: Remember when you used to have to reverse commute?

312
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:05,594
Speaker 0: We already lived outside of the city and you had to commute even further away from the city.

313
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:06,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

314
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,462
Speaker 0: But they bought you that car.

315
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:08,505
Speaker 0: Sure.

316
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:08,846
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:19,764
Speaker 0: But anyway, what we used to do because it was hard to come up with four things the day a week is that I would do theme weeks like that born to be alive Hitler week that I did that one time.

318
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,432
Speaker 0: I found those videos again recently.

319
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:25,000
Speaker 0: So I have a themed thing of the day.

320
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,186
Speaker 0: I'm going to blow it all right now.

321
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,492
Speaker 0: I found this video.

322
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:31,105
Speaker 0: Emily and I were doing our usual watch colleague humor and South Park and stuff.

323
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,797
Speaker 0: And it was called a late for meeting.

324
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,678
Speaker 0: It was apparently a sequel to another video by the same person whose name on Twitter is bad.

325
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:45,848
Speaker 0: mocap called goes to store.

326
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,883
Speaker 0: And the description of goes to store tells you everything you need to know about this video.

327
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:52,773
Speaker 0: Normal guy, normal walk.

328
00:19:54,137 --> 00:20:06,253
Speaker 0: The videos are pretty funny, but the part of the reason I bring this up is that these there is a huge community of people who have remixed this idea with everything.

329
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 0: There's a team fortress to going for intelligence.

330
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:14,657
Speaker 0: There's a sequel going to store best real remake, and all of this is delightful.

331
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:20,860
Speaker 0: So I invite you all to watch this normal guy who is normally walking to a normal store.

332
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:23,823
Speaker 1: All right, I do.

333
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:32,847
Speaker 1: So here's this awesome website I found called ASCII flow, and it basically is MS paint for ASCII flow charts.

334
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,989
Speaker 1: The tools available to you are Arrow, which is just the cursor to click on and select things box.

335
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:44,236
Speaker 1: It lets you draw an ASCII box, the kind with the pluses in the corners, the pipes in the side and the hyphen on the top and the bottom.

336
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kind of thing that I often see people using in bullshit game facts.

337
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:50,783
Speaker 1: Another box that has a heading on it, sort of like for UML.

338
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:55,399
Speaker 1: one that allows you to draw an arrow from one box to another box.

339
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:04,671
Speaker 1: Another one that lets you draw a different kind of arrow from one box to another box, one that lets you draw text, one that lets you erase.

340
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:09,167
Speaker 1: and one that lets you just draw a bunch of X's in a line wherever the hell you want.

341
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,535
Speaker 1: This thing is so awesome.

342
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:20,097
Speaker 1: You can use this for making like maps for rogue you likes or actual flow charts to post into forums.

343
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:28,683
Speaker 0: It's pretty good for simple databases, maps of dungeons for a tabletop RPG like tables and basically UML diagrams.

344
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,511
Speaker 1: This thing is so freaking useful.

345
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:38,113
Speaker 1: I want to figure out how to download it in case the website ever disappears, such as medieval tapestry.

346
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was duly impressed with this.

347
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,104
Speaker 1: Nightly build GitHub.

348
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,369
Speaker 1: Yes, you can get it on GitHub.

349
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,205
Speaker 0: If it's on GitHub, we should just integrate it into the forum.

350
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:48,929
Speaker 1: We can't now.

351
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,899
Speaker 1: We'll talk to that in the meta moment.

352
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

353
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,656
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, you might've noticed that Scott did something pretty big.

354
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:56,177
Speaker 0: Right.

355
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,703
Speaker 1: So here's what the deal was.

356
00:21:57,824 --> 00:22:00,272
Speaker 1: Our forum was all busted, right?

357
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:05,153
Speaker 1: And because it was so old and un-updated ancient version of vanilla, there's no way to update it.

358
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:12,383
Speaker 1: Cause basically what they did is they haven't updated their open source version in forever and they mostly were hosted in their cloud version.

359
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:14,650
Speaker 1: So I said, fine, you win.

360
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,336
Speaker 1: There's no other forum to switch to.

361
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,485
Speaker 1: We'll pay for your stupid cloud hosting.

362
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,479
Speaker 1: So it's costing us like one 50 a month, which is a ton of fucking money.

363
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:22,082
Speaker 0: Yeah.

364
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:26,357
Speaker 0: That's more than the collected entire archive of all of geek nights.

365
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:27,040
Speaker 0: That's online.

366
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,601
Speaker 1: Right.

367
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:36,822
Speaker 0: So if you want to, uh, send us some monies to help with that, we will set up numerous ways for you to send us money, both in return for gratitude and in return for things like t-shirts.

368
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:37,585
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

369
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,680
Speaker 1: Uh, so yeah, but yeah, the forum is now all updated and way better.

370
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,328
Speaker 1: If you want to register, we don't even need to approve you anymore because the filtering to keep spammers out is pretty damn good.

371
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,031
Speaker 1: Yup.

372
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:51,019
Speaker 1: All you got to do is just register for it.

373
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,567
Speaker 1: Like you'd anything else out there.

374
00:22:53,628 --> 00:23:02,669
Speaker 0: And now that the searching is better and everything's better, I think a lot of dormant people are going to come back and our forums already pretty fucking bad ass in terms of its community.

375
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:08,447
Speaker 0: But I sense that the ivory tower of our forum is going to explode in the coming months.

376
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:13,544
Speaker 1: But anyway, uh, so the forum is way better now than it has been in a long time.

377
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:22,580
Speaker 0: In fact, you might remember we gave a lecture at a PACS many years ago that was basically, here's why the community in your PHP VV is shit and why our forum community is awesome.

378
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:25,969
Speaker 0: And it's because of the design of the GUI of the forum itself.

379
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:37,018
Speaker 1: So yeah, go to the forum as usual, but also, uh, the, our ability to do things such as modify the forum in that way.

380
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:51,258
Speaker 0: For example, you might've noticed that like a year ago, the new episodes stopped having a link to the forum threads for set episodes for the plebes who did not otherwise already use the forum.

381
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:55,121
Speaker 0: And they would come to the website like, Oh, I want to comment on your episode because I disagree with you.

382
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,286
Speaker 0: And then there was no link.

383
00:23:56,527 --> 00:24:04,260
Speaker 0: So they'd never actually go find the forum and they disappear into the miss angry and alone, but now they can complain on the forum soon after we fix that part.

384
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:08,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff in regards to that, uh, pretty soon.

385
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,145
Speaker 0: So expect a bunch of stuff.

386
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:15,485
Speaker 0: And speaking of a bunch of stuff, uh, we did resume production of geek nights presents Utena.

387
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:19,400
Speaker 0: And in fact, uh, episode nine just finished uploading.

388
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,397
Speaker 0: I started uploading it when we started the show and it just finished.

389
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,406
Speaker 0: So yeah, eight gigabytes in about 23 minutes.

390
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,932
Speaker 0: I love files.

391
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:31,543
Speaker 0: So episode nine of geek nights presents shoujo kakame.

392
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:37,505
Speaker 0: Utena will be available as soon as YouTube finishes encoding it into all the various bit rates.

393
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:38,246
Speaker 0: Yes.

394
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,515
Speaker 0: This episode is 35 minutes long.

395
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:44,383
Speaker 0: The episode of Utena is 21 minutes long.

396
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:44,944
Speaker 0: Great.

397
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:46,349
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's the rate.

398
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:47,031
Speaker 0: we're going here.

399
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:52,708
Speaker 1: Uh, uh, the book club book is actually almost finished reading it.

400
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:56,279
Speaker 0: I have read six and a half books in the time.

401
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:57,844
Speaker 0: It's taken Scott to read this in fact.

402
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:58,205
Speaker 1: Okay.

403
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:03,443
Speaker 1: So if you only count right, the actual hours of reading time has taken me to read.

404
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:05,210
Speaker 0: this takes like two hours to read.

405
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,619
Speaker 1: This book is way not long to read.

406
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,292
Speaker 1: It's, I've just not been reading books in this time period.

407
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,584
Speaker 1: I've been doing other things of this.

408
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:16,140
Speaker 0: exercise to get people to read things outside of their comfort zone.

409
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,032
Speaker 1: I do know is to get people to read things period.

410
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:20,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're reading things.

411
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:24,695
Speaker 0: They're reading a mr nice guy's penis adventure that Patrick Rothfuss bullshit.

412
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,000
Speaker 0: They're not reading real books.

413
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,415
Speaker 1: Some people are reading that, but some people aren't reading at all.

414
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:29,636
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:32,169
Speaker 0: My goal is just don't read penis adventures.

416
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,732
Speaker 0: Read real.

417
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:33,697
Speaker 1: You're aiming too high.

418
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:35,083
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who just don't read.

419
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:46,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would at this point, I'd almost rather you not read than read captain nice guys adventures because good God fedora dig captain fedora's nice guy penis adventures.

420
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,788
Speaker 0: That's what the king killer Chronicles are.

421
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,643
Speaker 0: But, um, I'm most of the way through the new Locke Lamora book.

422
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:53,085
Speaker 0: It's okay.

423
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:54,551
Speaker 1: It's the same as the other one.

424
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:58,786
Speaker 0: It's identical to the other ones, except it takes place in the magic land.

425
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,456
Speaker 0: Ooh, yeah.

426
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:01,837
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

427
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:02,218
Speaker 1: I remember.

428
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:03,724
Speaker 1: I'm starting to remember that world.

429
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:04,829
Speaker 0: Remember the falconer.

430
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:06,415
Speaker 0: Remember when they did a thing?

431
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:07,138
Speaker 0: Yeah.

432
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:08,724
Speaker 0: So now they're going to deal with that.

433
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:09,728
Speaker 0: Okay.

434
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,109
Speaker 0: Yeah.

435
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,792
Speaker 1: Good luck guys.

436
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:11,374
Speaker 0: Books.

437
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:12,338
Speaker 0: Okay.

438
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:14,568
Speaker 0: It's not great, but it's more of the same and you know what?

439
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,694
Speaker 0: The same was pretty good.

440
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:16,820
Speaker 0: It's entertaining.

441
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

442
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,805
Speaker 1: Learn anything about elder glass.

443
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:27,162
Speaker 0: Uh, I learned that there's some mysterious elder glass shit deep in the ocean that you can see bubbling up and no one can get down there deep enough to look at it.

444
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:27,765
Speaker 0: Awesome.

445
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:28,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

446
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,595
Speaker 1: Maybe that's where shit comes from.

447
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:31,122
Speaker 0: I also learned a little bit about magical.

448
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:45,311
Speaker 0: I worry that Scott Lynch has read one of the, uh, captain penis nice guy adventure books because he mentioned something about magic and sympathy in a way that just brought back flashbacks to penises anyway.

449
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:56,347
Speaker 0: So yeah, book of the book Stasi land relevant in light of the fact that if you guys didn't notice, the UK is actually trying to crack down on free speech about the NSA leaks.

450
00:26:57,551 --> 00:27:00,722
Speaker 0: So yeah, this stuff is increasingly important and you should at least attention.

451
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,390
Speaker 0: We don't want to be like East Germany.

452
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,095
Speaker 1: I doubt that lab.

453
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:05,697
Speaker 0: Yeah.

454
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:08,809
Speaker 0: But other parts of the world are edging toward those sorts of things.

455
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,860
Speaker 0: And despite the fact that the U S is the place doing that spying, we also are maintaining your freedom of speech, which creates a sort of interesting,

456
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:31,132
Speaker 1: read a great article talking about how, you know, basically the U S not being able to keep secrets will eliminate hypocrisy in the U S because basically the government won't be able to do one thing and tell other people to do a different thing because everyone can see that we're only pretending to do what we say we do, and we're not.

457
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:33,464
Speaker 1: So then we'll be forced to actually do what we tell other people to do.

458
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:46,654
Speaker 0: I also read a similar article that said the same thing was happening specifically to the far right Republicans in the U S because in the old days they could go to their base and say, yeah, we're going to keep the black people down.

459
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:57,432
Speaker 0: And then in the public, they'd say we're fiscally responsible, but now the racist stuff they say to their base is all on YouTube right next to the things they say in public.

460
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:59,300
Speaker 0: They can't have two faces anymore.

461
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:07,247
Speaker 0: Politicians only get one face, at least there's still the lobbyist face, but they can't have the base face and the centrist face.

462
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:10,560
Speaker 0: And that hurts Republicans way more than it hurts Democrats.

463
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,955
Speaker 0: But anyway, uh, I think that's all we got in the meta moment.

464
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:16,080
Speaker 0: Look for us at magfest.

465
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:17,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:18,865
Speaker 0: Look for us at anime Boston.

467
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:22,255
Speaker 0: Look for us at tax East New York city.

468
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:27,800
Speaker 0: Look for us at, uh, I don't know what other conventions we're going to in the near future runner world tournament.

469
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,843
Speaker 1: I think it was within a week.

470
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:30,890
Speaker 1: Not going to fucking Minneapolis.

471
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:32,155
Speaker 0: Hell no.

472
00:28:32,596 --> 00:28:33,279
Speaker 0: Zenkai con.

473
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,985
Speaker 0: We're going to be there doing some panels.

474
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:59,170
Speaker 0: Oh, and, um, it's a long ways in advance, but, uh, as you know, Scott and I are two of the three people who run the panels, workshops and special events department for Connecticut, which is a moderately to surprisingly sized nerd convention in Connecticut every year, uh, panel submissions for next year around July are already open.

475
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,743
Speaker 0: We've already gotten like three panel submissions.

476
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:09,855
Speaker 0: So yeah, that other convention, take that certain unnamed conventions that don't have their panels scheduled together in the weeks before the con.

477
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,564
Speaker 0: take that I'm making two middle fingers right now.

478
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:17,300
Speaker 1: I'm already playing four middle fingers between us all raised high.

479
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:20,129
Speaker 0: I'm already looking at panel submissions.

480
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,864
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about, do I want anime in this room at this time?

481
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:25,290
Speaker 0: Or do I want video games?

482
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,018
Speaker 0: Connecticut is huge and awesome.

483
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:28,145
Speaker 0: Our panel rooms are awesome.

484
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:28,930
Speaker 0: We're getting bigger.

485
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,390
Speaker 0: The people who run the panels department, me, Scott, and the eggs know exactly what's up.

486
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,473
Speaker 0: We are cool.

487
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:40,755
Speaker 0: Other many listeners of geek nights, our panelists at Connecticut, they will tell you how awesome it is.

488
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:46,854
Speaker 0: Uh, many of them are now our own personal enforcers or at Connecticut.

489
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:49,923
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, go submit your panel.

490
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:52,631
Speaker 0: I get an email on my phone every time you do this.

491
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:54,215
Speaker 1: Okay.

492
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,862
Speaker 1: So talk about what we're gonna talk about.

493
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,306
Speaker 0: Burning con.

494
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,196
Speaker 1: Burning con is usually real good this year.

495
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,989
Speaker 1: I missed some burning con because there was a net runner tournament.

496
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:12,060
Speaker 1: I've talked about this before, but basically normally I would never skip burning con once a year for net runner tournament, which is like twice a month.

497
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,301
Speaker 1: Right?

498
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:12,965
Speaker 1: That's ridiculous.

499
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:13,146
Speaker 1: Right?

500
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:16,660
Speaker 1: You always go to the thing that is rarer to go to, right?

501
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,590
Speaker 1: Uh, for something that is less rare or more rare.

502
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:24,468
Speaker 1: But in this case, the net runner tournament was not just any net runner tournament.

503
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,715
Speaker 1: It was the plugged in special net runner.

504
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:26,916
Speaker 0: Yes.

505
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:27,177
Speaker 0: Yes.

506
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:34,239
Speaker 1: So Scott, which went from a once a month event to a once ever so once ever beats once a year.

507
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,810
Speaker 0: So Scott decided that schwag for his net runner game.

508
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,797
Speaker 1: I didn't win any schwag at all.

509
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,023
Speaker 1: I don't care about the schwag.

510
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,834
Speaker 1: I care about going to play net runner with the peoples.

511
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:54,470
Speaker 1: So regardless, Scott missed a good chunk of burning con, which I showed up for the third session on Saturday at the party on Friday and both sessions on Sunday.

512
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,678
Speaker 1: But I missed the first two sessions on Saturday.

513
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,103
Speaker 0: He also missed the after party.

514
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:58,786
Speaker 0: Yep.

515
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,171
Speaker 0: So burning con.

516
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,610
Speaker 1: We've talked about burning cons before, but this burning con was a lot like the other burning con.

517
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:14,142
Speaker 0: Suffice it to say, burning con is a curated convention run by the burning wheel crew like Luke Crane, Jared Sorensen, people like Vincent Baker.

518
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:17,693
Speaker 0: There's different combinations of game designers every year.

519
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:25,841
Speaker 0: And the idea is that games created by all the people who collectively are curating the con are the only games that can be played.

520
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:26,082
Speaker 1: Right.

521
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:32,305
Speaker 1: So this year the people were Jason Morningstar, Jared Sorensen, John Harper, Vincent Baker and Luke Crane.

522
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:35,516
Speaker 1: So the games you could play are fiasco.

523
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,503
Speaker 1: You could basically only play games they design.

524
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:45,535
Speaker 0: Fiasco, Durance, Carolina Death Crawl, Gray Ranks, Shab al-Hari Roach, Inspectors, Lacuna, Action Castle, Free Market, Lady Blackbird, Danger Patrol, Ghost Echo.

525
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:51,304
Speaker 0: I got Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, Kill Puppies for Satan, Rock of Tahamad, Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Torchbearer.

526
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:52,068
Speaker 1: That's it.

527
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:54,281
Speaker 1: Those that you can't are not allowed to play any other games like that.

528
00:31:54,301 --> 00:32:03,112
Speaker 1: And everyone who attends the convention has to either A run one of those games or B join the beginners track where they teach you how to run a game.

529
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,039
Speaker 0: But then you still have to run games.

530
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:07,528
Speaker 0: You have to run games to play games.

531
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:10,703
Speaker 1: Everyone runs one game and then plays games in the other four slots.

532
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:11,708
Speaker 1: It's always been that way.

533
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:18,953
Speaker 0: It always will be that way, which I think engenders a much better role playing culture than any other gaming con ever.

534
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:35,387
Speaker 0: Because even if you're a noob one, you're now you're a noob running a game for the first time with a bunch of people who are either noobs just like you who are similarly dedicated to role playing or seasoned experts and or the people who created the games.

535
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:40,404
Speaker 0: And you might think it's intimidating to run a game for people who are experts.

536
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:47,592
Speaker 0: It is so much easier to run Burning Wheel for people who helped write Burning Wheel than it is to run Burning Wheel for people who don't know what they're doing.

537
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,536
Speaker 0: Unless Luke's in your game.

538
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,245
Speaker 0: But I digress.

539
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,515
Speaker 1: So I guess what did you do in the two sessions?

540
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:57,017
Speaker 1: I wasn't there?

541
00:32:57,097 --> 00:33:05,948
Speaker 0: So the first session, which I had first priority for, I joined Jared Sorensen's inspectors game because I never get to play inspectors.

542
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,886
Speaker 0: It's the game I usually run at conventions for other people because I know all the rules.

543
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,535
Speaker 0: I can teach the rules in 30 seconds.

544
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:14,558
Speaker 0: It's easy.

545
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:23,427
Speaker 0: And it's a great game for people who aren't so much into role playing because I ran it for some people at PAX Prime when I was doing that thing.

546
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,475
Speaker 1: And it actually went really, really well.

547
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:29,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it has that moment where someone rolls and they roll really well.

548
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,205
Speaker 0: And I turn to them and I say, all right, tell me what happens.

549
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:32,391
Speaker 0: And they sit there for a second.

550
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:32,933
Speaker 0: Like, what do you mean?

551
00:33:32,953 --> 00:33:33,314
Speaker 0: Tell you.

552
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:39,237
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, well, I, uh, I find in the microfiche that the guy hasn't aged.

553
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:40,865
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, so tell me more about this.

554
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:41,990
Speaker 0: Tell me how awesome you are.

555
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:42,893
Speaker 0: And then they get it.

556
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,138
Speaker 0: And then role playing happens.

557
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:48,314
Speaker 0: But I'd never, you know, the rules are what they are.

558
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:54,054
Speaker 0: But I played in a game as a player where Jared Sorensen, the guy who wrote the game, ran it.

559
00:33:54,616 --> 00:34:00,035
Speaker 0: And the first half was basically him doing standup comedy of why do you people want to play my shitty game?

560
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:02,967
Speaker 1: But it was actually that when he played free market a long time ago.

561
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,565
Speaker 0: But that started being incorporated into him running the game.

562
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:12,505
Speaker 0: Like he, he puts the character sheets out and he's like, all right, everyone write your names under name.

563
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:15,158
Speaker 0: And then he looks around and he's like, that's not your fucking name.

564
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,929
Speaker 0: Write your name, not your character's name.

565
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,155
Speaker 0: We don't need characters.

566
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:19,958
Speaker 0: It's inspectors.

567
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,783
Speaker 0: Bullshit.

568
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,047
Speaker 0: You don't need some character.

569
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:22,951
Speaker 0: Just play yourself.

570
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:29,027
Speaker 0: It's you and the game set here in New York and yep.

571
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,969
Speaker 0: Lazy, but you know what?

572
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,597
Speaker 0: It was stupidly fun.

573
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:43,522
Speaker 0: And I will spare you the details of the end of the game, but suffice it to say it was a great experience and I'm going to use the way he ran the game as my model for running this game for other people in the future.

574
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,094
Speaker 0: One, he forgot a bunch of rules, which is kind of funny.

575
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:46,717
Speaker 0: Okay.

576
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:52,502
Speaker 0: He forgot a bunch of rules on purpose, like in the beginning, like as jokes, but then he legit forgot a rule later.

577
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:55,172
Speaker 0: And when we realized that he wasn't joking, he actually forgot.

578
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:55,976
Speaker 0: It was the most funnier.

579
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,634
Speaker 0: And I realized something important about the way he runs the game.

580
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,686
Speaker 0: So you know, you have the franchise dice, right?

581
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,633
Speaker 0: When you get enough, the plot is resolved.

582
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:10,914
Speaker 0: So the way he did that, once the plot was resolved, we kept rolling and the game just continues.

583
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,962
Speaker 0: You don't stop and any up and then continue.

584
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:16,116
Speaker 0: You just continue and you still have to roll for stuff.

585
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:20,937
Speaker 0: You just don't get franchise dice, but you still get good or bad results until you get another case.

586
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:28,924
Speaker 0: And also, if you do something that was interesting, but doesn't further the plot, he does not award you franchise dice.

587
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:39,682
Speaker 1: Oh, see, that's the thing is when I played it, I basically gave franchise dice as per the rules and you would have enough franchise dice to basically beat the mission before it was actually resolved.

588
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:49,056
Speaker 0: So if your description does not actually further the plot, then he doesn't give you franchise dice and he continues to use the mechanics between missions.

589
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:54,572
Speaker 0: And as a result, the missions start to link together in a much more fluid way.

590
00:35:54,974 --> 00:35:59,066
Speaker 0: Playing the game that way is a huge, it works way better.

591
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:02,157
Speaker 1: Maybe he should print inspectors 2.0 if he thinks that's such a good idea.

592
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:02,458
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:12,813
Speaker 0: So the next game I played in that you weren't involved in, we were all two life path apprentices in Burning Wheel and we were there and the hook was pretty cool.

594
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:17,252
Speaker 0: So we're there and it was an awesome friend, listener who ran this game, our friend, Jane.

595
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:20,022
Speaker 0: And the deal is we're all two life path apprentices.

596
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:23,374
Speaker 0: Like I knew one spell, like literally that's a lot.

597
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:23,956
Speaker 0: Yeah.

598
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:24,879
Speaker 0: One spell.

599
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:25,882
Speaker 0: I got nothing else.

600
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,676
Speaker 0: And our masters all went into the dungeon to fight the chaos or whatever.

601
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:33,170
Speaker 0: And we were told to wait here until the signal comes out.

602
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,600
Speaker 0: If it's blue, come in and help us carry the loot out.

603
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:43,044
Speaker 0: If it's one, if I land two, if I see, if it's red, run back to the king and tell him to bring the army because shit's fucked.

604
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:46,033
Speaker 0: So 40 days go by, nothing happens.

605
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,985
Speaker 1: How did you survive for those 40 days sitting outside a cave?

606
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:50,371
Speaker 0: In our camp with food.

607
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,458
Speaker 0: Food's running low, but we still have food.

608
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,090
Speaker 0: A purple signal comes off, not from the cave.

609
00:36:56,952 --> 00:37:01,453
Speaker 0: One of the adventurers runs out with a huge treasure chest and says, we're going to get the fuck out of here.

610
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:02,558
Speaker 0: Everyone else went evil.

611
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:04,004
Speaker 0: And then shit goes down.

612
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:07,014
Speaker 0: It was, that was a great Burning Wheel game.

613
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:08,458
Speaker 0: It was playing.

614
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:12,147
Speaker 0: those punk ass characters was actually super fun.

615
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:18,269
Speaker 1: All right, well, you know, then came Saturday night, I showed up and we played some Torchbearer.

616
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:25,332
Speaker 1: And I mean, basically Torchbearer, I had played it once before when it was called Dungeoneers and Dragonslayers.

617
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:28,059
Speaker 0: I played it when it was just called my book.

618
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,742
Speaker 1: My book had just arrived in the mail and I was like, all right, let's play this shit for reals.

619
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,469
Speaker 1: I want to see how this goes down.

620
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:40,984
Speaker 1: And we played it with Miguel and he's so excellent.

621
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,493
Speaker 1: He brought all these pieces and he was so good.

622
00:37:43,574 --> 00:37:45,924
Speaker 0: Miguel was more prepared than anyone else.

623
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:48,536
Speaker 0: And the exception of those people with all those weird snake props.

624
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:48,757
Speaker 1: Right.

625
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:50,024
Speaker 1: And then Tor was in the game.

626
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,149
Speaker 1: So that made it even better.

627
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,997
Speaker 0: It added an air of legitimacy.

628
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

629
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,329
Speaker 1: And it was just, oh, that game was just so good.

630
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,999
Speaker 1: We just went into this dungeon and we did basic Dungeonee stuff.

631
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:04,707
Speaker 1: But once you're doing that basic Dungeonee stuff in Torchbearer, it's like that became the only game I wanted to play.

632
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,500
Speaker 0: What helped was in the game before Miguel was in the game I played before.

633
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,791
Speaker 0: And he was like, I didn't know him too well.

634
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:13,247
Speaker 0: Like he's one of those people that he was a lot of people at burning con.

635
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:17,669
Speaker 1: You go there every year and you recognize everyone and you know everyone, but you don't know everyone's name.

636
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:23,034
Speaker 1: Or you just never like, you know, it's like you see them, you know who that is, but you don't know them, know them.

637
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,386
Speaker 0: Or even if you know them, maybe you've never role played with them.

638
00:38:25,748 --> 00:38:26,572
Speaker 0: Like you just don't end up there.

639
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:32,652
Speaker 0: Miguel had this, like he let his master murder him after giving this heartfelt speech.

640
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,825
Speaker 0: And it was just, it was like the persona point right there for him.

641
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:43,010
Speaker 0: And then he ran that Torchbearer and that little touch where he started just using, he started talking for the arcs.

642
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,253
Speaker 0: That was pretty good.

643
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,118
Speaker 0: Torchbearer is so fun.

644
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:50,726
Speaker 0: It was a good game.

645
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:52,350
Speaker 0: What else can I say about it?

646
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,354
Speaker 0: You should all buy Torchbearer.

647
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,459
Speaker 0: It'll be available very soon.

648
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:58,397
Speaker 1: So I went home and took a nap for the whole night because it was sleepy time.

649
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,130
Speaker 1: And then I woke up and I went back to Burning Con.

650
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:01,710
Speaker 0: Yep.

651
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,070
Speaker 0: We went back to Burning Con and then you played in another Torchbearer game.

652
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:06,393
Speaker 1: We did.

653
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,702
Speaker 1: Well, no, uh, it was the mornings.

654
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,870
Speaker 1: I ran my game because I had the morning slot.

655
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,331
Speaker 0: Oh right.

656
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,475
Speaker 0: And I joined your game.

657
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:16,491
Speaker 0: and Scott, every year at Burning Con, Scott sits there when it's time for his game.

658
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,018
Speaker 0: He's like, I don't want to run my game.

659
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,143
Speaker 0: I hope no one joins it.

660
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:22,617
Speaker 0: And then he tried to like shoo players away who kept showing up.

661
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:28,536
Speaker 0: So I sat down at his game along with our good friend Chris to force his game to happen.

662
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,983
Speaker 0: And it was okay.

663
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:31,645
Speaker 0: It was kind of fun.

664
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:34,032
Speaker 0: I think my human pyramid plan would have worked.

665
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:35,358
Speaker 1: You and your human pyramids.

666
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:38,873
Speaker 0: I think my glory moment was when Scott just puts us in the dungeon.

667
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:40,781
Speaker 0: Well explain your, your premise.

668
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:44,757
Speaker 1: So I always like to do games where everyone's just boring as townsfolk.

669
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:45,560
Speaker 1: That's my thing.

670
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,142
Speaker 1: I love that.

671
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:46,583
Speaker 1: Right.

672
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:48,751
Speaker 1: So I had a game last year.

673
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:54,740
Speaker 1: I don't know if I talked about it where it was like, everyone's boring as townsfolk and a night shows up in town and then there's a giant and whatever.

674
00:39:55,523 --> 00:40:00,921
Speaker 1: the one I came up with this time was everyone's pretty much boring as townsfolk, except for the sorcerer.

675
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:10,153
Speaker 1: And you all get thrown a dungeon, but not a dungeon the way, you know, D and D dungeon, like just an actual dungeon, the King's dungeon.

676
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,719
Speaker 0: It was committed crimes.

677
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,148
Speaker 0: Scott, you ran it like a prison drama.

678
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:14,770
Speaker 1: It was it.

679
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,096
Speaker 1: you're in jail.

680
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:17,401
Speaker 1: It was a dungeon.

681
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:23,964
Speaker 0: dungeon is like Scott had this set piece of like, you all get your sentences and then you get carted off to the dungeon.

682
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:26,233
Speaker 0: So of course immediately we try to break out.

683
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:26,514
Speaker 0: Right.

684
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:28,624
Speaker 1: So that's a lot of game happened there.

685
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:33,884
Speaker 1: And that early part, which I kind of wanted, but I didn't realize like just how good that part would be.

686
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,213
Speaker 0: We almost escaped before we got to the dungeon.

687
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,356
Speaker 0: Like we were real close.

688
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:44,340
Speaker 0: In fact, if a certain unnamed person had not fucked shit up in our plan, we would have gotten away.

689
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,263
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:46,809
Speaker 0: So that was really good.

691
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:49,279
Speaker 0: And then he just like fucking grabbed the key and started a fight.

692
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,131
Speaker 0: And I mean, that was what they got carted off.

693
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:56,187
Speaker 1: They got thrown in the dungeon and then they were in the dungeon.

694
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,503
Speaker 1: And then of course, they're still thinking the Sutton up with this dungeon.

695
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:06,172
Speaker 1: So I had to make them think Sutton was up with the dungeon because otherwise rim wanted to just practice for the rest of his life.

696
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:08,685
Speaker 0: Luke was, I was sitting there and Scott was like, well, you're in the dungeon.

697
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:12,502
Speaker 0: So I was like, all right, I look at the practice rules and let's say anything happens.

698
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:20,031
Speaker 0: I spend the next 10 years practicing climbing and lock picking and observation and stealthy and Luke crane over her.

699
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:23,369
Speaker 0: He was in the room at the time taking pictures and Scott looks at him like what?

700
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:25,563
Speaker 0: And Luke's like, that's an awesome plan.

701
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:26,630
Speaker 1: He's like, this is legit.

702
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,661
Speaker 1: So of course I wasn't going to let that.

703
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:29,923
Speaker 1: All right.

704
00:41:29,943 --> 00:41:35,252
Speaker 1: There was already something was going to happen even though I was sort of making it up and I was like, all right, they think something's going on.

705
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:36,959
Speaker 1: Let's make a dude disappear.

706
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:37,702
Speaker 1: Right.

707
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:44,716
Speaker 1: And then they'll think there's something going on because there was nothing they could figure out to do in their cell except they were going to, God, did you have like, where did that guy go?

708
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:54,785
Speaker 1: Uh, I think that just like the, the, you know, he was an unwanted, uh, person amongst the guards and I think the guards just like killed him and him somewhere because they didn't like, they killed him by accident.

709
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:55,630
Speaker 0: I was just curious.

710
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it was something mundane.

711
00:41:57,257 --> 00:41:59,067
Speaker 1: Like, oh yeah, the guards didn't like him.

712
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,634
Speaker 1: They killed him and then they were like, oh shit.

713
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:02,905
Speaker 1: And then they hid the body or something like that.

714
00:42:02,965 --> 00:42:03,146
Speaker 1: Right.

715
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:09,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, so pretty much the routine in the jail, which I came up with was, it's a really shitty dungeon.

716
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,593
Speaker 1: It's not nice.

717
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:19,469
Speaker 1: So you get to exercise for a couple of hours in an underground room and then you go back to your cell and if anyone misbehaves in your cell, your whole cell gets punished.

718
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:24,406
Speaker 1: That way I could keep the party together and also discourage misbehavior in the dungeon.

719
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:29,165
Speaker 1: And I think I did a pretty good job of making you feel depressed like you're in a dungeon.

720
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:36,069
Speaker 0: Well, I think the crowning glory of the game was that we had this great plan with the human pyramid.

721
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:41,478
Speaker 0: that just didn't really come together the way it should have, but we ended up busting out and getting into this like abandoned part of the dungeon.

722
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:45,559
Speaker 1: I can't believe you rolled well enough to break down a cement wall with almost nothing.

723
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,728
Speaker 0: I know, following Bernie Wheel rules too.

724
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:48,572
Speaker 0: Like we pulled that shit off.

725
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:52,734
Speaker 1: I was following the rules like as hard as I could, even looking up appropriate obstacles and everything.

726
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:54,962
Speaker 1: Cause I was just like, let's just keep it real.

727
00:42:55,062 --> 00:43:00,646
Speaker 0: So we bust into this abandoned part of the dungeon and we're going and going and lower and lower and lower.

728
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:03,178
Speaker 0: And we find this great and we smash it open.

729
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:05,829
Speaker 1: It's like they were so thrilled to escape the dungeon.

730
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:07,255
Speaker 1: They were willing to go lower.

731
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:09,504
Speaker 1: It's like, I was like, you're going down.

732
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,689
Speaker 1: And they're like, okay, let's go.

733
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:11,111
Speaker 1: We run.

734
00:43:11,232 --> 00:43:11,915
Speaker 1: We're running down.

735
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:15,312
Speaker 1: And I'm like, it's an old unused part of the dungeon with like skeletons and shit.

736
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:16,677
Speaker 1: And they're like, let's go further.

737
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:17,481
Speaker 1: Keep going down.

738
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:18,264
Speaker 0: And it's like down.

739
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:18,726
Speaker 0: Really?

740
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,755
Speaker 1: You're trying to escape.

741
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:21,540
Speaker 1: Shouldn't you want to go up?

742
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:22,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:22,887
Speaker 0: Up where the guards are.

744
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:23,350
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,523
Speaker 0: So we get down, we find this great, we smash it open.

746
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:27,166
Speaker 0: We make a rope.

747
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:27,850
Speaker 0: We throw it down there.

748
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:28,653
Speaker 0: We climb down.

749
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:30,340
Speaker 0: We fall in the rope breaks.

750
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:39,120
Speaker 0: And then we realize according to the rules also, that we had found an oubliette that at itself been forgotten.

751
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:39,621
Speaker 1: Yup.

752
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:47,523
Speaker 1: And I'm assuming that we some of the other prisoners or guards might've caught up.

753
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:50,616
Speaker 0: Well, no, we could have gotten out with the human pyramid.

754
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:53,445
Speaker 1: I think the room, the room was a little too high.

755
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:56,636
Speaker 0: Human pyramid, I think would be an ops.

756
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:57,298
Speaker 0: Okay.

757
00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:01,412
Speaker 1: You get some people together, make a human pyramid and see how high you can get.

758
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:06,350
Speaker 0: I've seen some pretty high human pyramids of trained gymnasts, which you were not.

759
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,997
Speaker 0: We didn't need to get that high though.

760
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:12,770
Speaker 1: Trained non-trained gymnasts wouldn't get high at all.

761
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,450
Speaker 1: They wouldn't even get to the second level of human pyramid, which is the required level.

762
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,363
Speaker 0: Second level of human pyramid, OBS one speed test.

763
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:25,465
Speaker 0: Third level I'd make like, I don't know, plus one OBS per level, plus two OBS per level, something like that.

764
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:26,309
Speaker 1: With four people.

765
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:27,394
Speaker 1: What kind of pyramid are you going to make?

766
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:31,452
Speaker 0: Well, we had a lot more people before for the original human pyramid plan.

767
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:32,274
Speaker 1: Sure.

768
00:44:32,856 --> 00:44:33,739
Speaker 0: And then the last slot.

769
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:38,151
Speaker 0: I ran my game, which every year I tweak, it went pretty well.

770
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:48,121
Speaker 0: The, uh, the characters went right for their obscenities and they found some obscenities and it ended with possible war between nations.

771
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:50,408
Speaker 0: I don't know what I can say.

772
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:55,450
Speaker 0: I don't want to really say much about my game because every year I keep tweaking it and I think I'm running the same game.

773
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,816
Speaker 1: We can't come up with new game like me.

774
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,092
Speaker 1: I've come up with new games, but I got another new game for next year.

775
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:01,237
Speaker 0: This game.

776
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,466
Speaker 0: I'm going to tweak a little bit to try to move faster.

777
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:03,928
Speaker 0: I change.

778
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:05,073
Speaker 1: No, my game is for next year.

779
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:09,429
Speaker 1: Townsfolk just in town and there's no crazy adventure shit at all.

780
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:10,473
Speaker 1: It's just townsfolk in town.

781
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:10,874
Speaker 1: The end.

782
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:17,319
Speaker 0: So the vague idea I want to do, town drama, I wanted to be town drama and then adventures come to town.

783
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,088
Speaker 1: That's what I, that's the game I did last year.

784
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:19,931
Speaker 0: That's what I want to do.

785
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:20,714
Speaker 1: Okay.

786
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,320
Speaker 1: My game next year is just you're in a town.

787
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,455
Speaker 0: The thing is my game, the problem I had with it was that it moved too slowly.

788
00:45:27,077 --> 00:45:34,060
Speaker 0: So I made the beliefs a lot more direct and I added a lot more sort of forward momentum and stuff to do.

789
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:40,404
Speaker 0: But this time the players got really interested in the lore and started doing a lot more research early on to slow the game back down.

790
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:45,608
Speaker 0: I gotta, I gotta come up with a way around that because I want to get to the genocide much faster.

791
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:45,890
Speaker 0: Sure.

792
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:50,405
Speaker 1: In the last slot, I just like playing torchbearers so much on Saturday night.

793
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,449
Speaker 1: I played it again.

794
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,311
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

795
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:57,368
Speaker 1: And this time we went to some goblin keep and we got horribly murdered.

796
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:57,870
Speaker 1: The end.

797
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:02,042
Speaker 0: Well, you shouldn't have tried to kill those orcs.

798
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:06,177
Speaker 1: That is a thing about torchbearer, but he was such an evil orc.

799
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:06,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

800
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,667
Speaker 0: So drive them away and deal with them later.

801
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:09,410
Speaker 0: Don't try to kill him.

802
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:10,354
Speaker 1: Yeah.

803
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:13,946
Speaker 1: If we drive them away, they want to meet him along with some friends.

804
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:29,984
Speaker 0: The way conflicts work in torchbearer comes down to the idea that there's some nuance to it based on might levels and things, but like if you're fighting a dragon, it might just kill you, but you can frame the parameters of the conflict and you always get to sort of set that.

805
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:35,566
Speaker 0: So if you're trying to drive other people away, the consequences involve you being driven away instead.

806
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:41,040
Speaker 0: If you try to kill someone, the consequences involve you being killed instead.

807
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:49,346
Speaker 0: So you sort of pick what you want, but that also sort of frames what the consequences will likely be if you fail.

808
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,253
Speaker 1: And we forgot armor, so we died.

809
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:53,325
Speaker 1: If we would have remembered our armor, we would have been fine.

810
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:56,860
Speaker 0: We forgot to bring your armor into the dungeon or forgot the rules for armor.

811
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,703
Speaker 1: We had the armor.

812
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,049
Speaker 1: We forgot to count it.

813
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,056
Speaker 0: BurningCon is great fun.

814
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:10,356
Speaker 0: What's interesting is how many people fly and drive here from far away to play in BurningCon.

815
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:11,119
Speaker 0: Like, I just live here.

816
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,963
Speaker 0: I just go show up.

817
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:14,895
Speaker 0: People come from pretty fucking far away to play in these games.

818
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:15,176
Speaker 1: Yep.

819
00:47:15,718 --> 00:47:16,340
Speaker 1: They sure do.

820
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:22,102
Speaker 0: And I see the same faces every year, but also a lot of new faces, even though I didn't interface with a lot of those new faces.

821
00:47:23,147 --> 00:47:26,100
Speaker 0: I was also given a gift of a game that we have to try out at some point.

822
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,370
Speaker 0: I'll show Scott the details of that later.

823
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,051
Speaker 1: All right.

824
00:47:30,075 --> 00:47:31,542
Speaker 0: And yeah, BurningCon was super fun.

825
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:35,800
Speaker 0: And I hope to go to the sixth one, even though Luke swore that there will never be another BurningCon.

826
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:36,222
Speaker 1: What?

827
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:39,354
Speaker 0: He has sworn that at the end of every BurningCon to date.

828
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:40,016
Speaker 1: Okay.

829
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:42,724
Speaker 0: Meaning there's going to be another BurningCon.

830
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:43,446
Speaker 0: Sure.

831
00:47:43,587 --> 00:47:48,219
Speaker 1: Torchbear is going to be for sale publicly real soon.

832
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:48,560
Speaker 0: Buy it.

833
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,121
Speaker 0: Just buy it.

834
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:53,173
Speaker 0: Even if you never play it, the book is a delight to read.

835
00:47:53,193 --> 00:47:56,204
Speaker 0: Emily was home with Scott and I was like on my way.

836
00:47:56,224 --> 00:48:00,579
Speaker 0: And according to her, Scott was reading the Torchbearer book and just giggling periodically.

837
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, funny parts.

838
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:11,112
Speaker 0: The book is also so beautiful and it gives me every feels that I felt when I used to read that old Second Ed AD&D Player's Handbook.

839
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:12,255
Speaker 1: Only it's playable.

840
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:13,118
Speaker 0: Yeah.

841
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,166
Speaker 1: You should play Torchbearer.

842
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:16,608
Speaker 0: You should.

843
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:17,691
Speaker 0: Torchbearer is tits.

844
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:27,151
Speaker 1: That's like if you're in a dungeon, if you have any game involved and you want to play a game that involves going into a dungeon with monsters and loot, this is the only game that you should be playing revolving around that.

845
00:48:33,817 --> 00:48:36,059
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

846
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:41,278
