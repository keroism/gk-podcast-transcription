1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,568
Speaker 1: It's Monday, April 4th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:09,809
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:14,300
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,908
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,040
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about hosting.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,709
Speaker 1: Not just web, but all kinds of hosting.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:25,002
Speaker 1: In the year 2022.

8
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,018
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,169
Speaker 1: Because we did.

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,000
Speaker 1: This is technically a repeat.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:39,042
Speaker 1: We did a show on hosting on Monday, May 1st, 2006.

12
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot has changed since then, so therefore this is a different show.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,740
Speaker 0: I don't even know what we talked about in 2006, but I can guarantee you.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,664
Speaker 1: So here's the show notes.

15
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,720
Speaker 1: Tonight on Geek Nights, we consider internet hosting.

16
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:51,004
Speaker 1: Full stop.

17
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:55,697
Speaker 1: In the news, Linux's new wireless stack and the Apple virus.

18
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:56,299
Speaker 1: that wasn't.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,330
Speaker 1: Linux's new wireless stack.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,459
Speaker 1: 2006 was an era when we were still rocking some Linux on the desktop.

21
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:16,979
Speaker 1: That's a very Geek Nights news that I could not care less what wireless stacks exist for Linux, because it's not like I would run Linux on anything but a server anymore.

22
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:18,820
Speaker 0: Or an Android phone.

23
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:20,639
Speaker 1: I don't have an Android phone.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,691
Speaker 0: Me either, but I'm just saying.

25
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,080
Speaker 0: You need some wireless stacks for your Android phone.

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,799
Speaker 1: Yep, but I buy my Android phone from a hardware manufacturer or a company that has hardware and software already sorted out.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is all those radios are going to be supported by whatever kernels in that phone.

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,118
Speaker 1: That is true.

29
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:49,840
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess there was a new wireless stack for Linux in 2006, around May, and I guess we thought it was notable.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,366
Speaker 0: Well, anyway.

31
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:52,700
Speaker 0: So we got some Openy bit.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, you remember, we had a long hiatus, so you'd think, oh, there's a lot going on.

33
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,634
Speaker 0: We blew our entire load the last episode.

34
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:02,920
Speaker 0: Now we don't have any Openy bit left.

35
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,666
Speaker 1: We're like internet goldfish.

36
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:12,600
Speaker 1: No matter how much time passes, the next time we do a Geek Nights, whatever happened to us most recently is what comes out of our mouths, everything else is just deleted.

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,759
Speaker 1: It's like a rolling buffer.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,181
Speaker 0: Exactly.

39
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:22,940
Speaker 0: So I guess lately I've been trying, you know, I'm not trying hard to get a different job because my job is still pretty terrific.

40
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,980
Speaker 0: I'm not like, you know, running to leave even though, you know, but.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,119
Speaker 1: I mean, mine's still pretty good other than giving me COVID.

42
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:30,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

43
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,187
Speaker 0: I tell you, workers comp.

44
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,360
Speaker 0: If I were to leave, you know, now wouldn't be the worst time.

45
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:38,380
Speaker 0: So and the market is ridiculous.

46
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,279
Speaker 0: So I'm investigating because it takes no effort whatsoever, basically.

47
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:42,500
Speaker 0: Right.

48
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:48,420
Speaker 0: And even if I interview somewhere and don't take the job or don't get accepted, it's still a learning experience.

49
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,776
Speaker 0: It's not a complete waste of time.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:02,100
Speaker 0: So what really, you know, the interesting thing was recently I got so deep into an interview at one place that I only maybe would work.

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,880
Speaker 0: Maybe if I guess if I didn't have a job already, I would work there immediately.

52
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,840
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's such a different calculus.

53
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,319
Speaker 1: I've never been in a position where I didn't have a job and I was looking for one.

54
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:18,340
Speaker 0: I was after the place that when I was a long time ago in the place I worked.

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,060
Speaker 1: I remember that the where the place that buy you that car to make you drive to that office that didn't have anything.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,541
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

57
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:23,823
Speaker 0: I quit.

58
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,688
Speaker 0: I quit that place.

59
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,679
Speaker 0: It was the place that I quit to from there.

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,385
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:28,968
Speaker 1: OK.

62
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,020
Speaker 1: I'm remembering vaguely those Beacon Times.

63
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:31,881
Speaker 0: Yeah.

64
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 0: The pre-Broadway job was the one that, you know, they went under anyway.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

66
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,480
Speaker 1: I mean, even at RIT, I just had jobs.

67
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:39,382
Speaker 0: Yeah.

68
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:40,046
Speaker 0: But I got to the.

69
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,400
Speaker 0: I got to the phase of needing references.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,360
Speaker 0: And in the past, you know, I've given references in the past, but I don't think anyone's ever called any references I've given in the past ever.

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Speaker 1: So recently, just recently for a bunch of partly because we're at that age where we both like you and I are about the same age.

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,359
Speaker 1: And we know a lot of people who are little younger than us.

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,160
Speaker 1: And a lot of them are starting to make career changes or like go to grad school or like jump into other things.

74
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:13,300
Speaker 1: So a surprising number of people over the last four or five months have been asking me to write recommendation letters for them for a variety of things.

75
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:20,640
Speaker 1: And for the first time ever, one of those entities actually called me and wanted to have a conversation.

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,825
Speaker 1: I have never in my life.

77
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:25,020
Speaker 0: I also recommended a person for a thing and actually got a call.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was of course, it was academia.

79
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,820
Speaker 1: So I feel like they're the people who do it.

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,180
Speaker 1: In terms of technology, no one's ever, ever called me as a reference in my life.

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have been called as a reference one time.

82
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,720
Speaker 0: But in terms of me, you know, getting called about me, I have not heard.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,100
Speaker 0: Right.

84
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,728
Speaker 0: But so this place is what I references.

85
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:49,220
Speaker 0: So I'm like, shit, who do I get references from?

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 1: Especially if you work at a place long enough to where like, who do I know who remembers what kind of work I do, who doesn't work where I currently am?

87
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,183
Speaker 0: Exactly.

88
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,274
Speaker 0: I'm not going to give anyone I work with now.

89
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,220
Speaker 0: That would be awkward.

90
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:00,782
Speaker 0: Right.

91
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:04,818
Speaker 0: And the people I worked with at my previous job, what was that, four years ago?

92
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:05,200
Speaker 0: Right.

93
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,784
Speaker 0: It's like I had my whole.

94
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,668
Speaker 1: every three years I changed jobs.

95
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:19,060
Speaker 1: And that was a pretty good sweet spot of just ask the people who were at the previous job for a recommendation every time.

96
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,427
Speaker 1: But I just kept rolling that forward.

97
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,980
Speaker 1: But then I then I worked at one place for too long.

98
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:24,182
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 0: So but, you know, what was really interesting is like, I'm like, well, I don't have really have much of a choice here.

100
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:30,121
Speaker 0: Right.

101
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,444
Speaker 0: I'm not going to be like, no, sorry.

102
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,406
Speaker 0: I don't have any references.

103
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:33,387
Speaker 0: Yeah.

104
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,740
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I went ahead and I contacted a my boss from who haven't spoken to a previous job.

105
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,062
Speaker 0: I've spoken to in four years.

106
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:50,540
Speaker 0: I just emailed him and I finally realized, like, oh, of course, the people who I did work with at my current job who already quit.

107
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:57,660
Speaker 0: Those are the perfect people, because I have only you know, I haven't talked to them in only like, you know, six months or so.

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:57,880
Speaker 0: Right.

109
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,322
Speaker 0: When they left late last year.

110
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:12,380
Speaker 0: And interestingly enough, I guess I'm not a piece of shit because every person I contacted, even the boss who I haven't spoken to in four years, they were just like so happy to hear from me.

111
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,861
Speaker 1: Right.

112
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:19,620
Speaker 0: They're like, you know, even we didn't say a word to each other, just like as soon as we left, I left the job where they left the job.

113
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,122
Speaker 0: Complete silence.

114
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,906
Speaker 0: Never spoke to these people at all.

115
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:23,607
Speaker 0: Right.

116
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,433
Speaker 0: And then I said one email just like, hey, how you doing?

117
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,136
Speaker 0: Small talk, small talk.

118
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:29,058
Speaker 0: Can I have a reference?

119
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:29,639
Speaker 0: Thanks.

120
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:29,920
Speaker 0: Bye.

121
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,740
Speaker 0: And they're like, you know, oh, conversation, conversation, conversation.

122
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:42,035
Speaker 1: I guess my weird orthogonal situation was, you know, I just went to this conference in London.

123
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,380
Speaker 1: I hadn't been to these conferences in like four years.

124
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:54,600
Speaker 1: And a ton of people who knew me, who I haven't talked to since I quit my previous job, saw me there and were like, holy shit, it's Rym, what are you up to?

125
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:55,983
Speaker 1: None of them.

126
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,987
Speaker 0: People kept coming up to me.

127
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:02,877
Speaker 1: But they kept coming up to me having no idea where I was.

128
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,100
Speaker 1: They're like, you just disappeared.

129
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,347
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, they still had my contact info through multiple sources.

130
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,550
Speaker 1: None of that had changed.

131
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,355
Speaker 1: My LinkedIn was very clearly up to date.

132
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,620
Speaker 1: Most of them follow me on LinkedIn.

133
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,244
Speaker 1: Several of them follow me on social media.

134
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,508
Speaker 0: Who checks their LinkedIn if they're not job hunting.

135
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,800
Speaker 1: These are the kinds of people who you'd think would be checking their LinkedIn, especially if they're bugging me about like, oh, yeah, we should do some business together.

136
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,603
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, why don't you just contact me?

137
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,288
Speaker 1: Like you could have at any point over these last four years.

138
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:37,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point I want to make is that there's that certain awkwardness, you know, forget the job reference part.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,611
Speaker 0: There's a certain awkwardness to somebody you think about and maybe you want to contact them for some reason.

140
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:48,100
Speaker 0: Maybe you like them, you know, but you just haven't spoken to them in a long ass time.

141
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:56,414
Speaker 0: And so like, there's nothing to talk about because, you know, the longer you go without talking to someone, the less it's like, you know what to even say to them.

142
00:07:56,454 --> 00:08:00,000
Speaker 0: Like what TV, you don't even know what TV show they're watching to talk about or anything.

143
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:05,940
Speaker 1: Especially with people you work with who aren't like going to hit that critical mass of just longtime friendship.

144
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:06,903
Speaker 0: Exactly.

145
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,360
Speaker 0: So it's awkward to contact them out of nowhere.

146
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,828
Speaker 0: Hey there Quagmire, what you doing?

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,721
Speaker 0: Exactly.

148
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,064
Speaker 0: So, so therefore you don't contact them.

149
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:27,740
Speaker 0: So the time since you contacted them only grows and the awkwardness only grows and you're imagining, right, that like, you know, it's like, what's the, what is that awkwardness?

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,501
Speaker 0: Why is it?

151
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:28,922
Speaker 0: Right.

152
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,366
Speaker 0: It's like they're just feeling the same awkwardness.

153
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:32,707
Speaker 0: Ninety nine percent chance.

154
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:33,590
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,111
Speaker 0: Right.

156
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:38,298
Speaker 0: And they want they want to hear from you and contact you also.

157
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:39,700
Speaker 0: Like 90 percent chance.

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,866
Speaker 0: So if you just say fucking something, just be like, hi.

159
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:44,787
Speaker 0: Right.

160
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,750
Speaker 0: Just be like, I remember you exist.

161
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:47,531
Speaker 0: Right.

162
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,115
Speaker 0: I miss talking to you.

163
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:50,556
Speaker 0: Right.

164
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:51,998
Speaker 0: What's up?

165
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,240
Speaker 0: How's your life doing?

166
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Speaker 1: Well, that's something during Covid that I've noticed, like just specifically these last few years that a lot of people who I would talk to, the thing that rekindles that relationship has been meeting at a PAX every three to six months.

167
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:12,228
Speaker 1: And without that, there's a bunch of people I just haven't talked to in years.

168
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:18,320
Speaker 1: But we still like follow each other and reply to each other and do mutual crap on social media.

169
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:22,487
Speaker 1: We just don't talk directly except on semi-public social media.

170
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,049
Speaker 0: Just talking about.

171
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:31,000
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like the not the person, you know, I guess with your nerdy people and your friends, you're going to be on the social media that way.

172
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,309
Speaker 0: But like maybe a cousin and you didn't attend any family gathering.

173
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:36,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

174
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,733
Speaker 0: But they were a close ish cousin.

175
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:39,074
Speaker 0: Right.

176
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,720
Speaker 0: Or a co-worker who was cool, who quit the job that you're at.

177
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:51,620
Speaker 1: The hardest part with family is there's the family who use more Internet and it's easier to just have those like light conversations versus the family that don't really Internet at all.

178
00:09:52,441 --> 00:10:03,540
Speaker 0: Or the friend, you know, the one friend who's not in the discord for their own reasons, you know, but is still but still wants to talk to people but has their reasons for not being in the social medias.

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,780
Speaker 0: Right.

180
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:17,494
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, it's every single person I contact, I think I like three or four people and every single one was like, oh, I guess they got.

181
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:21,359
Speaker 0: I guess the company is going to call them to ask about me and who knows what the fuck they're going to say.

182
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,440
Speaker 0: Don't hire this piece of shit.

183
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:34,320
Speaker 0: Well, so the other thing that happens, because in my own life, if they said bad things to the company that calls them, that would be a huge divergence for the emails they sent to me, which were very cordial.

184
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:43,991
Speaker 1: So in my experience, like looking at these kinds of things from a hiring perspective, basically every company, especially larger companies, they usually have a policy where they will.

185
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:51,900
Speaker 1: the company will officially never respond to any inquiry about previous employees with anything but confirming the dates they worked and confirming their salary.

186
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:52,601
Speaker 0: Right.

187
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:53,604
Speaker 0: But this isn't this isn't.

188
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:57,592
Speaker 0: they're not calling the current employer or previous employer, right?

189
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:00,880
Speaker 0: They're talking to, you know, former co-workers who are now.

190
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:15,140
Speaker 1: But that was the problem I used to run into in the earlier days, like the aughts in that I would not have any contact info for someone I wanted to like use as a reference except their company contact info.

191
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:28,820
Speaker 0: Ah, you know what saved me is that at my company, when it when people leave, there's actually a slack channel called Arrivals Hyphen Celebrations.

192
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,585
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's so.

193
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:37,678
Speaker 0: they announce arrivals and celebrations in there, you know, new dog, new baby, you know, new promotion, new hire.

194
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,039
Speaker 0: Right.

195
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,503
Speaker 0: But also when someone's leaving.

196
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:41,484
Speaker 0: Right.

197
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:44,489
Speaker 0: If they're not let go, it's a celebration.

198
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,271
Speaker 0: And sometimes even if they're let go.

199
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:46,932
Speaker 0: Right.

200
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:52,340
Speaker 0: They go into that channel and make a post like I'm leaving, you know, it was great working with you.

201
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,505
Speaker 0: I'm going to miss you guys, et cetera.

202
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,810
Speaker 0: And everyone throws a bunch of emojis under it.

203
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

204
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,473
Speaker 0: And it is a thread.

205
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:00,195
Speaker 0: Right.

206
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:00,997
Speaker 0: Like I miss you.

207
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:01,718
Speaker 0: You're awesome.

208
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:02,339
Speaker 0: Good luck.

209
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:12,553
Speaker 0: But people always put their personal email and phone number in that goodbye post every single time, which is an indicator they want you to contact them.

211
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:15,697
Speaker 0: And and I tested that theory and it's correct.

212
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,440
Speaker 0: They do want you to contact them when they do that.

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,365
Speaker 0: They didn't want you to contact them.

214
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:22,678
Speaker 0: They wouldn't put their personal phone number in the slack of a company.

215
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:23,100
Speaker 0: they're quitting.

216
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:35,020
Speaker 1: The funny thing is that that whole dynamic, that's actually the only reason I started using LinkedIn was that replaced having to keep track of the contact info for whoever I happen to work with at a company.

217
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,122
Speaker 0: I just went into the slack and I googled.

218
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,367
Speaker 0: I typed their name in because their account is still there is just deactivated.

219
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:48,520
Speaker 1: So but also coming out like in this environment after a few years, not seeing people, I look in LinkedIn just to remember, like, all right, I just talked to someone online.

220
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:56,190
Speaker 1: Let me see if I am supposed to already know who this person is or not, because let's move on to some news.

221
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,570
Speaker 0: All right.

222
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:04,660
Speaker 1: So in some news for a couple of weeks ago, and I'm not going to go too deep into the specifics of what Vimeo is doing, because you can read this article.

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,468
Speaker 1: It's extremely detailed, but this is not the only platform that is doing this kind of thing.

224
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:11,550
Speaker 1: This is a trend.

225
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:18,780
Speaker 1: This trend is only going to continue, and it is the kind of thing that affects people like us, people like many of you.

226
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:27,235
Speaker 1: A lot of small time creators don't think that much about these kinds of problems and then get super fucked down the road.

227
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,560
Speaker 1: No platform is immune to this.

228
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,106
Speaker 1: And basically Vimeo is a place you can host videos.

229
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:45,240
Speaker 1: And it's funny because a lot of people see Vimeo as this sort of like it's the non YouTube version, like I could use YouTube or I could use Vimeo and they cater to slightly different demographics.

230
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:51,600
Speaker 1: But people didn't really pay attention that Vimeo has not seen itself that way for a long time.

231
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,339
Speaker 0: I don't think it ever saw itself that way.

232
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:54,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
00:13:55,041 --> 00:14:04,340
Speaker 1: The only people who saw it that way were people who moved to Vimeo to avoid copyright issues on YouTube before Vimeo had any reasonable way to enforce copyright stuff.

234
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:16,400
Speaker 1: So Vimeo is really a platform that you can pay to host video, but it is not a destination for people to go to just watch random videos.

235
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,985
Speaker 1: It's more like a product, a B2B business to business product.

236
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,049
Speaker 1: for someone who has video.

237
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:29,059
Speaker 1: they need to host somewhere to host it so that they can build whatever ecosystem they're going to build around that video or incorporating that video.

238
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:36,891
Speaker 0: You got your own website, you know, and you want to put videos on that website and you don't want to build video hosting infrastructure.

240
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:37,352
Speaker 0: Right.

241
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:42,440
Speaker 0: Which we'll talk about in the main vid, I guess maybe you can just pay Vimeo and they'll do that for you.

242
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,281
Speaker 0: Right.

243
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:52,320
Speaker 0: I think the number one use of Vimeo these days, it's not the number one use of YouTube, but it is also a use of YouTube is Patreon.

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,951
Speaker 0: Patreon does not have unlike all the other like big social type sites, I guess.

245
00:14:57,971 --> 00:15:02,460
Speaker 0: I don't know if Patreon really falls into those categories, but they don't host their own videos at all.

246
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:14,380
Speaker 0: If you make a Patreon and you want to have videos to your patrons, you need to host those videos with Vimeo or YouTube and that integrates with, you know, embed them in as Patreon posts.

247
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:23,913
Speaker 1: And they have some good integrations with different platforms, but yeah, and they'll host other things like they'll host your images, they'll host your audio.

248
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:27,258
Speaker 1: There's a free mirror version of Geek Nights hosted there because why not?

249
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,520
Speaker 1: Why not have it in one more place?

250
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they won't do videos.

251
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:39,014
Speaker 0: You have to use YouTube or Vimeo in combination with your Patreon and I think that is one of the most popular uses of Vimeo these days.

252
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 0: is Patreon video embedding because you don't want to use YouTube for some reason.

253
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,422
Speaker 1: But here's where this is a problem.

254
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:49,367
Speaker 1: How is that a good business model for Vimeo.

255
00:15:49,627 --> 00:16:02,220
Speaker 1: if say I'm a creator making a podcast like, I don't know, Bleak Nights and we decide to like do our video and we want to host it somewhere and have a Patreon and we only let people who pay us on the Patreon see the videos.

256
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,007
Speaker 1: So we pay Vimeo, we put the videos on Vimeo and we give access to those videos to people who pay us on Patreon.

257
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:19,140
Speaker 1: So now Vimeo as a platform compared to say YouTube with all their ads and nonsense isn't monetizing my videos, I am paying them for hosting.

258
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:29,210
Speaker 1: That is a very different relationship because I'm making my money from Patreon or whatever other platform I might be using and this is just a hosting platform.

259
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:37,319
Speaker 1: So if I am paying them a small amount because I don't have that many videos and I'm using a lot of bandwidth, I'm just costing Vimeo money.

260
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,520
Speaker 1: They're getting nothing from me.

261
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,619
Speaker 0: YouTube is expensive to host.

262
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:52,972
Speaker 1: But YouTube meanwhile, the only reason they get away with having that kind of relationship is that even if you're a small time creator making nothing, if nobody watches your videos, they don't care.

263
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 1: And if a ton of people watch your videos, they monetize your videos and take money from your viewers basically.

264
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:07,246
Speaker 0: YouTube also is driving views to the ads to make money.

265
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:12,711
Speaker 0: They have that machine running and your content is really just fuel for that machine.

266
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,615
Speaker 0: Vimeo has no such machine.

267
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:22,420
Speaker 0: The only way Vimeo can get more money is if the people who are uploading videos pay them more money.

268
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:42,400
Speaker 1: Yep, and what this really seems to come down to is people will pay $200, $300, $400 a year for this service and Vimeo has started to reach out to a very small number of creators who aren't paying for that much hosting but represent an extreme or disproportionate number of downloads, a huge amount of bandwidth.

269
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,480
Speaker 1: Apparently they only go after you if you are using three to four terabytes of download a month.

270
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:52,386
Speaker 0: How much is a popular YouTube channel?

271
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:57,514
Speaker 0: It's probably using many terabytes of download a month, right?

272
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,116
Speaker 0: Someone just got a million views.

273
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,077
Speaker 0: Let me do some math.

274
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:00,598
Speaker 0: Let's see.

275
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:01,780
Speaker 0: You talk while I do math.

276
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, so I can even pull up the gig night stuff.

277
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:11,230
Speaker 1: So we have an average if I go to the YouTube studio, which I have to open in a window that's not public right here.

278
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,113
Speaker 1: I got to click and I got to click and get to analytics.

279
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,034
Speaker 1: So let's see.

280
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:20,120
Speaker 1: We get an average of about 10,000 views of our videos a month, let's say.

281
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,460
Speaker 0: All right.

282
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:31,510
Speaker 0: So if you have a 500 megabyte video, right, which is, you know, a nice chunky MP4, let's say, right.

283
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:38,436
Speaker 0: And you have a million views, which is a big, you know, a real well viewed video.

284
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:43,120
Speaker 0: That's going to be 500 terabytes of download in the million views.

285
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,641
Speaker 1: All right.

286
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:47,286
Speaker 1: Out of my 3.5 terabytes total that I'm allowed to have per month.

287
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,209
Speaker 0: OK, exactly.

288
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:49,690
Speaker 1: Yep.

289
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:54,276
Speaker 1: So you can read this article that talks about all the details and all the changes Vimeo's had.

290
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,660
Speaker 1: It's very long and thorough, but the moral is very simple.

291
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,008
Speaker 1: If you are a creator, every platform you use is a risk to you.

292
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:08,894
Speaker 1: You cannot assume the platforms will continue to exist in the way you currently use them.

293
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:21,047
Speaker 1: The more reliant you are on any platform, any kind of hosting, especially a particular specific provider of that hosting, the more vulnerable you are to them changing anything about that relationship.

294
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:34,740
Speaker 1: And if you make a business that assumes things like YouTube and Vimeo exist to be the backbone of your business, you're basically just skimming off at the top of a giant company that might disappear or fuck you over any day.

295
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:50,620
Speaker 1: And the real problem here is that there's a huge number of small time creators, which is cool, like that's a fun, exciting thing, who they complain that they can't monetize their content, but their content doesn't get that many views anyway.

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,427
Speaker 1: There's this huge class of content creators who basically just cost platforms money and at some point that ecosystem is going to break.

297
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:12,940
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of platforms are going to start cutting off small providers or small content creators or heavily limiting how much small content creators can use those platforms without either paying or being monetizable by those platforms.

298
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:13,901
Speaker 0: Yep.

299
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,404
Speaker 0: It's like, "Hey, I got videos on Vimeo.

300
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:18,146
Speaker 0: Please, Vimeo, don't shut down my

301
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:18,646
Speaker 0: account.".

302
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,548
Speaker 0: And Vimeo's like, "Well, give us

303
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:20,869
Speaker 0: money.".

304
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:21,349
Speaker 0: "No.".

305
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,712
Speaker 0: "Okay, we'll keep hosting you for the small amount of

306
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:23,972
Speaker 0: money.".

307
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,194
Speaker 0: "Oh, we went out of business.

308
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:26,335
Speaker 0: Everyone's videos are gone.

309
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:26,636
Speaker 0: That's a

310
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:27,036
Speaker 0: shame.".

311
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,300
Speaker 0: What other outcome were you expecting?

312
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:40,067
Speaker 1: Well, this also applies to people who get mad that YouTube won't let them monetize unless they have a certain number of views or a certain number of hours watched or a certain number of subscribers.

313
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:52,737
Speaker 1: But those people seem to forget that if you're below those honestly extremely low thresholds, Twitch is included in this too, like any platform, even if they let you monetize, you're going to be making dozens of cents a month.

314
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,419
Speaker 1: You're not going to make enough money to make a difference in your life.

315
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:56,380
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what...

316
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,507
Speaker 0: It's going to cost them more money.

317
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,940
Speaker 0: And if they did that for everyone, they'd go out of business and everyone's videos would be gone.

318
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,140
Speaker 1: Yep.

319
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,686
Speaker 1: What you're actually complaining about is, "Why won't capitalism pay you to do what you

320
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:05,927
Speaker 1: love?".

321
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,169
Speaker 1: And yeah, guess what?

322
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:07,569
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:09,112
Speaker 1: Geek Nights does not fund my life.

324
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:14,020
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is profitable if you don't account the labor that me and Scott spend on Geek Nights.

325
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,345
Speaker 0: Don't be mad at Vimeo and YouTube about this.

326
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:20,273
Speaker 0: Be mad at capitalism and support public funding of the arts.

327
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:23,539
Speaker 0: And then you'll just get money from the government and then you won't have to fight with...

328
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,543
Speaker 1: Don't even be mad at Adam Smith.

329
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Speaker 1: That form of capitalism assumes things like living wages and reasonable hours.

330
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:33,440
Speaker 1: Be mad at the actual capitalism that we actually have in the real world.

331
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,402
Speaker 0: All right, let's move on.

332
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:36,365
Speaker 0: We're dragging a bit here.

333
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:43,095
Speaker 0: So speaking of capitalism and internet platforms, Twitch has... I think we talked about this when it was first in news.

334
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:43,676
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

335
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:44,457
Speaker 0: I think we did.

336
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:45,819
Speaker 0: But they had a feature...

337
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,918
Speaker 1: I was mad about it.

338
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:54,370
Speaker 0: They got a feature where you can basically pay to get your Twitch stream boosted up to the front page.

339
00:21:54,431 --> 00:22:01,000
Speaker 0: So I guess your Twitch viewers would start boosting you and get a hype train going, get a boost train or whatever.

340
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,160
Speaker 0: And that would get your stream onto the front page of Twitch, which would then help you out even more.

341
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:22,700
Speaker 1: Which all I got to say, that whole ecosystem, in case we didn't say it when we did a show before, that reeks of how time shares get monetized in that they distance what the money is being used for and what you're actually paying for from the results of that money.

342
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,435
Speaker 1: And they're basically tricking fans of someone else into paying them to promote you.

343
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,140
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous.

344
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:42,878
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what happened is some genius started streaming some porn because even though it's against the Twitch terms of service, it's hard to police live streams and they had to find it first.

345
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,107
Speaker 0: You can stream porn on Twitch and get away with it for a little while until it's detected.

346
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:54,395
Speaker 0: And then they boosted that shit right to the front page and then they got shut down.

347
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,738
Speaker 0: But not before everyone noticed.

348
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:57,740
Speaker 0: And that's funny.

349
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:01,240
Speaker 0: And now, as a result, Twitch removed this feature.

350
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 1: Thankfully.

351
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, because, but also I guess whoever did this just gave Amazon a bunch of free money.

352
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:09,497
Speaker 0: Right?

353
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:21,313
Speaker 1: But that's, there's so much buried beneath, like the story itself is interesting, but the just sheer toxic nature of how Twitch monetizes.

354
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:26,360
Speaker 1: the desire for fame among the people who use Twitch is increasingly bothering me.

355
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,224
Speaker 1: And this is just a very strong example of that.

356
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,448
Speaker 1: But also it was a very poorly thought out feature.

357
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:41,980
Speaker 1: Twitch seems to have a recent history of features that as soon as they go live immediately cause all the harms that everyone saw coming a mile away before they had launched it.

358
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:49,910
Speaker 0: I guess what is interesting is that, you know, Twitch in this case actually acted counter to capitalism.

359
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,271
Speaker 0: Right?

360
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:57,560
Speaker 0: You know, it's an, this is an example of where, you know, moderating, you know, it by, you know, cracking down on these things.

361
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:01,345
Speaker 0: They're actually, you know, costing themselves money.

362
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:01,805
Speaker 0: Right.

363
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:04,308
Speaker 0: But they went ahead and did it anyway.

364
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:04,789
Speaker 0: Right.

365
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:13,360
Speaker 0: It's like they could have just let this go and they would have made a piles and piles of more money for people doing all sorts of, you know, bad stuff with this feature.

366
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,563
Speaker 0: Instead, they turn the feature off.

367
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:22,452
Speaker 1: Well, they're also getting a lot of flack from basically people who are already traditionally marginalized by.

368
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:28,340
Speaker 1: people would pay to promote them to the front page and then harassment brigades would see them and go after them.

369
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:35,700
Speaker 1: All sorts of bad outcomes that were all perfectly obvious from long before this feature went live.

370
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,186
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that happened.

371
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:40,467
Speaker 0: Yep.

372
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:44,520
Speaker 1: I guess you want to talk about the Amazon chat app?

373
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,622
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

374
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,286
Speaker 0: So, you know, I just talked about Slack, right?

375
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:50,071
Speaker 0: Which I think every company uses.

376
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:52,658
Speaker 0: Even Apple has Slack, right?

377
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:53,540
Speaker 0: Which is really weird to me.

378
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,820
Speaker 1: Even my company uses it for some teams, but I don't use it for anything.

379
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:10,080
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh, but yeah, so Amazon apparently is trying to make their own Slack, an internal employee chat app and for, you know, specifically for Amazon, not for the public, right?

380
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,482
Speaker 0: They're not going to go compete with Slack.

381
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,306
Speaker 0: At least there's no news of that yet.

382
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:21,240
Speaker 0: They're just making, they want the Amazon employees to use a chat app that is not Slack, that is the Amazon employee chat app.

383
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,838
Speaker 1: And that they've already said is designed to "boost

384
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:25,320
Speaker 1: happiness."

385
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

386
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:41,377
Speaker 0: Um, but the, what's making the headlines is supposedly there was some document leakage that may or may not be true or something like that, but, uh, that many words are banned for use in the chat app.

387
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,020
Speaker 0: Like you can't say "union" on it and such.

388
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,800
Speaker 1: Ethics, robots, bathroom.

389
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

390
00:25:47,580 --> 00:26:03,320
Speaker 0: So who knows if that's true or not, but it, you know, does raise a specter of, you know, if your company's chat app, um, you know, or internal communication systems, you know, I mean, forget if, right?

391
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,004
Speaker 0: They are controlled by the company.

392
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:09,153
Speaker 0: Even if you use Slack, your company could always like make a Slack plugin.

393
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:12,400
Speaker 0: that's like monitoring everything everyone says, even in the private chats.

394
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,080
Speaker 1: I mean, were I trying to say unionize a workplace I was in, I would not use anything the company provided under any circumstances.

395
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,120
Speaker 0: Exactly.

396
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:30,613
Speaker 0: So just, you know, it's like a reminder whether this is how much, how much truth there is in the story that, uh, Amazon is foolishly anti-union.

397
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:35,360
Speaker 0: They spent like millions of dollars trying to fight unions and Staten Island Unioned anyway.

398
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:45,420
Speaker 0: The amount of money they spent fighting the union, they could have just given that money to the employees and they wouldn't have made a union because their salaries would have been so much higher.

399
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,779
Speaker 1: Or they could have given the salaries, they would have made a union anyway and everyone would have been better off.

400
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

401
00:26:51,241 --> 00:27:04,940
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, but regardless, um, you know, internal company chat apps are for use them for your work and, you know, completely safe chit chats, you know, don't use them for anything else.

402
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:08,740
Speaker 0: Especially not trying to unionize the workplace that controls the chat app.

403
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,500
Speaker 1: Yup.

404
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,543
Speaker 1: But also it sounds so dystopian.

405
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:19,555
Speaker 1: They outlined that the app would encourage "shout outs" and offer digital rewards for providing value to the company.

406
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:21,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, digital rewards.

407
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:21,979
Speaker 1: Why not just give them money?

408
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,199
Speaker 0: You know, cause digital rewards don't cost anything.

409
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,585
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

410
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:36,346
Speaker 1: So check this out.

411
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:41,636
Speaker 1: If you use Blender for like 3D modeling and such, there is a plugin for Blender.

412
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:44,760
Speaker 1: What that plugin does, it's called Fast 64.

413
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:54,080
Speaker 1: It basically lets you make and export assets that could be used directly in games that use the Mario 64/Ocarina of Time engine.

414
00:27:54,641 --> 00:28:00,572
Speaker 1: So you can make assets to use in your N64 game that you're making.

415
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,415
Speaker 0: Like if that's something you're trying to do.

416
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a cool thing.

417
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:04,639
Speaker 1: That's not my thing of the day.

418
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,240
Speaker 1: That's just cool.

419
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:27,657
Speaker 1: So because of this, if you're making levels in Blender that you intend to use with this engine, or maybe not, and you're using this plugin, then the plugin also gives you the ability to drop a little Mario directly into Blender and have him just be fully controllable and jump around whatever it is.

420
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,340
Speaker 1: you've got open right now in Blender.

421
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,706
Speaker 0: Is this plugin like a commercial product that you buy?

422
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:32,766
Speaker 1: No.

423
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:33,548
Speaker 1: Just free.

424
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:33,929
Speaker 0: Okay.

425
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,260
Speaker 0: I was gonna say, cause Nintendo would come after them for using a Mario and not a generic dude.

426
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,705
Speaker 1: Yep, it's just free.

427
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:45,455
Speaker 1: I think you might need to have the asset pack to make it work.

428
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:46,838
Speaker 1: I didn't dig too closely into it.

429
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:47,199
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

430
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:47,860
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

431
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,904
Speaker 1: But that's not hard.

432
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:52,600
Speaker 1: That's like in the old Doom days where you'd get the fake WAD, you replace it with the real WAD.

433
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,447
Speaker 0: So basically you can make any 3D environment and make a Mario jump around it.

434
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,088
Speaker 1: Exactly.

435
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:02,280
Speaker 1: And all the other Blender stuff like voxel remeshing just works on the Mario.

436
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, it won't work when you load that into an N64.

437
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:06,489
Speaker 1: Oh no.

438
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,238
Speaker 1: You can make some really slick looking Marios that can never run on N64 hardware.

439
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:11,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

440
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:16,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, make a 3D model and just drop Mario in and he's just there, fully functional.

441
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,385
Speaker 0: So everyone knows emulators, right?

442
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:25,357
Speaker 0: You know, you can run software meant for another computer on a different computer, right?

443
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:26,680
Speaker 0: Or a different platform.

444
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:30,127
Speaker 0: Get an NES game to run on a PC, et cetera.

445
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:36,160
Speaker 0: And most of the time it's used for, you know, video games and whatnot, where it's just a single ROM, right?

446
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Speaker 0: You know, but, you know, it's a lot more complicated to emulate a computer, especially a computer that has, you know, like multiprocessing, right?

447
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:53,000
Speaker 0: You know, cause you got to like set up the OS and you know, usually use virtual machines to do that sort of thing and not emulators.

448
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,960
Speaker 0: And particularly complicated is when the architecture of the system you're trying to emulate is so vastly different from your local architecture.

449
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:12,840
Speaker 0: But somehow some nerds got Mac OS 7 and 8 to run emulated in a web browser and they set it up for you.

450
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,392
Speaker 1: To somebody who grew up in the late 1900s, this is amazing.

451
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,406
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:21,960
Speaker 0: And they set it up with all kinds of software pre-installed and pre-configured.

453
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:32,100
Speaker 0: And you can even like, you could even like make up a, you could open up Photoshop 3.0, draw a picture, drag it, and then it'll download in your browser.

454
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:35,492
Speaker 0: It'll act like you downloaded a file and then you could have that file.

455
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,780
Speaker 0: I made a JPEG and I downloaded it.

456
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:46,361
Speaker 0: And sure enough, I had the JPEG in my windows that I drew in a, in Firefox, in a Mac, in Photoshop 3.

457
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,684
Speaker 0: I got the JPEG to come out.

458
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:53,920
Speaker 0: I could have uploaded that JPEG to like, you know, my own website or the Geek Nights Discord or whatever.

459
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,880
Speaker 1: So I'm not connected to Apple talk, so I can't use Apple share.

460
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't use that.

461
00:30:58,183 --> 00:31:03,456
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you've never used a computer running, you know, Mac OS 7 or 8, the 7.1 works the best, I think.

462
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:12,460
Speaker 0: If you're not, if you haven't, you know, had that experience, you know, you know what it's like, I highly recommend just going to this website.

463
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:17,398
Speaker 0: And you can mess around a whole lot with Mac OS 7 and see what it was like.

464
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,180
Speaker 0: Because, you know, the only people who used it were like big Mac nerds.

465
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,037
Speaker 0: I mean, I've definitely, everyone else had, everyone else had like Windows, Windows 95 and shit.

466
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,105
Speaker 1: I've never used it in my life.

467
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:34,940
Speaker 1: I used DOS 6 something, Windows 3.1, Windows 3.1.1.

468
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,319
Speaker 1: All the Windows is except millennia, millennium after that.

469
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:41,488
Speaker 0: And I only use them at school.

470
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,696
Speaker 0: And we had one friend who had Mac OS 9, right?

471
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,681
Speaker 0: 8, 9.

472
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,067
Speaker 1: I did have a laptop when I worked at IBM.

473
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:55,400
Speaker 1: It was a 386 and it ran a local semi proprietary operating system.

474
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:56,644
Speaker 0: Yeah.

475
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:57,240
Speaker 0: Anyway.

476
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,581
Speaker 1: All right.

477
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:07,459
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, which we will be doing, not this week on Thursday, but next week on Thursday, the 14th, The City We Became by N.K.

478
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:07,880
Speaker 1: Jemisin.

479
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:10,698
Speaker 1: What a Geek Nights Book Club book this is.

480
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,038
Speaker 0: Did you finish it?

481
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:13,756
Speaker 1: Not yet, but nearly so.

482
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:14,902
Speaker 0: Okay.

483
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:16,500
Speaker 0: I finished the thing like so fast.

484
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,371
Speaker 1: I didn't read it while I had COVID.

485
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:19,760
Speaker 1: I just slept.

486
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,965
Speaker 0: All right.

487
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:23,855
Speaker 0: Anyway, any other meta things?

488
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:24,820
Speaker 0: PAX East is coming.

489
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,302
Speaker 0: Yep.

490
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,140
Speaker 1: I will be there on the Thursday.

491
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,079
Speaker 0: You're bringing your COVID to PAX East?

492
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:38,060
Speaker 1: I mean, the 21st, actually my work is weirdly wants me to come in as early as this coming Friday, even though I'm like still slightly symptomatic.

493
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,210
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

494
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,020
Speaker 1: They just don't get, no one cares anymore.

495
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:41,980
Speaker 0: Well.

496
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:51,640
Speaker 1: But Thursday, April 21st, the only day I will be at PAX, much like Unplugged, gonna roll in in a mask, do the panel and roll right back out.

497
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,508
Speaker 0: And if you- Sit in the back.

498
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,700
Speaker 0: If you go to that, sit in the back.

499
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:59,297
Speaker 1: If you are gonna be there, come on in.

500
00:32:59,317 --> 00:32:59,740
Speaker 1: It'll be fun.

501
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:11,620
Speaker 1: Don't go to PAX East just to see this panel if you're not already going, because just like with Unplugged, I guarantee to you video of this panel will be on YouTube before PAX East is over.

502
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,159
Speaker 1: It's a rock fact.

503
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:15,738
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

504
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,046
Speaker 1: All right.

505
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,623
Speaker 0: And I guess- That's all the meta we got.

506
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:23,540
Speaker 0: I'm working on the, I worked a whole bunch on the website and it's weird because I made a ton of progress.

507
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,686
Speaker 0: But all that I did, I just, I, you know, I'm overbuilding it, right?

508
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:33,420
Speaker 0: I built some enormous thing to fully support like the ultimate pod, every RSS spec for podcasts.

509
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,600
Speaker 1: I've never regretted overbuilding anything in my life and I've regretted many times when I underbuilt something.

510
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,140
Speaker 0: And I wrote like 200 lines of tests for, to make sure the XML is like correct.

511
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,910
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, so it's like.

512
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,159
Speaker 0: I made a lot of progress, but what did I really make?

513
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:49,760
Speaker 0: RSS feed.

514
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:51,884
Speaker 0: That's it.

515
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,059
Speaker 0: We got to move on to the next part, right?

516
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:55,220
Speaker 1: It's exciting though.

517
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,815
Speaker 0: I'm working on it.

518
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,940
Speaker 1: This coincides with slowly ramping up content and fun stuff again.

519
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:02,884
Speaker 0: Yeah.

520
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, main bit, hosting, right?

521
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:12,840
Speaker 0: So in the year 2006, if you wanted to host, you know, web services or internet services, right?

522
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:15,980
Speaker 0: There were ways you could go about this way.

523
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,940
Speaker 0: Number one was to, you know, there wasn't like Oz and these cloud hosts weren't really a thing then.

524
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:25,440
Speaker 0: I guess maybe they kind of existed sort of.

525
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,579
Speaker 0: When did EC2 come out?

526
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,518
Speaker 1: That's what I was just looking up.

527
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:32,679
Speaker 1: EC2 initial release, August 25th, 2006.

528
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,657
Speaker 1: So months after we did this episode, Amazon EC2 launch.

529
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:39,819
Speaker 1: Think about that for a minute.

530
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:40,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

531
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,257
Speaker 0: So in, you know, in those days, the way you could host internet services was to own a data center with hardware in it.

532
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,617
Speaker 0: Co-locate your own hardware into an existing data center.

533
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,920
Speaker 0: Somehow have a static IP address and then your own hardware in your house or some shit.

534
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,237
Speaker 1: Which I weirdly did in high school in the 90s.

535
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,620
Speaker 0: We did in college when you had a static IP address.

536
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,640
Speaker 1: I had a static IP in high school because of the extremely early cable modem network I was on.

537
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:09,679
Speaker 0: Yep.

538
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,819
Speaker 0: Use dynamic DNS.

539
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,197
Speaker 0: Some sort of.

540
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,340
Speaker 0: There's a couple of ways of doing dynamic DNS.

541
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,100
Speaker 0: None of them are amazing, but they kind of can work if you do them right.

542
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,866
Speaker 0: Sorta.

543
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,660
Speaker 0: And your IP address changes at your house, but you still have server at your house and it still mostly works all the time.

544
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:27,357
Speaker 0: You know, cause you did, you did it right.

545
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:28,838
Speaker 0: Were there.

546
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,779
Speaker 0: And the last way was to pay for hosting.

547
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,459
Speaker 0: So someone else has a server and they let you use it.

548
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:37,060
Speaker 0: Right.

549
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:54,440
Speaker 0: So, uh, and that means either a you're like getting your FTP files into a folder on the server and they're running services on the server that you're then using like my SQL database or Apache with mod PHP or something like that.

550
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:58,380
Speaker 0: Or you're just, it's effectively the same as co-locating.

551
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:01,160
Speaker 0: You just don't own the hardware, but you're just renting hardware.

552
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,163
Speaker 0: That's in a data center.

553
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:08,480
Speaker 0: or, uh, they're running virtual machines on hardware in a data center.

554
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,860
Speaker 1: So now this was a long time ago.

555
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,280
Speaker 1: Virtualization was quite different from how it is today.

556
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,100
Speaker 0: Right.

557
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:25,520
Speaker 0: You can still get VPCs today, which is still what I use a lot of the time, but the way those were implemented in those days was like using Zen or things like that that are not used anymore.

558
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,879
Speaker 0: That's the very old way of doing it.

559
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,300
Speaker 0: But regardless, one big piece of hardware running effectively many virtual computers inside of it, one of which belongs to you.

560
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,800
Speaker 1: But the fundamental unit was either a computer with a full ass operating system that you can just use as a computer.

561
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,640
Speaker 1: Run it like install Apache, run Apache, do stuff with Apache.

562
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:55,100
Speaker 1: It's just like a computer in your house or someone else is running an IRC server or someone else is running it like that and they give you limited access to it.

563
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:56,776
Speaker 1: That was pretty much it.

564
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,560
Speaker 0: Well, there was one more option.

565
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:07,560
Speaker 0: There was one more option, which was the GeoCities style option where, you know, like it's live journal or something like that.

566
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,519
Speaker 0: Well, content hosting, pure content hosting.

567
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Speaker 0: It's like you want to host something specific and there's somebody who hosts that specific thing.

568
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,380
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike server, blog, right?

569
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,799
Speaker 1: That did exist back then.

570
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,000
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of platforms that did that kind of thing.

571
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:25,220
Speaker 1: They were just extremely limited.

572
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:31,300
Speaker 1: And a big part of why we talked about hosting back in 2006 was that we wanted to do a podcast.

573
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:35,960
Speaker 1: Back then, there weren't even really like many dedicated podcasting services.

574
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:40,900
Speaker 1: Pretty much had to run a real Linux server in the sky to make Geek Nights happen.

575
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,199
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what has changed since then?

576
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,240
Speaker 0: Well, the first thing that's changed obviously is the introduction of the cloud providers, right?

577
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,820
Speaker 0: Amazon, obviously the biggest one because your Azure, your Google cloud and some other competitors out there that are smaller.

578
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,700
Speaker 0: Those are the big three basically.

579
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:05,860
Speaker 0: And the deal with them is that it's like it's not just, you know, data center host a machine.

580
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:13,080
Speaker 0: It's like every function of the data center is turned into like a different parceled out specific service.

581
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:20,860
Speaker 0: And you sort of have to orchestrate and architect a system that, you know, incorporates all those different pieces together.

582
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,027
Speaker 1: That is relatively new over the last five to eight years.

583
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:34,960
Speaker 1: in that earlier, like we would have talked about EC2 or cloud servers back then until relatively recently.

584
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,620
Speaker 1: It's still, it's a server virtualized as far as you're concerned with an operating system.

585
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:43,480
Speaker 1: You're still installing software into that operating system.

586
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:48,200
Speaker 1: It just happens to itself be virtualized at scale by another company.

587
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,180
Speaker 1: But then as Scott pointed out, this ecosystem expanded where like Amazon is a good example bit by bit.

588
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,076
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, hey, we have a DNS service you can use.

589
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:56,760
Speaker 1: that's cloud native.

590
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 1: We have a networking service, a firewall, a load balancer, and they kept a middleware, enterprise service bus.

591
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,940
Speaker 1: They kept adding cloud native services that you could run headless.

592
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,660
Speaker 1: They didn't need a server running Linux or Windows or something.

593
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,660
Speaker 1: They were just a service endpoint you could leverage.

594
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:19,820
Speaker 1: You could make a website where there's no actual EC2 instance at any point if you wanted to today.

595
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:21,062
Speaker 0: Yep.

596
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:27,680
Speaker 0: A very popular architecture on OZ specifically is to use API gateway backed by lambdas, right?

597
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:36,800
Speaker 0: So someone will make an API call and this lambda that only does one thing will spin up, run one thing, spit out the dirt JSON response and go back to sleep.

598
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:44,780
Speaker 1: So if a thousand people hit your service at the same time, a thousand lambdas spin up and each one handles one of those requests completely independently of each other.

599
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,200
Speaker 0: Depending on your setting.

600
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on what you do with it, obviously.

601
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:48,780
Speaker 0: Right.

602
00:39:50,282 --> 00:40:04,540
Speaker 0: So the reason this is so fascinating from a technological perspective is that basically at the Amazon data center, it's like they just got tons of storage, tons of hardware all over the place.

603
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,204
Speaker 0: And they've.

604
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:11,720
Speaker 0: the cloud service is actually like this abstraction layer on top of it.

605
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:15,760
Speaker 0: And there's this, you know, middle stuff that you don't get to see unless you work there.

606
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:17,840
Speaker 0: So I don't fully know how most of it works.

607
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:26,700
Speaker 0: I know some parts I've read about, but it's like they're basically, you know, parceling everything out and getting like incredible efficiency.

608
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:27,722
Speaker 0: Right.

609
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:32,720
Speaker 0: You know, it's not like, oh, some guy rented this whole server and he's got Apache running on it.

610
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:37,620
Speaker 0: And when nobody's visiting his website, this hardware is just sitting there doing nothing.

611
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:38,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't happen.

612
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:39,466
Speaker 0: Right.

613
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:43,400
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, a hundred people all have API gateways configured.

614
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:49,280
Speaker 0: Well, there's really just this one big API gateway service that's like handling all those API gateways all the time.

615
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:50,042
Speaker 0: Right.

616
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:54,480
Speaker 0: And so it's constantly, you know, being used efficiently.

617
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:55,082
Speaker 0: Right.

618
00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:55,745
Speaker 0: Nothing's really.

619
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:59,260
Speaker 0: you know, there isn't a lot of hardware just taking a nap over there, wasting away.

620
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,440
Speaker 0: Yup.

621
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:11,320
Speaker 1: The exception to that is any of the like cloud or virtualized hosting that's used for either legacy types of applications that still expect there to be an operating system or expect to be running all the time.

622
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

623
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,219
Speaker 0: Or, you know, each cloud service is going to be different.

624
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:14,420
Speaker 0: Right.

625
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,240
Speaker 1: Or honestly, things like game servers, things that just are always on constantly processing.

626
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:22,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

627
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:32,540
Speaker 0: But, you know, you use these things and like from your perspective as a user, it feels like you're using, you know, these services based on the abstractions they present to you.

628
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,332
Speaker 0: But what's actually happening behind them, you know, they only they know.

629
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:36,773
Speaker 0: Right.

630
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,880
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, but it works.

631
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:48,460
Speaker 0: The problem with this is that in terms of hosting, as you know, just a person who wants to host some Internet services, you know, just some servers, web, you know, email, whatever.

632
00:41:49,281 --> 00:42:02,500
Speaker 0: You had to need a vast amount of technological knowledge to and not just technological knowledge in general, but then on top of that specific knowledge of the cloud provider you're using and how they do things in order to make this work.

633
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:17,280
Speaker 0: You can't, you know, Amazon actually specifically has a thing called light sale, which is like push a button and will make a WordPress for you on Oz or will make a. you know, they have a list of, you know, of things that you can light sale and get basically push button to spin them up.

634
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:23,460
Speaker 0: But it still takes some technological knowing and costing money and whatnot.

635
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,616
Speaker 0: So but if you're a company, it's basically the way to go these days.

636
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:29,218
Speaker 0: Right.

637
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:29,800
Speaker 0: Kinda.

638
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:43,880
Speaker 1: Well, depending because, you know, kind of like we talked about in the in the Vimeo news, if you build something that is proprietary to or assumes that you sell a specific cloud platform, your thing is now locked to that cloud platform.

639
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,725
Speaker 1: Which means if Amazon changes anything, you have to deal with it like.

640
00:42:49,765 --> 00:43:02,300
Speaker 1: you can't just take your business elsewhere, at least not easily, unless you've been extremely careful about your architecture and multi cloud architectures that are actually fungible, still very difficult to put together for anything non-trivial.

641
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:07,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, my policy, you know, regard, you know, I don't know about my employer, they can have whatever policy they want.

642
00:43:07,658 --> 00:43:08,179
Speaker 0: That's on them.

643
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:08,400
Speaker 0: Right.

644
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:18,000
Speaker 0: But my personal policy is that when using a cloud service, I will stick to the services that are, you know, basically standards based.

645
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:26,459
Speaker 0: So like if you use Amazon RDS Postgres, it's like if you have to leave Amazon, you can just spin up a Postgres server and it's the same.

646
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:26,860
Speaker 0: Right.

647
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:32,755
Speaker 0: But if you use Amazon, what's a good redshift, I don't even know what the hell that thing does.

648
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:34,539
Speaker 0: I just heard it's one I thought of.

649
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:34,800
Speaker 0: Right.

650
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:43,015
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't think that that's just like a hosted version of an open source project.

651
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:44,978
Speaker 0: I think that's an Amazon specific thing.

652
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:45,560
Speaker 0: Right.

653
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:53,619
Speaker 0: You know, so if your application was dependent on that, you couldn't just easily spin your own up at home.

654
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,100
Speaker 0: Right.

655
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,125
Speaker 0: You know, use Amazon Lambdas.

656
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:59,234
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like, well, how are you going to host those yourself?

657
00:43:59,856 --> 00:44:00,558
Speaker 0: You kind of can't.

658
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:01,020
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,063
Speaker 0: So you have to do something.

660
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:11,260
Speaker 0: So I personally will only use the services in the cloud that are just free open source things that just happen to be hosted.

661
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:19,200
Speaker 0: And if I had to leave that cloud environment, I could easily mimic it and get my application up and running again because I'm only using standard pieces.

662
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:20,001
Speaker 1: Yep.

663
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:23,648
Speaker 1: And thus it comes down to way more than in 2006.

664
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:29,960
Speaker 1: You really just have to think about specifically, what are you trying to host and why?

665
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:43,958
Speaker 1: And the answer to what kind of hosting to use and how to use it could be so radically different based on that answer that it's almost impossible to give advice that's broad.

666
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:45,140
Speaker 1: that will work for you.

667
00:44:46,341 --> 00:44:48,164
Speaker 0: You have to know someone's situation, right?

668
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:58,040
Speaker 0: How much money they have, what their needs are, what their technological skills and knowledge are, how much time they have, you know, how different is what they're doing from something normal and boring.

669
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:09,160
Speaker 1: But this is where we see the rise of because there's, you know, there's blank as a service, like something as that's a big buzzword in the entire tech world has been for some time now.

670
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,222
Speaker 1: That's the business I'm in.

671
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:20,340
Speaker 1: And platform as a service is extremely popular for hosting because most people are not like us where they have all these different services.

672
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,765
Speaker 1: They're trying to like cobble something together with.

673
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:26,613
Speaker 1: They're not running a complex online application that's doing something.

674
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:29,820
Speaker 1: They're not hosting the infrastructure for an app or a big game.

675
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:40,615
Speaker 1: Usually people are trying to follow a small number of simple patterns, mostly around sharing content, usually video content, blogs, articles, like really simple stuff.

676
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:43,920
Speaker 1: That's what most people want to host when they talk about hosting.

677
00:45:44,802 --> 00:45:47,259
Speaker 1: So you pay for a platform like Vimeo.

678
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:51,033
Speaker 0: Vimeo is not platform as a service.

679
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:52,420
Speaker 0: Vimeo is software as a service.

680
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:53,724
Speaker 1: True.

681
00:45:53,905 --> 00:45:57,600
Speaker 1: Well, arguably Vimeo is video hosting as a service.

682
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,660
Speaker 0: Sure.

683
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:03,337
Speaker 0: But it's, you know, it's the two categories, the software as a service and platform as a service, right?

684
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:04,120
Speaker 0: So what's the difference?

685
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:11,640
Speaker 0: The difference is that software as a service is already the software that you want to be running, right?

686
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,548
Speaker 0: So a good example would be wordpress.com is software as a service, the software being WordPress, right?

687
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:23,276
Speaker 0: So rather than host your own WordPress blog, somehow, some way, there's a hundred ways to do it, right?

688
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:26,420
Speaker 0: You pay them and they run WordPress for you, right?

689
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,065
Speaker 0: Squarespace is software as a service, right?

690
00:46:30,446 --> 00:46:34,173
Speaker 0: You know, various podcast hosts out there are software as a service.

691
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:36,518
Speaker 0: They've got some sort of podcast delivery thing.

692
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:37,780
Speaker 0: they're running for you, right?

693
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,048
Speaker 0: Platform as a service would be something like Heroku, if you've ever heard of that, right?

694
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:47,220
Speaker 0: So Heroku is you write your software, right?

695
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:51,767
Speaker 0: You wrote a program in Ruby on Rails or Django or something.

696
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:58,660
Speaker 0: You wrote some application that you need to host somewhere, but you don't want to administer servers, right?

697
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,607
Speaker 0: You don't even want to do colocation or VPC or cloud or anything.

698
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:09,700
Speaker 0: You just wrote a simple application and you wrote that application within this framework, right?

699
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:18,255
Speaker 0: And you send it to them in the format that they want you to send it to them, and then they can run that on their platform.

700
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:21,240
Speaker 0: So you provide the software and they provide the platform.

701
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,895
Speaker 0: And you don't have to worry about any administration or, you know, hosting technology or networking or anything, all that stuff, you don't have to worry about.

702
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:31,520
Speaker 0: You can just write the software and that's it.

703
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,416
Speaker 1: You don't know if there even is an operating system behind all of this.

704
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:37,660
Speaker 1: You might never even see it.

705
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,882
Speaker 0: So that's platform as a service.

706
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:58,840
Speaker 0: And that's very popular these days because, you know, a lot of people, you know, especially with like Node.js and stuff, a lot of people can write a web application in JavaScript entirely, you know, however simple it is, and then just get it running without having to learn anything or do anything.

707
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:03,225
Speaker 0: And the cost of platform as a service is that you pay more money for those.

708
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:08,452
Speaker 0: Platform as a service costs a lot more over time than hosting your own machine.

709
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:14,840
Speaker 0: And the balance of that is you don't have to learn or do a bunch, you save a lot of time and knowledge.

710
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:16,061
Speaker 1: Yep.

711
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:22,920
Speaker 1: And you might also be taking advantage of some scaling factor that like you're probably smaller than the company you're paying for this from.

712
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,003
Speaker 0: Yep.

713
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:30,757
Speaker 0: So the software as a service, though, right, you know, it existed back in the day, 2006, in terms of like.

714
00:48:30,797 --> 00:48:32,040
Speaker 0: I talked about the GeoCities.

715
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,207
Speaker 1: But there just weren't many options.

716
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:34,929
Speaker 1: They weren't that good.

717
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,880
Speaker 1: Like WordPress wasn't even like that extensible or great back then.

718
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:43,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, but nowadays the software as a service options are enormous.

719
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:52,080
Speaker 0: There are tons of them covering like every possible conceivable thing for a lot of companies, especially, but also individuals.

720
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:59,673
Speaker 0: It doesn't really make a lot of sense unless your business is truly doing something unusual that requires custom software.

721
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:03,460
Speaker 0: There isn't really reason to hire engineers, maybe a couple.

722
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,867
Speaker 0: You could just pay for software as a service products and connect them together.

723
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:15,520
Speaker 0: And then like there are even other software as a service products you can get that will connect other software service products together.

724
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,749
Speaker 0: Like, oh, I got my slack and I got my sales force and I want to connect them together.

725
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:20,390
Speaker 0: Right.

726
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,472
Speaker 0: Well, guess what?

727
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:25,300
Speaker 0: There's another software as a service that does slack salesforce connections.

728
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:35,940
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can just keep buying these things, you know, get air tables and all sorts of things out there and run your whole operation that way.

729
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:42,991
Speaker 0: And frankly, if you're not doing anything out of the ordinary, that's the right move for basically any company.

730
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:47,940
Speaker 0: that's not a tech company, you know, for a large part of it anyway.

731
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:52,028
Speaker 0: And I think what's happened is, you know, people having trouble hiring engineers.

732
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:58,240
Speaker 0: It's like, why all the engineers are working at software as a service places, making the software.

733
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:04,493
Speaker 0: And, you know, all the other companies are just buying that software rather than hiring engineers.

734
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,920
Speaker 0: And with an engineer shortage, it actually makes sense.

735
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,427
Speaker 0: It's one of those cases where capitalism is kind of making things more efficient a little bit.

736
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:12,767
Speaker 0: Right.

737
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:21,240
Speaker 0: You know, one engineer makes one software product that many companies use rather than 10 companies all building 10 similar things.

738
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:35,820
Speaker 1: Well, similar to how once EC2 was stable for a long time, like if I needed a new server to do anything, even just my own personal stuff, I would just spin up an EC2 instance with like Linux installed on it and just run stuff on it.

739
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,288
Speaker 1: I used to have like six or seven different EC2 servers doing stuff I needed.

740
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:45,735
Speaker 1: And that's the kind of workflow that's kind of obsolete by modern standards.

741
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:49,120
Speaker 1: in most cases, unless you're hobbyist or you're doing something very bespoke.

742
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:50,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:56,488
Speaker 0: So, you know, with all that stuff going on in the realm of hosting, there's been, you know, a downturn.

744
00:50:56,528 --> 00:50:56,649
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:50:56,689 --> 00:51:06,079
Speaker 0: So all this new stuff, what's gone away and what's gone away, not completely, it still exists, but is that sort of hosting where you just get an FTP and drop stuff in a folder.

746
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,680
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,015
Speaker 0: There are still people providing it, but they're very few and they're mostly all garbage.

748
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:13,820
Speaker 0: They're not doing a good job of it.

749
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:20,920
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of them just have hardware that is still hosted that might even be a little old and they're just running something that's been around for a while.

750
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

751
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:30,236
Speaker 0: So this is a problem because I think for even with those platforms as a service, for a lot of people, it's like that's too much for them.

752
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,759
Speaker 0: That requires writing software.

753
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,060
Speaker 0: Right.

754
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:42,353
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of people just like, you know, they got, they want to host some static HTML blog or something, or maybe, you know, a PHP, a little PHP blog or something.

755
00:51:42,393 --> 00:51:42,633
Speaker 0: Right.

756
00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:47,640
Speaker 0: And you think they've been doing this by just dropping files into a directory.

757
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:58,674
Speaker 0: And if you don't have, you know, it's like anything else is like the technical skills required to do any other kind of hosting is an enormous leap.

758
00:51:59,194 --> 00:51:59,875
Speaker 1: Right.

759
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:02,920
Speaker 0: There isn't some other easy hosting option out there.

760
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:04,443
Speaker 0: You know, it's pretty much.

761
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:11,759
Speaker 0: you go straight from Squarespace, the software as a service, and you jump all the way to platform as a service is like the next easiest thing.

762
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,300
Speaker 0: Right.

763
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:17,360
Speaker 0: And it's like that space in between in terms of technical know-how is completely unoccupied.

764
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,423
Speaker 1: Well, I would argue that place in between.

765
00:52:19,563 --> 00:52:29,780
Speaker 1: So one of the areas I work with a lot in my space, at least in like my day job is infrastructure as a service as sort of bridging the gap between platform and just nothing.

766
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,565
Speaker 0: Well, that's harder.

767
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:35,080
Speaker 0: That's harder to do technical skill-wise than platform as a service.

768
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:35,981
Speaker 1: Yep.

769
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:38,524
Speaker 1: But think of it more like where I've seen.

770
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:42,187
Speaker 1: infrastructure as a service is more like you're running everything.

771
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:54,060
Speaker 1: however you're running it, but you've outsourced specific, extremely generic pieces of it to a platform somewhere like just the storage, just the video streaming.

772
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,385
Speaker 0: That's what cloud providers offer, right?

773
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:02,600
Speaker 0: S3, you know, that takes technological know-how to use an S3 compared to, you know, right.

774
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:07,085
Speaker 0: How much technical skill do you need to use it?

775
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:07,306
Speaker 0: Right.

776
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:09,851
Speaker 1: For example, I advise Squarespace.

777
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:10,452
Speaker 0: None.

778
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:12,476
Speaker 0: How much do you need to use Heroku?

779
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,140
Speaker 0: You have to be able to write software.

780
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,320
Speaker 0: Right.

781
00:53:14,682 --> 00:53:18,320
Speaker 0: Between know nothing and ability to write software.

782
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,483
Speaker 1: Well, so here's an example.

783
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:21,666
Speaker 1: Amazon Glacier.

784
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:27,240
Speaker 1: I suggested many years ago that someone else use Amazon Glacier just to do a backup because that's what I use.

785
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,578
Speaker 0: That requires technical know-how to use.

786
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,041
Speaker 0: It does.

787
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,010
Speaker 1: There's no UI of like drag files into Glacier.

788
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:35,360
Speaker 1: You've got to write some code, get that token and do some stuff.

789
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:48,540
Speaker 1: So my sonology is like integrated with this infrastructure that I'm using solely for storage, but I'm doing all the everything except the heavy lifting of the raw data storage itself.

790
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,241
Speaker 1: Everything.

791
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:51,748
Speaker 1: I'm doing everything except that one piece.

792
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:55,279
Speaker 1: And I'm paying Amazon like thirty dollars a month to do that one piece.

793
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,222
Speaker 0: That's hard to do.

794
00:53:57,282 --> 00:53:57,844
Speaker 0: That's not it.

795
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:58,726
Speaker 0: It's not an easy.

796
00:53:58,826 --> 00:53:59,046
Speaker 0: Right.

797
00:53:59,187 --> 00:54:01,832
Speaker 0: It's much harder than drag your files with an FTP.

798
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:05,220
Speaker 0: And now you have a website that has PHP going and such.

799
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:05,700
Speaker 1: Yep.

800
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:06,462
Speaker 1: Never mind.

801
00:54:06,683 --> 00:54:13,240
Speaker 1: Like with that software, like if you run WordPress yourself, however you run it, are you keeping it up to date?

802
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:14,281
Speaker 0: Yep.

803
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:29,660
Speaker 0: And so this what the result of that is, is that there are the people, people who don't have a lot of technological skill, right, are forced to either a only use free platforms to put their stuff online, right?

804
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,824
Speaker 0: Social media, Twitter's, Facebook's.

805
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:33,447
Speaker 0: Right.

806
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:38,696
Speaker 0: Or pay for software as a services, Squarespace is, you know, Vimeo's.

807
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:39,337
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:41,080
Speaker 0: And that's what they're stuck with.

809
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:53,080
Speaker 0: And people who have technological skill can host very, very complex and fancy, amazing things at relatively low cost, but still a cost of money.

810
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,601
Speaker 0: Right.

811
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,066
Speaker 0: That sort of, you know, balances out.

812
00:54:56,286 --> 00:54:56,527
Speaker 0: Right.

813
00:54:57,068 --> 00:55:03,340
Speaker 0: And then that in between space where only want to pay a little bit of money, what, five bucks a month?

814
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:03,801
Speaker 0: Right.

815
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:08,130
Speaker 0: Maybe less than that and host something kind of different.

816
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:10,114
Speaker 0: I want to host an IRC server.

817
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:10,535
Speaker 0: Right.

818
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:13,060
Speaker 0: I want to host a Jabber server.

819
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:21,740
Speaker 0: I want to host a, you know, a custom website and not just some, you know, like actually a custom website that I wrote all the HTML myself, whatever.

820
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,770
Speaker 0: It's like that's sort of technically still exists, but it's like not really anymore.

821
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,954
Speaker 0: And it's like this unoccupied space.

822
00:55:30,054 --> 00:55:33,460
Speaker 0: And people who land in that space are poorly served.

823
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:33,901
Speaker 0: Right.

824
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:47,940
Speaker 0: They either have to give up their customization and use the same platforms everyone else uses and pay money or learn a lot of technological stuff they don't have time for or pay a lot of money to hire someone who does know technological stuff.

825
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,041
Speaker 1: Yup.

826
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:55,972
Speaker 1: Like a really big example of that, especially because it's dying as companies start to just host this themselves.

827
00:55:56,592 --> 00:55:58,235
Speaker 1: Custom game servers.

828
00:55:58,315 --> 00:55:59,136
Speaker 1: You like a game.

829
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,238
Speaker 1: It's an online game.

830
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:01,780
Speaker 1: You want to run your own server.

831
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:15,120
Speaker 1: There are some providers who, for individual specific games, they will actually give you like basically virtualized software as a service for hosting like a Counter-Strike server specifically.

832
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,280
Speaker 1: Yup.

833
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:17,866
Speaker 1: But that's highly specialized.

834
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:21,595
Speaker 1: You want to run some other game other than Counter-Strike?

835
00:56:22,016 --> 00:56:22,998
Speaker 1: God, that doesn't exist.

836
00:56:23,018 --> 00:56:23,820
Speaker 1: You want to, you want to pick.

837
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,003
Speaker 0: I've seen it around.

838
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:30,380
Speaker 0: Usually the game, the game hosting places I've seen these days, you know, they all seem shady, but they tend to.

839
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,389
Speaker 0: They have a list of games that they have a big list of games you can choose from.

840
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:34,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

841
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,620
Speaker 0: But what's happened, though, is that we've gotten away from that, right?

842
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,242
Speaker 0: It's like now.

843
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:42,251
Speaker 0: it's like you don't host a server for most games.

844
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,153
Speaker 0: The company does.

845
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,340
Speaker 0: The company that makes the game hosts it.

846
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,340
Speaker 1: If I want to make a customer server in Overwatch, I click in the menu in Overwatch and I spawn a server on Blizzard servers somewhere.

847
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,001
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,426
Speaker 0: You can't run your own Overwatch server on your own hardware.

849
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:56,188
Speaker 0: They don't let you do that.

850
00:56:57,651 --> 00:57:01,660
Speaker 0: Maybe they have deals with like the Overwatch League teams to let them do it locally or something.

851
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:08,332
Speaker 1: Not like we used to run a Counter-Strike server on a physical server that was just sitting on the floor in our apartment at our IT.

852
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:09,375
Speaker 0: Exactly.

853
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:11,259
Speaker 0: You can't do that with new games.

854
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:11,760
Speaker 0: They don't let you.

855
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:25,560
Speaker 1: So if you want to do something that other people do with such frequency that someone has a very specific software as a service platform that just does what you want, pretty much that's your best bet.

856
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:26,982
Speaker 0: If you have money.

857
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:37,220
Speaker 1: If you don't have money, you're basically just screwed or you have to use services that will monetize your content instead of you monetizing it.

858
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,602
Speaker 1: You're going to be using social media.

859
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,686
Speaker 0: You can host all the videos you want on TikTok.

860
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:41,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

861
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:41,728
Speaker 1: Or YouTube.

862
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,630
Speaker 0: Right.

863
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:44,273
Speaker 0: No one's going to stop you.

864
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,540
Speaker 1: Unless they're copyright violating or whatever.

865
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:48,541
Speaker 1: Right.

866
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,864
Speaker 0: Or depending on, I guess, TikTok.

867
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:55,048
Speaker 0: You can do all the streaming you want on Twitch and YouTube and Facebook.

868
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:55,989
Speaker 1: But that's it.

869
00:57:56,009 --> 00:58:07,000
Speaker 1: We're seeing increasingly people like streaming video is extremely popular and also it's too expensive to actually provide that at scale for all the people who want to do it.

870
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:14,629
Speaker 1: So we have Twitch and YouTube and these platforms that each have their own way of monetizing very specific ways.

871
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:15,910
Speaker 1: video is used online.

872
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:18,734
Speaker 1: And you can't really step outside of those boundaries.

873
00:58:19,275 --> 00:58:23,860
Speaker 1: Or there's almost no viable option other than going bespoke and saying tons of money.

874
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,461
Speaker 0: No how and or money.

875
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:26,262
Speaker 0: Right.

876
00:58:26,342 --> 00:58:27,363
Speaker 0: To escape from that.

877
00:58:28,484 --> 00:58:28,985
Speaker 1: Yeah.

878
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:31,186
Speaker 1: So it's.

879
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:33,569
Speaker 1: it's interesting how the technology has gotten better.

880
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:37,412
Speaker 1: And if you're doing something basic, hosting is way easier than it ever was.

881
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:47,741
Speaker 1: But I would argue, I think it's almost harder to do anything that's not a standard capitalist supported thing online than it used to be in 2006.

882
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:47,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

883
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:51,286
Speaker 0: One technique I did learn recently was to use a tunnel.

884
00:58:51,486 --> 00:59:00,580
Speaker 0: I haven't tried this yet, but basically, you know, host your server in your house and then use a tunnel to the cloud provider like CloudFlare or Amazon.

885
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

886
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:07,872
Speaker 0: And then all traffic coming to your service that's running on a server in your house has to go through that tunnel.

887
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:12,520
Speaker 0: And that protects your your house from like being directly hit with network traffic.

888
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:12,961
Speaker 0: Right.

889
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:16,365
Speaker 0: Protects your server and it protects.

890
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:16,906
Speaker 0: Right.

891
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,910
Speaker 0: No, your cloud provider can't like mess with your server or anything.

892
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:20,030
Speaker 0: Right.

893
00:59:20,051 --> 00:59:21,212
Speaker 0: Because it's in your house still.

894
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:22,454
Speaker 0: Right.

895
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:26,820
Speaker 0: But, you know, you can get basically get the bandwidth from them that way with the tunnel.

896
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:28,583
Speaker 0: And that's not a bad model.

897
00:59:28,623 --> 00:59:39,260
Speaker 0: It also solves the dynamic DNS problem because, you know, all the DNS is pointing at the IP address in the cloud and it's reaching your house through a tunnel and not really, you know, your though.

898
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:45,600
Speaker 1: You still need enough bandwidth to handle all the client requests between you and your provider.

899
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:45,981
Speaker 0: Right.

900
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:47,886
Speaker 0: But you could put a CDN out there.

901
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:48,267
Speaker 0: Right.

902
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,349
Speaker 0: You could do all sorts of stuff.

903
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:53,440
Speaker 0: But, yeah, you are going to need enough bandwidth at your house.

904
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:55,905
Speaker 1: Or deploying a CDN.

905
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:56,628
Speaker 1: All right.

906
00:59:56,768 --> 00:59:57,049
Speaker 1: Sure.

907
00:59:58,614 --> 01:00:00,240
Speaker 1: We're the kind of people who know how to do that.

908
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying that's that's.

909
01:00:03,463 --> 01:00:04,965
Speaker 0: there is still that option now.

910
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:10,633
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that till like this week that the tunnel could be used in that way to still host from the house.

911
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:10,973
Speaker 0: Right.

912
01:00:10,993 --> 01:00:15,700
Speaker 0: But technological know how it would save you money, especially like, you know, CloudFlare.

913
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:21,247
Speaker 0: They got, you know, we can discuss CloudFlare good and bad at another time, but they're offering free tunnels within limits.

914
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:30,340
Speaker 1: So I think it's partly because most of what like the areas that people have struggled with the most right now are things where there are fixed costs.

915
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:37,228
Speaker 1: Or costs that don't exist in a retail consumer world like bandwidth at scale isn't cheap.

916
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:47,940
Speaker 1: If you actually want to do something like a host video game servers often require a ton of local CPU on the servers to run because they're real time or near.

917
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,013
Speaker 1: They're not real time like a real time system, but they're human pseudo real time.

918
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:55,840
Speaker 1: They need to be running and responsive and active with low latency.

919
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,603
Speaker 1: And it's hard to do that.

920
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:01,166
Speaker 1: It's even harder to do that now.

921
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:07,399
Speaker 1: And it's definitely harder to do that at scale than it was in 2006, partly because the scales were a lot lower back then.

922
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:14,090
Speaker 0: So, yeah, providing providing Internet services in 2022 is a lot harder than 2006.

923
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:19,560
Speaker 0: It takes technological skill and or money, and it's kind of a shame.

924
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:27,760
Speaker 0: And I suggest, you know, obviously personally, I suggest learning the technological skills that you can do it and avoid spending the money.

925
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:33,847
Speaker 1: Or partner with someone who has that, like Scott and I split up the duties of Geek Nights.

926
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:42,560
Speaker 1: We both don't do everything because there's too much to do, even for just a podcast with some streams and videos and like associated content.

927
01:01:44,488 --> 01:01:44,757
Speaker 0: All right.

928
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:47,119
Speaker 0: I'm going to go do poop.

929
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,046
