1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,560
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:11,248
Speaker 1: It's Monday October 1st.

3
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:12,071
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:18,099
Speaker 1: I'm sky and this is geek night Tonight tech conventions, and why we avoid them.

5
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:33,450
Speaker 1: Well last week We started asking for questions to do another week.

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,251
Speaker 1: well a week as opposed to just a day of ask rim and Scott and I got to say You guys kind of impressed me for once.

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,040
Speaker 1: we actually got some intelligent questions.

9
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,816
Speaker 0: Yes, but regardless of the fact that we got intelligent questions.

10
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:49,131
Speaker 0: We need more Intelligent questions because we can never be sated.

11
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:55,160
Speaker 1: we were always be wanting more questions plus We're gonna hold out until we get questions for every day of the week.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:03,216
Speaker 1: I don't know if we said too clearly, but basically at some point once we have enough questions We're just going to in a week or two probably yeah every day one week.

13
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 1: It'll be a theme week.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,359
Speaker 1: It'll be we answer the questions for each day on each day or not?

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:18,436
Speaker 0: So all you people who are like you know not listening to what I'm telling you and going back to the archives instead of just Listening to new episodes and only listening to old episodes that might interest you based on you know the titles.

16
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,719
Speaker 0: if you're doing that thing Where you're crazy?

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,639
Speaker 0: You're gonna miss out on your chance to ask a question And you're not gonna get another chance for a long time, and you're not hearing this because you're not doing what I told you to.

18
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:35,740
Speaker 0: Why would you tell people they can listen however they want they can't but I suggest you do it the way I say Because that is the way of not crazy people.

19
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:36,483
Speaker 1: I don't know the way.

20
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:42,372
Speaker 1: if I were listening to this show what I would probably do is I'd listen to the new episodes and I'd probably just randomly search through the old episode.

21
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,679
Speaker 0: That's what I was saying people should do.

22
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:50,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think there are people though who are apparently starting at the beginning and listening to each one in order Which I think is crazy.

23
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,080
Speaker 1: however why I mean all right, so you've written this up now in this show.

24
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,732
Speaker 1: They're not gonna hear this for a couple months.

25
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:58,500
Speaker 0: I know and they're missing out.

26
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:05,520
Speaker 1: So this is a haha to everyone who's crazy But they'll still get the questions answered and do you really think those people are gonna ask the kind of questions you want to answer?

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:19,798
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're not missing anything Maybe but maybe All right, so yeah make sure that your questions are not answered in a previous show of geek nights Or at least hope that we forgot that we asked it already.

28
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:23,060
Speaker 0: yes Don't have incredibly long answers.

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,596
Speaker 0: I mean there's a lot of good questions that take an entire episode to answer and that kind of we.

30
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,503
Speaker 0: that kind of sucks because We want to answer it.

31
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,290
Speaker 1: a question like episode idea.

32
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,920
Speaker 1: How do I set up a myth TV box is not good?

33
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,178
Speaker 1: Why should I use myth TV is good?

34
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,309
Speaker 0: yes See also don't ask questions like rim just said.

35
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,755
Speaker 0: that could be answered on Google because I'm not gonna Just go search on Google for the answer for you.

36
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:46,580
Speaker 0: You can do that yourself.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,503
Speaker 0: You don't need to ask me.

38
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:54,868
Speaker 0: you ask us things that are like discussion topics or opinions or something like that like What was your first computer?

39
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:54,948
Speaker 0: Yes?

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,198
Speaker 1: Why do you like the Commodore?

41
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:57,680
Speaker 1: whatever?

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, and make sure it's a question involving science or technology.

43
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,020
Speaker 1: at least when did you stop beating your wife?

44
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,279
Speaker 0: Right after you told your parents you were gay.

45
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:13,675
Speaker 1: All right right, so what are you been up to Boring this?

46
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:15,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

47
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:19,809
Speaker 0: So yes since I haven't been doing anything.

48
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,576
Speaker 0: We're just gonna do some news right now.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,178
Speaker 0: Alright, the news is the newest version of Ubuntu.

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,723
Speaker 1: Ubuntu.

51
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,360
Speaker 1: yes the gutsy given gotten to do that in a while.

52
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,891
Speaker 0: The gutsy given beta is now available.

53
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,660
Speaker 0: now it is a beta and it is pretty beta.

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,720
Speaker 0: I must say I had the live CD that you will download if you if you want to use this is very beta.

55
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:54,540
Speaker 0: However, it's been my experience in the past with Ubuntu betas that if you install the beta and then update it and then keep updating It it will work pretty well and eventually become the stable version.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,499
Speaker 0: So you won't have to like reinstall when the final version comes out.

57
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:00,920
Speaker 0: You'll just update straight into the final version and you won't be a problem.

58
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:09,231
Speaker 1: I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but I'm excited since it has a new kernel and My hardware is barely supported by the current kernel I'm using.

59
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:16,305
Speaker 0: well I see I put it on my laptop and I had a little bit of a problem because it like I was getting some error Messages indicative of hard drive failure.

60
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,051
Speaker 1: Oh wait what from smart?

61
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:20,197
Speaker 0: No from the Linux kernel.

62
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,300
Speaker 0: Uh-huh It was like having problems.

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,870
Speaker 0: So I tried it again and I was still getting problems.

64
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,211
Speaker 0: and I was.

65
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:31,480
Speaker 0: I tried like a feisty CD and there were no Problems and then I tried the gutsy CD again and there were problems.

66
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:39,800
Speaker 0: so I installed Windows Vista on my laptop just you know to Clear everything up because that's what came with the laptop and it worked perfectly.

67
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,121
Speaker 0: There was.

68
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,012
Speaker 0: there was no problem with my laptop whatsoever.

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,240
Speaker 0: So I was a good game gutsy.

70
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:54,040
Speaker 0: So I was able to confirm that You know Which problems on my laptop were because of Linux and which were because of hardware and pretty much any problems were all Linux.

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:05:00,097
Speaker 0: So I reinstalled the gutsy and now it was working just fine because I did it like a full scan disk with the Vista.

72
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:09,925
Speaker 0: and It's gutsy in a lot of ways is better than feisty in a lot of ways not so much different and in some ways a little bit worse Most notably.

73
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:13,803
Speaker 0: I think the one thing that's worse and I'm not sure if this is Ubuntu's fault Is the.

74
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:17,035
Speaker 0: there's a thing called the deskbar applet, which I use a lot.

75
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:17,837
Speaker 0: I really like it.

76
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:25,207
Speaker 0: Yeah Apparently someone's project for Google Summer of Code was to sort of Refactor the deskbar to make it better.

77
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:26,029
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

78
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,654
Speaker 0: And in many ways they made it better.

79
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,536
Speaker 0: It doesn't crash.

80
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,663
Speaker 0: It's very much more stable It's faster.

81
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:34,535
Speaker 0: It's it's better in a lot of ways and good for them in other ways.

82
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,200
Speaker 0: They've ruined the user interface of it.

83
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:38,472
Speaker 0: It's now really in all honesty.

84
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:47,760
Speaker 0: It's no longer a deskbar It's just a button that you put in your in your bar And if you push that button or push the keyboard shortcut for that button, it pops up a window.

85
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,572
Speaker 0: Literally all it is is a button that makes a window show up.

86
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,120
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the way I have it now.

87
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,999
Speaker 1: It's just a window pops up, but that window has a dialog in it.

88
00:05:57,743 --> 00:06:00,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean that windows sort of it's not like a separate window.

89
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,080
Speaker 0: It's like sort of attached to the button, right?

90
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,108
Speaker 1: So now it's not attached.

91
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,580
Speaker 1: just kind of pops up in the middle of my screen.

92
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,720
Speaker 0: It could have a pop-up anywhere on your screen that you want.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,619
Speaker 0: It's a window like a full-on window with a closed button and everything, you know I feel like they're just trying to do too much with it.

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,268
Speaker 0: I think they are trying to do too much though.

95
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,278
Speaker 1: The reason I like it is that I just.

96
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:15,720
Speaker 1: it's simple.

97
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,065
Speaker 1: It's like launchy and windows.

98
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,731
Speaker 1: It's just yeah run any program.

99
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,020
Speaker 1: I want without having to think about and I can extend it.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,120
Speaker 0: I like how I can make it do more or less, but I prefer to make it do less.

101
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,570
Speaker 0: So the fact that they make it this whole window is sort of annoying.

102
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:29,920
Speaker 0: but good things about the Ubuntu gutsy.

103
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:33,910
Speaker 0: Of course newer kernel runs faster runs better more things work.

104
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,277
Speaker 0: some things that will accept Scott's hard drive.

105
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:37,159
Speaker 0: It works fine.

106
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:41,145
Speaker 0: Some things that used to not work Do work now.

107
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,356
Speaker 0: some things that used to not work still don't work.

108
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a check.

109
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:44,830
Speaker 1: I got a test it.

110
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:49,320
Speaker 1: when I get a chance Hopefully my the network card built into my motherboard will work with this kernel.

111
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,907
Speaker 0: Well, why don't you?

112
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,020
Speaker 0: what's wrong with the one that you bought?

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,673
Speaker 1: I'm using that one now, but I'd rather use the embedded one since I have two of them.

114
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:54,753
Speaker 1: All

115
00:06:55,195 --> 00:07:13,356
Speaker 0: right, but the The one thing that's a big change the biggest thing you're gonna notice is the addition by default of the comp is fusion uh-huh, uh-huh, which is the super eye candy desktop window managing thing that everyone's showing off all the time and Basically if you just don't have 3d.

116
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,833
Speaker 0: So if you have let's say here you you have an Nvidia card, right you install gutsy.

117
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,160
Speaker 0: It's gonna be disabled not working.

118
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,084
Speaker 0: It's gonna be off.

119
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:22,490
Speaker 0: you have two choices.

120
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,198
Speaker 0: You can set it to normal or crazy.

121
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:29,555
Speaker 0: And in order to set it to normal or crazy You're gonna have to install the Nvidia Drive, which is very easy.

122
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,220
Speaker 0: You click one button.

123
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,521
Speaker 0: It's pretty.

124
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,104
Speaker 1: you should do that.

125
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:34,260
Speaker 1: No matter what there's no reason not to install the Nvidia driver now.

126
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:36,071
Speaker 0: You can set it to normal or crazy.

127
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:37,580
Speaker 0: normal is what I like.

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,503
Speaker 0: It lets you have just like the drop shadows on the on the windows and like fading menus and you know Just the subtle stuff right.

129
00:07:45,065 --> 00:08:01,631
Speaker 0: crazy advanced makes the wobbly windows and all the stuff you can't handle right, but there's a secret you can do apt-get install comp is settings something and you can choose custom and Basically, it gives you this extra control panel to configure.

130
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:06,180
Speaker 0: comp is right and I did this at work today Pretty much all day on my work computer.

131
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,563
Speaker 0: This is crazy.

132
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:12,060
Speaker 0: It takes you days probably just to set up all these crazy settings, but you can do crazy stuff.

133
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,205
Speaker 0: There was even a thing.

134
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:16,458
Speaker 0: it lets you like draw on your screen and then like erase it.

135
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:21,185
Speaker 0: instead of having to touch your screen you can like draw on it and There was stuff to like.

136
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:25,780
Speaker 0: do you could browse through your windows the same way you browse through like albums on an iPod where it?

137
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,964
Speaker 0: Kind of goes whoosh whoosh whoosh.

138
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:31,640
Speaker 0: you can do the expose like on a Mac you could do expose of your virtual desktops.

139
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:36,095
Speaker 0: Is all I like that one right there, there's all kinds of crazy action going on.

140
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:39,948
Speaker 0: if you bother to futz with it That's definitely a step up spinning cube.

141
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,653
Speaker 1: If you try to use the desktop effects in feisty I mean, it looks like it works this little dialogue.

142
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:45,740
Speaker 1: and hey, do you want this?

143
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,463
Speaker 1: Do you want this?

144
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:51,104
Speaker 1: and it doesn't give you many options obviously, but it just breaks your computer That is.

145
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,600
Speaker 0: one thing I must say is that there is much less breakage.

146
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,920
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a little breakage like on my laptop.

147
00:08:56,442 --> 00:09:01,446
Speaker 0: It takes a little while for like the taskbar at the bottom to appear, you know When I started up.

148
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:05,488
Speaker 0: so I turned it off on my laptop because it was eating the battery But it worked really well.

149
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,700
Speaker 0: with my shitty Intel laptop video card.

150
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,632
Speaker 0: It just worked out of the box of the live CD.

151
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:10,377
Speaker 1: ah cuz God.

152
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:17,200
Speaker 1: and feisty I mean if you enable anything with the desktop switching it just completely destroys your desktops and gives you two and overwrites everything you change.

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:30,807
Speaker 0: my only major complaint with this release is that it really screws around with your Keyboard shortcuts because you have keyboard shortcuts for compass keyboard shortcuts for gnome keyboard shortcuts for the deskbar Keyboard shortcuts for individual applications.

154
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,831
Speaker 0: They're all separate.

155
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:33,075
Speaker 0: They're all all over the place.

156
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,700
Speaker 0: They're all conflicting with each other.

157
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:39,318
Speaker 0: Nothing knows what's going on and it's really beginning to be like with everything.

158
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:44,980
Speaker 0: Yes So luckily the only way the comp is the keyboard shortcuts are like ten times worse than they were before.

159
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,007
Speaker 1: See the thing is for that.

160
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:56,400
Speaker 1: I wouldn't use many of the only keyboard shortcuts I need if I had expose and all that I could get buying them easily, but the stuff inside a few applications I use and the deskbar but that's the thing is like the deskbar.

161
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,851
Speaker 0: I used to use window tab as my deskbar shortcut.

162
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:00,137
Speaker 0: Can't do that anymore.

163
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:00,640
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

164
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,700
Speaker 0: I used you know, it's really getting on my nerves here.

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:14,920
Speaker 0: So I had to go around and it took me like a half hour just to figure out all these like in to get The keyboard shortcuts to be intuitive just for the simple things like change desktop or open terminal.

166
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:20,028
Speaker 0: I couldn't find the setting that was intuitive and non-conflicting Between all this crazy stuff all over the place.

167
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:28,860
Speaker 1: honestly for all that stuff because I do have one of those semi fancy logitech keyboards I just bind those two Reasonable looking things on the keyboard that aren't otherwise keys.

168
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,460
Speaker 0: I see I like to use the window button in combination with other buttons because that's not used for anything in Linux Yeah, so I like hold like right now to change desktops.

169
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,160
Speaker 0: I hold down window and I push left and right and the arrows I see for me.

170
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,660
Speaker 1: You know I have like the next track previous track play pause all those arrows and crack that I'm never gonna use.

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,487
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I use those for play.

172
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,134
Speaker 0: pause next track previous track.

173
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:50,685
Speaker 1: I don't do that by listening to music I'm just listening to music.

174
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:51,388
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

175
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,392
Speaker 1: I don't bother with and if I really want to change tracks or something I just go into XMMS or whatever.

176
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:58,000
Speaker 1: I'm playing with and click the next track.

177
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,834
Speaker 0: Oh, that's what I used to do back in the day when I had those buttons.

178
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:06,558
Speaker 1: now with my happy hacking keyboard I don't have those buttons anymore, but I use the arrows to switch between desktops and it's actually really nice.

179
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,342
Speaker 1: Yep All right, right.

180
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:12,269
Speaker 1: So in somewhat scarier news slash dot is about 10 years old.

181
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,424
Speaker 0: That's better.

182
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:15,849
Speaker 1: How old are you a decade?

183
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:19,142
Speaker 1: Well, I am 15 years older than slash job Uh-huh.

184
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,853
Speaker 0: So when you were 15 slash that came about.

185
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:28,888
Speaker 0: uh, yeah give or take Because I didn't really read slash dot till I was like 17 or 18.

186
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,607
Speaker 1: So I got memory in high school The second or third year.

187
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:37,520
Speaker 1: a few people said like oh they talked about slash dot But I didn't really read it or know much about it.

188
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:43,200
Speaker 0: I heard of it, but and I went to it a few times before college But I only seriously went to when I got to college.

189
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:43,762
Speaker 1: It was weird.

190
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:48,300
Speaker 1: at RIT where I've been I've read slash dot pretty much two days after I was at RIT.

191
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,551
Speaker 1: But you talk to people and it was this dichotomy of pipe.

192
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:55,979
Speaker 1: people either read all of slash dot or had never heard of it.

193
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:59,135
Speaker 1: So you sit there and you're like, yeah blah blah blah and slash dot.

194
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:03,015
Speaker 1: and people would either say oh I already read that or they'd say what what are you talking about?

195
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:07,839
Speaker 0: Yeah And now we have dig and Fark and all this.

196
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,306
Speaker 1: luckily They all people.

197
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,000
Speaker 1: I remember when dig came out people thought oh, that's the end of slash dot.

198
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,368
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of things that came out.

199
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:21,246
Speaker 1: and every time people said oh slash shot will die While slash dots not doing as well as it used to be and it's no longer Definitely gave it a nice punch to the gut.

200
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:27,469
Speaker 1: slash dot is no longer the definitive and sole source of technology news for geeks And in a way, I think that is good.

201
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,300
Speaker 0: We needed more sources of news for geeks.

202
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:32,679
Speaker 0: You know that we're void of rolling peak Bailey, but he's back.

203
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,246
Speaker 0: I don't think he's back.

204
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,130
Speaker 0: I don't think he went away.

205
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,400
Speaker 0: I think we just stopped paying attention and stopped seeing him.

206
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:40,059
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing is slash dot.

207
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:47,400
Speaker 1: the reason I think it's still around is that it offers something that those other sites don't offer and it's that The comments are not useless.

208
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,687
Speaker 0: Well, not anymore not since all this useless.

209
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,470
Speaker 0: people went to dig.

210
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:54,060
Speaker 1: even then they weren't that useless because the moderation system actually worked Pretty well.

211
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:59,134
Speaker 1: And yeah I can say that I never read slash dot articles because I never needed to any article.

212
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:09,380
Speaker 1: if you want to know what the article Was actually about whether or not the article was true and what the gist was All you had to do was go into the comments and it was clear almost immediately exactly what was important.

213
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:16,000
Speaker 0: Another thing about slash dot is that unlike dig did slash dot goes by its tagline.

214
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,179
Speaker 0: It is news for nerds.

215
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,037
Speaker 0: Yep stuff that matters.

216
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:24,616
Speaker 0: and While the editors are not perfect and they put up dupes and they put spelling errors and rollin

217
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,137
Speaker 1: peak pale

218
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:38,103
Speaker 0: and stuff like that They really do most for the most part only post things to slash dot that matter in some way and you're not gonna get those like, you know freaking stupid stories like Someone gone

219
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,327
Speaker 1: Paul gold standard

220
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,869
Speaker 0: alien.

221
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that shit.

222
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,939
Speaker 0: doesn't go on slash dot if it's not April 1st.

223
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:50,938
Speaker 0: So I guess that is one thing in slash that's favorite Even though it doesn't get the news right away and it doesn't get all the news and it doesn't get.

224
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,075
Speaker 0: you know You might miss something here or there or it might put something up.

225
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:54,940
Speaker 0: That's kind of a you know.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,746
Speaker 1: I've noticed one thing though about slash dot.

227
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,853
Speaker 1: that I just realized is now thinking about it.

228
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,762
Speaker 1: slash dot used to be really funny like I remember.

229
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:05,289
Speaker 1: I'd read it and it would be really insightful comments and it'd be really funny stuff.

230
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:11,749
Speaker 1: and now a it seems like all the people who would say something funny have gone to dig and Fark and they say they're funny things there.

231
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,450
Speaker 1: because The only humor left on slash dot is either the tech

232
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,674
Speaker 0: Well, it's

233
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:33,985
Speaker 1: either the tech equivalent of filk where someone will like Post song lyrics that match up that they wrote about the Linux thing or they make a really lame exchange of dot like just really lame humor But seems to fit with that vibe or the old standard boring cliches of first post.

234
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,850
Speaker 1: Natalie Portman grits cowboy Neil.

235
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never got the Natalie Portman grits thing.

236
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,019
Speaker 1: That's just.

237
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,303
Speaker 1: I never found that funny.

238
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,590
Speaker 0: I also do not understand it.

239
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,155
Speaker 0: Plus I came up with that one.

240
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,707
Speaker 0: That was like only old people in North Korea.

241
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,750
Speaker 0: old people email you.

242
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,456
Speaker 0: What remember?

243
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,122
Speaker 0: there was a thing with like North Korea?

244
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,186
Speaker 0: No South Korea and all.

245
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,190
Speaker 0: yes people use email.

246
00:14:55,271 --> 00:15:00,360
Speaker 0: Yes, because I'm sure in North Korea anyone uses email But it was South Korea and only old people are using email.

247
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:04,818
Speaker 0: and I combined that with the Soviet Russia and I oh I see what you did that I had.

248
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,790
Speaker 0: that was it was my thing on slash that I was your thing and people it was.

249
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:14,330
Speaker 0: It was cool because I posted it first before anyone else and then people actually carried it into other threads without me doing it Was.

250
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,516
Speaker 0: it was the one time it was good.

251
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,022
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

252
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:17,585
Speaker 1: slash out.

253
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:18,690
Speaker 1: I still find useful.

254
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:19,328
Speaker 1: I still read it.

255
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,370
Speaker 1: I I actually read slash dot as opposed to dig where I just go there to get whatever the news is and I ignore what?

256
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,131
Speaker 1: People post.

257
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:41,100
Speaker 1: Yep things of the day Bo de ga bo de go de ga bo de ga bo de ga.

258
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:43,693
Speaker 1: So I think Emily is the one who found this.

259
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:44,980
Speaker 1: I found it you found it.

260
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Speaker 1: All I know is I was out of town and I come back and I found it actually like over a week ago.

261
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,893
Speaker 0: I just didn't show it to anyone until more recently.

262
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:52,578
Speaker 0: Why not?

263
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,587
Speaker 0: The opportunity did not arise.

264
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:56,430
Speaker 1: This is so perfect.

265
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,035
Speaker 1: And now that's been around a while.

266
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,260
Speaker 1: There's starting to be internet buzz.

267
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:00,544
Speaker 0: Is there internet buzz?

268
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,287
Speaker 0: I didn't notice any.

269
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:02,411
Speaker 1: I saw it on dig.

270
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:03,716
Speaker 0: It was on dig when I found it.

271
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:06,164
Speaker 0: days and days ago Got more digs.

272
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,997
Speaker 1: All right, so but anyway, and also I saw an article on FARC about it.

273
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:17,240
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Nice, I think these people might get some press in the end just because New York City, you know, you know.

274
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,328
Speaker 1: But FARC there's this cliche.

275
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:22,489
Speaker 1: anytime New York City's in the news it's always like something minor and everyone always.

276
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:26,545
Speaker 1: this wouldn't have been in the news if it wasn't about New York City and There's got it.

277
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:29,869
Speaker 1: There's like this amplification effect Like an ESPN.

278
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,480
Speaker 0: would they get that same sort of thing?

279
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:43,580
Speaker 0: Like I listen to this one sports podcast and whenever they talk about like the Yankees or the Red Sox or anything like that People are always like, oh they keep talking about those New York sports Not paying attention to our middle of nowhere.

280
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's just you know more people living here than in the rest of our state combined.

281
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:52,642
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's all and ESPN's in Connecticut really close to New York Plus.

282
00:16:52,682 --> 00:17:01,001
Speaker 1: also it's kind of relevant to what's going on in the world today just because this is a video made by two awesome guys about Bodegas.

283
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:11,516
Speaker 1: now this might be a foreign concept to people who don't live in the Bronx or New York City or downstate New York because it's kind of I haven't seen this sort of thing elsewhere there.

284
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:12,398
Speaker 1: There are analogs.

285
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:21,689
Speaker 1: I mean you go to the hicktown in the middle of nowhere You'll find like the local not quite a 7-eleven that has some food But it's also a gas station and a general store.

286
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,000
Speaker 1: But this is really something special.

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,648
Speaker 1: It's the bodega in the Bronx.

288
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,520
Speaker 0: If you are walking around or in Queens or Brooklyn They have these all over the place.

289
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,860
Speaker 1: Yeah But I spent a lot of time in the Bronx and there's a lot of them in the bra.

290
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,117
Speaker 1: Oh there are often like two or three next to each other and the price varies by location.

291
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,580
Speaker 0: like this some of these near My work in Soho, but you did the prices are much higher.

292
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,220
Speaker 1: So what makes a bodega as opposed to just I don't know a convenience store?

293
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:54,767
Speaker 1: I think number one and as you'll see in this video very specifically is the quarter water Quarter water water water.

294
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,199
Speaker 0: if you don't got a quarter water, you're not in the bodega.

295
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:08,340
Speaker 0: I've never actually drunk that stuff I But I think my friend people who lived across the street from me when I was a kid Used to like buy it like a whole bunch of it from BJ's and stuff and I drank it a couple times.

296
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,851
Speaker 1: Wait a minute good buying that from BJ's that's kind of crazy.

297
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,557
Speaker 1: Yeah already only a quarter.

298
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:14,580
Speaker 1: How cheap is it there?

299
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,560
Speaker 0: It was it was when I was a kid.

300
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,400
Speaker 0: I would go over there and drink it and it'd be no good and I think they called them like teenies or something.

301
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,356
Speaker 0: They didn't call him quarter water, but and my mom wouldn't buy it for me and I didn't want it.

302
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:29,365
Speaker 1: cuz tastes like shit You know, I think that's pretty much it.

303
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,515
Speaker 1: if you see that for sale, it's probably a bodega.

304
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:35,178
Speaker 0: at least if it's 25 cents You're in the bodega.

305
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,469
Speaker 1: Just watch this video and all I have to say is it.

306
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,350
Speaker 1: it might not be funny if you don't live around here and you haven't seen this before.

307
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,259
Speaker 1: but Going into these things and eating some of that food sometimes and just being in it.

308
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,637
Speaker 1: It's such a fixture of the Bronx and it's just.

309
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,180
Speaker 0: yeah.

310
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:55,538
Speaker 0: I just like the general vibe I get from these guys in that it's sort of like the same vibe as the.

311
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,204
Speaker 0: you can't catch 10-pokemon's video.

312
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,187
Speaker 0: it is.

313
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:03,769
Speaker 0: and at the same time these guys are being all silly chilling in the bodega But they're also making a point.

314
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,880
Speaker 0: but they're not making the point like we're making a point.

315
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
Speaker 0: It's like they happen to make a point.

316
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:08,262
Speaker 1: I like that.

317
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:10,350
Speaker 0: their point like not even trying to make a point.

318
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,457
Speaker 1: but the economy was what fuck the fuck up.

319
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,271
Speaker 0: economy is still Fuck the fuck up.

320
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:17,284
Speaker 1: Oh shit What's really funny is there?

321
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:23,807
Speaker 1: obviously they're doing this kind of for the camera so they're playing it up a little bit, but People talk like that in the Bronx.

322
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:29,785
Speaker 1: if you walk into a bodega, you'll hear conversations that sound almost exactly like that Shit.

323
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:36,369
Speaker 0: Oh, man, you got some ice cream sandwiches And I actually eat those things all the time.

324
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,032
Speaker 0: They're 25 cents.

325
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:37,754
Speaker 0: You can't go wrong.

326
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,580
Speaker 1: Sometimes they're 50 cents, but they're better.

327
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:45,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, and where I live where I work, it's like $2 for two cookies with ice cream in this cuz you work in Manhattan.

328
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, I work in the Bronx, Manhattan.

329
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,817
Speaker 1: Oh Manhattan yes, well weren't you the one who didn't know where the word Manhattan came from?

330
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:52,359
Speaker 0: I do now.

331
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do now.

332
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:55,196
Speaker 0: I couldn't find it on the Internet's though.

333
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:55,840
Speaker 0: I asked the internet.

334
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,121
Speaker 0: I didn't.

335
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:56,724
Speaker 0: it didn't know.

336
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:57,386
Speaker 1: I did so.

337
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,740
Speaker 1: you asked the internet where the word Manhattan came from and you couldn't find anything.

338
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,711
Speaker 0: Not in the Wikipedia for Manhattan.

339
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:06,199
Speaker 1: Oh, so so apparently Wikipedia is the Internet.

340
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:09,132
Speaker 0: No, but that was the easiest place to look and it didn't say anything.

341
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:09,915
Speaker 0: and I was like what the fuck?

342
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:11,341
Speaker 1: you sure didn't say Anything.

343
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,405
Speaker 1: did you actually read the article?

344
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:13,890
Speaker 0: No, but I was.

345
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:20,116
Speaker 1: I skimmed the important parts because I worry now that Someone listening is thinking oh, I should go to the Wikipedia and look this up.

346
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:24,235
Speaker 1: and hey There's a section here called origin of the name Manhattan.

347
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,480
Speaker 1: Well, that's story.

348
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:29,066
Speaker 0: Well, yeah I looked at the article But you go to check the edits.

349
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:31,856
Speaker 0: cuz I looked at the article five seconds before the edit it was made.

350
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:46,540
Speaker 1: that added that Yes, that edit was made two and a half years ago, yes, yes quite Regardless this video will teach you a lot about what it's like to live work or be anywhere near the Bronx.

351
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:47,966
Speaker 0: Oh and one thing about these guys.

352
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:55,219
Speaker 0: I think their names are like Dallas and Rafi Rafi and Like in this video they have URLs like separate for each of them.

353
00:20:55,581 --> 00:21:00,096
Speaker 0: But now I think they call themselves like the Internet's also the Internet's celebrities.

354
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,100
Speaker 0: That's what they call themselves.

355
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,707
Speaker 1: That's so perfect for them.

356
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,355
Speaker 0: and they made some other videos.

357
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:06,364
Speaker 0: like in one of the videos They talked to hammer.

358
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:09,215
Speaker 0: like for real hammer is they're talking to them man.

359
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:14,100
Speaker 0: We should try to interview hammer Yeah, but there and hammer was saying cool stuff even though he wasn't too eloquent.

360
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:22,473
Speaker 0: I think it's cuz they caught him off guard, of course it's a hammer but that's why the video was so cool is because he was being all just Talking and these guys are.

361
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:23,520
Speaker 0: these are cool guys.

362
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:27,380
Speaker 1: So these guys, you know, actually I think part of our YouTube channel.

363
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 1: They remind me a little bit of Dave and Joel just in terms of it just banner.

364
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,080
Speaker 0: They do have a little Dave and Joel going on.

365
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,108
Speaker 1: I must say we kind of lost the banner as we I don't know we didn't commercialize but a lot of people accuse us of Having done so.

366
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:51,620
Speaker 0: All right So my thing of the day Hey rim bodega, if you're at sea on a boat Yeah, and it's the olden times and you do not have computers to tell you the weather or anything, right?

367
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:59,271
Speaker 0: Right, and you just looking at the water and you can't see anything but water and the boat and this you don't even have any Sails out because you're not sailing right now.

368
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,319
Speaker 0: You're just floating, right?

369
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,850
Speaker 1: Even if you're just floating you have to have sails out.

370
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,720
Speaker 0: Do you can't just float with no sails?

371
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,725
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

372
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,619
Speaker 0: you can't like tie them all up and just have the sticks.

373
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,440
Speaker 1: Sometimes you put a sail up just to keep your position.

374
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:17,054
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway Here's looking out over the water and you want to know how fast the wind is going.

375
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:18,378
Speaker 0: Well, you tell.

376
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:24,580
Speaker 1: well What I do is first I look at the exponent for my sea wise and then I roll that many dice against say an obstacle one.

377
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:29,340
Speaker 0: How do you really do it if you're on a real boat in real life and not playing a game?

378
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:32,276
Speaker 1: I just know because I'm an awesome captain.

379
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:34,926
Speaker 0: No Apparently I did not know this.

380
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:35,849
Speaker 0: I learned something today.

381
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,500
Speaker 0: There is a thing called the Beaufort scale.

382
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:40,166
Speaker 1: I thought you were gonna say bodega.

383
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:44,943
Speaker 0: No the or maybe the Beaufort scale be a ufo RT Beaufort Beaufort.

384
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:55,792
Speaker 0: the Beaufort scale is a way to tell how fast the wind is going based on looking with their eyeballs and taking in other sensory data.

385
00:22:55,813 --> 00:23:04,376
Speaker 0: with your five certain senses you can estimate the Speed of the wind and you know how dangerous that wind will be on sea and land.

386
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,580
Speaker 1: now, this is interesting.

387
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,320
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

388
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,660
Speaker 1: There was a time ladies and gentlemen before there were fancy computers and things and people didn't have cup anemometers.

389
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,603
Speaker 0: It was so primitive.

390
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:17,699
Speaker 1: people still had to know things like how fast the wind is generally and it wasn't just.

391
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,020
Speaker 1: you know.

392
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,007
Speaker 1: Oh, it's fast.

393
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:23,719
Speaker 1: It's not fast, but you had to at least be able to say All right, is it faster now than it was five minutes ago?

394
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:34,239
Speaker 0: yeah with the scale there's like 12 different like settings on the scale and You can get the wind speed within five knots or six miles an hour.

395
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:41,140
Speaker 1: It's kind of like how they used to figure how they figured out how fast tornadoes go and it's kind of sick.

396
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,531
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's kind of just.

397
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:43,499
Speaker 1: it's an interesting thing.

398
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,651
Speaker 1: Tornadoes, you know, they've ripped through farm country a lot and a farmer.

399
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:54,030
Speaker 1: I've heard this tale from someone else on BBC So I blame the BBC if this is not entirely accurate.

400
00:23:54,752 --> 00:24:02,859
Speaker 1: and they noticed that sometimes when tornadoes went through you know chickens and things get killed but the chickens were also short of all their feathers and Sometimes they weren't.

401
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:19,414
Speaker 1: so they took dead chickens and put him in wind tunnels and they discovered that on a dead chicken the feathers come off at a Certain speed of the wind and based on that after a storm came through they could look at the storm and know that Whether or not the wind in the tornado was faster than or slower than a given point.

402
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:24,080
Speaker 0: if they had the technology for a wind Tunnel, why didn't they have the technology for an anemometer?

403
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,495
Speaker 1: The reason is tornadoes come through really quickly and they're so fleeting.

404
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:31,900
Speaker 0: if you live in a tornado place Shouldn't you have an anemometer?

405
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,296
Speaker 1: So what are the odds that the anemometer is one in the path of the tornado?

406
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:38,260
Speaker 0: tornadoes are very narrow Obviously didn't see twister?

407
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:47,657
Speaker 0: You're supposed to put it in the way of the tornado with your truck While holding on in a room full of many many sides more size than any farmers you ever own.

408
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:59,570
Speaker 1: It's an f5 You know, I I just I would like to say because I didn't that movie was the second worst movie I've ever watched why I only ever qualified.

409
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,240
Speaker 1: qualified by the fact that I watched it all the way through.

410
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:06,160
Speaker 0: I watched it all the way through like two or three times because they made us watch it in school and it was so dumb.

411
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,304
Speaker 0: It's a dumb movie.

412
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,408
Speaker 0: There's nothing good about.

413
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:14,120
Speaker 1: worst thing is if there's this whole idea of the storm chasers And I believe this was invented by the Weather Channel.

414
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:16,626
Speaker 1: Yeah where they're like check out these cool people.

415
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:22,349
Speaker 1: their job is to chase tornadoes with fancy equipment in veins and look how cool and dangerous it is.

416
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:26,919
Speaker 1: and Not only does that profession barely exists, but it's not like that.

417
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:39,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly they just kind of fly airplanes through hurricanes and the airplanes are flying high and not in any real danger most of the Time and they have instrumentation on them that collects all the data and then they fly out.

418
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:46,797
Speaker 1: though speaking of bad movies I over the weekend had the displeasure of watching the first nine minutes of Silent Hill.

419
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:51,686
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, yeah I don't know what to do.

420
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:55,257
Speaker 0: So yeah before it scale before it scale, however, you pronounce it.

421
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:56,866
Speaker 0: if anyone learns it You're way cool.

422
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,399
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna learn it cuz I'm lazy.

423
00:25:59,063 --> 00:25:59,605
Speaker 1: It's pretty.

424
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,800
Speaker 1: I mean you look at it and the neat thing is a system like this is very.

425
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:09,814
Speaker 1: All the points are very specific things Like if you see small twigs breaking off of trees, then the wind is about this fast.

426
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,178
Speaker 1: It's very objective.

427
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,620
Speaker 1: Yep right, so We talk a lot on Tuesdays about gaming conventions.

428
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:26,880
Speaker 1: We talk a lot on Wednesdays about anime conventions and comic conventions But how come we haven't talked about any science or technology convention Scott cuz they kind of suck most of them.

429
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:28,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's it.

430
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:28,906

Speaker 0: Well this week was Friday.

432
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:35,526
Speaker 0: I think I went to digital life, which is It's pretty small.

433
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,217
Speaker 0: It's in the Javits Center, which is weird for being small.

434
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:40,145
Speaker 0: in the Javits Center It's run by things.

435
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:53,980
Speaker 0: if Davis and I'd been to it once before I think I went to it two years ago Which I think was the second one now the first time I went to it It was actually a lot bigger than it was this Friday and it's about it's sort of like this tech convention But it's sort of targeted at consumers.

436
00:26:54,141 --> 00:27:00,147
Speaker 0: so it's like here's the consumers chance to come and look at all this cool stuff that usually people only see a trade shows not allowed to go to.

437
00:27:01,158 --> 00:27:04,580
Speaker 0: and You know, you see mostly it's about half video games, you know.

438
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,679
Speaker 0: So like there's like a LAN party going on and the army has their little.

Speaker 0: crisis and Bioshock there and Nvidia's there and Intel.

441
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,360
Speaker 1: but and the other hand I can play Intel.

442
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:26,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other hands the other half is sort of like technology for normal people.

443
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:37,160
Speaker 0: so they'll be like cell phones and HP is there and Microsoft is there showing off their stuff and Toshiba's there with their laptops and you know that sort of thing.

444
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,839
Speaker 1: So on Microsoft, it's Vista and a zoom.

445
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,535
Speaker 0: Yep, now the first time I went there like the year the you know, there were.

446
00:27:43,676 --> 00:27:48,640
Speaker 0: there was big booths Right, which is and then there were the small booths and there were a lot of small booths.

447
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:55,763
Speaker 0: There's a lot of small people and the small people that year were mostly give it were mostly selling iPod accessories.

448
00:27:55,843 --> 00:28:01,562
Speaker 0: cuz like the iPod nano had just come out cuz I remember I was there looking for like an iPod nano case Cuz.

449
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:03,530
Speaker 0: there weren't any and I just got in the nano cuz.

450
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,402
Speaker 0: it's brand new and I think they're also Like.

451
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:08,009
Speaker 0: Nintendo was there with the DS cuz.

452
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,395
Speaker 0: the DS was super brand-new.

453
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,299
Speaker 0: That's how old this was.

454
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:20,242
Speaker 0: I missed that one, too yeah, and the one this Friday was sort of like just the big booths and there weren't small booths and it was kind of sad.

455
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:31,480
Speaker 0: and and it was most of the attention was on the video games and stuff and I think the only Significant announcement that happened there was like palm had a new device or something.

456
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,372
Speaker 0: That wasn't too exciting and it was just kind of yeah.

457
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:35,753
Speaker 0: Okay.

458
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:36,757
Speaker 0: I've seen all this stuff.

459
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:37,820
Speaker 0: I could see the stuff online.

460
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,389
Speaker 0: Okay, cell phones that I know exists.

461
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:41,333
Speaker 1: I think that's the big thing.

462
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,508
Speaker 1: a lot of these trade conventions Existed back in a time.

463
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,260
Speaker 1: I mean it was for you know, there wasn't an internet.

464
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:53,740
Speaker 1: You couldn't find out about stuff that quickly and now You really only need one or two journalists to see something and then everyone else in the world knows immediately.

465
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:55,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like why do they?

466
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:55,966
Speaker 0: I mean this?

467
00:28:56,046 --> 00:29:02,245
Speaker 0: I can understand cuz it actually lets consumers get hands-on with some stuff that they otherwise Couldn't get hands.

468
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,352
Speaker 1: What did you get hands-on with it?

469
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:04,036
Speaker 1: You otherwise couldn't.

470
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,520
Speaker 1: well I played with like a Nokia n95 for about a minute But when when are you gonna be able to play with that in a store?

471
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,382
Speaker 0: Never never.

472
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:13,067
Speaker 0: it's like a $700 phone.

473
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,412
Speaker 0: They don't really sell here that much.

474
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,117
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're not gonna buy one.

475
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,163
Speaker 0: No $700.

476
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:19,872
Speaker 1: so playing around with it enrich your life.

477
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, you feel better about that.

478
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:24,380
Speaker 0: Well, I actually I thought it's a lot smaller than I thought it was.

479
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it was too big and that's why I never really wanted one.

480
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:33,500
Speaker 0: now I realize whoa, that's like if anyone is out there with a fistful of money and you want the phone that does everything.

481
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,421
Speaker 0: Get.

482
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:37,132
Speaker 0: spend $700 on a Nokia n95.

483
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:38,035
Speaker 0: It does everything.

484
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,791
Speaker 0: You don't need to unlock it You don't you know, you can buy an unlocked one from Nokia.

485
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:48,597
Speaker 0: It does everything everything Absolutely everything you want it does and it's really small much smaller than I thought.

486
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:53,196
Speaker 0: Uh-huh But other than that, I mean I didn't want to wait in line to play guitar hero 3 cuz.

487
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,000
Speaker 0: I could just play what it.

488
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,260
Speaker 0: I didn't want to sit around and play in a gaming tournament or anything.

489
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,920
Speaker 0: I didn't want to you know play with laptops that I could play with at the store.

490
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:12,226
Speaker 0: It's really just kind of a. the most exciting thing was I was walking around and there was some music and I go over there And it was MC Frontalot was there.

491
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,931
Speaker 0: Ah, but it was.

492
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,676
Speaker 0: he wasn't you know, he was just kind of.

493
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:22,492
Speaker 0: it was kind of sad actually, like no one was really Watching him or cheering or anything and he was just.

494
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:25,169
Speaker 0: I think he was there like someone was paying him to be there you know.

495
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,676
Speaker 0: and He was kind of sad like that guy at Kineticon who was in the panel room before us.

496
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:31,867
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It was kind of sad like that.

497
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:43,594
Speaker 1: I was like, oh poor MC Frontalot That's just what happens when you you take someone who was popular in one arena and pay him or for whatever reason just have them In another arena trying to get those people to switch arenas.

498
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:44,840
Speaker 0: Well, it was his arena.

499
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,000
Speaker 0: I mean it was super video game sponsorships, but but it wasn't super video games.

500
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:52,020
Speaker 1: Hey, it's a weekend party where all the penny arcade types would come.

501
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:55,156
Speaker 1: It's all the people who are in the city and want to see consumers.

502
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:55,820
Speaker 1: tech would come.

503
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:59,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think many people thought oh crap video games.

504
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,379
Speaker 0: Well, actually no is mostly video games.

505
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,852
Speaker 1: But how many people thought all video games and went?

506
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:05,300
Speaker 1: how many people even knew this was happening?

507
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,621
Speaker 1: They did.

508
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:08,032
Speaker 0: they did advertise around the city with various signage.

509
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not so much on the internet.

510
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,275
Speaker 1: I don't many internet people knew much about this unless they really follow the website.

511
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:14,943
Speaker 0: second gadget knew about it But that's about it.

512
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:20,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like the penny arcade reading vidya gamer No idea whatsoever.

513
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,480
Speaker 1: Plus it doesn't sound like it was their kind of event.

514
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,827
Speaker 1: It wasn't a hangout and play games all weekend.

515
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:27,476
Speaker 1: It was standing in line and play guitar here hero three once.

516
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:28,659
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much.

517
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:33,992
Speaker 0: So yeah, it really just wasn't that exciting and it wasn't worth any money to get in.

518
00:31:34,073 --> 00:31:37,483
Speaker 0: but Emily got in for free and I Got in.

519
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:39,330
Speaker 0: see the thing is the first year I went to this.

520
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:44,400
Speaker 0: I got in for free because someone on a blog Posted a code you could use to get a free ticket.

521
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:52,980
Speaker 0: That's the only reason I went in the first year that well the second year two years ago This year I went up and I was gonna pay to get in right.

522
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:55,251
Speaker 0: So I walk up and I don't know I did.

523
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:56,115
Speaker 0: I see a sign.

524
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:57,200
Speaker 0: This is self registration.

525
00:31:57,823 --> 00:32:01,120
Speaker 0: So I walk over I type in my information then I see a sign.

526
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,599
Speaker 0: This is printing station and I go over and my badge is printed out and they hand it to me and I'm like should I pay?

527
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,081
Speaker 0: They're like no No.

528
00:32:09,503 --> 00:32:21,272
Speaker 0: later I was standing around waiting for Emily and I saw there was a booth that said cashier that was before the self registration booth that I just didn't see that cashier booth Wow, and The cashiers obviously didn't notice.

529
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:22,380
Speaker 0: No one else noticed.

530
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:29,160
Speaker 0: I didn't notice and I just got in for free without even like I stole a badge basically without even realizing it.

531
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:34,000
Speaker 0: Oh, man, you should see this is when I was glad because if I would have paid I would have been pissed.

532
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:39,547
Speaker 1: It was They recognized me and they gave me a badge.

533
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:40,450
Speaker 1: I got in for free.

534
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,733
Speaker 1: Yeah geek nights blah blah blah.

535
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:42,475
Speaker 1: I'm a journalist.

536
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:43,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

537
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:46,157
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was just kinda

538
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:50,468
Speaker 1: Hey Wow I wish I could have done that for Ohio con -

539
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:59,693
Speaker 0: and that's why I missed the Friday night party line mostly cuz I It was weird cuz like I was at work, right and I was like, alright Am I gonna go home and do Friday night party line?

540
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:00,640
Speaker 0: Am I gonna go to this thing?

541
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,767
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh wait I'm gonna do the Friday night party line.

542
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:05,319
Speaker 0: and then later in the day Emily was like we gonna go to this thing.

543
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,184
Speaker 0: and I Was like do you want to?

544
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:09,059
Speaker 0: and she's like, yeah, and I totally forgot about the Friday night party line.

545
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,810
Speaker 0: If I'd remembered I probably would have gone home.

546
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:13,713
Speaker 1: if I recall.

547
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:19,079
Speaker 1: I believe I don't know she'll hit mad or laugh But I think she had an ulterior motive and getting you to go to that.

548
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:21,620
Speaker 1: I think she just wanted a ride home from the train station.

549
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,910
Speaker 1: Maybe it probably worked out though because it sounds like it was worth it to go.

550
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever point is is that?

551
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:34,691
Speaker 0: At least to give you something to talk about on the show, yeah Yeah, I guess the broader thing is you able to talk a little bit cuz?

552
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:45,902
Speaker 1: Scott went to one of these things that when it comes to science and technology The conventions that exist are not like the conventions for anime and video games and Star Wars Trek and Star Wars and all those Things.

553
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,520
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, I heard from Gerald of anime world order.

554
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,929
Speaker 0: There is going to be a convention down south somewhere.

555
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,762
Speaker 0: that is going to be but get this ready the Naruto and Star Trek Convention.

556
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:02,160
Speaker 0: what I'm not joking why I don't know but that's all I'm gonna say about it for now.

557
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,271
Speaker 0: Well, he continued about the tech conventions.

558
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:04,613
Speaker 0: god.

559
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:05,277
Speaker 1: I'm out of the loop.

560
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:09,080
Speaker 1: Yeah Right, but there seem to be two kinds of tech.

561
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,726
Speaker 1: Well, I guess three kinds of tech conventions.

562
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:15,806
Speaker 1: one of these kinds is a scam, but I'll get to that one last Because I mean the one Scott went to.

563
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:16,650
Speaker 1: these happen all the time.

564
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:21,382
Speaker 1: They're just a consumer slash press event where I guess they let.

565
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:26,266
Speaker 1: they usually let the public into these things just as a way of making more money and As a way of making some buzz.

566
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:32,333
Speaker 1: but largely these events are for the press, you know The company will announce we're releasing the cell phone.

567
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:33,899
Speaker 1: blah blah blah XD XD six.

568
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:36,154
Speaker 0: It's like e3 was supposed to be.

569
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,221
Speaker 0: yep Where.

570
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:50,547
Speaker 1: so the press will go and they'll take all their press photos and they'll take the press kit and they'll interview like the four engineers were standing there with canned statements ready to be interviewed and then they go home and they write their little article about the new Thing that came out and all the articles are the same.

571
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:51,389
Speaker 1: but that doesn't matter.

572
00:34:51,429 --> 00:35:05,235
Speaker 1: and that's what those events mostly are that a lot Of times the public gets let in just to hey we can make some money just by letting people in and hey The people who are setting up and showing stuff off They'll be happy because now they can also hawk their wares to normal people.

573
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:06,460
Speaker 1: instead adjust to the press.

574
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:20,475
Speaker 0: That's what a lot of the for-profit comic book conventions do is they have it like an industry night or like a preview day or something like that where You know the people are in the business They're supposed to get in and not other people and so that they can do business and then they let.

575
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:30,327
Speaker 0: while everyone has these booths Why not let normal people in we can charge them for admission and then sell shit to them or put the cashier where no One will notice it and then not charge people for admission.

576
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,320
Speaker 1: That's - I guess I can say pretty it's clear.

577
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,636
Speaker 0: Actually, it was kind of sad that I missed the cashier was pretty big and obvious, but they missed me.

578
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:39,599
Speaker 1: I don't know.

579
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:50,468
Speaker 1: Sometimes because there was a time in my life when if I had an opportunity to either talk my way into or somehow get a free badge Regardless of how shady it was I probably would have just done it.

580
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, like try bypassing the cashier to go.

581
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:56,997
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, I'll bet we could have if we really wanted to.

582
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:03,200
Speaker 0: yeah I think the failing that they had was they didn't have the badge giveaway as the person who gives you them takes your money.

583
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,027
Speaker 1: Well, I figure one they probably didn't care.

584
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, and two they probably just didn't even think.

585
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:14,879
Speaker 1: nope Anyway, yeah, the sad truth is it's not that hard to get into any convention free if you're willing to be a shady, dude.

586
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:18,700
Speaker 0: So let's talk about the different types of like science tech conventions, right?

587
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,672
Speaker 1: Well aside from the one we just talked about which Scott went to there all I can say about them beyond what we've already Said is that they're usually not worth going to know

588
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:26,496
Speaker 0: because anything

589
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,159
Speaker 1: you would get to do there You'll be able to do in the real world pretty quick.

590
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,400
Speaker 0: Right now the major kind that you're gonna see most often are these kind where you're supposed to like conferences.

591
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,033
Speaker 0: You're supposed to learn something, right?

592
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:42,320
Speaker 0: It'll be like Pycon or OSC on or something like that and some of those are actually good stuff.

593
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:51,370
Speaker 0: You will learn things if you go there and you want to learn and they have people giving speeches and presentations and workshops and you Know birds of a feather thingies going on.

594
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,675
Speaker 1: I remember it a penguin con.

595
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:53,780
Speaker 1: I learned a lot about PGP.

596
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, this stuff to learn right?

597
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:05,994
Speaker 0: the thing is they're usually aimed at people with jobs and they charge a lot of money to get in and Everything costs a lot of money cause like hundreds of dollars to go.

598
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:06,959
Speaker 0: We're not talking like 50 bucks.

599
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:08,099
Speaker 0: You think that's a lot of money?

600
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:15,447
Speaker 1: No, these things are like it's 500 bucks to get in and you got to stay there for like five days and each different thing You want to see that's just to get in.

601
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:21,633
Speaker 0: if you want to go see like speech one two and three you have to pay Separately for each one of those things and most of these events there.

602
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:23,220
Speaker 1: These are the ones that are kind of scams.

603
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:33,188
Speaker 1: They're not marketed to people because very often except for the exceptional rare ones that are actually worthwhile most of these are marketed to Corporations and they market them as.

604
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:40,090
Speaker 1: send your employees here tax breaks whatever because of you know training and it'll make your employees better.

605
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:42,937
Speaker 1: if you don't send your employees bad things will happen.

606
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:53,191
Speaker 0: and what happens is companies spend a lot of money and this company that does the presentation convention makes a lot of money and Employees basically get off work get a free business trip.

607
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:55,700
Speaker 0: They don't actually really learn anything.

608
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,660
Speaker 0: They mostly hang out with the other people they're drinking and having fun in hotels and whatnot.

609
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,592
Speaker 1: It's kind of a scam that gets.

610
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:06,497
Speaker 1: it's good for everyone But the corporations that send their employees off which who cares?

611
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,285
Speaker 0: that's your boss What do you care if they get up?

612
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:09,971
Speaker 0: I mean unless you are the boss.

613
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:10,694
Speaker 0: It's scary.

614
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:12,120
Speaker 0: Don't send your employees there.

615
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:15,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, just remember most of these tech conferences not just tech.

616
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:16,760
Speaker 0: They're even doing it for podcast.

617
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,260
Speaker 0: You know, it's like podcasting expos and things like that.

618
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:28,855
Speaker 0: Oh, they're growing and they're putting them all over the place and they're like come learn about podcasting Give us a lot of money and you'll listen to like a few workshops about podcasting for a weekend.

619
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:31,999
Speaker 0: and it's like give me a break Dude, you're just you're ripping everyone off.

620
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,145
Speaker 1: these events are almost all worthless.

621
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:46,308
Speaker 0: and these companies like they catch on to the latest trends and then they start conferences about the Latest trends and then you know, they'll keep switching them up as much as they can to keep up with with the times to get More people to show up.

622
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:47,640
Speaker 1: Yep along the same line.

623
00:38:47,740 --> 00:39:01,305
Speaker 1: sometimes what they'll do is they'll have a timeless generic thing like leadership training or team building or anything like that and it's all $2,000 to send you.

624
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:06,816
Speaker 1: and if your boss ever asks you if you want to go to one of these things say yes Because here's what it really means for you.

625
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:12,900
Speaker 1: one Like Scott said you get off work for a bunch of days because they usually you'll notice scheduled during the week and not on weekends.

626
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's very on purpose because otherwise people wouldn't want to go.

627
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,375
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm to all expenses.

628
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:19,678
Speaker 1: paid vacation to somewhere.

629
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:20,200
Speaker 0: three.

630
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:33,500
Speaker 1: It could be right next door to your house, but vacation three these places often don't take Attendance so you don't actually have to go to the events unless they're checking and you'll find out right away if they're checking or not.

631
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:38,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know if you want to learn something there's usually is an opportunity to learn something.

632
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:42,036
Speaker 0: if you don't want to learn anything What do they care if you paid and didn't show up?

633
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:45,347
Speaker 1: Yeah Honestly, usually there's not much to learn.

634
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:53,644
Speaker 1: I mean if you go to it one of these things about I don't know web 2.0 whatever business PR you're not gonna learn anything You didn't already know.

635
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,160
Speaker 0: and also if there was something to learn all the good ones.

636
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:04,700
Speaker 0: You can listen to the presentations like months after the conventions on the IT conversations podcast network for free.

637
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:12,020
Speaker 0: So if you want to hear these kinds of you know presentations that learn something and you don't want to pay money Go to IT conversations.

638
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:15,011
Speaker 0: They have all these things up there to download and listen to.

639
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,135
Speaker 1: the rule when going to.

640
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:18,102
Speaker 1: one of these is the one in Rome Approach.

641
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:24,385
Speaker 1: if you go to one and you see that everyone else there or the majority of them are going to all the events Go to all the events.

642
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:35,347
Speaker 1: if you go and you immediately see everyone heading out to the bars Head out to the bars and while you're there network with all those people because that's the only real purpose of yes I don't network for your business.

643
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:36,030
Speaker 0: Oh god.

644
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,000
Speaker 1: No, don't even say what company you work for just unless you want to.

645
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,225
Speaker 0: I mean network for yourself.

646
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:40,686
Speaker 0: Mostly.

647
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:41,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're there for you.

648
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:44,180
Speaker 0: Take advantage of your company's spending money.

649
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,151
Speaker 0: Actually, no way your company was only gonna ask you when you got back.

650
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:48,335
Speaker 0: What did you do there?

651
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:49,620
Speaker 0: Did you learn anything?

652
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,300
Speaker 1: Yes, I learned how to energize my synergies.

653
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:53,954
Speaker 0: Yes just make up some bullshit.

654
00:40:54,419 --> 00:41:02,313
Speaker 1: and Seriously, if you're looking for a job in your industry and you want to get out of where you are Go to one of these things and you'll find someone who's gonna hire you.

655
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:13,750
Speaker 0: most often if you're actually trying to meet people Yeah the other kind of tech conference that you're gonna see is actually the kind that's sort of worth going to and that's sort of You know the by geeks for geeks kind of deal penguin.

656
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:15,315
Speaker 0: well penguin was weird.

657
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 0: and then it was a science fiction Linux gaming convention all in one, right?

658
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,860
Speaker 0: So even if the the tech Linux part of it failed, it would be science fiction and gaming which is worth going.

659
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was primarily Linux.

660
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:30,171
Speaker 0: It's primarily Linux though.

661
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:36,155
Speaker 0: And basically during the day you had People who are really cool, especially that Mozilla guy.

662
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:36,336
Speaker 0: Wow.

663
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:37,120
Speaker 0: He was really awesome.

664
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:38,564
Speaker 0: It's talking.

665
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:46,915
Speaker 0: you could go and sit and listen to the talk about all this awesome Linux stuff and then at The end of the day at night everyone sits around playing board games and drinking.

666
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:47,960
Speaker 0: Yeah free beer.

667
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:50,790
Speaker 1: Well, that kind of convention is the kind I like.

668
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,960
Speaker 1: it's the same as the video game anime whatever conventions.

669
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,439
Speaker 1: It's just a convention where it's about a topic nominally or it's about a field of interest or some way to get a bunch of like-minded people together.

670
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:11,421
Speaker 1: But regardless of what is going on at the event The point is you've got a bunch of people with similar interests in a hotel somewhere and they can talk to each other and hang Out.

671
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:14,915
Speaker 0: Yep, similar conventions would be like Def Con in Vegas.

672
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very similar.

673
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:17,126
Speaker 0: They also.

674
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:17,932
Speaker 0: there are other things.

675
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:31,460
Speaker 0: there are other open source things You can go to that are pretty cool in a similar way like bar camp or things like that Where basically what it is is a bunch of open source type Program where people get together and like they work on stuff and teach each other things.

676
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:37,260
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing you can go to if you actually want to learn and do Technology for a weekend or something like that.

677
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,962
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get.

678
00:42:37,982 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 0: I mean, there'll be some drinking and some playing and some fooling But it's primarily gonna be technology and learning and it's mostly for open source cool hip people and not so much the businessmen.

679
00:42:48,391 --> 00:43:02,877
Speaker 1: Yep the one thing I can say at least if the internet and my Experiences at penguin con are any indication and I think they are if you think that the people at anime cons drink a lot or the People at sci-fi cons drink a lot Good God, it seems like Linux people.

680
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:09,163
Speaker 1: for some reason There is a very strong correlation between them and vast quantities of micro brewed beer Mm-hmm.

681
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:14,680
Speaker 1: I mean penguin can't head as part of admission if you had a badge infinite free beer for the whole weekend.

682
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,665
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you remember that?

683
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:17,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

684
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:23,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never been to another comment had that they made like there was that like colored Alcohol they were given.

685
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:26,275
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the pangolactic gargle blaster the supposed peg.

686
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,058
Speaker 0: I that wasn't really.

687
00:43:27,098 --> 00:43:29,446
Speaker 0: it was just like God.

688
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,813
Speaker 1: it wasn't really the pangolactic gargle blast.

689
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:33,840
Speaker 0: Oh, it was just Vodak and Kool-Aid.

690
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,427
Speaker 1: What is the pangolactic gargle blaster?

691
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,912
Speaker 0: It's not Vodak and Kool-Aid.

692
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:38,433
Speaker 1: What is it?

693
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:39,456
Speaker 0: I gotta look it up.

694
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:45,612
Speaker 0: I know it's from this the The hitchhikers whatnot.

695
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:47,038
Speaker 1: It's not real is what it is.

696
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:51,551
Speaker 1: I know Most recipes I've seen are made up and usually involve Everclear.

697
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:54,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now this is like Vodak and Kool-Aid.

698
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:56,180
Speaker 1: It was it was a big cooler.

699
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:57,056
Speaker 1: It was.

700
00:43:57,076 --> 00:44:02,580
Speaker 1: you know You go to a party and there's that blue drink and everyone knows not to drink it unless they're prepared to not remember what happened.

701
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,829
Speaker 0: Many people drank it and didn't remember what happened.

702
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,619
Speaker 1: I believe there was a drink like that at Scott Johnson's bacchanal.

703
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,411
Speaker 1: Bacchanal you say the one we didn't go to because the Wii was coming out.

704
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:13,696
Speaker 0: All right that one.

705
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:14,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at us.

706
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:26,040
Speaker 1: All right It's either go to a crazy drunken party that a friend of ours is throwing and he's gonna get his Wii at the drunken party or Just stay at home and do nothing and then get a Wii as soon as it comes to me.

707
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,844
Speaker 0: What was I gonna do?

708
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,680
Speaker 0: try to play the Wii with all these drunken people or try to play the Wii?

709
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,146
Speaker 0: Quietly in my own home.

710
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:33,420
Speaker 1: Well, you play with your Wii quietly in your own home all the time.

711
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:35,419
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it was the next logical.

712
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:40,097
Speaker 0: Are there any other kinds of tech inventions going on we could talk about?

713
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:40,760
Speaker 1: I don't know.

714
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,587
Speaker 1: I I honestly avoid them.

715
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:43,109
Speaker 1: the only one.

716
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,020
Speaker 1: I'd love to go back to penguicon because the thing is I'm looking at penguicon.

717
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,282
Speaker 0: It's currently penguicon 6.0 is gonna be in Troy Michigan April 18th through 20th, but not Novi All right.

718
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:56,395
Speaker 0: No, but the the guest list is actually looking much sadder.

719
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:57,800
Speaker 0: I think the year we went was the peak.

720
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:00,745
Speaker 1: I think That was what 2.0.

721
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:04,777
Speaker 1: Yes, I think penguicon 2.0 was the perfect storm of Linux.

722
00:45:04,817 --> 00:45:05,780
Speaker 1: I mean think about all right.

723
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,252
Speaker 1: It's a Linux convention and we happen to live in Rochester.

724
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,620
Speaker 1: So we could just drive through Canada and be there wasn't that far.

725
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:13,979
Speaker 1: Neil Gaiman happened to be there.

726
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:16,991
Speaker 1: He wrote it he read us a story and then he got drunk with everyone.

727
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:19,080
Speaker 1: Steve Jackson just happened to be there.

728
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,588
Speaker 1: What's-his-name from slashed out just happened to be there.

729
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,113
Speaker 1: It was just not cool.

730
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,317
Speaker 0: Mozilla guy was there.

731
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,260
Speaker 0: our friends were there.

732
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,545
Speaker 1: It was nothing but cool people.

733
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:30,320
Speaker 0: pretty much all the people that we know that were like super techie went with us.

734
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,648
Speaker 0: It was like the super tech crew.

735
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:33,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like me you Alex.

736
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:45,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz we took his van took his van James James and Steve Pomeroy and he not Most open-source people in in the front row crew away on our way to penguicon.

737
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:55,090
Speaker 1: We had a cell phone connected to the internet and then we had an ad hoc wireless network shared from that cell phone and the First laptop to everyone else in the van.

738
00:45:55,673 --> 00:46:05,827
Speaker 1: It was it was all the open-source nerdy In fact, we wrote the SS ID down and put it out the window And we were hoping that if someone came by next to us if they just drove next to our car They could have connected to our land.

739
00:46:06,008 --> 00:46:06,451
Speaker 0: They could have.

740
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:07,396
Speaker 0: no one did.

741
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:08,000
Speaker 0: no one did.

742
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,684
Speaker 1: No, I don't think.

743
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:17,947
Speaker 0: many people drove from Rochester to Novi through Canada And we learned how to play tickers and Euphrates at that convention from a guy who worked for Mayfair game.

744
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:19,279
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah forgot about that.

745
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:19,782
Speaker 0: It was.

746
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:22,655
Speaker 0: it was quite the perfect storm penguicon 2.0 and I don't.

747
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:25,050
Speaker 0: I think if we went to another penguicon I think it would be a repeat.

748
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:26,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would be a disappointment.

749
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,411
Speaker 0: Here's the thing I think it was especially considering the distance we'd have to trap.

750
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:33,225
Speaker 1: it still would have been worth it to go if we still lived In Rochester, I think so.

751
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:36,960
Speaker 1: Yes, and it would have been worthwhile to go if we lived here.

752
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:39,512
Speaker 1: But it had the guest list from penguicon 2.0.

753
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:41,000
Speaker 1: I'd fly out for that exact same con.

754
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,888
Speaker 0: I would also especially with my 20/20 hindsight.

755
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:50,156
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, especially I mean remember Steve Jackson came over and said hey I've seen that game Puerto Rico.

756
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:50,620
Speaker 1: I didn't know.

757
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:56,306
Speaker 1: And we say alright scary, dude We're kind of busy right now.

758
00:46:56,326 --> 00:46:57,651
Speaker 1: Just leave us alone.

759
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,028
Speaker 1: And then some guy comes up says ah guys, that was Steve Jackson You just blew off.

760
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:06,420
Speaker 0: Oh And then we tried to suck up to him for the rest of the weekend and then drama happened, but whatever.

761
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,893
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the drama we're not gonna tell.

762
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:12,620
Speaker 0: the drama story Guess is one other kind of convention and that's like really targeted.

763
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:15,820
Speaker 0: They're not really conventions so much but conferences more often.

764
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,707
Speaker 0: But for example PyCon.

765
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:21,000
Speaker 0: it's all about Python or Ubuntu live.

766
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,891
Speaker 0: It was all about Ubuntu.

767
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:27,900
Speaker 0: or our friend Steve We just talked about went to something in the city recently that was all about Drupal.

768
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,903
Speaker 0: so if you have a really specific interest like WordPress or Something like that.

769
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:50,259
Speaker 0: like one project a lot of these projects like MySQL or PHP a lot of them have a big meeting somewhere that you can go to and all the big people in that Project sort of get together and and really make something happen like once a year or something like that.

770
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:53,934
Speaker 0: So this is a particular project that you were like really deep into.

771
00:47:54,335 --> 00:47:55,540
Speaker 0: Let's say you're really deep into.

772
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:05,320
Speaker 0: I don't know Moveable type which is a blogging thing, you know There's probably some sort of convention conference for that that you can go to somewhere in the world.

773
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:11,367
Speaker 1: Yep, the only problem with these is if you're not really into that thing, it's not that oh, well You won't have as good a time.

774
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,420
Speaker 1: It's you can't have a good time.

775
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,587
Speaker 0: There's nothing for you to do there.

776
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:21,475
Speaker 0: cuz imagine going to a place You know what people work on and talk about and help each other with WordPress for three days.

777
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:22,378
Speaker 1: Yeah.

778
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:29,405
Speaker 1: Yeah That's what it's gonna sound like an anime con where you could hate anime and everything involved with anime and still have a really Great time at an anime.

779
00:48:29,446 --> 00:48:41,138
Speaker 0: or go somewhere where people talk about, you know, drew Paul It's software architecture how to use it how to make it making patches to it current bugs the future of drew Paul the past The history, you know for three days, huh?

780
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:43,526
Speaker 0: Unless you're really into drew Paul.

781
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:45,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not gonna be worth your time.

782
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:47,460
Speaker 0: But if you are really into drew Paul totally go.

783
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,722
Speaker 1: Yep, of course that is it's interesting I mean.

784
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:56,130
Speaker 1: by the same token you look at the anime video game sci-fi world and there aren't the focused conventions or the focus.

785
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,893
Speaker 0: you can go to the.

786
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:58,056
Speaker 0: you can go to the convention.

787
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:02,625
Speaker 0: that's just for You know Gargoyles the animated series.

788
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:06,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, but from what I've read on the internet, that's just a giant sci-fi nerd party.

789
00:49:06,298 --> 00:49:08,288
Speaker 1: generally I mean not.

790
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:10,440
Speaker 1: it's kind of like everyone there likes gargoyles a lot.

791
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,954
Speaker 1: I mean, I like gargoyles a lot, but you know, I have really watched it really.

792
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually really good.

793
00:49:15,681 --> 00:49:16,765
Speaker 1: It's it's tough.

794
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:18,993
Speaker 1: I'm not yeah, I'm just saying it's.

795
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:22,427
Speaker 1: it was one of those rare cartoons Quote-unquote for children.

796
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:23,952
Speaker 1: That was actually pretty damn good.

797
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:25,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of want to watch this one.

798
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,683
Speaker 0: I think there was something else on when it was on so I didn't watch it too much and I mostly watched Something else.

799
00:49:30,724 --> 00:49:34,200
Speaker 0: I liked more and I didn't take a risk on it when I was a kid someday.

800
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,520
Speaker 0: Well Netflix and none of my friends were really into it either.

801
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,283
Speaker 0: So it was like.

802
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:41,380
Speaker 1: most of the fandom for gargoyles was actually a little bit younger than us.

803
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,231
Speaker 1: We were kind of on the early edge of that fandom.

804
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I was watching like beat ass instead.

805
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:48,575
Speaker 0: Why Batman the animated series?

806
00:49:48,595 --> 00:49:56,148
Speaker 1: Oh, I've Gotta stop hanging out with these comic people cuz You can't call things things like that beat ass.

807
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:57,030
Speaker 0: It's beat ass.

808
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,193
Speaker 1: No, it's Batman.

809
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,256
Speaker 1: I say Batman.

810
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:03,139
Speaker 0: That's the problem is is I know I know You know what?

811
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:12,769
Speaker 1: My answer to that is as far as I'm concerned with the sole exception of the movie where Michael Keaton plays Batman Batman the animated series is the only Batman.

812
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:13,712
Speaker 0: What about that?

813
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:16,000
Speaker 0: See if you just say Batman people think you're talking about Adam West.

814
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:17,050
Speaker 1: Oh, I know but you know what?

815
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:21,574
Speaker 1: I don't care When I say that man, I'm West watch out.

816
00:50:21,795 --> 00:50:22,959
Speaker 0: I like Adam West a lot.

817
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:31,960
Speaker 0: We done talking about tech conventions and conferences and how they're not quite I think we're done.

818
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that the secret of this show was we have our geek nights calendar where we list, you know Every show we're gonna do.

819
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:43,700
Speaker 1: we plan sometimes a month or two in advance But there has there's nothing in Monday at all for a long time.

820
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:49,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, we filled up the calendar But I think what's gonna happen is a lot of the questions people ask that take a whole episode to answer.

821
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,060
Speaker 0: We'll fill in the Monday calendar.

822
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:51,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

823
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,848
Speaker 1: So once again all week and a prior all next week - we're taking questions for all Four nights of geek nights.

824
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:03,972
Speaker 1: if you have an anime question a video game question I guess in anything question for Thursdays and doesn't anything.

825
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:12,100
Speaker 1: that's not Monday Tuesday or Wednesday should go Thursday And it doesn't just have to be questions about the tech or about the anime like well so-and-so directed blah.

826
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:13,508
Speaker 1: But what do you think about the other blah?

827
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:13,829
Speaker 1: he did.

828
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,010
Speaker 1: they can be questions like so What do you think about blah?

829
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,160
Speaker 1: or what was your first blah?

830
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, any question just ask us any any question that's related to anime, you know, whatever in any way.

831
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:29,760
Speaker 1: But the real secret of course was the tonight We didn't really have a show to do it all and we just kind of came up with this on the fly.

832
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:37,187
Speaker 0: I mean I was thinking of using the digital life as the opening bit and then using the yeah, but - is the news Like vice versa thought

833
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:47,360
Speaker 1: we were gonna talk about do a how computers work and talk about RAM But we realized that the history of RAM is boring and doesn't matter and the current technology of RAM is actually very straightforward.

834
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could talk about how RAM works and stuff like that, which is kind of interesting.

835
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:52,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's five minutes.

836
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:57,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, so bits go in capacitance Capacitance.

837
00:51:57,544 --> 00:52:02,931
Speaker 0: Oh Noah's We have to go clean the kitchen to eat some food.

838
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:04,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, the house is kind of a disaster.

839
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:05,760
Speaker 0: We've only really the kitchen.

840
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,291
Speaker 1: Yeah, a living room is better because I worked on it.

841
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:10,280
Speaker 0: I didn't put my laundry away, but that's about that.

842
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, I exploded all over the living room and I had to unexplode.

843
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:15,317
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and I found bits of explosion still.
