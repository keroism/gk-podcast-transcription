1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,951
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, October 18th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:12,372
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:19,799
Speaker 0: I'm sky and this is geek night tonight Video-game journalism as if you couldn't guess what we have to say.

4
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:29,945
Speaker 1: Let's do this By happenstance.

5
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:33,377
Speaker 0: I had a very fancy dinner at Benoit balls last night.

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:45,053
Speaker 0: Oh Cuz you know our friend Phil and his friend Sarah are going on a world traveling wandering tour of Basically around the entire world on foot and bike and their bike.

7
00:00:45,073 --> 00:01:03,695
Speaker 0: they biked to New York from Providence Stayed with us for the weekend and now are currently on route to Fort Lauderdale, Florida on the same bikes mostly But at one thing led to another and basically Sarah had like her cousin or something was the manager of this restaurant called Benoit And Benoit was a very fancy French place.

8
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:04,459
Speaker 0: That was very awesome.

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,500
Speaker 0: So I had something I have not had in a long time flag right beef tartare.

10
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:14,016
Speaker 0: Let me tell you that is one of the most delicious things you can ever have.

11
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:16,646
Speaker 1: it's pretty good That's not foie gras.

12
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:18,095
Speaker 0: No, it is not foie gras.

13
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:22,360
Speaker 0: It's also not Pure sugar thing is though, you know, we had to pay for our food.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:32,252
Speaker 0: Obviously the manager is not gonna be like yeah free, you know multi hundred dollar dinner, but for the guy's cousin Yeah, but they brought out like we didn't order many appetizers.

15
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,917
Speaker 0: They brought out like every appetizer.

16
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:34,980
Speaker 1: They were all left over.

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,767
Speaker 1: They would have thrown him out.

18
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:37,059
Speaker 0: No, they made him.

19
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 0: They brought out every dessert and they brought out fancy champagne.

20
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,097
Speaker 0: But I tested two of my theories.

21
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:52,138
Speaker 0: one Like I always say the cheapest champagne and the most expensive champagne are both the good Champagne's and the expensive champagne was very good.

22
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:59,800
Speaker 0: The cheapest wine on the menu is almost always perfectly adequate If not better than these slightly more expensive wines on the menu.

23
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:02,935
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's all these different wines on the menu.

24
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:06,147
Speaker 0: I ordered the $26 bottle and you know what?

25
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:07,411
Speaker 0: It was pretty damn good.

26
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:08,756
Speaker 1: is that I mean?

27
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:12,091
Speaker 1: is even if you have a restaurant Are you gonna even have a wine on the menu?

28
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,860
Speaker 1: That's not good period.

29
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,475
Speaker 1: Usually it's the second but why would you why would you even have a bad one?

30
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:20,960
Speaker 1: Why not have all good ones?

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,561
Speaker 0: Well, what if?

32
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:27,280
Speaker 1: and then just psychologically price them said the one you have the most of is the one that's priced to sell?

33
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:30,079
Speaker 0: Well, it depends if you're a mediocre restaurant, right?

34
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:35,300
Speaker 0: The cheapest wine is also probably the worst wine out in the market.

35
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:42,860
Speaker 0: So what you do is you just buy the cheapest shit wine and you know charge eight bucks a glass for it?

36
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 0: Okay, I guess and be in a tourist town or something where no one will ever come back to your restaurant.

37
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,634
Speaker 1: Anyway, maybe I don't know.

38
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:56,735
Speaker 1: I don't know I can't imagine a place would have a bad wine or that even a winery would make a bad wine.

39
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:59,043
Speaker 0: a place had some really Bad.

40
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,689
Speaker 0: well, it was just a bad wine.

41
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,331
Speaker 0: They recommend it.

42
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:01,994
Speaker 0: It was terrible.

43
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:02,757
Speaker 0: It wasn't corked.

44
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:03,620
Speaker 0: It was just terrible.

45
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,170
Speaker 0: It was that steak place.

46
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,342
Speaker 0: We went to in beacon or in fish kill Uh-huh.

47
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:10,515
Speaker 0: Remember the same place that wouldn't let us leave because we didn't order enough alcohol.

48
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,466
Speaker 1: I Don't remember that happen.

49
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:12,869
Speaker 1: Really?

50
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:14,300
Speaker 0: You don't remember shit.

51
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,992
Speaker 1: I remember going there, but I remember them not letting.

52
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,840
Speaker 0: so we brought the whole crew one time there.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,900
Speaker 0: We had like 14 people around this big table and we had a gigantic dinner But no one ordered booze and no one wanted dessert.

54
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:37,455
Speaker 0: So once it was apparent that we weren't gonna order like booze They basically never brought us menus for like ever and the service was the slowest possible and then they just wouldn't bring the check And everyone disappeared.

55
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean it wasn't they did.

56
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:45,720
Speaker 1: it wasn't them not letting us leave It was them trying to hit, you know, it wasn't like you can't leave until you buy alcohol.

57
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:46,784
Speaker 0: Ah, but it was.

58
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:49,533
Speaker 0: you can't leave until we bring the check and even asking for the check.

59
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:50,296
Speaker 0: It did not appear.

60
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:54,612
Speaker 0: Yep Well, I'll never get there again, okay, it's highly unlikely.

61
00:03:54,632 --> 00:04:00,794
Speaker 1: if we were to go there we would eat it cafe Maya and Kaibo Kaibo Whatever.

62
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,553
Speaker 1: So let's just get this onwards like go home.

63
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,693
Speaker 1: Uh So check this out.

64
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,220
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

65
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,151
Speaker 1: Remember that there was the Battle of the Scrolls versus the Elder Scrolls.

66
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,417
Speaker 1: Yep, man trying to keep you down.

67
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:18,678
Speaker 0: So elders What amazes me is how like?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,107
Speaker 0: Blatant this sort of infringement suit was.

69
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:27,260
Speaker 0: I mean, it's kind of like if I if Apple computers went after the Apple farm.

70
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:29,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they went after Apple Records.

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,453
Speaker 0: There was a battle there, but that was fine because actually Apple Records had like.

72
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,180
Speaker 0: the trademark stuff was very specific.

73
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:41,038
Speaker 1: Anyway, but the point here is that so remember notch was like, hey, let's just play quake to settle this.

74
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,088
Speaker 1: and they were like No, we're gonna go to court.

75
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,456
Speaker 1: He's like, alright cuz he had money.

76
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:49,192
Speaker 1: Yep Does your big first mistake is not just you know suing you.

77
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:56,563
Speaker 1: either sue someone who doesn't care Like, you know some company or you sue someone who doesn't have money But does care.

78
00:04:56,823 --> 00:05:00,454
Speaker 1: you never sue someone who has money and cares because they will fight you.

79
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:06,212
Speaker 1: and of course notch Won at least well, he got an interim injunction, which means he won.

80
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,195
Speaker 1: but they can appeal.

81
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,900
Speaker 0: but but that's that's very important.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,678
Speaker 0: A lot of people a lot of people always say that if you you know, like oh they can still appeal.

83
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 0: it appeals.

84
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:17,176
Speaker 1: Appeals aren't what you think they are right.

85
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:17,920
Speaker 1: an appeal isn't.

86
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:24,635
Speaker 1: Do over an appeal is something was wrong with the court that I was just in.

87
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:29,092
Speaker 1: not so, you know, so it's like Let's say I go to court and I'm guilty.

88
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:29,333
Speaker 1: Of course.

89
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,016
Speaker 1: I'm not a lawyer.

90
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:30,760
Speaker 1: So some lawyers pregnant.

91
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:32,506
Speaker 0: I'm also not a lawyer.

92
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:36,080
Speaker 1: Nury was probably like just whatever from what I understand, right?

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,940
Speaker 1: Let's say I go to court and I was I'm a murderer and I get found guilty.

94
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:43,800
Speaker 1: If I want to appeal I can't just be like no seriously, I wasn't guilty.

95
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,608
Speaker 1: You have to be like you'd be like.

96
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:47,838
Speaker 0: the Constitution protects murder as a right.

97
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,020
Speaker 0: No, yeah No, you can argue that I get the original law was unconstitutional.

98
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,061
Speaker 0: No

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,504
Speaker 1: But when you appeal

100
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:56,898
Speaker 0: or you could argue that the process in the court was wrong like technicality when

101
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:05,379
Speaker 1: you appeal That's what you have to do is you have to say like look that court that I was just in they chose the jurors wrong And we guys why we have to do it again?

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,740
Speaker 0: Yep, the jury they they let the jury see me handcuffed which gave them a preconceived notion that I was guilty.

103
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:18,601
Speaker 1: You need some reason to show that there was something wrong with the court that you were just in and that's why you need to do Over.

104
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,340
Speaker 1: you can't get a do-over just because you didn't like the result.

105
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,539
Speaker 1: But lawyers are very good and they always find a reason to appeal.

106
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:26,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they need one.

107
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:27,189
Speaker 1: or why?

108
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:30,859
Speaker 1: if they amazing if you want to pay for the appeal They'll find a way to do it.

109
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,102
Speaker 0: but we always say I mean we want people who are awesome who do awesome stuff when confronted with lawsuits like this to fight and Not.

110
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,937
Speaker 0: you have my seal of approval for being one of the people who does that.

111
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,815
Speaker 1: Yep Because he has the monies.

112
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:45,848
Speaker 0: Yeah And he cares he does.

113
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,880
Speaker 0: I just it's such like a bleep.

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,279
Speaker 1: The thing I understand is why do they even care about?

115
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,540
Speaker 1: Some other guy making a game called Scrolls when their game isn't even called Elder Scrolls.

116
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,050
Speaker 1: It's called something something something.

117
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,440
Speaker 1: Elder Scrolls number something.

118
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,351
Speaker 0: Well, because you know, and I know that colloquially people know it as Elder Scrolls.

119
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:06,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Elder Scrolls series.

120
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:10,960
Speaker 1: Yeah elder scrolls Right, so why do they even care about someone else making in called Scrolls?

121
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,320
Speaker 1: What do they seriously think that is gonna happen is gonna hurt them in any way?

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,860
Speaker 0: I mean if I make a book like luscious vixens of the Amazon is Amazon gonna come after me, right?

123
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:27,384
Speaker 1: It's like Amazon be retarded if they actually thought that that was gonna hurt or modify their business or any people's perception of them In any way shape or form.

124
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,627
Speaker 0: so here's the question then why?

125
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,720
Speaker 0: why do you think they even bothered with this lawsuit in the first place?

126
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,580
Speaker 1: because I Think that there is a lawyer who works there who needs to do something.

127
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,750
Speaker 1: Otherwise you what is he there for lawyers?

128
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:48,467
Speaker 1: if you there's lawyers that work for companies And if you're a lawyer that works for a company as opposed to working for a law firm You need to do something.

129
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,940
Speaker 1: So if I'm a lawyer who works for say Apple, I'm sitting there.

130
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,011
Speaker 1: No one's suing Apple right now, so I don't need to defend Apple.

131
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:56,556
Speaker 1: Well, what should I do?

132
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:05,596
Speaker 1: I need to sue somebody so you got to look and look and look for someone to sue and Usually you find some patent or something and you say hey, I'm doing work here.

133
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,246
Speaker 1: Don't fire me I'm a lawyer works at you.

134
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,150
Speaker 1: Keep paying my salary.

135
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,795
Speaker 1: I'm working and I found a way to make the company money Which is sue people Because if you're an employee of a company, you have to find a way to make that company money.

136
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:17,700
Speaker 1: That's your job, right?

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Speaker 1: So some guy works for Bethesda Zenimax and he needs to find a way.

138
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,780
Speaker 1: He's a lawyer there and he needs to find a way to make the money.

139
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,979
Speaker 1: So he looks for someone to sue.

140
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:34,600
Speaker 1: So you see someone comes out with the game called Scrolls and then in the gaming news and he says aha Here's maybe we can make a trademark suit and I can prove my worth.

141
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,837
Speaker 1: I can win this I'm gonna go for it and he goes for it.

142
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:45,400
Speaker 0: Another option is that they knew this was kind of a BS lawsuit, but it would generate a lot of buzz.

143
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,545
Speaker 0: I mean everyone's talking about it.

144
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:53,924
Speaker 0: I don't know, you know gamers all the time will say something like oh due to X I will now not buy.

145
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:54,606
Speaker 0: why game?

146
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,973
Speaker 0: that is never the truth never.

147
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,398
Speaker 0: no one who says that means it.

148
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:07,131
Speaker 0: Nope Anyway, it's hard to say anyway, so Speaking of gamers saying they will never do something again.

149
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:07,834
Speaker 0: First.

150
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,980
Speaker 0: I want to talk about a technological issue.

151
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,898
Speaker 0: This is a kind of a Monday thing, but bear with me here.

152
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:19,211
Speaker 0: There is an issue issue number 44,106. it's a lot of issues for chromium.

153
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,879
Speaker 0: Ah, you know the Chrome web browser.

154
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:31,597
Speaker 0: Yep So the issue is that they would like the tab bar To be able to be moved under the URL bar, I don't know why people want that.

155
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:37,580
Speaker 1: I mean I've Suddenly, you know Firefox and Chrome both have tabs on top and I'm kind of just fine with it.

156
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,910
Speaker 0: Well, it's weird because I've noticed complaining about this.

157
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,180
Speaker 1: people use the mouse and you know what I say throw your mouse in the trash.

158
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,531
Speaker 1: I use the keyboard baby.

159
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:46,540
Speaker 0: I'm not complaining about it.

160
00:09:46,620 --> 00:10:05,088
Speaker 0: I think what it is is that and I was this way you were this way people who are between the ages of like 15 and 20 are this way if they use Linux you get this idea that I'm going to customize my computer a hundred fucking percent I'm gonna use like FVWM or whatever.

161
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:13,280
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make like this super awesome my personal interface And I learned that was a dumbass idea because you waste all your time customizing your computer.

162
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:18,844
Speaker 1: And so let's say let's say that I can say let's say it is more efficient Even though it's not.

163
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:24,340
Speaker 1: but let's say it is that moving the tabs to the bottom makes me like a half a microsecond more efficient.

164
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,339
Speaker 1: The amount of time it takes for me to check that setting box.

165
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:35,999
Speaker 1: In order for me to break even on time savings and that efficiency I would have to like use the tab bar like 10 billion times for it to add up.

166
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,240
Speaker 1: You know to be a break-even on the efficiency and you know what?

167
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,800
Speaker 1: I'm very likely in that time period to have to install Chrome again and change the setting again thus ruining the efficiency.

168
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:53,620
Speaker 0: So, I mean, it's very analogous to the whole Dvorak situation one There's no evidence that the Dvorak keyboard is in any way better.

169
00:10:53,941 --> 00:11:02,368
Speaker 1: There is only anecdotal evidence that it is more comfortable because you have to move your fingers less distance because the more Commonly used keys are closer to the house.

170
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:03,694
Speaker 0: So we've got that's about it.

171
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,140
Speaker 0: We've got vague anecdotal evidence.

172
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:17,140
Speaker 0: Yes, but I would argue that even if it were slightly better from all those perspectives the Inconvenience and loss of productivity when you have to use any other fucking computer in the world

173
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:18,223
Speaker 1: Yep more

174
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:24,180
Speaker 0: than a ways the benefits of Dvorak, so there's no reason to ever use Dvorak unless you're an idiot

175
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:24,678
Speaker 1: You know what?

176
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,599
Speaker 1: They're dumbasses who use Dvorak layout on say iPhones and other touchscreen devices and you can you guys check the iPhone.

177
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,151
Speaker 1: you can do It ah, but it's like why that's.

178
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,699
Speaker 1: there's just no point at that point.

179
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:38,276
Speaker 0: So this bug was entered.

180
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:39,944
Speaker 0: Comment number one.

181
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,296
Speaker 0: I think this bug should be rejected as design intent.

182
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:48,080
Speaker 0: comment number two I think this bug should be given high priority as a design deficiency.

183
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,029
Speaker 0: The shitstorm that ensued is Amazing and there is somewhere.

184
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,698
Speaker 0: there was a comment near the end of this thing that I'm reading right now.

185
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:02,800
Speaker 0: Quote I see a fork in this products future Chrome devs.

186
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,330
Speaker 0: There are a hundred plus users here overruling your UI designers.

187
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,015
Speaker 0: Give them the option now now now.

188
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:13,220
Speaker 0: now before we talk about That comment I want to talk about another gaming related thing.

189
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,960
Speaker 0: So counter-strike source a fairly venerable game a game that is kind of like it is completely mature.

190
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:39,040
Speaker 0: It's the second most popular FPS on the internet sometimes the third most popular right now numbers one and two being Team Fortress 2 and counter-strike 1 6. and For the first time in a long time There was an update and it wasn't just bugs valve changed some shit in counter-strike.

191
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:43,700
Speaker 0: Okay quote they reduce the standing and moving accuracy for pistols.

192
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:48,900
Speaker 1: That's good because a lot of people just fucking headshot the pistols which too easily it should be much harder.

193
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:58,000
Speaker 0: Well, it means now you have to get new position duck and shoot or stop running to shoot Decreased accuracy while moving with sniper rifles.

194
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 1: That's also good because a lot of people just freakin shoot from the hip and blow you right away And it's too easy to do that and I would do it all the time and it's probably not a good idea.

195
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:18,616
Speaker 0: And they fixed a bug that has been in a long-standing bug where you could use Weapon switch cycles to fire the AWP more often than you otherwise would be able.

196
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,760
Speaker 1: people were probably using that on me.

197
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,300
Speaker 1: That's why I couldn't win the gun game there.

198
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,525
Speaker 1: That's how come I couldn't get out of round.

199
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,980
Speaker 1: one is because people read up reloading their AWPs too fast in that first round.

200
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,540
Speaker 0: It's very telling that I've been playing count and I didn't know that trick.

201
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:32,396
Speaker 0: We've both been playing counter-strike since like beta 5 because I don't do tricks like that.

202
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,200
Speaker 1: I just play straight up.

203
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,933
Speaker 0: I didn't know that trick exists me there.

204
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:35,800
Speaker 1: other people try that shit.

205
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,694
Speaker 1: That's why I think we get owned and they did.

206
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,520
Speaker 0: Well, I don't get owned.

207
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:42,694
Speaker 1: I get owned in gun game in the first round when the AWPs are out.

208
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,279
Speaker 0: I'm okay with the AWP.

209
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,068
Speaker 0: I think your problem is you don't snipe enough.

210
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:46,892
Speaker 0: So you're not that good at it.

211
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,005
Speaker 0: Once you get past the AWP You're fine.

212
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am until you hit the scout.

213
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Speaker 1: There have been a few times where I got out of the AWP round very easily, but that you know, like right away.

214
00:13:55,561 --> 00:14:00,963
Speaker 1: But it's usually when someone's not looking at me and I'm hiding in a good spot And I just go.

215
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:05,300
Speaker 0: yeah, you know what I would do jump out into the middle just firing wildly from the head.

216
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've tried that to work sometimes.

217
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,240
Speaker 1: I usually do that more better with the auto snipers.

218
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:14,917
Speaker 0: So the forum the steam form because there was a problem with this rollout it.

219
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:25,390
Speaker 1: this rather thing Is this has been going on since the year 2000. when encounter strike they would this counter-strike forms would be like remove AWP from the game Remove p90 from the game.

220
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:35,172
Speaker 0: granted when the p90 was introduced It might as well have been called the automatic death machine P90 as in my hands is still the automatic death machine.

221
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:40,812
Speaker 1: as long as it's not a big a map that's wide open If it has even one hallway where people are close in.

222
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:45,410
Speaker 0: the p90 is automatic death machine But it was I guess machine across the map.

223
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,997
Speaker 1: I don't think in any gun game.

224
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:47,720
Speaker 1: I've ever played.

225
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,799
Speaker 1: I've had the p90 for more than 30 seconds.

226
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:57,006
Speaker 0: But anyway, I won't go through the details of the steam forum thread, but this update broke Counter-strike.

227
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,580
Speaker 0: you could not play it now.

228
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,428
Speaker 0: Good and the forum had all these dubious suggestions.

229
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,512
Speaker 0: now me being smart.

230
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:07,319
Speaker 0: I just looked figured out It was probably a problem with the download.

231
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:09,113
Speaker 0: Cleared the cat, you know.

232
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,871
Speaker 1: And you run the validate game file.

233
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,255
Speaker 0: Yep, and that fixed it.

234
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,459
Speaker 0: I started playing one.

235
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:19,040
Speaker 0: I can tell that the majority of players could not figure that out right away.

236
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,113
Speaker 1: Well, it is a little hidden option But if you know if you're a steam gamer You need to know that that option is there because you're gonna need to use it at least once.

237
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,972
Speaker 0: so in the forum someone suggested That and someone else said lol troll.

238
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:33,691
Speaker 1: in response to that Dude, no, it's a real.

239
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:39,451
Speaker 0: Maybe that was a very clever meta troll May be causing people to doubt the legitimate non troll.

240
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:43,225
Speaker 0: Maybe, you know, someone's like, how do I Reboot my computer?

241
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:44,129
Speaker 0: and someone's like hit control.

242
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:46,559
Speaker 0: I'll delete twice and the guys like lol troll.

243
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,149
Speaker 0: So in that thread it devolved into.

244
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,201
Speaker 0: oh This is gonna drive everyone back to 1/6 valve.

245
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,470
Speaker 0: those fuckers they have no idea how to design games.

246
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:03,262
Speaker 0: Why would they should get rid of that AWP exploit?

247
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:04,407
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you fuckers.

248
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:05,170
Speaker 0: You've ruined my game.

249
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,225
Speaker 0: I will never buy another steam game ever.

250
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:09,110
Speaker 0: I'm uninstalling.

251
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, right kid you care enough to post in the forums.

252
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,105
Speaker 1: you're never gonna install Steve.

253
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,395
Speaker 1: you're gonna install it and go oh shit install It again.

254
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:33,097
Speaker 0: Yep now these two Issues with chromium and counter-strike are the exact same issue and they dovetail into what happened to Team Fortress 2. not Team Fortress 2 tribes - Don't listen to anyone who plays your game.

255
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:38,534
Speaker 0: They're not as good at UI design as you most likely Just do what you think is best.

256
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:42,229
Speaker 0: and to to kind of like illustrate that I have a new job.

257
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,964
Speaker 0: I'm the vice president of product management for a company and I design software interfaces.

258
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:47,866
Speaker 0: It's one of the things I do.

259
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,336
Speaker 0: We had software that has an interface With a whole bunch of like tabs in it.

260
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:55,990
Speaker 0: Like there's these different views of different functionality little tabs built-in.

261
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,719
Speaker 0: Originally, the interface was very open.

262
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,990
Speaker 0: You could drag these tabs and these panels around arbitrarily.

263
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:14,088
Speaker 0: Customize it exactly as you want pull tabs out of the window put them on different monitors save like this layout for your particular user all this craziness.

264
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:25,849
Speaker 0: and What I found when I was watching people use this interface, which I did not design by the way It was designed before I got there was that the average person would accidentally drag a tab somewhere and never find it again.

265
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:26,693
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

266
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:30,487
Speaker 0: I made everybody happy by removing all of that functionality.

267
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:34,461
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, these are all just things to think about.

268
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:40,790
Speaker 0: when you complain about games When you suggest changes to games when you whine and when you design interfaces

269
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:49,723
Speaker 1: You don't know better than the people who do it for real right and this is part of Apple success while Apple gets many things wrong with their closeness and such right.

270
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,670
Speaker 1: but then again, am I just the guy complaining?

271
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,739
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's nothing to do with their design right?

272
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,010
Speaker 1: is they just hand down the design.

273
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,377
Speaker 1: They never do any focus groups or anything.

274
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,625
Speaker 1: They just design it and say this is it.

275
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,310
Speaker 1: This is what we think is great.

276
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:07,119
Speaker 1: this is what you get no changing and Like it or not like it or leave it.

277
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,950
Speaker 0: Oh, I feel like we could do a shark.

278
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:16,727
Speaker 0: I almost want to go back you and me and we should play cs16 and Then see a source like back and forth a couple times and then I don't remember what cs16 is like.

279
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:20,119
Speaker 1: I kind of remember but I haven't played.

280
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,790
Speaker 0: I remember the visual field, but I it's been so long.

281
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,877
Speaker 1: It's a lot faster and slipperier.

282
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:27,125
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually faster and I think one it's.

283
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:28,490
Speaker 0: I think source is slipperier.

284
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:41,857
Speaker 0: I want to go shoot the poop - But anyway things of the day.

285
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,770
Speaker 0: so if you've got some fuck I'm gonna have some fuck laying around.

286
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:45,987
Speaker 0: What do you do with it?

287
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,517
Speaker 0: Well, maybe if you've got some shit and you put it down in a glass bowl put some fuck on it I'll have a fuck shit stack.

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,659
Speaker 0: and that is the topic of this song which Surprisingly our friend Conrad had never heard and it's the kind of thing I would have expected him to hear.

289
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,069
Speaker 0: so I wonder if any of you have not heard it.

290
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:08,452
Speaker 0: The song is fuck shit stack, and I don't know if I want to say anything else about it Other than that.

291
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:09,756
Speaker 0: it is by the.

292
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,562
Speaker 0: I almost said late and great.

293
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:13,287
Speaker 0: He's not dead Reggie Watts.

294
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,070
Speaker 1: All right.

295
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,098
Speaker 1: So this is all over the Internet's.

296
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,447
Speaker 1: it's on College Humor now, but I saw it before.

297
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,250
Speaker 1: it was on College Humor.

298
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,630
Speaker 1: So this is not cut as a college humor thing falling down on the College Humor thing of the day.

299
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:27,929
Speaker 1: Yes, sure, whatever.

300
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:42,589
Speaker 1: So this dude does his little science project where he takes a superconductor and some magnets and liquid nitrogen And he freezes that superconductor so cold that it has a scientific phenomenon that I forget the name of called something locking Whatever.

301
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,850
Speaker 1: Basically, I don't really understand what's going on here.

302
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,926
Speaker 1: I tried to read it and I was like I don't get it.

303
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,044
Speaker 1: But basically the magnetic fields get frozen or some shit and it hovers.

304
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:57,937
Speaker 1: you can make things hover in The air if they're really cold Superconductors of a certain type.

305
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:04,489
Speaker 1: there's like two types of superconductors has to be a certain type of superconductor It has to be really cold and has to have magnets and then it can hover.

306
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:21,169
Speaker 1: but we can't actually develop any sort of floating cars or anything because they would have to be really cold and made of giant superconductors with giant magnets in the street and Liquid nitrogen all over the fuck and it wouldn't work All right.

307
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,441
Speaker 0: Yeah This this thing of the day caused me to read over lunch.

308
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,970
Speaker 0: the Wikipedia article is on pretty much everything related to superconductivity.

309
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,096
Speaker 1: Can you explain this to me then?

310
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,705
Speaker 0: and I forgot the majority of it.

311
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:36,350
Speaker 0: It has to do with the fact There are two kinds of superconductors.

312
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,543
Speaker 0: I figured out that part one is permeable to magnetic fields and one is not.

313
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:49,478
Speaker 1: All right, so as a result Anyway It's real science is not bullshit though.

314
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,927
Speaker 0: in the meta moment we were at the New York Comic Con.

315
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,710
Speaker 0: as press We will have a review of it whenever we have time.

316
00:20:55,414 --> 00:21:01,130
Speaker 0: I am going to Japan with Emily for two weeks starting next week So the schedule for geek nights might be a little wonky.

317
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,218
Speaker 1: We only need four shows in the can.

318
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,503
Speaker 0: the next conventions.

319
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:09,714
Speaker 0: We will be at will be burning Apocalypse con.

320
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:16,891
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah that on 11 11 11 11 11 12 11 12 11 and 11 13 11.

321
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, I carried away with my 11s.

322
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all the way up.

323
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,670
Speaker 0: And then we will be at mag fest.

324
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,604
Speaker 0: Yep, mag fest.

325
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,210
Speaker 0: Oh We are guests as we were last year.

326
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:35,790
Speaker 0: I imagine that we will go to mag fest forever much like the penny arcade expo for as long as it exists and Doesn't fall apart like katsu-kan.

327
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:41,930
Speaker 1: So also the book club selection is a double book.

328
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:53,834
Speaker 1: Oh my god all the way one very tiny book the little prince by Antoine de Saint-Ejou Paris, which I assume I'm pronouncing correctly because no French people have yet to complain There aren't French people.

329
00:21:54,416 --> 00:22:01,546
Speaker 1: and also another book by him that you that takes more than 20 minutes to read Which is the wind sand and stars.

330
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,900
Speaker 1: Also by Antoine de Saint-Ejou Paris.

331
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,586
Speaker 0: I will point out not to advocate piracy, but I have a Kindle I just bought and I wanted to you get an e-book of the latter.

332
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:17,856
Speaker 0: the former has pictures so don't you have two long plane rides to read and There is no official ebook.

333
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,570
Speaker 0: If you google for that book, you will find a PDF right away.

334
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:30,680
Speaker 0: I found physical books all over the place I know but I wanted an e-book and I'm saying if you google for the name of that book and the word ebook You will find a PDF.

335
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,865
Speaker 1: I don't care if you buy the book.

336
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:32,850
Speaker 1: I just care if you read it.

337
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,047
Speaker 1: That's what book club is about reading a book.

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:44,052
Speaker 1: Also visit us on the internet facebook.com slash front row crew twitter.com slash geek nights for a crew calm and such.

339
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:49,950
Speaker 0: and if you want us to Appear at a convention at a school at an event any of the things that you guys like us to come to?

340
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,525
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone I ran into with the New York comic-con says something to the effect of.

341
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:54,489
Speaker 0: so when is your show?

342
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:56,630
Speaker 0: To which I said, oh, we're not doing one.

343
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,812
Speaker 0: So if you want us to appear at anything Don't contact us.

344
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,435
Speaker 0: that will get you nowhere.

345
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,778
Speaker 0: contact the thing you want us to be at now.

346
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:16,162
Speaker 0: if you run the thing and Have the actual authority to invite us as opposed to yeah I'm a volunteer for the screenings department of a convention.

347
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:17,445
Speaker 0: I will ask them to bring you.

348
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:29,039
Speaker 0: then we'll talk but otherwise tell the event itself to invite us and As long as they're not dick bags is a good chance will come if you know they're not a million miles away and whatever.

349
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:29,319
Speaker 1: yeah

350
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,184
Speaker 0: I mean It depends

351
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:32,186
Speaker 1: right

352
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:33,329
Speaker 0: all right,

353
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:37,199
Speaker 1: so we did do a show a long time ago

354
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,845
Speaker 0: in 2007

355
00:23:38,845 --> 00:24:13,280
Speaker 1: about reviews in General not about game reviews specifically, but about reviews, and I'm sure there was much talk of game reviews in that show however But we really haven't done a show about specifically Video game journalism, which is a long-standing hot topic in the video game world especially because well you know people like to be meta and all your video game talk comes from video game journalists who talk about themselves and Because it's a relatively new field of journalism compared to other fields of journalism such as political journalism.

356
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:22,305
Speaker 1: There's a lot of you know questions and uncertainties and because a lot of the people in the field are not professional journalists I mean they they do.

357
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:27,538
Speaker 1: they do journalism as their professional job, but they weren't necessarily trained in journalism.

358
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,705
Speaker 1: You know That thoroughly.

359
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:33,339
Speaker 1: you know there's a lot of you know sort of murky areas, and it's not.

360
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,563
Speaker 1: you know It's not the same.

361
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:40,100
Speaker 1: reporting on video games is not the same as reporting on governments or other things.

362
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,205
Speaker 1: So you know there's.

363
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:49,423
Speaker 1: there's often much talk about many things in this department that are very controversial like Pay.

364
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,073
Speaker 1: you know people getting paid for better review scores.

365
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:57,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was just a story Today about how Dutch newspapers are being pressured by EA.

366
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,986
Speaker 0: They basically if you wanted to review copy of the game you had to fill out a survey and the survey was like do You like the game?

367
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:06,480
Speaker 0: What do you think of our primary competition?

368
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:10,418
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's let's cover that to begin with right.

369
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:18,760
Speaker 1: so You know the fundamental problem here Is that any video game journalism that exists right is usually on its own?

370
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,428
Speaker 1: It's not like in a newspaper.

371
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:21,573
Speaker 1: That's pretty rare right.

372
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:34,834
Speaker 1: so it sometimes exists in a newspaper But usually it's in a video game website or a video game magazine like IGN or Kotaku and all the advertisers Or the vast majority of them are video games, and they don't want it.

373
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:37,940
Speaker 1: You know if they lose those video game advertisers They're out of business.

374
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:44,040
Speaker 0: Scott are you implying that there's a perverse incentive in the journalism of video games due to the fact that it's kind of this?

375
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:45,628
Speaker 1: Huh right you know.

376
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,775
Speaker 1: so look at the New York Times.

377
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:49,887
Speaker 1: right the New York Times Doesn't really have political advertising in it.

378
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 0: now it may, but that's not its only source of advertising.

379
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,484
Speaker 0: There's gonna be like.

380
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:55,347
Speaker 1: main source of advertising.

381
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:56,633
Speaker 1: is Macy's and shit like that?

382
00:25:56,914 --> 00:26:08,105
Speaker 0: yes, and even then Because you know being a respected source of journalism means that if you have an advertiser say Macy's and Macy's was like murdering babies You would cover that.

383
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,775
Speaker 1: yeah, you would still say that Macy's is murdering babies.

384
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,280
Speaker 1: You wouldn't give a shit you better.

385
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:17,025
Speaker 1: But you know because video game you know magazines They're not.

386
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,865
Speaker 1: you know these places don't make that much money They're not that stable.

387
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:32,434
Speaker 1: and also the people there are you know I mean sure there's plenty of highly People with lots of integrity there and highly people with lots of I'm headed to say high integrity people But I got it backwards.

388
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:49,896
Speaker 0: it happens Even if you know an individual journalist may say I am not influenced by that factor Which they may believe, but how many studies show that if you you know if doctors are given perks from a drug company they start Prescribing that drug more even if they don't actually believe that they were influenced by the gifts

389
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:50,699
Speaker 1: exactly?

390
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:54,953
Speaker 1: and It's just a psychological fact whether you acknowledge it or not.

391
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:59,068
Speaker 1: if someone gives you free shit Even you know it's like in Prince of Nothing.

392
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:00,393
Speaker 1: He sent you what.

393
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,379
Speaker 1: no have you ever talked to him?

394
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:04,688
Speaker 1: well Yeah, did you that he sent you?

395
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,254
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

396
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:07,699
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

397
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:24,138
Speaker 0: So even if they say they're not and even if they believe they're not It looks bad kind of like how if you look at any major company they'll have rules about You know like business integrity or conflict of interests and usually the rules aren't like.

398
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:24,760
Speaker 0: you know.

399
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:26,720
Speaker 0: You can't have a conflict of interest.

400
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,566
Speaker 0: They are you cannot have one.

401
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:32,379
Speaker 0: nor can you have something that would appear to be one.

402
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:35,317
Speaker 0: This definitely appears to be one.

403
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:43,453
Speaker 1: well Yeah And the thing is is that the people while even individual journalists might care The people running say video game magazine at least.

404
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:46,869
Speaker 1: I can't speak for all the magazines But there are clearly some and also websites.

405
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:47,612
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit.

406
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,065
Speaker 1: They're just like all right whatever I don't care about.

407
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:52,080
Speaker 1: you know the integrity of our magazine or whatever.

408
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,502
Speaker 1: Let's just.

409
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:53,989
Speaker 1: you know you want to pass money.

410
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,396
Speaker 1: sure this is a money-making business.

411
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:56,160
Speaker 1: I just want to make money.

412
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,662
Speaker 1: I don't care.

413
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:57,525
Speaker 1: I don't know.

414
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:06,095
Speaker 0: we can couple this with the fact that the video game industry especially the major players I'm EA are like petulant babies when it comes to reviews.

415
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:07,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is another thing Right.

416
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:10,900
Speaker 1: so on the one hand you've got this problem of the reviewers.

417
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,808
Speaker 1: Given people better scores.

418
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:15,540
Speaker 1: if they pay more money and less scores they pay less money, okay, whatever.

419
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:20,920
Speaker 1: Why the fuck do these companies actually think their review scores are important like this?

420
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:26,240
Speaker 0: I think they have numbers showing that review scores correlate directly to sales, and I wouldn't be surprised if that were true.

421
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,571
Speaker 1: It's possible But I highly doubt that it's the cut.

422
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,661
Speaker 1: you know the cause and effect is Good.

423
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:32,848
Speaker 1: is in that direction right?

424
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:43,971
Speaker 1: if I put out a piece of shit game tomorrow Are you gonna seriously tell me that that piece of shit game if it gets all fives from some video game magazine is gonna Sell like crazy, or you know perfect scores.

425
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,678
Speaker 1: It's it's not it get it.

426
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:56,250
Speaker 1: Games sell more when they have more Marketing when they're more out there, and if they're more out there and they're better marketing the marketing Even if you didn't directly pay and be corrupt.

427
00:28:56,711 --> 00:29:06,640
Speaker 1: if you have tons of ads for your game all over the place And it's like this hot hot explosive game It's gonna change how people perceive it regardless of the content of the game itself.

428
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:09,056
Speaker 1: You know like look at that firefall thing right.

429
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:13,426
Speaker 1: it bags Advertised all over.

430
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:13,907
Speaker 1: the fuck.

431
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:16,999
Speaker 0: can you hire a guy to drive in a circle for three days?

432
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,093
Speaker 0: Around a convention with a billboard on his truck right?

433
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:28,280
Speaker 1: and the thing is even if the game Doesn't get the best scores right the fact is is that because they spent so much in marketing?

434
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:46,899
Speaker 1: Every game magazine reviewing place is gonna review that game because it was advertised so much You know and because every place reviewed it that you're actually even if you gave it a bad score You're still giving more space more FaceTime to that game for the customers, and it's gonna sell more copies.

435
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:54,212
Speaker 0: now I will bet a place where reviews like that especially scores matter heavily, but then again They're usually outsourced and not done by you know.

436
00:29:54,273 --> 00:30:03,471
Speaker 0: quote unquote professional Journalists our app stores like the iPhone game store droid whatever those customer reviews They're all I actually personally trust.

437
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:08,393
Speaker 1: Amazon reviews kind of probably too much Yeah, like ones also, but especially when it comes to video games.

438
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:21,060
Speaker 0: It's there's so much shit Where it's not even like crap where it's just shit where on The iPhone and Android that unless someone I know and trust said try this game There is no game.

439
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,189
Speaker 0: I will try especially because they're not free.

440
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,459
Speaker 0: nor are there demos most of the time.

441
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 0: So as a result if I do want to try a game And I want to look for something like random the only way to look Short of finding someone else recommending something which again is a sea of shit is to go by the reviews in the system.

442
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,668
Speaker 0: What are the top rated or most downloaded games?

443
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,475
Speaker 1: and they're usually crap yeah?

444
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:41,857
Speaker 0: They are.

445
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:42,700
Speaker 1: you don't want those.

446
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,897
Speaker 0: That's a separate problem, right?

447
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,489
Speaker 0: So you know what are the things people always complain about?

448
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:57,333
Speaker 0: they people you know people who hate on video game journalism because I don't Wanted this to be just us hating on it because well I can tell you there's really only one thing I personally hate about game journalism because you know what.

449
00:30:57,434 --> 00:31:03,668
Speaker 1: I don't look at scores So I don't care if they're you know I don't really read reviews either So I really don't give a shit about if they're corrupt or not.

450
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:11,160
Speaker 1: the one thing that bothers me most about game journalism is game Journalists who don't know anything about games, right?

451
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,660
Speaker 1: It's like your only job or at least your major job here is to write about games.

452
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:19,711
Speaker 1: You should know more about games than me.

453
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,060
Speaker 1: my job is computer science and writing computer programs.

454
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:24,379
Speaker 1: I just play games.

455
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,781
Speaker 1: You know.

456
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:35,775
Speaker 1: that's like if you know when I listen to say sports casts right or watch sports TV shows or Sports Center Those people always know more about sports than I do right.

457
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,827
Speaker 1: I just watch sports I don't you know.

458
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:44,391
Speaker 1: I know as much as I know which is probably more than Your job is not to watch sports and write about it.

459
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:47,020
Speaker 1: these guys always know a fuck ton more than me.

460
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,634
Speaker 1: They say names of people and then I go look up who those people were like.

461
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:51,617
Speaker 1: cuz I didn't know who they were.

462
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:52,300
Speaker 1: like Rod Laver.

463
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,507
Speaker 1: I didn't know Rod Laver was.

464
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,760
Speaker 1: Rod Laver is the best tennis player to ever exist.

465
00:31:55,861 --> 00:32:01,000
Speaker 1: Well, I mean look at I don't know who he was But then I listened to a sports cast and I learned something when I read game journalism.

466
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:17,240
Speaker 1: I've rarely if ever learned anything from any article in any game magazine or game website ever Except for when they're about things that are like Japanese, which is why I didn't know about them Which is why I tend to like Kotaku better because they actually have Japanese correspond.

467
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:22,480
Speaker 1: Ashcraft is over there digging up the Japanese dirts that I don't see in the US, you know.

468
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:26,785
Speaker 1: But it's like they don't teach me anything cuz I know more than them Which means they don't know enough.

469
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:39,974
Speaker 1: because even though I know a lot there is a lot more to know than I know You know, so it's like if I know more than you you're not qualified for this job And I haven't really found anyone who is qualified and eat and it's not.

470
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:41,460
Speaker 0: there are a few out there people.

471
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,023
Speaker 0: There are people wear the journalist hat and who simultaneously Play games or design games But that's it.

472
00:32:49,123 --> 00:33:01,440
Speaker 0: They also design and play games and thus know but they're not the the kind of prominent game journalists Yeah, the big-name game journalists and are usually really good at writing, you know people like N guy crow or Steven DiTillo.

473
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:02,565
Speaker 1: Right, and I've met law.

474
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,067
Speaker 0: I mean they're.

475
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:03,971
Speaker 0: they're writing style.

476
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:04,553
Speaker 0: They're writing.

477
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:05,096
Speaker 1: They're great.

478
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,060
Speaker 1: They're great at writing.

479
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,394
Speaker 1: I've met them in person at PAX for like a minute.

480
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:09,158
Speaker 0: They're great guys.

481
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:20,524
Speaker 1: They're good They're good guys, but the fact is, you know and guy crow started gaming when the PlayStation 1 came out, you know I mean, he's probably gone back and played some classics But he doesn't know.

482
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:25,738
Speaker 1: he doesn't have that incredibly deep knowledge of the history of gaming and all sorts of crazy shit.

483
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:29,660
Speaker 1: and Steven DiTillo Never played doom until relatively recently.

484
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,778
Speaker 1: He wrote a big thing on Kotaku about how he tried to play doom and he couldn't get it to work.

485
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:40,380
Speaker 1: and all this I mean, I'm like, how can you be like this preeminent game review journalist guy if you've never played doom?

486
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:41,164
Speaker 1: You would never.

487
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:50,587
Speaker 1: you couldn't even be a movie critic for the town newspaper If you have never seen Citizen Kane dude never played doom, but he's like top game journalist Meanwhile bullshit.

488
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:52,720
Speaker 0: Mike and Jerry, you know game in taiko penny arcade.

489
00:33:53,661 --> 00:34:08,034
Speaker 0: They basically spend their lives, you know other than family and eating and sleeping and all that Making a comic running conventions and playing video games and their you know reviews of games They play are actually usually very spot-on because they do.

490
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:09,500
Speaker 0: they do know a lot about games.

491
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,951
Speaker 1: They're they know what you know, but they're not they don't.

492
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:15,031
Speaker 1: they still don't know as much as me, but you know They know that a challenge.

493
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they're not.

494
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:18,527
Speaker 1: you know, it's like.

495
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,475
Speaker 1: they know, you know, they go back Scott.

496
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:21,860
Speaker 0: What year was doom published?

497
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,504
Speaker 1: Doom one doom one 1991 to 1991 or 1992?

498
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:32,603
Speaker 0: you're saying yes three 1993 close close.

499
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:33,550
Speaker 0: You're close close.

500
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:41,634
Speaker 1: Anyway, you didn't know I'm not good at years Trivia that that's not knowledge of gamery.

501
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:42,739
Speaker 1: That's knowledge of you.

502
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaker 0: But the thing is guys they have a pretty deep knowledge and the reviews are very good.

503
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,080
Speaker 0: my only complaint with their game journalism is that They review all games from their perspective.

504
00:34:53,681 --> 00:35:07,740
Speaker 0: Being two people whose lives center around playing games and don't have a lot of other responsibilities Mmm, so they will love a game that I can play and say wow I would love this if I had 20 hours a day to play video games.

505
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:15,420
Speaker 1: Yeah It's another thing is that you know when people review a game at least the vast majority of reviews.

506
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:22,480
Speaker 1: Right, it pretty much comes down to the same kind of reviews that punk kids write in forums on the internet or on their blogs.

507
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:22,862
Speaker 1: Which is?

508
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:34,800
Speaker 1: I like this game because X Y Z right or you know They'll judge games because oh it didn't it wasn't innovative or it didn't do anything new or they'll actually care about the graphics.

509
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:35,428
Speaker 1: So, you know?

510
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:39,978
Speaker 1: No, actually, you know, it's like though do those things matter?

511
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:41,260
Speaker 1: It's you know.

512
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,672
Speaker 1: Are you actually judging whether it's a good game or not?

513
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,598
Speaker 1: and they kind of are kind of are.

514
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,527
Speaker 0: here's the thing It's it's like there isn't?

515
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,360
Speaker 1: you know, this sort of formula of here's the things you have.

516
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,851
Speaker 0: What I was getting at with what people complain about.

517
00:35:55,192 --> 00:36:03,640
Speaker 0: people love to hate on video game journalism But their complaints are often kind of dumb or invalid like they'll add they'll say video game journalism isn't objective.

518
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,689
Speaker 0: I want objective reviews only.

519
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,697
Speaker 1: well, there's no such thing as objective review.

520
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,025
Speaker 1: first of all Unless you had

521
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:15,640
Speaker 0: simply a list of facts about the game and unaltered screenshots of the game

522
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:19,496
Speaker 1: No, and if we had a list of criteria by which to judge all games

523
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:32,991
Speaker 0: like graphics Maybe we count how the total the maximum number of colors on the screen to any one time throughout the whole game And we have a metric based on that color ability or colorfulness Yeah, then we could say this game is more colorful than this game

524
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:33,453
Speaker 1: great

525
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:34,998
Speaker 0: by these criteria.

526
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:46,930
Speaker 0: Sure The other side that people complain about is they get mad when someone reviews a game and Gives it a score like people get really mad like.

527
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,254
Speaker 0: so it's like the hip thing to say.

528
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,100
Speaker 0: Oh fucking scoring games.

529
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,839
Speaker 0: That's like the bullshit way to review things.

530
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,860
Speaker 0: Scores are not inherently bad.

531
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,760
Speaker 0: I just think they're often used very poorly and the categories are not are very ill-defined.

532
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:03,580
Speaker 0: I mean, I've just found this random IGN review of Super Mario 3 on the Wii.

533
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:13,554
Speaker 0: Okay, it was broken out into five numbers presentation Graphics, how is presentation different from graphics sound?

534
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:25,195
Speaker 0: Okay gameplay lasting appeal mm-hmm, so Gameplay is one fifth of the metric but that should be 90% of the score.

535
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:30,117
Speaker 0: and yet Appeal is separate from gameplay.

536
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:35,675
Speaker 1: It's like if it has good gameplay that it also necessarily has lasting appeal.

537
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,577
Speaker 1: kind of right.

538
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:39,205
Speaker 0: I mean, all right Let's go through our presentation.

539
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,212
Speaker 0: It gets a nine point.

540
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,760
Speaker 1: Oh, well, this is this Mario 3 as in Super Mario 3.

541
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,724
Speaker 1: Yes, goon tail yellow.

542
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:45,809
Speaker 0: Yes, but on the Wii.

543
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,054
Speaker 1: so the virtual console version.

544
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:47,376
Speaker 1: Yes.

545
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:53,298
Speaker 0: Okay, so 9.0 is the presentation out of 10 and out of 10 and it has some text here.

546
00:37:53,639 --> 00:38:00,540
Speaker 0: quote Mario's world was greatly expanded through Super Mario Brothers 3. the adventure is more epic and several new lands and enemies to encounter.

547
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,557
Speaker 0: fantastic.

548
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,377
Speaker 0: So what separates it from a nine point one?

549
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, what did it need to go up or down one point?

550
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:10,956
Speaker 1: I don't know.

551
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:12,040
Speaker 1: do they do point one?

552
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,804
Speaker 1: Here's what bothers me.

553
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:13,608
Speaker 1: They just do.

554
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:14,935
Speaker 1: do they just do whole numbers.

555
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,020
Speaker 0: No, they don't just do whole numbers.

556
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,766
Speaker 1: Can it possibly be nine point one?

557
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:22,120
Speaker 0: graphics 8.0 some of the best 8-bit work ever done.

558
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,140
Speaker 0: Yet an 8.0.

559
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,360
Speaker 0: Okay, seeing Mario encounter the oversized enemies of giant land still impresses me to this day.

560
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,542
Speaker 0: How come that's an 8?

561
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,030
Speaker 0: if it impresses you to this day and it's some of the best 8-bit work ever done?

562
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:37,302
Speaker 1: What what's a 9?

563
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:38,819
Speaker 0: And also is this an objective scale?

564
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,580
Speaker 0: Normalized to modern games like wouldn't Mario 3 be a 2.0 compared to like crisis?

565
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:52,366
Speaker 1: That is something that happens a lot right is that people judge, you know, and you sort of you have to judge Agree by the time it comes out.

566
00:38:52,406 --> 00:39:00,112
Speaker 1: right like if I take you know, say I don't know what a relatively mediocre move Not even by the time it comes out.

567
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:12,220
Speaker 0: you you you rate it more by How well it achieves its purpose with just an understanding of the limitations of the but also understanding not just what the you know The technologies of the time but the other art of the time.

568
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:26,187
Speaker 0: But at the same time the counter-argument is that a movie that is amazingly made from the 20s But is just like visually difficult to follow because of the camera problems that they had is Objectively worse in that regard.

569
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:27,592
Speaker 0: had it been made with modern equipment.

570
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,560
Speaker 0: It would have been a better movie true.

571
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,240
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about saying, you know, I could take something from today.

572
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:45,685
Speaker 1: I could take a crappy video game that just came out today and I could bring it back to you in 1986 and it would be the greatest game of all time Even though it's crappy today because compared to other things that came out today It's not so good.

573
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,535
Speaker 1: A lot of times what you'll see is a game will come out.

574
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:53,220
Speaker 1: That'll be a huge hit And you'll see a sequel come out that will streamline the original and be much better.

575
00:39:53,741 --> 00:40:03,132
Speaker 1: But compared to other games that have come out since in that interim period the sequel isn't better Than some other game that came out the same way like case in point.

576
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:05,260
Speaker 1: It's better than the game that came before it.

577
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,020
Speaker 1: So it's an improvement, but it doesn't beat other games at that time.

578
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:19,400
Speaker 1: So even though it's a better game it actually gets a worse score than the original game even though it's better than the original game because it's worse than some other game that Is also out at that time.

579
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,740
Speaker 1: So for example half-life 2 might be better than half-life 1 but half-life 1 came out in what?

580
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:32,420
Speaker 1: 97 98 something like that 96 and half-life 1 was better than all the other FPS is at that time that it was released.

581
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:35,395
Speaker 1: But maybe half-life 2 it was still better than all the other.

582
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:38,560
Speaker 0: but I'm saying pretend I guess it means you have to define your turn 10.

583
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:49,321
Speaker 1: There was a quake 7 that came out at the same time as half-life 2 and even though half-life 2 was a million times better Than half-life 1 quake 7 was a million times better than half-life 2 came out at the same time as half-life 2.

584
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:54,301
Speaker 1: Therefore half-life 2 ends up with a worse score than half-life 1 even though it's better than half-life 1.

585
00:40:54,301 --> 00:41:03,593
Speaker 0: So maybe one way to go around this is if you have a graphic score from 1 to 10 You need to say what a 10 is and what a 1 is exactly.

586
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:04,195
Speaker 0: then.

587
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:12,087
Speaker 0: but then you get in the situation where something exceeds in either direction and then what you do is Rebalance the scale with that being the new one.

588
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:13,933
Speaker 0: Yep, and squeeze everything else in.

589
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:20,580
Speaker 0: change everything else's numbers like this game Redefined what worst game means to our journalistic outlet.

590
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:33,092
Speaker 1: Yeah What I would do if I had some sort of reviewing site is I would just have a chart and the first game I ever Reviewed would be number one and the second game I ever reviewed would either be number one or number two and the number.

591
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:36,326
Speaker 1: if it was one the number one former number one Get pushed down to two.

592
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:40,351
Speaker 0: I don't rank everything But based on what criteria?

593
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:41,096
Speaker 0: because this you know.

594
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:44,471
Speaker 0: overall Mario 3 gets a 9.5 on this.

595
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:46,700
Speaker 0: but what does overall mean?

596
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,619
Speaker 0: I mean Mario 3 is a better overall game in what sense compared to some other type of ranking should pretty much be worth.

597
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:56,589
Speaker 1: Spending your time on assuming what's not.

598
00:41:56,669 --> 00:42:00,080
Speaker 0: super meat boy great game, but not for some people.

599
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what do you do with games that are for an audience?

600
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:07,252
Speaker 0: There are ten for that guy, but there are one for me personally.

601
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:09,759
Speaker 1: no, you know, that's just how it is.

602
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what do you do?

603
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:21,980
Speaker 0: because the reviews I like you read the fucking text and the reviews I strive for when I do Review things are to be able to say on a on a kind of semi objective artistic standpoint.

604
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:27,979
Speaker 0: I feel like this is a you know, a reasonable neutral review as to the qualities of a thing.

605
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:29,158
Speaker 0: Independently.

606
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,447
Speaker 0: Here's who I think it is good for.

607
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:35,965
Speaker 0: here's what I think it is bad for to be able to say I Personally think this game is shit.

608
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:40,240
Speaker 0: But if you like this kind of stuff this game is awesome.

609
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:41,686
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's.

610
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:45,060
Speaker 1: it's pretty much like, you know, look at the game of go right the board game.

611
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:46,376
Speaker 0: I don't like go I don't like go.

612
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,789
Speaker 1: Of all time playing go but go Mathematically and in every other fashion is amazing.

613
00:42:52,909 --> 00:43:01,088
Speaker 1: I just personally can't stand playing it I don't want to spend any time on it but it's Amazing in great in every possible way.

614
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:19,400
Speaker 1: and if you might be the kind of person who will spend your entire life studying it Reading all the go book studying the patterns and good for you, but I'm not that guy you know, so, you know super meat boy, well if you have no skills and No fingers probably shouldn't play super meat boy.

615
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:29,112
Speaker 1: But if you have skills and fingers get that shit now and you're highly tolerant to frustration But not quite as much frustration as necessary as in games.

616
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:33,773
Speaker 1: Like I want to be the guy or ninja Gaiden Yeah, it's not that bad.

617
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:36,575
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm kind of feeling this kind of an aside.

618
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:48,900
Speaker 0: I kind of Maybe just because I've watched a whole bunch of retro game master, but I kind of want to play One of those fuck you games play that play the incredibly hard ones like cat Mario or the flash.

619
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,810
Speaker 0: No, because Mario is just memorizing.

620
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,473
Speaker 0: I don't want that.

621
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:53,426
Speaker 1: I Like the one.

622
00:43:53,669 --> 00:44:01,663
Speaker 1: I think you should just play the Modern impossible ones like the flash games that are just like up spikes out of nowhere up, you know this thing, you know It's like I might.

623
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:02,967
Speaker 0: I think some games are like.

624
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:06,420
Speaker 0: I think I might start with God hand which I didn't actually play.

625
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:08,400
Speaker 1: I don't think God hands that kind of you.

626
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,860
Speaker 0: I don't know now that you're thinking of that kind of game in terms of the fuck you impossible Nintendo hard style.

627
00:44:14,323 --> 00:44:17,220
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking in terms of a game that's gonna piss me off to no end.

628
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,632
Speaker 0: But I will not let defeat me because I haven't done that in a long time.

629
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:23,007
Speaker 0: I tend to let games defeat me If I get like.

630
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:32,140
Speaker 0: if I sat down today Having never played Zelda 2 before and was gonna play it I would get to the hammer part and be like, yeah, fuck this and just go on to counter strike.

631
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,120
Speaker 0: I could do it I could but I don't know if I would put the effort into a game of that difficulty.

632
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,400
Speaker 1: It all depends, you know giving up on games.

633
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,960
Speaker 1: I guess it's sort of a separate show, but it all depends on the reason that the game is fucking me, right?

634
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,897
Speaker 1: It's like if it's fucking me because I just can't make it like super meat boy Then I'm gonna keep going for it.

635
00:44:49,342 --> 00:44:57,160
Speaker 1: But if it's a game where you know The reason I can't make it is cuz some bullshit then I will give up on it because the game is broken not me.

636
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,173
Speaker 1: You know if I'm broken I'll fix me if the game is broken.

637
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:00,515
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

638
00:45:00,555 --> 00:45:01,299
Speaker 1: I got other shit to do.

639
00:45:01,722 --> 00:45:03,440
Speaker 0: So Scott, what do we do about game journalism?

640
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:11,480
Speaker 1: I think number one Things we can do now as gamers fucking ignore the goddamn scores.

641
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,960
Speaker 1: They're stupid and we start to be you know and make it known that you don't give a shit about the scores either.

642
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:22,880
Speaker 1: Right, and it's even worse is that metacritic site that like averages all the scores together and then steam puts the scores in steam.

643
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:23,784
Speaker 1: It's like oh, come on.

644
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:26,856
Speaker 1: Really, you know, it's like get rid of the fucking scores.

645
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:27,840
Speaker 1: Just get them out of here.

646
00:45:28,241 --> 00:45:29,928
Speaker 1: You don't see, you know movies.

647
00:45:29,948 --> 00:45:32,740
Speaker 1: It's like thumbs up thumbs down and five stars.

648
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:36,174
Speaker 1: But it's like game scores are like all over the fucking place.

649
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:37,500
Speaker 1: You know, it's ridiculous.

650
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,720
Speaker 1: Also, if you're are gonna keep the scores because I know we're not gonna actually get rid of them, right?

651
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:46,880
Speaker 1: There's that ten-point problem where everything gets between a five and a seven, right?

652
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,920
Speaker 1: Five stars is the optimal number to rate anything and don't use any fractions.

653
00:45:52,342 --> 00:46:00,398
Speaker 0: I would argue that a five-star system has one flaw in that you can always go for the third middle star.

654
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:08,080
Speaker 0: I. There is an argument to be made that when you're reviewing anything you should force the review to be slightly good or slightly bad.

655
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it prevents laziness then you need a four star system.

656
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,874
Speaker 1: Well, well you can you know, the thing is you can force our systems.

657
00:46:15,915 --> 00:46:17,560
Speaker 1: not bad either but that you know.

658
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,439
Speaker 0: I guess I'm just saying there's an argument to be made there.

659
00:46:19,832 --> 00:46:26,140
Speaker 0: Yeah I guess I found you know using to go into enterprising land doing ticketing systems and everything.

660
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:38,379
Speaker 0: I would originally use five levels of severity, you know, five four three two one one two You know critical at the top trivial at the bottom something like that and things tended to always either be critical or the middle

661
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:41,719
Speaker 1: three Just like video game reviews is like five seven ten.

662
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:45,540
Speaker 1: That's the other thing with five seven nine because you don't want to give it a ten.

663
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:56,440
Speaker 0: Maybe we need to change the scale because we kind of have great inflation where you know If a game is less than like seventy five percent or whatever that's considered that it's garbage.

664
00:46:56,741 --> 00:47:00,940
Speaker 1: Well a lot of you know, like when we review in the comics, you know, and some other podcast do the same thing.

665
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,440
Speaker 1: They do like, you know, buy borrow and ignore you'll actively destroy, right?

666
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:15,980
Speaker 1: So it's like your recommendation like I recommend that you go out immediately pay full price for this game And you know that should be the recommendation list.

667
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,999
Speaker 1: You're like the top possible recommendation is buy this immediately for full price and play the fuck out of it right under that is you know.

668
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:31,784
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe try to get it at a slight discount and maybe play it a lot kind of if you really want to You know.

669
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:52,349
Speaker 1: and then under that you can have you know Like okay wait for this to be discounted at you know a year from now or wait for all the DLC to come out or you Know they give an actual recommendation like get this for free somehow and play it if you like it or try the demo And you know, maybe an actual recommendation.

670
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:53,051
Speaker 0: we go back.

671
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,620
Speaker 0: we go back to an idea of you have a journalistic outlet.

672
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:05,140
Speaker 0: However, you do it where every game has like ten Recommendations and each and and each of these recommendations is from a different perspective.

673
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,886
Speaker 1: There have been magazines that have done that.

674
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:10,679
Speaker 1: there have been and we're usually one person writes the article who is like.

675
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:24,585
Speaker 1: Usually the person writing the article is a specialist in that kind of game like the platformer guy reviews the platform game but then all the you know, a bunch of people like five different people play the game and Give it a score and a slight

676
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:28,699
Speaker 0: and we go based on mechanics like for a platformer.

677
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:37,574
Speaker 0: You know, this is how it is if you like for the details of the platformer player Like if you're like super meat boy, if you love platformers, it's great.

678
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:41,933
Speaker 0: If you don't like platformers It's possibly the worst game you could ever play.

679
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:46,940
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, it's like if you just had you know a specialist in a genre.

680
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,801
Speaker 1: But then the thing I hate is that even more enforces the genre fication of games, which I hate and I want to see go Away.

681
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:53,163
Speaker 0: Yep.

682
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:57,420
Speaker 0: Well, that's why you need specialist because you need the specialist perspective because there are specialist gamers.

683
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,708
Speaker 0: You also need the generic.

684
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,185
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't want to say enlightened but the kind of the mass I mean, we're even.

685
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:05,854
Speaker 0: you know, Scott and I are very guilty of.

686
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:13,641
Speaker 0: there are Arenas of games that we generally don't like so we tend not to review them because we tend not to play them that much Yep.

687
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:18,340
Speaker 1: Also, what do you do when say for example a you know a game?

688
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,620
Speaker 1: Has problems that aren't really the fault of the people making the game, right?

689
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:40,199
Speaker 1: So what if for example some guy made a game for PlayStation and it was great but the PlayStation Network was down so it didn't work, you know, or Someone made a game but then Everyone started cheating at the game ruining it?

690
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:43,108
Speaker 0: But that's the game design flaw sort of.

691
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,512
Speaker 1: but you get my idea right.

692
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:48,558
Speaker 1: like there's something else outside of the game That is causing it a problem.

693
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:53,040
Speaker 0: You could argue that most of those things outside of the game are still the fault of the game designer.

694
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,731
Speaker 0: They are in some way gave a lecture to that.

695
00:49:55,771 --> 00:50:00,052
Speaker 1: Like if you have a shitty community, you know It's cuz you made your netcode is bad.

696
00:50:00,193 --> 00:50:01,320
Speaker 0: You only have one server.

697
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:04,709
Speaker 1: Yeah but there are still you know many things that could happen.

698
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,817
Speaker 1: like what if I put a game out on steam?

699
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:12,560
Speaker 1: and what if valve Fucks up and like, you know The downloading of it is all screwed up and I have to put out patches or something.

700
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,463
Speaker 1: But it wasn't my fault.

701
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:18,580
Speaker 1: or I put a game on Apple and then you know, the they change something on me.

702
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:24,377
Speaker 1: You know, there's there's all sorts of technological and other issues that could happen to a game that would make it bad.

703
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:25,120
Speaker 1: that aren't your fault.

704
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:28,088
Speaker 1: Yeah might give you a negative review.

705
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,140
Speaker 0: otherwise, you know, you know, I'll do from my perspective.

706
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:34,100
Speaker 0: I don't read any game journalism.

707
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:34,843
Speaker 1: What if?

708
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:40,451
Speaker 1: what if I make a movie and I put it in the movie theater and the movie theaters all have shitty projectors And the bulbs are dim, right?

709
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:41,600
Speaker 0: I should have taken that into account.

710
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,800
Speaker 0: I would have known if they all have dim bulbs, then you got to account for dim fucking bulb.

711
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,388
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that happens, right?

712
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:53,564
Speaker 1: So, um, I made a game and Man, it just doesn't work with this weird-ass video card that I couldn't test, you know The one that everyone has.

713
00:50:53,624 --> 00:50:54,307
Speaker 0: I should have tested it.

714
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:57,399
Speaker 1: No a rare one, but that happens to be the one the reviewer has.

715
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:01,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually the reviewer will say hey your game didn't fucking work.

716
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:02,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

717
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:11,264
Speaker 1: There's also the the fact that you know reviewers even if there's no shady business of advertisers pressuring them or any of that kind of stuff right They.

718
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:20,246
Speaker 1: if you get a game for free, you know Cuz it's a review copy or something even if it's the same exact game as the final copy You didn't pay for it.

719
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:24,740
Speaker 1: So not paying for it, you know gives you a completely different mental.

720
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:30,564
Speaker 1: You know thing on the game right like if I pay for something and I don't play it I feel bad.

721
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:48,140
Speaker 1: like you have different feelings about something when you've paid for it then if you've gotten it for free and That difference in feelings results in the review even if you really identify with that reviewer and you're very similar in your taste is Gonna have a different perspective than you who has to pay 50 bucks for it, you know.

722
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:58,411
Speaker 1: and in that way I sort of feel like video game reviewers Should sort of have to pay for the game, you know when you if you're a movie reviewer Don't they pay for a movie ticket usually?

723
00:51:58,431 --> 00:51:59,436
Speaker 1: I don't know.

724
00:51:59,637 --> 00:52:00,140
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

725
00:52:00,563 --> 00:52:11,727
Speaker 1: I know people do get review copies of books But the thing is with a book even though you're not paying for it There's a significant time investment to read the whole thing and some games do have the time investment But some games don't.

726
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:12,752
Speaker 1: so I don't know.

727
00:52:13,154 --> 00:52:14,300
Speaker 0: Well, I think we've gone on long enough.

728
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:19,385
Speaker 0: But that's not only and you know you touched on this earlier I Don't read game journalism.

729
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:25,932
Speaker 0: And the only thing that would get me to is if when I read game journalism I learned something that I would not have just learned on my own.

730
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:26,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tend.

731
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:39,270
Speaker 1: if I'm reading game journalism It's usually something that is you know Historical or it's not something that's like a review of a game or something like that or a list of facts because a list of facts I get from anywhere like the game has this multiplayer or not.

732
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,460
Speaker 0: this publisher comes out in this day that everyone has that right?

733
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,584
Speaker 1: It's usually something like hey Check out, you know the This guy.

734
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:48,808
Speaker 1: this is a great designer.

735
00:52:48,848 --> 00:52:49,611
Speaker 1: No one ever heard of.

736
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:51,417
Speaker 1: he made these games back in the day.

737
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:52,360
Speaker 1: Let's interview him.

738
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,253
Speaker 1: What was it like back in those days?

739
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:55,240
Speaker 1: What made you do this?

740
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,020
Speaker 1: You know something educational something like a documentary this the Super Mario 3 review.

741
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:03,778
Speaker 0: Is that for people who if you don't know what Mario 3 is.

742
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:03,839
Speaker 0: it?

743
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:13,979
Speaker 0: Gives you a lot of info on like what Mario 3 is and kind of why it was important and when it came out and that's Good, but at the same time it's not for me.

744
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,255
Speaker 0: I know it all of it and it doesn't talk a lot about anything obscure.

745
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:22,707
Speaker 0: It's kind of like Just a description of what the game is like.

746
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:24,071
Speaker 1: Yep.

747
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:25,354
Speaker 1: Another thing one more thing.

748
00:53:25,394 --> 00:53:26,076
Speaker 1: I want to add here.

749
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:36,760
Speaker 1: That's is that You know game reviewers if you're good, even though we already talked about doing the thing We have a bunch of different reviewers or specialists in different areas or stuff like that, right?

750
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,149
Speaker 1: We need more reviewers from different demographics, right?

751
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:40,710
Speaker 1: Where is the?

752
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:43,720
Speaker 1: you need the the five-year-old kid reviewing the game, right?

753
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,650
Speaker 1: You need the the 80 year old lady review in the game, right?

754
00:53:46,690 --> 00:54:03,766
Speaker 1: Because different people are gonna have different, you know From different demographics and different skill levels and different genders and different whatevers are gonna have different perspectives on a game, you know Especially different ages, you know and people generally.

755
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:22,040
Speaker 1: most game reviewing people tend to be 20 to 40 year old dudes and that's it and occasionally ladies And not too many old people and not too many kids really and If you're a kid and some 35 year old dude really thinks this game is awesome.

756
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,814
Speaker 1: Does that mean you're gonna think it's awesome as a 12 year old?

757
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:25,840
Speaker 1: Probably not.

758
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:27,719
Speaker 1: You probably don't have a lot in common with that guy.

759
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:29,747
Speaker 1: He probably thinks pokemons are really boring.

760
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:31,172
Speaker 1: you think pokemons the best thing ever.

761
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,500
Speaker 0: I find pokemons really boring nowadays.

762
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:43,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But it would if if you played the new pokemons if I gave if I went back in time and gave 12-year-old rim the brand new pokemons That would have been the best game ever, right?

763
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,644
Speaker 1: It's exactly so.

764
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:47,300
Speaker 1: you need the 12 year old to tell the 12 year old what game is good.

765
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:54,773
Speaker 0: I guess what we're missing from game journalism that I don't see anywhere and if anyone can point me at it Maybe I just haven't found it because I've you know, I've given up on it for.

766
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:55,698
Speaker 1: so don't look at it.

767
00:54:55,758 --> 00:55:09,757
Speaker 0: Yeah is otakuusa Like that level of like insight into video games that we see into with them talking about anime Mm-hmm, because that's the kind of reviewing I want that I just don't see for video games.

768
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:18,518
Speaker 0: Yep This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
