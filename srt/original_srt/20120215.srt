1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,938
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 15th, 2012.

2
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,547
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:22,821
Speaker 0: Tonight, we bring you the stunning conclusion of our reviews of every single one of the DC new 52.

4
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,838
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,660
Speaker 0: So All-Star Western 1, basically Batman.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,660
Speaker 1: Uh, well, let me give you a little information here, right?

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,640
Speaker 1: So, you know, you get this Jonah Hex situation going on, right?

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,950
Speaker 1: And I was reading the Jonah Hex.

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaker 1: Did we do an episode on it at some point?

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,220
Speaker 1: I don't know if we did or not.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,120
Speaker 1: But basically, this is written by, it's got Jonah Hex in it, at least half of it, right?

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,155
Speaker 1: And it's written by the same guys, the same team that did that Jonah Hex.

13
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,280
Speaker 1: that's been going on for a while.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,300
Speaker 1: So here you go, it's basically the continuation of Jonah Hex, which has always been sort of episodic and such, so that's kind of nice.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,240
Speaker 0: I actually surprisingly enjoyed seeing, like, you know, cowboy time era Gotham.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:13,380
Speaker 0: Like, I like that whole aspect of, like, you know, seeing the old families and all this stuff kind of together.

17
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:18,500
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the actual plot, as was revealed, was a little too forced and cliche.

18
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,259
Speaker 0: Moved a little too quickly, I think.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing I wrote, here's my three notes that I wrote, right?

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Speaker 1: First of all, I agreed with you entirely, you know, Jonah Hex that I read in those Jonah Hex books was a different character.

21
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:37,420
Speaker 1: Even though this Jonah Hex, it's the same person on paper.

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,860
Speaker 0: He is way too not an asshole.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,859
Speaker 1: I wrote, Jonah Hex is basically just old-timey Batman here.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,640
Speaker 0: Yup, that's what I was saying, this was Batman.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,438
Speaker 1: Number two, I think the doctor did it.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,400
Speaker 1: And number three, this is a mystery, not a Western.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,160
Speaker 1: Even though it takes place in Western times and is drawn like a Western, and everything looks Western, this is a mystery story.

28
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,420
Speaker 1: You know, the same way the Star Trek is not sci-fi as a soap opera.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,700
Speaker 0: Mystery story, so two counts of Batman.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,136
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

31
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,560
Speaker 0: And it's in Gotham.

32
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,900
Speaker 1: And that's the thing though, the Batman comics weren't actually mysteries.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,440
Speaker 1: Detective Comics wasn't a detective story.

34
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,380
Speaker 1: But All-Star Western isn't a Western, it's the mystery the Detective Comics should have been.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,256
Speaker 1: So does this mean that I have to read All-Star Horror to get the Western story?

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,020
Speaker 0: No, that would be a comedy.

37
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, it wasn't a bad mystery, I guess.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,173
Speaker 1: I also, you know.

39
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,536
Speaker 0: I kind of liked it, it was a high meh.

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,008
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,599
Speaker 0: It just, that wasn't Jonah Hex.

42
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:37,917
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,680
Speaker 0: Jonah Hex would not have suffered most of those people to live.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,100
Speaker 1: You know, this is the thing, I've mentioned it a hundred times, hopefully this will be the last time I mention it.

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,400
Speaker 1: But it's like, you have a character, a character has a personality, there's something about that character, right?

46
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,140
Speaker 1: And I mean, you know, it's like, what's Mario like?

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,440
Speaker 1: You know, if I say, if I mention Mario, you know what Mario is like.

48
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,900
Speaker 0: He's a fat plumber named Lou Albano.

49
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:06,760
Speaker 1: Right, I could make a story, draw Mario in it, call him Mario, but he could act like, you know, a princess instead of being the plumber.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,696
Speaker 1: And he could be like, you know, "Oh, save

51
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:08,776
Speaker 1: me.".

52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,674
Speaker 1: "It's a pretty, pretty

53
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:09,900
Speaker 1: princess.".

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,460
Speaker 1: He wouldn't even have the accent, right?

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,840
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, you drew Mario and you called him Mario, but that's not Mario.

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,980
Speaker 1: And that's what goes on in these DC Comics, is they draw a character.

57
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,400
Speaker 1: Well, Batman is the worst example.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,624
Speaker 1: It looks like the character, they name it.

59
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:25,940
Speaker 1: that character, doesn't act like that character, acts like someone else in every different book.

60
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:31,300
Speaker 0: The Batman in Justice League isn't, he's nothing like any other Batman anywhere.

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,446
Speaker 1: Justice League International.

62
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,139
Speaker 1: Batman is the Super Friends Batman, right?

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,180
Speaker 0: That Batman was the same, I don't even want to, we already talked about how bad that was.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,999
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's move on.

65
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:41,680
Speaker 0: I liked Aquaman, I was surprised.

66
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,115
Speaker 1: Aquaman, I was going into this and I was saying, "Well, it's Aquaman.

67
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:45,919
Speaker 1: Everyone makes fun of

68
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:46,120
Speaker 1: Aquaman.".

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,180
Speaker 1: It's written by Geoff Johns, the guy we hate, who wrote the Green Lantern Rebirth, who, you know, does all the most fanboyish stuff.

70
00:03:53,921 --> 00:04:00,600
Speaker 1: But you read this and you're like, okay, how is, you know, everyone, people have tried to do Aquaman for years and everyone has failed.

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,735
Speaker 1: What is this guy going to do to do Aquaman?

72
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:04,500
Speaker 1: He's starting fresh.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,820
Speaker 0: Well, let's see, the plot involves the ocean.

74
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:08,129
Speaker 1: It does, that's good.

75
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 1: That's a good start.

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,780
Speaker 1: Keeping Aquaman in the ocean, not in the Justice League satellite dish, whatever.

77
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,100
Speaker 0: And he's got a personality.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,980
Speaker 1: He does, and I don't know what Aquaman's personality is.

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,200
Speaker 1: I'm willing to bet that this is not the personality Aquaman has had in the past.

80
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 1: But I like this one.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen pictures of like old Aquaman, like bearded Aquaman and all sorts of, right?

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,320
Speaker 1: Pretty sure this is not anything like those ones, but maybe that's good because those other Aquamans sucked.

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:39,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, well like, Scott, while the Jonah Hex in All Star Western was not a real Jonah Hex, that's the one I'd rather hang out with in a bar if I had to choose.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,702
Speaker 1: That's right.

85
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:43,020
Speaker 1: This Aquaman is kind of an awesome dude.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,139
Speaker 0: Because he's kind of a dick.

87
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,959
Speaker 1: He's sort of Rainbow Dash-ish.

88
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:50,821
Speaker 0: Isn't that what we also liked about Superman in Action Comics 1?

89
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:51,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

90
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:53,979
Speaker 1: It's sort of the same kind of guy.

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,960
Speaker 0: A little bit of Rainbow Dash, a little bit of Astro Boy, all mixed into one.

92
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Speaker 1: And then he was pretty awesome when he just gives the waitress the two undersea golden coins.

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,698
Speaker 0: She's like, "What the fuck am I supposed to do with

94
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:03,860
Speaker 0: this?".

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,811
Speaker 0: He's like, "Send your kids to

96
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:05,277
Speaker 0: college?".

97
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:08,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she's just like, "Holy shit, fucking Aquaman's got-".

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,517
Speaker 0: I love how they go right in and have the nerd be like, "How's it feel to be everyone's least favorite

99
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 0: superhero?".

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,100
Speaker 0: And how Aquaman just punks the kid.

101
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:16,616
Speaker 1: Yeah.

102
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:17,987
Speaker 0: I like this one.

103
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:19,240
Speaker 0: I want to read the trade when it comes out.

104
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually realized that, but it is good.

105
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,140
Speaker 1: It's like the exact opposite.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,903
Speaker 1: You know what?

107
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,959
Speaker 1: I bet the fanboys probably hated this Aquaman.

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,719
Speaker 0: They had to have.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,668
Speaker 1: Maybe.

110
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:29,640
Speaker 1: Who knows?

111
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:34,120
Speaker 1: I think it's just something about jerk characters that I just personally like.

112
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:35,580
Speaker 0: It has to be a certain kind of jerk, though.

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, that certain kind of jerk.

114
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,979
Speaker 1: I like it no matter what.

115
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,980
Speaker 1: Who knows if this is actually good, but it's Scott Rubin's alley.

116
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,320
Speaker 0: Speaking of Batman, there's another Batman here.

117
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,019
Speaker 1: How many Batmans are there going to be?

118
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,179
Speaker 0: I forget which one this is.

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,720
Speaker 1: This is Batman colon The Dark Knight.

120
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,580
Speaker 0: Was this the one with the Joker cutting his face off?

121
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,580
Speaker 1: No, that was Detective Comics, right?

122
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,438
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I don't even remember then.

123
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,252
Speaker 0: Which one was this?

124
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:02,880
Speaker 0: What happens?

125
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,448
Speaker 1: I barely remember.

126
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,200
Speaker 1: Let me look at my notes about it.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,849
Speaker 0: My note just says, "It's

128
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:08,473
Speaker 0: Batman.".

129
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,539
Speaker 0: I didn't write anything else.

130
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:11,867
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

131
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,360
Speaker 1: This is the one with one face.

132
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:15,896
Speaker 0: Oh, all right.

133
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 0: I remember.

134
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,120
Speaker 0: This one had way too much supervillain bullshit.

135
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,009
Speaker 0: And it felt way more like superhero.

136
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,294
Speaker 0: supervillain and way less.

137
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,800
Speaker 0: Batman is just a person.

138
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:30,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, my notes were not even one clever thing.

139
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,040
Speaker 1: I don't know what that was meaning.

140
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:32,660
Speaker 1: All over the place.

141
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:34,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, the plot didn't make any sense.

142
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,199
Speaker 1: Here's the other thing.

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,700
Speaker 1: I wrote that it wasn't related to the other Batman books at all, which is good and bad, right?

144
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:54,060
Speaker 1: It's good on the one hand that, well, you can read it on its own, but it's sort of bad in that, you know, it's like they set the expectation that there's some mixing with the other books, and then when one of the books doesn't mix, it's like, well, now this one doesn't even fit.

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,314
Speaker 1: More importantly, why are you-- Like the one where Batman showed up in Africa.

146
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,040
Speaker 1: It doesn't fit.

147
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if you're throwing, if you've got three straight up Batman comics, and they're all different, and they don't line up, and they're all kind of uninspired, the fact that I couldn't remember which one was which actually is very telling in my opinion.

148
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was able to remember that Aquaman was an awesome jerk.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,940
Speaker 0: And I like detective comics the most of the Batman.

150
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:30,139
Speaker 1: This one was sort of structured, though, as sort of the same way as like the start of a Batman movie, where you have the Bruce Wayne part where he's getting all business-y.

151
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,380
Speaker 0: But I hate the Batman movies.

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,700
Speaker 1: And then you'll have that, you know, Batman fights all the villains part after that, right?

153
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:38,040
Speaker 1: And that was sort of the way it went.

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Speaker 0: I hate Batman fighting a villain, like, straight up.

155
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,520
Speaker 0: I like all the other stuff about Batman.

156
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,240
Speaker 0: The villain part is just the vehicle for my Batman enjoyment.

157
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,480
Speaker 0: If you actually think I care about the villain part, then you don't understand why I like Batman.

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:57,020
Speaker 1: Well, if you like those Batman video games, you probably love this, because he just walks around punching and kicking all the bad guys in Arkham.

159
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,176
Speaker 1: So yeah.

160
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 1: So Black Hawks-- I put that as bad.

161
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put it as bad, too.

162
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,120
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't put it as bad, but since I don't remember it, it had to have been bad.

163
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,960
Speaker 0: So, Black Hawks, I have one note.

164
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,640
Speaker 0: Why is the logo of their secret organization on the side of their--.

165
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,280
Speaker 1: Are you reading my fucking notes?

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,340
Speaker 0: Because the fact that it was there didn't bother me.

167
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,420
Speaker 0: The fact that a guy took a picture of it was funny.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Speaker 0: The fact that that is the plot is crazy bullshit.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,260
Speaker 1: You don't see the fucking Navy Seals walking around with the word Navy Seals on the side of a truck driving around the city.

170
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:36,220
Speaker 0: And if the Black Hawks are this crazy, ultra-elite organization, seriously, that's your plot?

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,960
Speaker 1: They have a logo that everyone knows that they slap all over their bodies and all over everything they own, and it's bright yellow and everyone can see it.

172
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Speaker 1: That pissed me off enough to hate it already, but the whole-- Also, this is yet another-- I should count how many of these books were secret government or corporate organization with an acronym sort of-ish name, goes and fights some generic terrorist group of some kind.

173
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:04,693
Speaker 0: But also, way too much-- It was very clumsily.

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,119
Speaker 0: The whole thing about she was bitten and the nanocytes were in her was so clumsily set up that I actually didn't expect it because it seemed too obvious and cliche.

175
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:13,763
Speaker 1: Yeah.

176
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:23,378
Speaker 1: I think that there's some-- I get the feeling that someone's done some sort of focus group study that's like, "Well, if we add a sidekick, then the sales go

177
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:23,479
Speaker 1: up.".

178
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,280
Speaker 1: Is that information they use?

179
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:35,418
Speaker 1: And someone figured out, "Well, books about paramilitary organizations fighting bad guys in such and such a format get great ratings, so let's make seven comics about that and ten TV

180
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:35,660
Speaker 1: shows.".

181
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:44,239
Speaker 0: Well, Scott, what is Ghost in the Shell's stand-alone complex, but a paramilitary organization fighting bad guys with awesome technology and equipment secretly funded by the government with acronyms?

182
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,980
Speaker 1: That's correct, but they add an extra layer on top of that, which is it's actually procedural police-detectiving, sort of.

183
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,840
Speaker 0: Except it isn't because they replace all the procedural police stuff with proper-known gobbledygook bullshit.

184
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,849
Speaker 1: It's also actually real sci-fi.

185
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,140
Speaker 1: At least Ghost in the Shell is actually real sci-fi.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,359
Speaker 1: Reels, like, you know, for serious.

187
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:08,110
Speaker 1: But this, at least, is not.

188
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,340
Speaker 1: This is just government organization fighting some guys.

189
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:21,356
Speaker 0: Had it not been so clumsily done and had the picture of their logo not been the plot, then I would have said, "Meh, but I have to say bad because I really didn't like

190
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:21,417
Speaker 0: it.".

191
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the thing-- whatever.

192
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 1: I actually like some of the equipment they had because you see all these people get special equipment.

193
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,893
Speaker 1: This guy's got really cool sunglasses.

194
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:30,499
Speaker 1: I kind of want those.

195
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,960
Speaker 0: They're not as good as the Deus Ex sunglasses.

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,119
Speaker 0: Those are the best sunglasses ever.

197
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,739
Speaker 1: Black Hawks, I put bad.

198
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,859
Speaker 1: So The Flash-- He's the fastest dude.

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,802
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:47,120
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that I needed to know more about The Flash than I did.

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,760
Speaker 0: Either that or it just was a poorly told story.

202
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:54,619
Speaker 1: First of all, The Flash is one of the main dudes, right?

203
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,067
Speaker 1: And I was actually surprised.

204
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,777
Speaker 1: The Flash was not in any of the other 51 books.

205
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,599
Speaker 1: He was only in this one, so good job on that.

206
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,839
Speaker 1: Two, I actually kind of like these arts.

207
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,200
Speaker 0: I also like the art.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Speaker 1: The sort of faded-out, grayish look with almost-- I don't know if that's sort of water-color-y-ish.

209
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,418
Speaker 1: I don't know much about arts, but I sort of liked--.

210
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:23,719
Speaker 1: It was pleasant to look at because the contrast wasn't so high, but it was still colorful, and I don't know if it was accidental, but I hope it wasn't because it was pretty cool.

211
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:34,460
Speaker 1: But here's the thing that really bothered me, which I've mentioned sort of already, which is how come the bad guys even have time to say anything, right?

212
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,545
Speaker 1: It's The Flash.

213
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:43,160
Speaker 1: The bad guys wouldn't even be able to say one word, and then The Flash just-- even if he was going to stop and take care of them, they would just be knocked out instantly.

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,560
Speaker 1: You just punch them in the face really fast, and they don't talk, ever.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,888
Speaker 1: So how come the scenes where The Flash is talking with a guy and sort of fighting with him?

216
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,380
Speaker 1: Those scenes cannot happen.

217
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,365
Speaker 1: He's The Flash.

218
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:55,060
Speaker 1: He's so fast, you would not see him.

219
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,840
Speaker 1: The bad guy would not even be able to see him to start a fight with him.

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 1: It would just be over before the bad guy even knew The Flash was there.

221
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,379
Speaker 0: Also, every time The Flash needs to appear, he runs away at his slow-ass speed and then turns to The Flash and comes back.

222
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,308
Speaker 0: No one notices.

223
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,400
Speaker 0: That's even worse than Superman.

224
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,635
Speaker 1: That's even worse than Superman in the phone booth, whatever.

225
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,080
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's The Flash.

226
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,151
Speaker 1: I also wrote Jin Ro armor.

227
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,920
Speaker 1: Was there Jin Ro armor in here for some reason?

228
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,145
Speaker 1: I'm trying to find it.

229
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:24,870
Speaker 1: Maybe that was it.

230
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,997
Speaker 1: I wrote it under the wrong--.

231
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,040
Speaker 1: Did I write it under the wrong comic?

232
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,620
Speaker 0: I wrote Jin Ro-- Yeah, the soldiers that he was fighting in the beginning.

233
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,440
Speaker 0: He killed the guy by throwing him into the wall or into the building, and then the guy ended up being a clone of his old friend, and there's a million of them, and I didn't care anymore.

234
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,740
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, right in the beginning, all these dudes are wearing sort of Jin Ro-ish armor.

235
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,420
Speaker 1: I really like this page, though, the title page.

236
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:49,340
Speaker 1: It's like, man, The Arts is really good on that shit.

237
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,900
Speaker 0: Honestly, the only thing I didn't like about it was that the story seemed really kind of boring.

238
00:12:54,681 --> 00:13:08,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I was doing a story about The Flash, I would make it all about The Flash having all these mental problems, because he just goes so fast and he sees so many things, and his brain isn't any better, right?

239
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,454
Speaker 0: Maybe it is faster.

240
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:09,800
Speaker 0: We don't know.

241
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:32,040
Speaker 1: So it's just like he's traveling all around the world, and he gets disoriented and sort of fucked up, and he could even be leading five lives simultaneously, but he could run back and forth between the different lives so quickly that it's instantaneous, that if you were having a conversation with one of them, you wouldn't even notice that he was leaving, because he'd be there for one fifth of every nanosecond.

242
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,040
Speaker 1: I would do shit like that and make it some crazy story.

243
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:47,539
Speaker 0: Well, The Flash runs into the problem of his powers such that you have to be really clever or really narrow path to make any challenge that would fit, that he wouldn't just solve immediately.

244
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:55,760
Speaker 1: Alright, so Firestorm, well, the fury of Firestorm, the nuclear man.

245
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,918
Speaker 0: I didn't get that it was only two guys, not three, and that it was the two combined into one until I read Wikipedia, because I couldn't figure out what was going on.

246
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:09,940
Speaker 1: I only knew it because I had heard about Firestorm in the past from other people.

247
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,419
Speaker 1: I knew that it was two guys.

248
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,406
Speaker 0: It didn't make sense.

249
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,120
Speaker 0: I read Wikipedia, now it makes sense.

250
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,599
Speaker 0: This was just awful.

251
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,377
Speaker 1: It was awful.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,360
Speaker 0: It was like everything I hate about comics condensed.

253
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 0: With forced high school drama, and then obviously the two- All the fake sciency talk as usual.

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,120
Speaker 0: Yup.

255
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, what else is there to say?

256
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,180
Speaker 0: And how did that girl survive, get the blow up?

257
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:34,551
Speaker 0: I didn't care.

258
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:35,340
Speaker 0: It was terrible.

259
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like it could be the key to all human knowledge, really.

260
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,557
Speaker 1: Yeah.

261
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,400
Speaker 1: That's what Firestorm is dealing with, the key to all human knowledge.

262
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,860
Speaker 1: What's Superman dealing with, right?

263
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:45,732
Speaker 1: I mean, really?

264
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,080
Speaker 1: There's something that's dealing with the key to all human knowledge.

265
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,500
Speaker 1: Is that important, and Firestorm is the guy who's dealing with that?

266
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:51,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

267
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,300
Speaker 1: Not the Justice League, not the Green Lanterns, not someone more important.

268
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,620
Speaker 0: So- Yeah.

269
00:14:59,503 --> 00:14:59,977
Speaker 1: I put bad.

270
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:03,000
Speaker 0: So Green Lantern- New Guardians.

271
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,879
Speaker 1: So these are like young Green Lanterns, I guess, right?

272
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:06,937
Speaker 1: Something like that?

273
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,819
Speaker 1: They're new Green Lanterns, they're not the other ones?

274
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,480
Speaker 0: I thought this was the one where all the rings disappear.

275
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,116
Speaker 0: That was the previous one, wasn't it?

276
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:15,700
Speaker 0: Green Lantern Corps.

277
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,579
Speaker 0: See, I mix them all up again because I didn't like any of them.

278
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,800
Speaker 1: No, this is the one where all the rings fly away.

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
Speaker 0: Okay, that's the one I thought we were talking about with Green Lantern Corps.

280
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,079
Speaker 1: No, this is the one where the rings fly away.

281
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,020
Speaker 0: Oh, Green Lantern Corps, I remember which one that was.

282
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,679
Speaker 0: I didn't like it either, but for different reasons.

283
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:37,638
Speaker 0: This is the one that didn't make sense because all the colors, how would you know?

284
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:39,978
Speaker 0: What can I say?

285
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,500
Speaker 0: It was terrible.

286
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,859
Speaker 0: Unless you really like Green Lantern and you know all about it.

287
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
Speaker 1: All right, so I wrote cute elder guy because of this panel.

288
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,319
Speaker 1: The guy's got the eyeball.

289
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,278
Speaker 0: He's got a good look.

290
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got this look.

291
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:59,780
Speaker 1: I also wrote Mary Sue because this character is a comic artist in the comic book.

292
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,100
Speaker 0: So also, how come the pink lanterns, I guess, are all girls?

293
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,297
Speaker 0: Like, why?

294
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:10,019
Speaker 1: Hot ones.

295
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:10,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, why?

296
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,795
Speaker 1: In space.

297
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,840
Speaker 1: And then, here's the other thing.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Speaker 1: This one, more so than any of the other books I've read, right?

299
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,173
Speaker 1: We've read all 52 of them.

300
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,880
Speaker 1: More so than any of them, this felt like pretty much a direct continuation of a previous book.

301
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,840
Speaker 1: It's like some of the other ones, they sort of started...

302
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,519
Speaker 0: Oh, because Red Lanterns had some of the characters in it, too.

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,820
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like some of the other ones, they tried to start fresh and they brought a few things in that were obviously you had to know.

304
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,540
Speaker 1: This felt like they weren't even trying to start fresh.

305
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,000
Speaker 1: It was just direct continuation of something that already happened without starting any newness whatsoever.

306
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:45,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like season two.

307
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and whatever.

308
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:50,720
Speaker 0: Every Green Lantern was bad, in my opinion.

309
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,849
Speaker 1: And then it's sort of like this rings all flying away thing.

310
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:58,840
Speaker 1: was just this excuse to get these bunch of different lanterns all in the same place for no reason.

311
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 0: And I gotta admit, in all media, I no longer...

312
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,880
Speaker 1: That's worse than the D&D using an "in" to get the characters together.

313
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:14,220
Speaker 0: I no longer ever want to see a plot that ends with a big misunderstanding that a bunch of people just have to stop and talk about because I hate watching that.

314
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,467
Speaker 0: I hate seeing it.

315
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,898
Speaker 0: I hate anticipating it.

316
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:22,459
Speaker 0: One of the best things you can do to get me interested in media is to set that up and then not do it.

317
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,099
Speaker 0: Like, uh, not to bring up ponies, that episode with Rarity and Canterlot.

318
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,800
Speaker 1: I'll use a non-pony example.

319
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,071
Speaker 1: All right.

320
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,879
Speaker 1: Is Kentro meets, uh, what's-his-face, the blind guy.

321
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:35,678
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

322
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Speaker 1: And he thinks he's a bad guy, and so Kentro has a misunderstanding and he's sort of fighting him, but then Kentro realizes the guy isn't fighting to kill.

323
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,857
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Oh, you're actually a good

324
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,099
Speaker 1: guy.".

325
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:47,860
Speaker 0: They didn't make it this long, drawn-out...

326
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,091
Speaker 1: They didn't make it this long, drawn-out thing of, "I must fight you.

327
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,038
Speaker 0: Oh, you were good guys the whole

328
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:53,680
Speaker 0: time.".

329
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,462
Speaker 0: You know what it is?

330
00:17:54,863 --> 00:18:02,580
Speaker 0: If I, as the viewer, figure it out, and the characters don't figure it out for the majority of a scene or show, then I really get pissed off.

331
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,300
Speaker 1: If it's obvious.

332
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:03,748
Speaker 1: Yeah.

333
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,239
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, bad.

334
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:07,339
Speaker 1: So... I, Vampire.

335
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,583
Speaker 0: I, Vampire.

336
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:12,780
Speaker 0: I'm assuming that these characters have all this history that I don't know about.

337
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:14,158
Speaker 1: Something like that.

338
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,732
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell, the plot is weepy.

339
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,600
Speaker 0: vampire wants to kill all humans.

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

341
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,280
Speaker 1: So, the art, I gotta give the art credit for being different from other art, but...

342
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it reminded me so much of every White Wolf story ever.

343
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,580
Speaker 1: I did not like this art, though, even though, like, I give them credit for being different from the other superhero comics, but I is not a fan.

344
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,240
Speaker 1: Pretty much everything was two colors.

345
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,179
Speaker 1: Gray and different gray and black, and that's it.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,227
Speaker 0: And, I don't know, the plot was just like some White Wolf.

347
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,834
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's the plot of whoever these characters are.

348
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:48,757
Speaker 0: I don't know their names.

349
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:49,820
Speaker 0: I haven't even read this.

350
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,778
Speaker 1: Also, dude, vampires, you know, this is in the DC Universe, right?

351
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:55,360
Speaker 1: Right?

352
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,259
Speaker 0: I guess.

353
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,819
Speaker 1: There's no way any vampire, even Dracula, is gonna do anything in a universe...

354
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,300
Speaker 0: With Superman, the Green Lanterns...

355
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:03,981
Speaker 1: Right.

356
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:08,080
Speaker 1: If there's actually vampires and they're actually trying to bite everyone, like I said...

357
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,799
Speaker 0: What about Frankenstein, Agent of Shade, though?

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,569
Speaker 1: Superman would just punch them all in the head, and that would be it.

359
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,779
Speaker 1: And, you know, you toss vampires into the vacuum of space...

360
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,384
Speaker 0: Well, speaking of which, 'cause you know what?

361
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:22,360
Speaker 0: I think we can just say bad and move on, because Justice League Dark had the same problem.

362
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
Speaker 0: But they got around it by saying that magic is more...

363
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,327
Speaker 1: Well, first, did you put I, vampires... Bad.

364
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:28,011
Speaker 1: Bad?

365
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:28,319
Speaker 1: Okay.

366
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,011
Speaker 1: So, I didn't think it was 100% bad.

367
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:33,720
Speaker 1: I gave it points for doing different arts.

368
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I just didn't like the story.

369
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,685
Speaker 1: So, Justice League Dark, right?

370
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:43,380
Speaker 1: So, what you got here is they've actually taken a bunch of characters from Vertigo Comics, right?

371
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,820
Speaker 1: So, you got, you know, like Madame Xanadu's in here, right?

372
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,960
Speaker 0: I don't know who any of those characters are.

373
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,580
Speaker 1: John Constantine, I think, is in here.

374
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,840
Speaker 0: Other than him, because there was a movie.

375
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,638
Speaker 1: Right, I think.

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's in there.

377
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,221
Speaker 1: He's in there, right?

378
00:19:55,562 --> 00:20:04,680
Speaker 1: So, it's like, oh, they sort of brought in these magical characters all together to make sort of a magic wizardy, you know, dark wizard Justice League.

379
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, but... One...

380
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,259
Speaker 1: The art is kind of colorful and nice.

381
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,460
Speaker 0: The fact that they had to do this whole thing of showing you, look, Superman can't deal with this.

382
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:13,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,360
Speaker 0: They almost died.

384
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the typical thing where it's like, oh, there's something that only magicians can handle.

385
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:25,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the Green Lantern Corps, I guess, to come down and fix this.

386
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,837
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

387
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:30,519
Speaker 0: But two, what bothered me is that they had, like, all these paranormal events all happening at the same time.

388
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,680
Speaker 0: One, they all, I guess, are caused by this witch in the envelope.

389
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,240
Speaker 0: And two, they really had too many of those things.

390
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:40,940
Speaker 1: Yep.

391
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,580
Speaker 0: They listed, they went through so many, like, a cow gave birth to a meat slicing machine.

392
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,259
Speaker 0: One of the farmers who saw it shot himself.

393
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:51,559
Speaker 0: There's, like, ten of those.

394
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, also, why did the real superhero show up?

395
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,960
Speaker 1: It's like, ugh, really?

396
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,060
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you gotta bring the regular Justice League into Justice League.

397
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:06,640
Speaker 0: They're torn apart by those teeth, and they cut away, and then all you get is one- That was actually very Madoka-esque witch kind of scene.

398
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:07,159
Speaker 0: It was.

399
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,100
Speaker 1: But, you know, it didn't make the story any better.

400
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,780
Speaker 0: But then you get this one line or later where someone's like, yeah, Superman and them almost didn't survive.

401
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:14,728
Speaker 0: And that's it.

402
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:15,860
Speaker 0: That's all you get.

403
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

404
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,079
Speaker 1: Also, I was disappointed yet again.

405
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,519
Speaker 1: Every time I see Superman, I'm looking for- Action Comics Superman.

406
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,860
Speaker 1: The Action Comics Jumping Superman, and you're getting the Flying Superman.

407
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,332
Speaker 1: I'm like, ah.

408
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:30,680
Speaker 0: But this- even calling it Justice League Dark.

409
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,039
Speaker 0: I mean, really?

410
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:32,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:33,819
Speaker 0: You're calling it that?

412
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,680
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm doing Green Arrow and Green Arrow Dark.

413
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,920
Speaker 1: It's like- It's gonna be the same, but all, like- Why couldn't you just call it, like, you know, magic something something.

414
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,515
Speaker 1: I don't know.

415
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:45,100
Speaker 1: Come up with a new name for it.

416
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:45,560
Speaker 0: I don't know.

417
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,817
Speaker 0: It just, it was, it seemed so forced and simultaneously kind of bad.

418
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:53,896
Speaker 1: What are you, a Mayor bad?

419
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:55,339
Speaker 1: I'm giving it bad.

420
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,158
Speaker 1: I give it low med.

421
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,579
Speaker 0: I don't know who any of those characters are, for one.

422
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess because I knew some of them.

423
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,400
Speaker 1: That's sort of, you know, and the art was so good.

424
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,680
Speaker 0: The supernatural aspect was so forced.

425
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:06,840
Speaker 0: It was super forced.

426
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,477
Speaker 0: Am I supposed to know who that witch is?

427
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:09,778
Speaker 1: Yeah.

428
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,139
Speaker 0: So, alright.

429
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,516
Speaker 0: It doesn't tell you who it is.

430
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,087
Speaker 0: No.

431
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,259
Speaker 0: So thanks, comic book.

432
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,420
Speaker 0: Thanks for giving me nothing.

433
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:17,194
Speaker 1: Alright, so.

434
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
Speaker 1: Savage Hawkman.

435
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:21,518
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

436
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,958
Speaker 0: I've seen- Why is this a comic?

437
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,500
Speaker 1: Well, like, I don't know what the deal is with Hawkman.

438
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaker 0: Like, I see Hawkman all over the place.

439
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,880
Speaker 0: Is Savage Hawkman different from Hawkman?

440
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,120
Speaker 1: No, he's just, it's the Hawkman.

441
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,959
Speaker 0: This already started with him, you know, like, throwing away the Hawkman suit that I guess was his.

442
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, I don't get Hawkman.

443
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,215
Speaker 1: He's a dude who has a weird suit with wings and a mace.

444
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,180
Speaker 0: No, it's made out of the, it's made out of the oomph metal.

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,740
Speaker 1: But isn't he, like, an alien or something, Hawkman?

446
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,440
Speaker 0: No, the metal is alien.

447
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,580
Speaker 0: The oomph metal.

448
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,900
Speaker 1: So Hawkman's a regular dude.

449
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,700
Speaker 0: He's a regular dude, as far as I can guess.

450
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:53,640
Speaker 1: I thought he was this thing, I thought he was from some other planet, like.

451
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,937
Speaker 0: So Scott, I am basing all of my cosmology of the Savage Hawkman on this one comic I read.

452
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Speaker 0: And in this comic, there is a man, normal dude, who was the Hawkman because he had a suit made out of the oomph metal, and when he burned the oomph metal suit, it exploded and turned him again into the Hawkman.

453
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,518
Speaker 1: So the art, at least in the beginning part, was way awesome, especially the dude being set on fire.

454
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,620
Speaker 1: Oh, the art was great.

455
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,340
Speaker 1: Oh man, that was, it was just, like, a lot of these books, it's like, wow, they actually brought out some pretty good artists.

456
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,857
Speaker 1: I wonder if the fanboys like these arts as much as I like them.

457
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:27,700
Speaker 1: Here's another question.

458
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,733
Speaker 1: So there's this archaeologist going on here, right, and they're trying to dig up some alien shit.

459
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,313
Speaker 0: Yup.

460
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:42,859
Speaker 1: Why are there archaeologists in a world with Superman who can x-ray vision the whole world and can just fly out into outer space and find out anything you have to know about alien history?

461
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,538
Speaker 0: Why, yeah.

462
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,720
Speaker 1: Archaeology is completely unnecessary in a world with superheroes who can go into space and fly faster than the speed of light.

463
00:23:49,720 --> 00:24:04,117
Speaker 0: In a world where there is also a long history of epic space battles, I mean, we know from the one of the Green Lanterns, no, not from Green Lantern, from Blue Beetle, that when the Mayans were around, that one Green Lantern guy was out there doing the Green Lantern bullshit.

464
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is, archaeology is obsolete in a world of superheroes.

465
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,799
Speaker 0: No, you have archaeological experts who tell the superheroes what to do.

466
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:19,520
Speaker 1: You just know, you just have superheroes who have already done all the archaeology in about two days, and then the other guys would just be studying all the stuff that was 100% dug up and discovered.

467
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:35,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that aside, I don't have any motivation to care about the Hawkman, and because, clearly, the comic book decided that it didn't need to tell me anything that was going on, I had no idea what was going on.

468
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,700
Speaker 1: This also reminded me of Independence Day, where they got that cocoon there, and it's sort of like the peace, no peace kind of situation.

469
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,420
Speaker 0: Is this class bulletproof?

470
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is- See that college humor, where the guy's like, "Yes, it is," and then they shoot anyway, and then they get hit with a ricochet.

471
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:49,520
Speaker 0: He's like, "What the fuck?

472
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,270
Speaker 0: I said it was

473
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:50,758
Speaker 0: bulletproof!".

474
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,420
Speaker 1: Bulletproof glass doesn't ricochet, though.

475
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
Speaker 1: The bullets just get stuck in it, right?

476
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:54,480
Speaker 0: I know.

477
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,297
Speaker 1: Anyway, and then, also, this is one of those cases of, "I hit you, little

479
00:24:59,317 --> 00:24:59,658
Speaker 1: guy.".

480
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a lot of that going on.

481
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,480
Speaker 1: Always minus points, but you get mad because your arts are awesome.

482
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,338
Speaker 1: What are you going to give it?

483
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,099
Speaker 0: I don't know.

484
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,600
Speaker 0: I got to give it a meh minus.

485
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:12,539
Speaker 1: Meh minus?

486
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:12,980
Speaker 0: Okay.

487
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,619
Speaker 0: Because, like you said, the art is really good, but the story, one- I don't know anything about the Hawkman, so it makes no sense.

488
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,899
Speaker 0: I wonder if it would be slightly better if I knew, but I pretended, like, what if I knew what all these things were?

489
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,540
Speaker 0: The story still wasn't that compelling.

490
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:27,913
Speaker 1: No.

491
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,920
Speaker 1: All right, so, regular old Superman.

492
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,300
Speaker 0: Wasn't action comic Superman, would not buy from again.

493
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:36,500
Speaker 1: That's pretty much what he got.

494
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,680
Speaker 1: It wasn't the Superman I want.

495
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,180
Speaker 1: So, first of all, it's like, the Daily Planet is bigger than the New York Times.

496
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,140
Speaker 1: Does the internet exist in this world, right?

497
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,952
Speaker 1: It's like, "Are you kidding

498
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:46,095
Speaker 1: me?".

499
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,030
Speaker 1: It's like, "How is the Daily Planet-".

500
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:53,638
Speaker 0: And how come they- I guess they feel like the only way to keep Superman fresh is to make the Daily Planet start to turn into a rag?

501
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:54,472
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,459
Speaker 1: It's like, obviously, they were trying to make this social commentary, but you failed because you were too overt and not subtle at all.

503
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:01,828
Speaker 0: Yeah.

504
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,520
Speaker 1: Right?

505
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:11,520
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, why didn't, you know, Superman just save the old globe instead of just letting it fall?

506
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,820
Speaker 1: Like, he could have just taken it and put it in a museum.

507
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,399
Speaker 1: He's Superman.

508
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,392
Speaker 0: Who's going to stop him?

509
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,619
Speaker 0: And put it in space in an orbit and left it there until someone asked for him to give it to them to do something with it.

510
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,100
Speaker 0: And then he could have gone out and got it and brought it back.

511
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,059
Speaker 1: If there's a thing you care about and you're Superman, no one can fuck it up for you.

512
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,880
Speaker 0: The Superman just had no personality.

513
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,000
Speaker 0: Action Comics Superman has personality.

514
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,898
Speaker 0: Where is that guy?

515
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,537
Speaker 1: Oh, the thing that bothered me the most of the whole book- The most.

516
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,220
Speaker 1: The most, I don't know if you remember this, right, is if you go to, uh, what page was this fucking thing on, right?

517
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:45,898
Speaker 1: Oh, God, I'm going to find it.

518
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:50,538
Speaker 0: I'm wondering if I'm thinking the same thing, but I don't want to say anything until you show me the page.

519
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,140
Speaker 0: All right.

520
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,557
Speaker 0: So what?

521
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,617
Speaker 1: So there's this random page in the middle that has nothing to do with anything- The guy blowing the horn!

522
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:03,300
Speaker 1: It's just like you're reading this book and this stuff, Superman stuff happening.

523
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,678
Speaker 1: Then there's a page and there's a guy, there's a crazy alien blowing this weird ass fucking horn.

524
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,579
Speaker 1: And it has that note.

525
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,379
Speaker 0: It's like, want to know more about this mystery?

526
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,540
Speaker 1: Because for more on this mystery, you see Stormwatch number one, and then it just goes back to Superman.

527
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,300
Speaker 1: That horn blowing has nothing to do with anything else in any page in this book.

528
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,099
Speaker 1: It is a random page of an alien blowing a horn.

529
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,700
Speaker 0: And two, it's not a mystery anymore if I read that other comic.

530
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, uh, we had Stormwatch number one.

531
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,079
Speaker 1: I read it already, didn't we?

532
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,079
Speaker 0: I don't remember that in Stormwatch.

533
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,060
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck this alien blowing a horn has to do with Stormwatch.

534
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:50,360
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe I'll go back and check it out, but why did you- it's like they took a page out of Stormwatch, ripped it out, and just shoved it in a Superman book, just randomly in the middle for no reason.

535
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,940
Speaker 0: Probably to get you to read Stormwatch.

536
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,116
Speaker 0: I know the plots are going to collide, but again, DC, why you do this?

537
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,120
Speaker 0: This is what I hate about comics.

538
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,598
Speaker 1: And there's more subtle ways you could have done it.

539
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:11,660
Speaker 1: Maybe not even have the Stormwatch comic, and then maybe sort of introduce a plot where Stormwatch has to deal with Superman somehow, and then sort of bring it around back.

540
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:24,560
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ways they could have done it, but the only thing I like about Superman right now is either the Superman in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, or the action comic Superman.

541
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,179
Speaker 0: If this is neither, I don't care.

542
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,800
Speaker 0: And it just heaped insults upon those already weak foundations.

543
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,780
Speaker 0: I'd give it a bed.

544
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,419
Speaker 1: I would have given it meh, but that horn page brings it down.

545
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,778
Speaker 1: Brings it down into bad territory.

546
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,465
Speaker 0: So not to bring in stuff.

547
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:46,518
Speaker 0: I know about other stuff, but Teen Titans, that's not the Teen Titans.

548
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:47,979
Speaker 0: Who are these people?

549
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:51,180
Speaker 1: I don't know much about Teen Titans at all, really.

550
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,020
Speaker 0: I know there was the mediocre cartoon, and that's all I know, and you know what?

551
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 0: This wasn't the same people.

552
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,920
Speaker 1: So you've got this super boy, right?

553
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,279
Speaker 1: Is he super boy or is he not?

554
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,100
Speaker 1: Because isn't super boy the astro boy?

555
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,880
Speaker 0: Yes, the astro boy and super boy.

556
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:03,798
Speaker 1: So who's this guy?

557
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:04,880
Speaker 0: Fuck if I know.

558
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,560
Speaker 1: So he's super kid, super dude.

559
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:07,256
Speaker 0: I don't know.

560
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,540
Speaker 1: Other super boy, super boy two, super whatever.

561
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:15,320
Speaker 0: And then- Remember, Queen Tits and Ass is supposed to be in the Teen Titans, but she's not.

562
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,420
Speaker 0: She's in Tits and Ass, the comic book.

563
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,480
Speaker 1: You've got Kid Flash, who I sort of know.

564
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,118
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

565
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who that is.

566
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,740
Speaker 1: You got Robin.

567
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,699
Speaker 1: Which one of the four Robins is this?

568
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,920
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure this is the one.

569
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,240
Speaker 1: The one who takes it in the ass or the one who sucks Batman's dick?

570
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 0: This is like Red Robin or something.

571
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,779
Speaker 0: It's like yet another Robin.

572
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:30,560
Speaker 1: Is it different?

573
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,540
Speaker 1: Was he not ever a regular Robin?

574
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:33,052
Speaker 1: I don't know.

575
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,620
Speaker 1: Was he only a Red Robin or was he a real, plain old Robin at some point?

576
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,879
Speaker 0: I don't know and it doesn't tell you.

577
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:44,960
Speaker 0: I watched the cartoon a little bit and it was just Robin and the cyborg guy.

578
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,740
Speaker 0: I don't know who these people are.

579
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 1: And then you've got Wonder Girl, right?

580
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,051
Speaker 1: And the weirdest part for me was Wonder Girl says, "Wonder

581
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:54,252
Speaker 1: Girl."

582
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:57,146
Speaker 1: It's like,

583
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:57,792
Speaker 1: "What?".

584
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:02,540
Speaker 1: You say- You know, it's like you don't say your weird name.

585
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,760
Speaker 1: No one goes around saying their own weird-ass name.

586
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,186
Speaker 0: I kind of like the dynamic between the Robin and Wonder Girl because she's like, "Don't call me

587
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:10,371
Speaker 0: that.".

588
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,580
Speaker 0: And then he's like, "I can block these bullets.

589
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,034
Speaker 0: You're on your

590
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:14,159
Speaker 0: own.".

591
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:14,820
Speaker 0: She's like, "Whatever.

592
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:15,408
Speaker 0: I got

593
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:15,857
Speaker 0: magics.".

594
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:16,755
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Whoa, you got

595
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:17,020
Speaker 0: magic.".

596
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,633
Speaker 0: And she's like, "Shut

597
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:17,776
Speaker 0: up.".

598
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:18,340
Speaker 1: Oh, no, wait.

599
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:28,260
Speaker 1: I think that the Superboy is the Astro Boy Superboy because if you look on the final two pages, it's that girl with the orange hair who was cool and then released the Superboy.

600
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:34,277
Speaker 0: I was holding my notes in my hand and actually looked, but what I wrote was, "Oh, Superboy is here.

601
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,106
Speaker 0: I wonder

602
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:35,492
Speaker 0: why.".

603
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:39,780
Speaker 0: Basically, I was complaining that, yet again, they're mixing all my comics up.

604
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,640
Speaker 1: Also, The Enemy was an evil acronym organization.

605
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,099
Speaker 1: Of course.

606
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:49,099
Speaker 1: And I think at some point someone made a joke about Robin being homeschooled, and I was like, "Haha.

607
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,459
Speaker 1: He does act homeschooled.

608
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:50,990
Speaker 1: Wait.

609
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:51,972
Speaker 1: All these people act

610
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:52,479
Speaker 1: homeschooled.".

611
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:57,380
Speaker 1: Okay, so that Superboy is the Astro Boy Superboy, but it's like, "No, wait.

612
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,832
Speaker 1: Why are they releasing the Astro Boy Superboy in a comic?

613
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:00,334
Speaker 1: that's not the

614
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:00,877
Speaker 1: Superboy?".

615
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,220
Speaker 0: I give it a mad just because it's not as bad as all the things I've said are bad.

616
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:09,120
Speaker 0: I didn't like it, but I didn't particularly dislike it.

617
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,260
Speaker 1: I actually gave it bad because there was absolutely nothing.

618
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:16,125
Speaker 1: The other ones that I gave mad, it was like, "Oh, there was amazing art, but there was nothing

619
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:16,412
Speaker 1: doing.".

620
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,414
Speaker 1: This, it was just nothing doing across the board.

621
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,571
Speaker 1: There wasn't one awesome thing to say.

622
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:24,200
Speaker 1: there was an awesome thing to push it up into mad.

623
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:27,877
Speaker 0: I guess I kind of enjoyed some of the banter, and the dialogue wasn't that bad.

624
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,540
Speaker 1: I did comment about the, "You were homeschooled" part.

625
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:38,499
Speaker 1: It was a little better than others in the dialogue department, but still not good dialogue, just better than the others.

626
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,079
Speaker 0: By this point in the slog, it didn't take much to impress me.

627
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,060
Speaker 1: It's all relative.

628
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:43,939
Speaker 0: All right.

629
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,299
Speaker 1: We're finally at the end of our slog.

630
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,845
Speaker 0: Voodoo.

631
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:48,897
Speaker 0: Voodoo.

632
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:50,171
Speaker 1: AKA.

633
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:50,836
Speaker 1: TNA.

634
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:54,757
Speaker 0: Not only TNA, but let's have- Tnist Aonist.

635
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:07,920
Speaker 0: The majority of this comic take place in a strip club and keep showing all the strippers and play to the stereotype that all the strippers are in fact working moms and college girls just trying to get by, and that is totally not sleazy.

636
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:19,720
Speaker 0: This is like, it's almost like misogyny trying to pretend it's not misogynistic by stereotyping misogyny and then trying to cast it in a good light.

637
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,859
Speaker 1: So the art, I thought the art was actually kind of, it was cool that they tried to do something different, right?

638
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,619
Speaker 1: But it looks like a high quality kamipo.

639
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:28,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

640
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,799
Speaker 1: So it's not actually good, but I give them points for doing something different and minus points for doing a bad job.

641
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,479
Speaker 1: The cover was a little- Minus points for TNA.

642
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,539
Speaker 0: The cover was a little- The cover doesn't fit.

643
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,340
Speaker 1: And then here's the notes that I wrote down.

644
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:40,615
Speaker 1: You ready?

645
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,714
Speaker 0: Boobs.

646
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,139
Speaker 1: Nice setup.

647
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,255
Speaker 1: Boobs.

648
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:45,979
Speaker 0: It was all boobs.

649
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:46,996
Speaker 1: All boobs.

650
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:48,259
Speaker 0: Nothing but boobs.

651
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 0: I did not, the first time I read it, I did not actually catch that it was the same guy.

652
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,579
Speaker 0: Like I didn't notice that that guy was back.

653
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,339
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't notice that?

654
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,739
Speaker 0: Because he was drawn derpily.

655
00:32:59,784 --> 00:32:59,976
Speaker 0: Kind of.

656
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,319
Speaker 0: Like his face went off model.

657
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:03,300
Speaker 1: I didn't notice that much.

658
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,320
Speaker 0: Like I didn't notice it was him.

659
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,474
Speaker 0: I read it again, I was like, "Oh wait, it's the same

660
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:05,799
Speaker 0: guy.".

661
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,638
Speaker 0: I don't know if I just didn't read those last pages the first time I read it.

662
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,020
Speaker 0: But seriously, they're all strippers.

663
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:22,660
Speaker 0: You focus on strippers and sex, the whole comic, and you like go out of your way to talk about how all the strippers are totally cool and totally okay with being strippers.

664
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:26,680
Speaker 0: and they're just like, you know, working moms, trying to get by, trying to make do.

665
00:33:27,181 --> 00:33:30,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I mean it's, the thing is, is like you're like, "Oh, it's the same

666
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:30,480
Speaker 1: guy.".

667
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,838
Speaker 1: It's because Voodoo turned into the guy.

668
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,189
Speaker 0: Yeah.

669
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:34,339
Speaker 0: But then Voodoo also walked away.

671
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,180
Speaker 1: I think she's basically just like the thing, you know, the thing from another world or whatever.

672
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,020
Speaker 0: Maybe she's bad at it, so she was off, that was why he was off model.

673
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:41,497
Speaker 0: I don't know.

674
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:42,200
Speaker 1: I don't know.

675
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,319
Speaker 1: I gave it man.

676
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,940
Speaker 0: I gave it bad because I just didn't care.

677
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,538
Speaker 1: Yeah.

678
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:49,839
Speaker 1: All right, so that concludes this.

679
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,699
Speaker 1: I hope this helps somebody even though it's a thousand years late.

680
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,540
Speaker 1: Just sort of summary things.

681
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:02,540
Speaker 0: I think we can sum it up by pointing out that it took us this long to do this and I was really excited.

682
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,132
Speaker 0: Like, it's only 52 single issue comics.

683
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,777
Speaker 0: I'm going to read them all with an open mind and I liked some of them, but it became such a slog.

684
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:19,558
Speaker 0: Like the ones that I didn't like, I would put to the back of the pile and then I'd gotten through all the ones I liked and I had this gigantic pile of comics that I did not want to read.

685
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,359
Speaker 1: 52 comics.

686
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,059
Speaker 1: That's a lot of different comics.

687
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,536
Speaker 1: I know.

688
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,719
Speaker 1: But it's like so many of them were just the same shit.

689
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,062
Speaker 0: I mean, all the Green Lanterns blurred together to where I really, the only ones that stood out was.

690
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:38,760
Speaker 0: there was Green Lanterny bullshit and then separate from that there was Green Lanterny bullshit where the evil looking guy is in space brooding.

691
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:53,000
Speaker 1: See, what I would do if I was them, right, is it's like, okay, obviously if I was them I would throw out the whole thing and make a completely new way of doing things, but just to make, you know, if you're going to keep things the way they're doing it, but you know, just make slight modifications to improve, right?

692
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,149
Speaker 1: What I would do is all this Batman stuff, you really got to sort it out and have there be just one Batman.

693
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,617
Speaker 0: Here's what I would do.

694
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,099
Speaker 0: I'd have all the different Batmans.

695
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:05,160
Speaker 0: I'd make the equivalent of Shonen Jump, but it's just Batman Jump.

696
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:06,859
Speaker 0: It's just like.

697
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,680
Speaker 1: Well, that's changing the whole world, right?

698
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:29,236
Speaker 1: I'm talking about just the slight change, which is, you know, get rid of all these different Batman comics, like Batman Dark, Batman Light, Batman Purple, Batman this, and just make the one comic Batman and release four issues every month, Batman one, two, three, four, and month two, five, six, seven, eight, and if you have to, make them bigger with more pages like a 48 page.

699
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,614
Speaker 0: Or, or, or if you have to, have a second Batman.

700
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:32,520
Speaker 0: that is no story.

701
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,300
Speaker 0: Every one off is a one off story.

702
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:44,540
Speaker 1: So there's the one off story, B-Task, and then there's the other one that is Batman, Hell, just make more B-TAS in comic form.

703
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:55,360
Speaker 0: That style of Batman is my second favorite, third favorite after the original Frank Miller Dark Knight Returns and Michael Keaton Batman, which nobody else likes.

704
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,619
Speaker 1: You know, numbers wise, I wrote, I got to put this spreadsheet out there.

705
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,394
Speaker 1: So you know, most of the comics had 21 pages of content.

706
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:13,420
Speaker 1: I counted the cover as content that you had around, you know, four or five, six, seven pages of ads, but actually the number of ads went up over the weeks.

707
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,760
Speaker 1: Like the early weeks had like four or five, six pages.

708
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,020
Speaker 1: The later weeks had seven, eight, nine ad pages.

709
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:19,899
Speaker 0: I wonder if they thought we wouldn't notice.

710
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,780
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it also was that they had house ads, right?

711
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,100
Speaker 1: The house ads are the ads for other DC shit.

712
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,500
Speaker 1: So the house ads started off as like 10 house ads for all 14 pages of house ads, right?

713
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:32,879
Speaker 1: And they went down.

714
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:42,099
Speaker 1: So they, over the weeks, over these four weeks, at least of starting, they had more house ads in the beginning and they replaced them with paid ads as time went on.

715
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:47,480
Speaker 1: And yeah, charging three bucks for any one of these is a ridiculous amount of money.

716
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,584
Speaker 1: Think about this for one of these flimsy ass things that gives you only 21 pages of story.

717
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,240
Speaker 1: That's pretty much a disposable thing.

718
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,359
Speaker 1: You read it once and chuck it.

719
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:01,127
Speaker 1: You could get three one dollar iPhone games that you'll probably play every day on the subway.

720
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:02,039
Speaker 0: Three Angry Birds.

721
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:02,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

722
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,340
Speaker 1: You're telling me that this Batman is worth three Angry Birds?

723
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:07,680
Speaker 1: Are you crazy?

724
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,656
Speaker 0: The only I mean, maybe Animal Man, just because if that was the only way to read it, I kind of want to read it.

725
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not worth that many.

726
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:17,904
Speaker 1: Yeah.

727
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:19,860
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, my God, it's unbelievable.

728
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:21,620
Speaker 1: And some of these are four dollars.

729
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,220
Speaker 1: All Star Western was a longer book with more pages at twenty nine pages of content.

730
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,647
Speaker 1: Guess what?

731
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,339
Speaker 1: Four dollars.

732
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:35,279
Speaker 1: It's like, wait, you only added eight more pages of content, you know, over the twenty one that were already in the other ones.

733
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:42,140
Speaker 1: And you added a whole extra dollar, a thirty three percent price increase for a less than thirty three percent content increase.

734
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,199
Speaker 1: That is not cool.

735
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:50,479
Speaker 1: So the pricing is all fucked up, but everyone knows that most of them were bad or mad, but hey, most of everything is crap.

736
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:54,160
Speaker 0: But in our opinion, I mean, I know there are people who love the shit out of all of them.

737
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:59,080
Speaker 1: Well, if you're the kind of person who loves the shit out of us, you know what we think and you know that you disagree with us.

738
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,979
Speaker 0: No, didn't you know that you like it?

739
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,700
Speaker 0: Didn't some of these already get canceled by the time we finished all this?

740
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly which ones were canceled because you keep going through your statistics.

741
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,259
Speaker 0: I'll find out which ones got canceled.

742
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,479
Speaker 1: I think Omak was canceled and stuff like that.

743
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:11,578
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

744
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,404
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

745
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be the Jack Kirby-esque one.

746
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:15,751
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

747
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:16,299
Speaker 1: It was pretty bad.

748
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,460
Speaker 1: But, you know, all in all, there were some good ones.

749
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:23,042
Speaker 1: If you make if you throw enough shit against the wall, you're going to have some golds, right?

750
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:23,759
Speaker 1: You know, Animal Man.

751
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,202
Speaker 1: Great.

752
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:26,300
Speaker 1: The action comic Superman.

753
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:26,802
Speaker 1: Great.

754
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:30,820
Speaker 1: You know, there were some of these comics in here that we kind of liked.

755
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:31,474
Speaker 1: Aquaman.

756
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:31,780
Speaker 1: Right.

757
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,659
Speaker 1: Totally cool and awesome jerk guy.

758
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:38,200
Speaker 1: You know, All-Star Western kind of OK-ish, right?

759
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,503
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, not all these comics were absolutely awful.

760
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,962
Speaker 1: There are some that are worth reading and they'll probably be paying for the trade.

761
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:55,160
Speaker 0: Well, there is a whole section in the Wikipedia article on the New 52 on accusations of sexism.

762
00:38:58,912 --> 00:38:59,399
Speaker 1: How about that?

763
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,501
Speaker 0: Wow.

764
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:03,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of information here.

765
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 0: Doesn't say which ones got canceled.

766
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,520
Speaker 1: Did you press control F and type the word cancel?

767
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,181
Speaker 0: Not yet.

768
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:14,320
Speaker 1: OK, here we go.

769
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Speaker 1: On January 12, 2012, DC announced that after their eighth issue.

770
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:23,300
Speaker 1: So there's going to be eight issues of the following comics and then they will all be canceled and replace.

771
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,140
Speaker 0: Yep, I see it with six new titles.

772
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,360
Speaker 1: So here are the ones that are going away.

773
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,759
Speaker 1: Black Hawks, which was, you know, we put our logo on our truck, Hawk and Dove, which is Rob Liefeld.

774
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:34,647
Speaker 1: Men of War.

775
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,200
Speaker 1: That was the war one.

776
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:37,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least.

777
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:41,819
Speaker 1: Hey, but the thing is, if there's only eight issues of it, you know, there'll be one trade and that's it.

778
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:42,960
Speaker 1: So it's not even a big commitment.

779
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,523
Speaker 0: I'll read the trade.

780
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:46,060
Speaker 1: So you could buy that and then sell it to book off or something.

781
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:46,730
Speaker 1: Yeah.

782
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:46,852
Speaker 1: Mr.

783
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:47,240
Speaker 1: Terrific.

784
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,720
Speaker 0: OK.

785
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,700
Speaker 0: Oh, Mac, no shock there.

786
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,180
Speaker 1: And static shock again.

787
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,043
Speaker 0: No shock.

788
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:59,620
Speaker 1: So those six title after their eighth issues, those six titles will be canceled and they're going to be six new titles.

789
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:03,720
Speaker 0: So six new Batman, no, five new Batman and one new Green Lanterns.

790
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,679
Speaker 1: Should we buy the number ones of those six new?

791
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:07,155
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

792
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:07,520
Speaker 1: Right.

793
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,879
Speaker 1: It won't be for a while.

794
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:09,202
Speaker 1: Right.

795
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,320
Speaker 1: The eighth issues of those ones still have to come out.

796
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,637
Speaker 1: And then the month after that.

797
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,379
Speaker 0: We probably should.

798
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be like half an episode going over just six issues.

799
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,165
Speaker 1: Right.

800
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,058
Speaker 1: But then I feel like, well, if we're going to do that, we have to.

801
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,699
Speaker 1: we should be buying Marvel number ones.

802
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:23,062
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,680
Speaker 1: So I don't want to go, you know, down this huge rabbit hole.

804
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,171
Speaker 0: So if we're going to do anything Marvel, you need to watch Wolverine and the X-Men so we can do a show on it.

805
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:30,840
Speaker 1: Sure.

806
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:32,218
Speaker 0: It's really good.

807
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:33,487
Speaker 1: Sure.

808
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:34,279
Speaker 0: It is really good.

809
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,719
Speaker 1: I got other things to be doing.

810
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,539
Speaker 0: I just got to point out, you know, for all the hate I get for all the a lot of these comic books, you can do superhero stuff that I'll really like.

811
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:42,783
Speaker 1: It's possible.

812
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,650
Speaker 1: It's very it's you know, it's just.

813
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,440
Speaker 1: you just can't do the typical shit.

814
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,638
Speaker 1: I really like the superhero stuff that gets sort of like existential and weird.

815
00:40:52,939 --> 00:41:05,259
Speaker 1: or like you remember I was talking about my idea for the Flash where he sort of has like mental problems or, you know, you make it real sci fi, like for real sci fi, the way Ghost in the Shell is for real sci fi.

816
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,003
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

817
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:10,442
Speaker 0: If they if they got some of the artists or like Demon Knight was real fantasy, right?

818
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:17,240
Speaker 0: It's got to take the artist who did this stuff like the good ones and make a Ghost in the Shell like color comic.

819
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:17,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

820
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:20,380
Speaker 0: That isn't just Ghost in the Shell 2.

821
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, that isn't just Ghost in the Shell 2.

822
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,744
Speaker 1: Right.

823
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,254
Speaker 1: You know, or you know, you could do.

824
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:26,600
Speaker 1: none of these are comedies.

825
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:27,478
Speaker 1: Have you noticed that?

826
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,740
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Wikipedia.

827
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:33,483
Speaker 0: All right.

828
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:49,174
Speaker 0: So Keith Phillips and two people who are talking about the sexism stuff agreed with the observations on Catwoman and Red Hood and the Outlaws, quote, but opine that Voodoo was a positive example of how to incorporate a female character's sexuality as relevant aspect of the story without appearing

829
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:49,859
Speaker 1: exploitative.

830
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:51,829
Speaker 0: Oh, I got.

831
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:52,639
Speaker 0: who said that?

832
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,238
Speaker 0: Who said that?

833
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:58,780
Speaker 0: The Comics Alliance and I don't know, Keith Phillips.

834
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:00,198
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know.

835
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:00,784
Speaker 0: Really?

836
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,420
Speaker 0: You could say that with a straight face.

837
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,057
Speaker 1: I guess the guy believes it.

838
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,960
Speaker 0: I know.

839
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,680
Speaker 1: I mean, if you tried to go argue that in some forum, there'd be a flame war.

840
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,709
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

841
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

842
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:14,952
Speaker 1: This is why you have a podcast.

843
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:15,560
Speaker 1: No replies.

844
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:24,350
