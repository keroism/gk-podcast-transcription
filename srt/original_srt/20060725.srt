1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,120
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:14,091
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday July 25th, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,220
Speaker 1: We talk about the Nintendo classic semi classic Advance Wars.

4
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:21,093
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:23,543
Speaker 0: Not moments ago.

6
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:29,960
Speaker 0: I braved almost certain death to bravely fight a small tiny nest of paper wasps.

7
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:35,620
Speaker 1: You know I don't think you would have died even if they all stung you in the eye.

8
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,158
Speaker 0: You know what though that would have hurt a lot, and I really don't like it when things hurt.

9
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,626
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, and how do you?

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,900
Speaker 1: how are you a hundred percent sure they were paper wasps?

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,598
Speaker 1: They could have been any kind of wasps actually.

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:01:03,196
Speaker 0: no I did a bunch of research at work because I really didn't have much to do today And I learned all the differences between wasps yellow jackets Hornets bees bumble bees and various other nefarious stinging bits and The main thing I learned is that the things that were living on our deck were almost certainly paper wasps.

13
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:04,358
Speaker 1: and what kind of?

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,937
Speaker 1: Characteristics of paper wasps makes you believe that that's what they were.

15
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:08,380
Speaker 0: one.

16
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,780
Speaker 0: They looked exactly like the pictures on the websites.

17
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:19,823
Speaker 0: Uh-huh - their nest looked exactly like the picture of the nest that a paper wasp makes which is very different from a hornet's nest Hornet's net.

18
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 0: you see how to head out all those open exposed cells, and it was made out of that papery stuff.

19
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:27,540
Speaker 0: Yep, the hornet's nest have this whooshing kind of paper, and it looks completely different.

20
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:30,219
Speaker 0: Uh-huh and a lot of yellow jackets live in the ground.

21
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:31,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate it.

22
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:35,740
Speaker 1: in my yard at home my parents house a lot of bugs that live in holes in the ground.

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,380
Speaker 1: We'd have to fill them up or spray poison down there with the hose.

24
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:43,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, there will be pictures in the form of this because I got one crappy picture.

25
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,319
Speaker 0: That's fine.

26
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:54,440
Speaker 0: see I remember I'm about to go and Scott says I'm recording and then I fought the bees and then Scott says oh, I wasn't recording.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,660
Speaker 1: That's what I get for using trying to use a digital photo camera.

28
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,719
Speaker 1: Try to use the video feature on it, which is not the greatest.

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,948
Speaker 1: And I didn't.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,163
Speaker 1: it wasn't enabled even though I thought it was.

31
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,280
Speaker 1: it wasn't recording when I thought it was and it just wasn't good.

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:18,800
Speaker 0: But I did take one or two photographs so which were worth it because I wasn't afraid of Actually dying or being hurt because I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to any of these sorts of stings.

33
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:31,100
Speaker 0: I just didn't want to feel any pain and Originally my plan was I'll buy the most dangerous poison I can buy without a license or any special permission or training and I was gonna follow the instructions and spray down this nest now.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,407
Speaker 0: I didn't even want to get rid of the nest.

35
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,760
Speaker 0: I was fine with it there because they hadn't bothered us at all.

36
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:51,361
Speaker 0: but in my research I learned that wasps of that kind will as the summer goes on toward fall get more and more aggressive as they forage and Considering that they were on our deck in a place we frequent it would have been a bad idea to let that nest get any Bigger.

37
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:52,747
Speaker 1: well, it's dead now.

38
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,953
Speaker 0: Oh it is dead.

39
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,580
Speaker 0: I filled it so full of poison.

40
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:06,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, I destroyed it with the hose, but I didn't want to get stung and every single website I read said you will get stung If you try to take one of these down.

41
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,380
Speaker 1: so screw those websites.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,368
Speaker 1: They're all written by idiots who got didn't get still.

43
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:15,254
Speaker 0: a bunch of them came at me and before they died Yeah, I felt at least one of them bounce off my trench coat.

44
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:30,360
Speaker 0: you see I put on armor I put on blue jeans and a shirt, and then I put my old trench coat on which unlike my new wonderful one that Emily and her family gave me the old one is filled with the Wax and decay of many many years of rim wearing it in all weather.

45
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:37,020
Speaker 0: It is basically armor, and I suit it up, and I put gloves on and over my head.

46
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,239
Speaker 0: I had a veil tucked into my neck made out of my.

47
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:42,550
Speaker 1: It was just a mesh laundry bag.

48
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what I it worked pretty well.

49
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least it didn't.

50
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,480
Speaker 0: I didn't die or anything better than nothing.

51
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:51,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I didn't want to risk one stabbing me in the eye.

52
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:59,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so there are two things I just want to Pay note to real quick that it seems that no one in the else in the universe noticed including me.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,443
Speaker 1: Yesterday was the one hundred and fiftieth episode of geek nights which hooray for arbitrary numbers Whatever.

54
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:11,916
Speaker 0: well the thing is it's hard to say because one.

55
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:16,305
Speaker 0: there was one slight Inconsistency in our numbering way back To.

56
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:26,176
Speaker 0: we started with episode one but then the next day we uploaded an episode from the previous day art which became our very first episode and I gave that the number zero.

57
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:28,369
Speaker 0: and There are a bunch of episodes.

58
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,760
Speaker 0: We made before we had a website.

59
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:35,057
Speaker 1: Well, here's how I counted you ready the Odeo which is what we were going to talk about.

60
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:42,997
Speaker 1: next is They have a thing that tells you how many episodes there are and in their list they had every single episode.

61
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,083
Speaker 1: that is on our Website.

62
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:46,748
Speaker 1: that is listed in the blog.

63
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:50,438
Speaker 1: so not counting the beta alpha episodes of geek nights.

64
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,629
Speaker 1: there were 150 of them as of yesterday.

65
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:57,002
Speaker 0: all right cuz Yahoo gives a different number and feed But no one.

66
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,167
Speaker 0: nothing gives the right number.

67
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:00,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, I checked Odeo had the right number.

68
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:01,180
Speaker 0: all right, okay?

69
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:09,771
Speaker 1: Also, people don't seem to notice that this past Saturday Was the 10th anniversary of the Daily Show.

70
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,734
Speaker 0: don't you feel old?

71
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:12,640
Speaker 0: don't you feel real old?

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,568
Speaker 1: Here's something to make you feel older that other guy Craig.

73
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:16,692
Speaker 0: What's-his-face Kilborn?

74
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,460
Speaker 1: He was only on the show for three years.

75
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:23,350
Speaker 1: Jon Stewart has been on the show for seven years now.

76
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:33,850
Speaker 0: the thing is not only do I remember the very First episode of the Daily Show because I watched it and I wasn't it on the same Night as the first episode of South Park.

77
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:35,879
Speaker 1: It was like right around the same time.

78
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:46,820
Speaker 0: all I know is that I was at band camp right and Someone we had said cuz someone was a senior in that a car, and they snuck out at night drove back home Which is like a two-hour drive?

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,500
Speaker 0: They went to their parents house who had taped both shows for them Drove back, and it was like this was like three days after it actually aired.

80
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,575
Speaker 0: We eventually got this tape and we watched South Park and a bunch of other stuff.

81
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:05,229
Speaker 0: whoa yeah But I remember when Craig Kilborn was gonna leave the show and I thought all right.

82
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:05,970
Speaker 0: That's the end of the show.

83
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:07,053
Speaker 0: Who's this?

84
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:07,858
Speaker 0: Jon Stewart guy?

85
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,710
Speaker 0: I didn't know he was actually famous from other stuff.

86
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,363
Speaker 0: I didn't know he did anything yep, and I thought the show was gonna be stupid.

87
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:19,644
Speaker 0: and after about five minutes I realized that Craig Kilborn was nothing to me, so everyone write it down.

88
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:27,307
Speaker 1: three years from now in 2009 on July 22nd, that's the 10th anniversary of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

89
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,524
Speaker 0: now I wonder how many of our younger listeners don't even know who Craig Kilborn is.

90
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:32,850
Speaker 0: I don't know.

91
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:38,929
Speaker 1: We seem to be really detached from that sort of pop culture thing, so I'm sure that they know better than we do.

92
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:47,082
Speaker 0: I don't know because it seems like Comedy Central stuff seems to be a lot more Hip to the geeks because all the clips that are relevant are on YouTube anyway.

93
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,770
Speaker 1: Yep, okay, and last thing is the Odeo thing.

94
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:58,296
Speaker 1: for anyone doesn't know Odeo is a website that lets you handle podcast making and Listening and all sorts of audio.

95
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an okay website.

96
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,727
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

97
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:12,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Point is is that if you go to frontrowcrew.com down in the bottom right side of the page way at the bottom on the right There is a link that says send me an Odeo.

98
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:20,815
Speaker 1: now There is also a link above that way above that that says like just Odeo That's not the one you want.

99
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:32,450
Speaker 1: you want the one in the bottom below the frapper link and oh yeah You should do the frapper map thing if you haven't already and if you click on that It will take you to a web page where you can send us an Odeo.

100
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:47,409
Speaker 1: this means you plug a microphone into your computer and this little flash program runs in your browser and it's dead simple to record a message and then click send and We will get that message in mp3 format to play on the show.

101
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:53,090
Speaker 1: So that's the easiest way now for to send us voicemail is to click on that.

102
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,427
Speaker 1: Send me an Odeo link in the bottom right hand corner of the page.

103
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:01,508
Speaker 0: now Here are rims fantastic hints for how to get us to actually play what you send us.

104
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:01,930
Speaker 0: one.

105
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:05,262
Speaker 0: Keep it less than like four or five minutes.

106
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, four or five minutes is pretty long.

107
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,778
Speaker 1: I mean other podcasts say keep it less than 30 seconds.

108
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, keep it short.

109
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:11,945
Speaker 0: Keep it to the point.

110
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,410
Speaker 0: have something to say.

111
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:17,778
Speaker 1: Don't go Ramble ramble ramble rehearse it a few times.

112
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:26,068
Speaker 1: this thing lets you record, you know a race and then record again So you can keep doing it until you get it right unlike some phone calling things.

113
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:40,385
Speaker 0: now I mean, we've gotten a bunch of long long long audio feedbacks in the recent weeks and We're probably not going to play them anytime soon because stuff like that will probably save for gig night specials when we're you know out of town and we need filler.

114
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:45,669
Speaker 1: or if there's an episode Pertaining to that very thing or if you want to turn the long feedback into an episode itself.

115
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,070
Speaker 0: Yep, and also generally whenever we get a long feedback bear in mind that we're probably going to edit it to hell.

116
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, just just a warning.

117
00:08:53,652 --> 00:09:01,037
Speaker 1: So anyway now for those of you who had a hard time sending us audio feedback Like if we're saying something on the show and you go.

118
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:11,324
Speaker 1: Oh my god those guys go to the go to front crew comm click on the send me an audio link and Start recording whatever your rant is and then when you're done click send

119
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:16,450
Speaker 0: because I worry that We're gonna be in the situation that Penn Jillette is now on his radio show where?

120
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:26,109
Speaker 0: The best funny seemed to have is when people who hated him and disagreed with him and were angry at him would call In mm-hmm, but now the only people who listen to him are people who like him and generally agree with him.

121
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,520
Speaker 0: So I hope some of you disagree with us enough to yell at us.

122
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:35,977
Speaker 1: Yes, but now it's very easy to yell at us and We do have some news.

123
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:36,603
Speaker 0: We have two.

124
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,249
Speaker 0: news is today.

125
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:41,087
Speaker 0: now many of you will be happy that in the news we have in fact two news is.

126
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:52,298
Speaker 0: but first I Gotta say this again because it doesn't seem to be getting through to everyone when we said we're gonna you know cut down on the length of the show a bit and Possibly only do one news every now and then.

127
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:54,646
Speaker 0: I don't mean the show is gonna get short.

128
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:57,965
Speaker 0: the show is still gonna be 45 To 55 minutes like it always has been.

129
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:07,949
Speaker 0: yeah We're just not gonna do 90 minute shows unless we have a really good reason to but it seems like half the emails we get Have been saying please don't make the show really short Please don't oh my god.

130
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:15,861
Speaker 0: And actually even if we cut it down to the minimum we considered cutting it down to It's still longer than it was when geek night started by far.

131
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:30,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, so don't worry We're getting a lot of email about this, so I just wanted to say it again Okay Anyway in the actual news this was going to be a thing of the day But the forum discussion has prompted me to use it otherwise.

132
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,748
Speaker 0: Monopoly that terrible American board game is updating itself.

133
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:41,890
Speaker 0: They are now going to do what Scott and I did when we were little kids for the longest time.

134
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,619
Speaker 0: But now you know I guess the rest of the world's caught up.

135
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:52,320
Speaker 0: instead of using the paper money in the new sets You'll have a debit card and some sort of calculator like thing and all the money will be digital All right.

136
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:56,667
Speaker 0: now I say this is great except that I don't really care about Monopoly.

137
00:10:56,707 --> 00:11:01,790
Speaker 0: the game is Generally a terrible game even though I played it a lot when I was a young kid only because I didn't know better.

138
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:06,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also played it a lot as a young kid because what other board games that I have to choose from.

139
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,259
Speaker 0: well I had a risk and access now.

140
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,657
Speaker 1: I had risk and access and allies and Dinah bones.

141
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:14,350
Speaker 1: yep, I had a dampened fireball island.

142
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,342
Speaker 1: I had a lot of board games that you know other kids didn't have.

143
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:21,377
Speaker 1: that were pretty cool But like free parking that was great.

144
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:22,581
Speaker 1: the Monopoly spin-off.

145
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:24,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a great game.

146
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,493
Speaker 0: now the thing is officer Jones Discussion.

147
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:32,890
Speaker 0: in our forums people seem to be arguing that but the paper money was important or whatever.

148
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:39,664
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna really go into why Monopoly is a broken terrible game Because that that is the purview of another another show entirely.

149
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:43,965
Speaker 0: I could do a whole show on Monopoly Like I could tell you exactly how to give yourself the best chance of winning.

150
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:45,030
Speaker 0: a simple thing could do it.

151
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,880
Speaker 1: I remember everyone knows that it's on the internet.

152
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:48,510
Speaker 0: a monkey could do it.

153
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,029
Speaker 0: You could train a monkey to play Monopoly and win as much as even the best Monopoly player mm-hmm.

154
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:04,850
Speaker 0: but some people were arguing that having the physical money can somehow change the game and That is outright not true other than possibly your own internal psychological things.

155
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,914
Speaker 0: Exactly now their arguments were one that openness.

156
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:13,978
Speaker 0: by having physical money you can see what everyone else has and Basically that comes down to the rules of the game.

157
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:18,014
Speaker 0: if the rules of the game say specifically that money is open Then money is open.

158
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:27,127
Speaker 0: meaning even if you're using a calculator or something if someone asks you how much money you have You have to tell them you are or you just have your calculator sitting wide open on the table.

159
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:28,712
Speaker 1: anyone can look at it In any time.

160
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,178
Speaker 0: yeah, it depends on what the rules say.

161
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:39,912
Speaker 1: you can make a special Monopoly calculator that shows the number Just in bright big LED LCD screen that everyone can see and to I mean the money can be a crutch for some kinds of People.

162
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,350
Speaker 0: the calculator can be a crutch for other kinds of people.

163
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,223
Speaker 0: It's really kind of arbitrary, and it doesn't actually affect the game.

164
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,810
Speaker 1: just affect affect the game.

165
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,161
Speaker 0: It only affects the psychology of people and how you think about the game.

166
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is basically nothing.

167
00:12:53,312 --> 00:13:06,347
Speaker 0: But in the end it just amazes me that every time Monopoly sales wane they can just make some other Monopoly set like Star Wars Monopoly or RIT-opoly and sell a bunch more even though it's the same goddamn game.

168
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:15,899
Speaker 1: yep Okay, my news is there was a Nintendo press release and It was a pretty funky press release.

169
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:23,210
Speaker 1: actually they talked about a lot of the games that are gonna be released Towards the end of this year, and I'm not gonna read the whole thing because you can do that yourself.

170
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,609
Speaker 1: But I'm just gonna go over the main points.

171
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,990
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 5 is coming to the Game Boy Advance on November 6.

172
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,209
Speaker 0: I'm very happy about that even though that is the hardest freaking Final Fantasy ever made.

173
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:43,793
Speaker 1: the touch generations stuff is gonna come out yeah, and Basically starting October 9th.

174
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:56,341
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a new game a DS game released every week the the touch generation the new nintendo dalmatians Magical star sign I don't know what that is Pokemon Ranger.

175
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:57,946
Speaker 1: Okay children of mana.

176
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:02,709
Speaker 1: We're gonna get that Elite beat agents isn't that the beat game?

177
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:07,786
Speaker 1: yeah I think it is Yoshi's Island 2 custom Robo arena and Kirby squeak squad.

178
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,680
Speaker 1: now the last Bit of this press release is the interesting part.

179
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,387
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read this verbatim.

180
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:20,478
Speaker 1: everything I say from now until I say you know otherwise is directly from the Nintendo press release.

181
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:30,168
Speaker 1: all right including that no starting now and For Nintendo GameCube owners the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess will be available for you this fall.

182
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,738
Speaker 1: an Enhanced version also will be a launch title for Wii.

183
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,665
Speaker 1: that will all happen on dot dot dot.

184
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:37,548
Speaker 1: Oh look.

185
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:40,941
Speaker 1: We're out of space God damn it.

186
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:57,088
Speaker 1: now I can't remember what website I saw it on but the guy deduced that Nintendo is hinting that the The release date for Wii and whatever was all coded into this press release.

187
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:57,570
Speaker 1: somehow

188
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,313
Speaker 0: Yeah,

189
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:16,730
Speaker 1: and he said that you know his source at Nintendo kinda sorta wink-winked it and said yeah So his deduction was that the Wii release date is October 2nd because if you look at this release thing table there's a new game every week except for

190
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:18,933
Speaker 0: Except

191
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:21,944
Speaker 1: for the second two weeks in November, which is black.

192
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,035
Speaker 1: whatever Black Friday What do you keep saying?

193
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:34,304
Speaker 1: I just couldn't get past it anyway except for Black Friday and Another week which is past the release of the ps3.

194
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,449
Speaker 1: so it can't be that week.

195
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:39,188
Speaker 1: So he's deduced that the release date for Wii is October 2nd.

196
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,928
Speaker 0: Huh, we'll find out if that's true.

197
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:43,578
Speaker 1: Yes, we will.

198
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:44,204
Speaker 0: I give it a 50/50 shot.

199
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,070
Speaker 1: I think that's the best guess you've had yet looking at these release times.

200
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,498
Speaker 0: But well the thing is as time goes on the number of possible days decreases Pretty much on a day for day basis.

201
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,625
Speaker 1: Well, it has to be a week.

202
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,150
Speaker 1: It's not you know, so there are only.

203
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,269
Speaker 1: It's not like they have a choice of any day in the.

204
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:08,410
Speaker 0: well Yeah, but I mean the time frame is counting down because it's gonna come out before the end of the year.

205
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there what there's.

206
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,100
Speaker 1: there's four weeks.

207
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,650
Speaker 1: It's probably not gonna be in August or September, right?

208
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:19,827
Speaker 1: So if it isn't September so me I guess it could be so you got two weeks at the end of September.

209
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:28,870
Speaker 1: that are possible four weeks of October and like two weeks in November, so If you guessed you got pretty much a one in eight shot of getting it, right?

210
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,684
Speaker 0: I'd say we'd make a geek night's pool, but I don't really care enough.

211
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:32,630
Speaker 1: Hey, that's a good idea.

212
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:33,997
Speaker 0: Well, we could if you want to handle it.

213
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,223
Speaker 0: I'll talk about it.

214
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,630
Speaker 1: No, let's forget it great.

215
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:42,510
Speaker 0: If anyone in the forums wants to run a pool on when the Wii is coming out just put it up in the forums.

216
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:54,094
Speaker 1: Yeah We won't stop you Mm-hmm Even though you know someone else might some legal type person who doesn't know we won't Gamble.

217
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,081
Speaker 0: it's just a pool.

218
00:16:55,363 --> 00:17:02,268
Speaker 0: the amounts of money We're claiming to send to each other's purely fake money where no one's actually going to send anyone any money.

219
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,070
Speaker 0: Okay?

220
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:07,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously Okay, and I don't have it's gonna pay pal each other.

221
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,561
Speaker 1: bits zeros and ones.

222
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,608
Speaker 0: I don't have any illegal mp3s either.

223
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,095
Speaker 0: I don't have any ROMs.

224
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:13,823
Speaker 0: I've never pirated a movie.

225
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,089
Speaker 0: I don't even know what bit torrent is.

226
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:31,510
Speaker 0: Okay, but you just said bit torrent stuff Things of the day which are probably going to stay in the middle of the show due to popular demand.

227
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,952
Speaker 1: Okay.

228
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:33,634
Speaker 0: All right.

229
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:39,870
Speaker 0: So many of you are familiar with Daft Punk, which is one of my favorite bands consisting of two French dudes.

230
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,274
Speaker 1: They are two awesome.

231
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:45,646
Speaker 0: And if you don't know them check out interstellar five five five five.

232
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:46,830
Speaker 0: just google it.

233
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:47,899
Speaker 0: It's a DVD.

234
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:48,767
Speaker 0: buy it and watch it.

235
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:52,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll pretty much give you everything you need to know about Daft Punk.

236
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:58,163
Speaker 0: Yeah Either that or find that old flash video more than ever hour after to River City ransom.

237
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:04,329
Speaker 1: just search for Daft Punk on YouTube or Google video or Google and you'll you'll you'll find everything that's good.

238
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:13,704
Speaker 0: now I use this as a thing of the day Mostly because we've been people have been talking about music bit in the forums and a lot of people have kind of asked what kind Of music we like which is not an easy question to answer at all.

239
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:15,070
Speaker 1: a lot a lot of music.

240
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,210
Speaker 0: Basically, you would have to ask us what music don't we like and even then it's hard for us to name anything.

241
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 1: It would be easier to list the music.

242
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,361
Speaker 1: We don't like than to list the music we do Because there's a lot and there's also a lot of music we don't know about.

243
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:32,260
Speaker 0: so we can't say yeah, but like there aren't Genres of music that we really dislike.

244
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,274
Speaker 0: There are just a lot of very specific things We dislike like.

245
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:43,402
Speaker 0: I don't like most country music, but I like Western music Yeah, and there is some country music straight-up country that I like.

246
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:48,280
Speaker 0: not much but there's some yeah And it's like I really like Western music.

247
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:49,746
Speaker 0: Yeah and honky-tonk.

248
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:52,297
Speaker 1: Yeah God, yeah too much.

249
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,502
Speaker 0: We like everything.

250
00:18:53,543 --> 00:19:00,710
Speaker 0: But anyway, we really like Daft Punk and This is just a really cool interview with them and Leiji Matsumoto's there.

251
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,210
Speaker 0: I don't know how much he talks in the interview because I didn't watch the whole thing.

252
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,955
Speaker 0: It's pretty much just an interview of Daft Punk.

253
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:05,676
Speaker 0: Yep.

254
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:07,622
Speaker 0: It looks like it was done right after they finished.

255
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,266
Speaker 0: interstellar five five five five.

256
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:09,727
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

257
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:24,403
Speaker 1: and see, you know in Daft Punk are two French guys who make all this great music and They never let you see their face in public as a few other bands do Because that way they can still go hang out at clubs and stuff and no one goes.

258
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:25,367
Speaker 1: Oh my god Daft Punk.

259
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:26,069
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

260
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,409
Speaker 0: Now in this interview, it's a video interview.

261
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:32,770
Speaker 0: So the way they did it is they're wearing robot suits and you can't see their faces or their hands.

262
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:43,530
Speaker 1: yep, and It seems like their interview is recorded in a sound studio somewhere else and that they just videotaped them doing a bunch of robot stuff So that you can watch that while you listen to the interview.

263
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:48,710
Speaker 0: I wonder if they did the interview in any way where people could see their faces if they wore some sort of veil.

264
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,630
Speaker 1: I think they let you know, like their agent and you know interview people.

265
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:59,590
Speaker 1: I think they just don't put it anywhere super public or like during a concert or in a music video or an interview on TV.

266
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:00,072
Speaker 0: You know what?

267
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,770
Speaker 0: Here's a bounty that I don't think any of our listeners will fulfill.

268
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:07,657
Speaker 0: If you can get me a picture of the two dudes from Daft Punk I saw a picture on Google Images.

269
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:08,560
Speaker 1: You don't want to bet that.

270
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:09,363
Speaker 0: Really?

271
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:09,865
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,230
Speaker 0: Well, I wasn't gonna bet anything.

273
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,018
Speaker 0: I was gonna bet nothing.

274
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,270
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I saw one on Google Images.

275
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:16,535
Speaker 0: So, you know what those got.

276
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:22,793
Speaker 0: if no one knows what they look like just find a picture of some guy and say it's him Who's gonna know?

277
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:28,153
Speaker 1: I think the point is is that you know, even if you know what they look like It's their faces.

278
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,079
Speaker 1: don't become famous true?

279
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,667
Speaker 1: that way no one walking down the street will recognize.

280
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:33,449
Speaker 0: you know what it's like V.

281
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda they're an idea.

282
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:37,762
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who they are.

283
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:38,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

284
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,170
Speaker 1: They had to be these two awesome French guys.

285
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever gonna make shit music It's not.

286
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:47,973
Speaker 0: at least they're not like the blue man group where if they made a group that because of the way they dress they're completely Interchangeable.

287
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:52,350
Speaker 0: so the band actually has a crazy number of people in it and they do shows all over the place with different groups.

288
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:53,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

289
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:57,730
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is The world's biggest hole.

290
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,139
Speaker 1: That's right the biggest hole.

291
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,370
Speaker 0: I was gonna make some sort of joke and I couldn't come up with anything good.

292
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:07,501
Speaker 0: The only thing I'd think of was the asshole song.

293
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:07,984
Speaker 0: All right, you ready?

294
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:18,899
Speaker 1: It's in Russia Odio Odio, the biggest hole in the world is in Russia the world's biggest hole Actually a diamond mine in eastern Siberia.

295
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,042
Speaker 0: Is it still a diamond mine?

296
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:21,406
Speaker 0: No, so it's just a hole now.

297
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:26,213
Speaker 1: Yes, it's 525 meters deep and 1.25 kilometers in diameter.

298
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:32,690
Speaker 0: Whoa I have a terrible urge to throw a rock into that.

299
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,724
Speaker 1: The hole is so big that it's caught the suction of the holes.

300
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:41,958
Speaker 1: existence has caused several helicopter crashes several.

301
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:49,510
Speaker 1: I Really want to throw a rock in this thing and now it is illegal to fly over the hole.

302
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,030
Speaker 0: Seriously this picture Scott just showed me is pretty freakin amazing.

303
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:57,384
Speaker 1: there's a picture here of a truck that is you that was used to.

304
00:21:57,404 --> 00:22:13,643
Speaker 1: you know, go down and haul up stuff out of the hole and The trucks mighty big and when you look at like the spiraling road that goes down the hole it's Wow, it really puts it in perspective.

305
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:23,337
Speaker 0: Let me just say that Yeah, now I will say that because this was a diamond mine and the fact that Russian diamonds play a big part in what's happened I think it might still be a diamond mine.

306
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,307
Speaker 0: We should do a show about the diamond industry someday.

307
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,210
Speaker 1: Well, that's a good one.

308
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,677
Speaker 0: That's a big show we could do.

309
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:29,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone write that one down.

310
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:34,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah I think this actually might still have diamonds coming out of it.

311
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:37,030
Speaker 0: great You know if it's deep enough.

312
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,156
Speaker 0: I wonder if the amount of gas it takes to drive the diamonds up is worth less than the time it could take and just Make a diamond in Genesis or something.

313
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:47,284
Speaker 1: No, cuz I don't know diamonds aren't worth anything.

314
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,270
Speaker 1: So I know I know anyway.

315
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:52,824
Speaker 1: So today we're gonna talk about Advance Wars.

316
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:53,548
Speaker 0: Yes, we are.

317
00:22:54,032 --> 00:23:03,133
Speaker 0: Advance Wars is a game that well We're not gonna talk about the Japanese releases or anything because we don't know much about the Japanese releases and it's hard to find reliable Information about.

318
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:10,089
Speaker 0: all I know is that it that the what we got as Advance Wars 1. when it was released in Japan Olaf looked like Santa Claus.

319
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a game.

320
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:20,161
Speaker 1: there was a series of games in Japan for an in from Nintendo and I don't know what it was Called but it was basically.

321
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,710
Speaker 1: it's the Advance Wars that we have.

322
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:35,510
Speaker 0: Yes now the games are there a lot like those desert war type game for the old NES and SNES or Trying to think I don't remember what all these games were but games where you have military units that are described very simply.

323
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:46,699
Speaker 0: you know, they have a small number of stats and there's different types and You move them around and fight with another group who has similar units and you try to capture bases destroy units and you know General puzzling military stuff.

324
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:54,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know There's a lot of complicated war games out there with crazy maps and hexagons and all sorts of numbers.

325
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:58,650
Speaker 1: Advance Wars is the same kind of game, but it's way simpler.

326
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,540
Speaker 1: I mean, you've got a school a grid of squares.

327
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:03,367
Speaker 1: all the units are simple.

328
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:07,795
Speaker 1: It's infantry mech guy Tank mechanized infant.

329
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:16,790
Speaker 1: Yeah bigger tank biggest fighter jet even bigger tank bomber battleship Jeep, you know, yep, all that sort of stuff.

330
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:23,430
Speaker 0: And the thing is the way the game plays out is while it's a military kind of you know move units around and fight game.

331
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:31,930
Speaker 0: For the most part unless you're playing against other people or in certain special campaign missions The game is more a puzzle game than a military game.

332
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,237
Speaker 1: It really is a puzzle game.

333
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:35,790
Speaker 0: well at least in the first advance wars.

334
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:41,550
Speaker 1: Well, even in the it's sort of like a puzzle, but it's got like a lenient solution.

335
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,998
Speaker 1: You know how like some some puzzle games it's.

336
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:47,469
Speaker 1: there is one solution you either figure it out or you don't figure it out.

337
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,550
Speaker 1: Advance Wars is more of a puzzle game where there are a lot of slightly different solutions.

338
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,968
Speaker 1: You know one solution might be quicker one might take longer, you know one might.

339
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:04,710
Speaker 1: you know Done really quick, but have a bad score.

340
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,767
Speaker 0: I guess the point I was making is that advance Wars 1 compared to 2 and 2 and there's a progression.

341
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:10,429
Speaker 0: definitely that.

342
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,439
Speaker 0: The early advance Wars game was very very.

343
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:25,432
Speaker 0: there were a few options and the game was very unforgiving especially in the later stages or in the hard campaign where if you made one single mistake or Got to the got to the point where if you moved one unit to the wrong place You lost.

344
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,077
Speaker 0: you would lose the war.

345
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:31,210
Speaker 0: in advance Wars DS the third iteration the game involved to the point to where?

346
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:41,510
Speaker 0: Not only were there usually many multiple different strategies to win But the individual movements of a single troop alone would usually not screw you and you could always still win.

347
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:45,330
Speaker 0: You wouldn't get bowled over just because you put an infantry in the wrong square.

348
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:49,370
Speaker 0: You'd only get bowled over if you made poor tactical decisions on a broader scale.

349
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:57,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game became less of a puzzle game and more of a war game as the series went on But it is still definitely a puzzle oriented game.

350
00:25:57,604 --> 00:25:58,970
Speaker 1: Let's do some informational stuff.

351
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,590
Speaker 1: There are three advance Wars games available in the United States of America.

352
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:10,396
Speaker 0: the first two came out for the Gameboy advanced and they're called advance Wars 1 or advance Wars and Advance Wars 2 black hole rising.

353
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:17,355
Speaker 1: Yep, and the third advance or his game is a DS game, which is advance Wars DS dual strike dual strike.

354
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:21,546
Speaker 1: Yes, they they they were very clever in their DS using.

355
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:30,132
Speaker 0: I know they're puzzle games slash military games and there is also a very Japanese element of instant.

356
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:43,010
Speaker 0: in addition to just having these units you have CEOs or commanding officers and Not only do they all have different powers like if you pick one CEO The all your tanks are stronger if you pick a different CEO or infantry or really badass.

357
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:47,241
Speaker 0: They all have personalities and they all interact with each other.

358
00:26:47,281 --> 00:27:05,049
Speaker 0: and as you play through the campaigns you get to see this more and This is really really brought to the final the furthest extreme It has been yet in advance Wars DS where depending on what characters you use in certain battles You see different bits of plot and there's romance between the CEOs and all sorts of funny stuff that has nothing to do with the game.

359
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:11,170
Speaker 1: yep, and Not only that but every CEO has a special CEO power.

360
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,145
Speaker 0: Yep, and the way the mechanic works is kind of neat.

361
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,104
Speaker 0: I mean you're fighting, you know I've got my tanks and Scott's got his tanks and we're out.

362
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:26,010
Speaker 0: you're battling it out Anytime your units take damage your little CEO power meter goes up and anytime you deal out damage it goes up.

363
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,910
Speaker 0: Also, however, when you take damage it goes up more than twice as fast as you deal out damage.

364
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:38,350
Speaker 1: So if you're losing and you're taking a lot of damage You're gonna get your power more often to sort of help even out the game.

365
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:48,950
Speaker 1: But it doesn't really, you know, it's not really a handicap But it's there, you know, it sort of makes the game last a little bit longer and make it a little bit more interesting.

366
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:56,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean to me the function it serves and I'll preface this and we're not gonna talk about the strategy of the game because That would be another episode or two.

367
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,601
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but I'm not kidding.

368
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:03,181
Speaker 0: when I say that I am freaking amazing at this game I mean you play too much.

369
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:04,550
Speaker 0: I did play too much.

370
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:06,456
Speaker 0: I advance Wars one and two.

371
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:10,209
Speaker 0: I beat every single single mission with an ass and I unlocked everything.

372
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:11,608
Speaker 0: Advance Wars DS.

373
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:17,597
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't unlock everything and beat everything is because a lot of the maps are the same as the maps in advance Wars one and two.

374
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:38,069
Speaker 0: so I just didn't bother with them again Mm-hmm, but I really like I figured out almost everything about this game and it seems to me that the CEO power serve a very critical purpose in that they prevent people from winning by pure dumb luck and They force you to win by winning as opposed to just squeaking by someone and winning on a technicality.

375
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:53,405
Speaker 0: Say I'm beating Scott up a lot and I roll up and I destroy a bunch of his units But I don't have enough units in my supply line to follow through and finish him off Now because I failed to plan and I didn't actually destroy him.

376
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,870
Speaker 0: I just beat him back really bad.

377
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,137
Speaker 0: He gets his CEO power that I didn't get.

378
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:04,721
Speaker 0: he uses that to counter-attack my thinly supported units that are far off in his field Recapture everything and now we're back at square one.

379
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:05,464
Speaker 1: Yep.

380
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:12,770
Speaker 1: The other thing is the The this different CEOs have different lengths in their CEO meter.

381
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 1: So depending on some people have an incredibly powerful CEO power that like destroys everything.

382
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, some people have a power that's kind of weak, you know, none of them are weak like useless But some of them aren't as strong as others.

383
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:33,370
Speaker 1: So the CEOs that have less useful powers get them more often because their meter fills up faster because it's smaller.

384
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:42,029
Speaker 0: There's also a mechanic that for every time you use your CEO power It takes more damage to make it fill up the next time.

385
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:52,394
Speaker 0: So you can't keeper like if you keep getting your CEO power over and over and over and over again Because you're sucking but the other person is also kind of sucking so they can't finish you off They're just beating you back.

386
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:53,259
Speaker 0: Eventually.

387
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,389
Speaker 0: You're not gonna be getting your CEO power so much anymore.

388
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:56,093
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

389
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:58,770
Speaker 0: The game really isn't handicapped in any direction.

390
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,840
Speaker 1: Yep What else is there no about this game?

391
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:04,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the game is very much.

392
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,330
Speaker 0: I mean all the units are very archtypical and very distinct, you know, you have infantry also cute.

393
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:11,240
Speaker 0: Yes, the game is very cute.

394
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:13,190
Speaker 0: But yet it's almost disturbing.

395
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,893
Speaker 0: I mean think of this.

396
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:14,956
Speaker 0: it's war.

397
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:18,670
Speaker 0: you were sending troops against each other to fight and kill and die for you.

398
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:27,278
Speaker 1: There are people taking over cities bombing each other shooting big guns at each other killing people and the CEOs are Oblivious to this because you even meet some.

399
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:29,388
Speaker 0: they're just happy anime characters like some of.

400
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:32,922
Speaker 0: there's a point Which some of the troops are talking to you and they're like and it's just.

401
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:35,212
Speaker 0: it's kind of sad because you're sending them to their Deaths.

402
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:51,089
Speaker 0: but the way the game is like one CEO is marching through a land right and this other CEO will come up and they'll talk and they'll be like I don't know if we can be friends Let's fight first and then they'll fight and kill a whole bunch of people and then they'll decide yeah We can be friends and then they'll march together.

403
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:53,439
Speaker 0: It's just really silly.

404
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,780
Speaker 0: It's real God yeah, but the game itself is not silly at all.

405
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:06,710
Speaker 0: The game is actually an incredibly well-done Tactical and strategic game that has many many levels of strategy.

406
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like how.

407
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:17,093
Speaker 1: it's a turn-based game, which you don't see a lot of these days but it's it really helps out because you know a lot of RTS is and Such the.

408
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:25,060
Speaker 1: the thing that matters most is knowing how to build things in the correct order for speed or clicking quickly And advance or as that's not the case.

409
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:31,030
Speaker 0: Yep, you can actually sit there and think and decide Alright, I need to send infantry to the north to capture those cities.

410
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:38,749
Speaker 0: Well, I have a few mechs to the south on the mountains to hold Scott at bay Long enough for me to save up the money to buy a mega tank and then roll it over and destroy him.

411
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:40,248
Speaker 0: Yep, stuff like that.

412
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:41,793
Speaker 0: now the game.

413
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:52,691
Speaker 0: I mean I said that we said the game is very puzzle oriented but also very tactical strategic and The key element there is that one part of the game is fog of war and I like how the game can be played both Ways.

414
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:56,062
Speaker 0: there are straight-up battles where the entire game is visible.

415
00:31:56,363 --> 00:32:07,269
Speaker 0: You can see every unit you can see everyone's money You can see everything on the screen and when you're playing like that It's more of a puzzle game than anything, you know move my fighter So it's just out of range of his fighter.

416
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:12,689
Speaker 0: move my infantry so we can capture that city and I know that his recon will make it one turn too late.

417
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:33,069
Speaker 0: and In a lot of the campaigns, especially in the advanced campaigns, which I'll talk about a bit in a minute Which are basically these super difficult campaigns after you beat the game itself It'll get to the point where you have to move units to specific locations and it's just a puzzle game of How can I get this infantry through this maze of units to the end before he dies stuff like that?

418
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,999
Speaker 1: Yep Let's talk about the differences into the the three different games.

419
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,350
Speaker 1: the very first advance wars for the GBA was real simple.

420
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,403
Speaker 1: I mean the biggest tank you had was a medium tank.

421
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:45,970
Speaker 0: Well, it still had a lot of units.

422
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,338
Speaker 1: It did still have a lot.

423
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,872
Speaker 1: most of the units in the game were in the first one But there were.

424
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:51,879
Speaker 1: you know, the biggest tank was a medium tank.

425
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:53,284
Speaker 1: There weren't the boats?

426
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,770
Speaker 1: weren't that useful?

427
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:59,674
Speaker 1: they were you know, they didn't have the wide variety of boats and You know, it was Jen.

428
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:00,818
Speaker 1: It was a lot simpler game.

429
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,869
Speaker 1: The maps were a lot smaller and less complex.

430
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,990
Speaker 1: There were a lot less weird things on the maps like in the later advanced.

431
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game was very much a straight-up.

432
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,370
Speaker 0: introduce you to the game.

433
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,310
Speaker 0: In fact before you play the game, there's a tutorial that takes you through a bunch of lessons on how to play the game.

434
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,960
Speaker 0: That's actually very very well done.

435
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,630
Speaker 0: I give a lot of credit to the people who put that together.

436
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:25,605
Speaker 1: Yep, and the game is really doesn't have a lot of different modes.

437
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:33,310
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the campaign There's the war room and has the multiplayer which isn't the most exciting multiplayer in the world.

438
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the campaign itself is good.

439
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:48,627
Speaker 0: It's a great way to learn about advance wars and I've noticed a lot of the people I know who played advance wars DS And had never touched the previous two Didn't really do so well in the game and to this day don't do so well because I don't know.

440
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:53,470
Speaker 0: it's like you learn a Lot of fundamentals playing advance wars 1 also you can get it for like 8 bucks.

441
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,258
Speaker 0: I highly recommend picking it up now.

442
00:33:55,298 --> 00:34:04,850
Speaker 1: advance wars 2 is is sort of like the game that just Improved leaps and bounds ahead of advance wars 1 and is it's pretty much the best you can do with advance wars on the GBA.

443
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,170
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean in advance wars 1 there was a limited number of CEOs and their powers were very generic.

444
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,338
Speaker 0: You know one guy hits really hard.

445
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,529
Speaker 0: one guys in one girl's infantry is really really good.

446
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:18,002
Speaker 0: One guy has really good long range.

447
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:23,224
Speaker 0: one guy is good in the snow and when it snows his weapons things are more powerful and he makes it snow.

448
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:30,389
Speaker 0: yep, and Advance wars 2 added a bunch more CEOs that even the game out quite a bit more.

449
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:45,339
Speaker 1: They there were a lot more subtle strategies a lot more interesting CEOs that were somewhat difficult to use sometimes and they I also added the extra units like the neo tank which is even better than the medium tank and They also added the superpower.

450
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:54,389
Speaker 1: so you know a CEO would have one power But if he wanted to wait even longer he could wait and fill up his meter even more to get an even better power.

451
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:02,282
Speaker 0: Yep, and advance wars 2 overall is an absolutely fantastic game Oh for sure, especially if you compare it to GBA games.

452
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:14,428
Speaker 0: It's probably one of the best GBA games Yes, and in fact I would say that the campaign all things considered in advance wars 2 was my favorite of all three games Mmm in terms of just the fun and the difficulty and the challenge.

453
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:16,458
Speaker 0: see Advance wars DS.

454
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,058
Speaker 0: the campaign was in my opinion Pathetically easy.

455
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,165
Speaker 1: it was pretty easy.

456
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:26,013
Speaker 1: there was one mission I had a little trouble on but then I got through it advance wars 2.

457
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:29,330
Speaker 1: There were some missions that I just couldn't do like the stupid battleships mission.

458
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:32,528
Speaker 0: I could I laugh to you so much because I beat it on my first try?

459
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,959
Speaker 1: yeah But you know it wasn't like a strategy thing.

460
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,270
Speaker 1: It's a puzzle thing, and I just can't solve that damn puzzle.

461
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,536
Speaker 0: Yep, now the thing is advance wars.

462
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:46,859
Speaker 0: all of them have a campaign and then an advanced campaign and once you beat the campaign Which is the single-player game which will take you a long time?

463
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:49,330
Speaker 0: There's a lot of missions even in the first advance wars.

464
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,623
Speaker 0: The advanced campaign is the same thing again only one.

465
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,008
Speaker 0: it's a lot harder, too.

466
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:57,277
Speaker 0: There's a lot less margin for error.

467
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:05,344
Speaker 0: three in a lot of cases some of the maps are completely different And there's different missions and everything and the AI is also more direct and better.

468
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:06,909
Speaker 1: also in advance wars.

469
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,256
Speaker 1: one It's a lot harder to unlock everything.

470
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:13,870
Speaker 1: you have to like use certain CEOs and certain missions and crazy stuff like that.

471
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm starting with two and three.

472
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:15,763
Speaker 0: you just buy them.

473
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:16,690
Speaker 0: you don't have to do anything.

474
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:17,352
Speaker 1: Yeah You know.

475
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:23,904
Speaker 1: and in all the advance horses as you beat things you get money and you can use that money to buy maps And unlock different things.

476
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:28,404
Speaker 1: Advance or is two and three you just use your money to unlock all the characters and shit.

477
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:39,387
Speaker 0: now in terms of difficulty I'll talk about the advance campaign because to give you an example Like the second or third mission in advance wars one the enemy has like a couple of tanks and you have to beat him.

478
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,970
Speaker 0: in The advance campaign is the exact same map and you start with the exact same units.

479
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:50,147
Speaker 0: But now they have like three medium tanks and a pile of tanks and it's like oh my god.

480
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,050
Speaker 0: How do I beat this?

481
00:36:51,910 --> 00:37:07,110
Speaker 0: the advance campaign in advance Wars one was So difficult and so much of a precise puzzle that it got to the point that by the end of it You would literally have to move every single unit in the exact perfect direction every turn or you would die.

482
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,936
Speaker 0: Not that oh now it'll take a long time to win.

483
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,019
Speaker 0: you would die.

484
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,962
Speaker 0: It would be over.

485
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:13,787
Speaker 0: It was so difficult.

486
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,496
Speaker 0: I To this day.

487
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:20,050
Speaker 0: I can't believe I beat it and going back I probably couldn't beat it because I don't have that much patience anymore.

488
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:26,370
Speaker 1: Yep, now advance Wars DS was of course being on the DS leaps and bounds ahead of previous advance Wars.

489
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,501
Speaker 0: They added a million co's they address.

490
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:33,626
Speaker 0: one of the primary complaints people have had about the game Was that in advance Wars one and two?

491
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,286
Speaker 0: Naval units were all but useless and a Navy was never a viable strategy.

492
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:40,430
Speaker 0: They were just not worth it.

493
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:49,090
Speaker 1: it was too expensive and hard to use and Even if you you know built battleships and stuff like submarines just come and destroy them and it was very difficult.

494
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:53,787
Speaker 0: Yep, advance Wars DS added a bunch of extra new Navy unit like

495
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:54,169
Speaker 1: a black

496
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:56,860
Speaker 0: boat Yes or the aircraft carrier

497
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:57,825
Speaker 1: the aircraft carrier

498
00:37:57,946 --> 00:38:06,000
Speaker 0: and it also changed some of the powers of older units to make it so that you could actually have a Navy and Send it out to sea and have naval battles.

499
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:07,950
Speaker 0: and it added a lot to the game in my opinion.

500
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:09,350
Speaker 1: Oh it added a whole lot.

501
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,673
Speaker 1: I mean just the addition.

502
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:16,435
Speaker 1: it used to be that the only reason to have a Navy was to have Battleships at sea that survived.

503
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:22,240
Speaker 1: if you could have Battleships at sea that lived you could use them to rain unholy death upon your opponent.

504
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,503
Speaker 0: Yep, especially if you were grit.

505
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,940
Speaker 1: every other naval unit was simply there to defend battleships or to destroy the enemy's battleship.

506
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,637
Speaker 0: Yep, other than the transport which served only to bring units across water.

507
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:34,340
Speaker 1: Oh, that's correct.

508
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,528
Speaker 1: So yeah also defending the transports.

509
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:43,040
Speaker 1: but now in advance or as DS they added the aircraft carrier Which not only can it airplanes land on it?

510
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,900
Speaker 1: But it can completely destroy any other aircraft within a huge radius.

511
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:55,148
Speaker 1: So the appeal of having battleships and aircraft carriers at sea Actually makes it worth it to build a Navy.

512
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:55,609
Speaker 0: Yes.

513
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,360
Speaker 0: I mean especially in large maps and playing against actual humans instead of the AI.

514
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:11,789
Speaker 0: Very realistic military doctrine is important and very realistic military tactics in terms of you know I want air superiority I build fighters and such and I claim air superiority.

515
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:19,360
Speaker 0: now my bombers can fly around unmolested but to get air superiority I have to spend a lot of money which I could have spent on things like tanks.

516
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:26,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, and with these new units you could shoot for naval superiority, which was just as powerful just like in the real world Mm-hmm.

517
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:32,840
Speaker 1: and naval superiority often also means air superiority because the aircraft carrier is just that dangerous.

518
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,913
Speaker 1: Yes, it's just also that hard and expensive to defend.

519
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,640
Speaker 1: No, we're talking about the strategy again.

520
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:41,653
Speaker 0: Yes Well, I want to get back to at least the way the game flows.

521
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:51,960
Speaker 0: that because before I was talking about the game is a puzzle game and advance Wars 1 was a super puzzle game advance Wars 2 which is a much better game and It's much more tactical especially the advanced campaign.

522
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:58,159
Speaker 0: It's a lot less of this move a unit in a specific direction X pieces per round ago lose and a lot more.

523
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,240
Speaker 0: Think of a strategy to overcome this enemy and you'll succeed.

524
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:07,000
Speaker 0: Advance Wars DS took this one step further and the game is much more tactical in a lot of degrees.

525
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:14,925
Speaker 0: and even if you completely screw up in the single-player game unless the advanced campaign you can probably still win, but I Said fog of war.

526
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:18,100
Speaker 0: the game usually is totally open and you can see all the units.

527
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:22,234
Speaker 0: but sometimes you can play in fog war mode where you can't see everything.

528
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:30,223
Speaker 0: and now visibility and All that plays a bigger role and that makes it played a role in the earlier advance horses But in advance.

529
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:32,351
Speaker 1: where is DS it really actually be?

530
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:39,355
Speaker 0: as something I mean, especially playing against humans It gets to the point where when you're playing with fog of war You can't see what the other person's doing.

531
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:39,999
Speaker 0: all the time.

532
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:45,960
Speaker 0: The game is so much more strategic and tactical and so much more of a realistic military game.

533
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,540
Speaker 0: It's no longer a puzzle because now you have a lot.

534
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:59,088
Speaker 0: I mean you can try things like Secretly constructing a Navy at your rear ports while you have a token defense at the front and then sneaking that Navy around and suddenly Launching a surprise attack on their southern shore.

535
00:40:59,108 --> 00:40:59,570
Speaker 0: Yep.

536
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:00,955
Speaker 0: Awesome stuff like that.

537
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:01,036
Speaker 0: Yep.

538
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:05,455
Speaker 1: Yep The other thing advance or is DS they take a lot of.

539
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,540
Speaker 1: there's a lot more modes.

540
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,980
Speaker 1: There's the combat mode which is sort of like combat for the Atari.

541
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,497
Speaker 0: It's that it's silly and crap silly and crap, but they threw it in the game.

542
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:13,979
Speaker 0: It was fun.

543
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good way to get a lot of points to unlock stuff real quickly.

544
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:23,486
Speaker 1: Yes They also added these survival puzzle modes and things Those are actually like.

545
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,280
Speaker 1: not they're not even like advance or is one where it's a puzzle, but you don't know it.

546
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,872
Speaker 1: This is like here is an advance wars puzzle.

547
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:41,357
Speaker 1: solve it figure out how to do this And they'll give you like two units and put you up on like this crazy map Against a billion enemies and you'll have to figure out how to win in like x-turns.

548
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,522
Speaker 0: It's great fun It.

549
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:45,697
Speaker 1: the puzzle mode is fantastic the survival mode that whole thing.

550
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,079
Speaker 1: I love it.

551
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,800
Speaker 0: Now the one complaint we always had about advanced wars 1 & 2 was that they had a great wealth of multiplayer built into them.

552
00:41:53,282 --> 00:42:06,500
Speaker 0: multiplayer advanced wars is a wonderful wonderful experience, but Playing multiplayer games on the GBA Was utter hell with those tiny ass little cables and you basically have pictures of us at the shore doing this.

553
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 0: We're all hunched around in a circle.

554
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,294
Speaker 0: If anyone sneezes or bumps their cable the game crashes and it was just miserable.

555
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:15,180
Speaker 1: the DS has the wireless.

556
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,613
Speaker 0: Oh my god The day is saved.

557
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,709
Speaker 0: playing wireless advanced wars at the shore was one of the.

558
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:26,990
Speaker 0: that was the moment when the DS moved from a Wonderful gaming system to my primary gaming system.

559
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:27,913
Speaker 1: Yep.

560
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,140
Speaker 1: Well, they also added the dual strike.

561
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,498
Speaker 1: so instead of having just one commanding officer you have two and you can swap them back and forth.

562
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,513
Speaker 0: which Kind of it has pros and cons.

563
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:41,940
Speaker 1: You can turn it off in the game You can you can just play with one CEO if you want.

564
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,940
Speaker 0: But again, it adds a lot more depth of strategy and depth of tactics to the game.

565
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:47,504
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean you before.

566
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:51,435
Speaker 1: you could just choose the guy who's good with infantry and then that would be it.

567
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:55,800
Speaker 1: if you have two CEOs You can take the guy who's good with infantry and the guy who's good with tanks.

568
00:42:56,241 --> 00:43:02,990
Speaker 1: So early game you bring out your infantry which are cheap and then you save up your money doing that and then you switch to Tanks and you're still good.

569
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,716
Speaker 1: You don't suck now.

570
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:07,300
Speaker 1: and There's also the dual strike powers.

571
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:16,689
Speaker 1: Or if you fill up the meters on both of your CEOs not only to both of them use their incredibly superpowers But you take two turns which is insane.

572
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,540
Speaker 1: It's actually it's super insane and it can turn the whole game around.

573
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:24,753
Speaker 0: Now I guess in conclusion I really I mean we've kind of reviewed the games.

574
00:43:25,054 --> 00:43:29,800
Speaker 0: we're gonna do an episode someday now This will be way out in the future Because we're in no hurry to do this.

575
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,179
Speaker 0: we could do this any time about how to actually be good at advanced wars and all the strategies they're in.

576
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:44,314
Speaker 0: but For now if any of you have a DS or just bought one or a DS lite or even if you just have a GBA Yeah, and you need a game by any and all advanced wars games.

577
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,218
Speaker 0: You can get your hands on.

578
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:48,359
Speaker 0: they're Absolutely fantastic and they're well worth the money.

579
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:52,472
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean advanced wars is sort of like this sleeper hit too.

580
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:54,920
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it wasn't widely advertised.

581
00:43:55,283 --> 00:43:57,579
Speaker 0: In fact, I poo-pooed it when I first heard about it.

582
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:58,664
Speaker 1: I didn't poo-poo it.

583
00:43:58,885 --> 00:43:59,748
Speaker 0: I and Scott had it.

584
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:03,868
Speaker 0: cuz I didn't have a GBA and I saw it and him and Luke and all Them were really playing the effect.

585
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:04,573
Speaker 0: God.

586
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:07,646
Speaker 0: We have a story To make a long story short.

587
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:15,697
Speaker 0: one of our friends prac pretty much failed out of graduate school Because he was playing advanced wars trying to beat advanced Wars ones advanced campaign.

588
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:18,404
Speaker 1: Yep That's a true story.

589
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:18,766
Speaker 1: Yes.

590
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:23,581
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah the was I saying I Don't know.

591
00:44:24,063 --> 00:44:25,288
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

592
00:44:25,348 --> 00:44:26,131
Speaker 1: It was a sleeper hit.

593
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:32,280
Speaker 1: it wasn't advertised widely It wasn't very well known but it sold a shit ton of copies

594
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:42,860
Speaker 0: Yep, and I put kind of poo-pooed it and then I got a D or a GBA the platinum one for my parents for Christmas Which I was very happy with and I saw advanced Wars one for sale used for like eight bucks.

595
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:53,259
Speaker 0: So I bought it and the game was amazing and within a couple of weeks I'd beaten the whole thing and then within another couple weeks I'd beaten the advanced campaign and then it wasn't too long after that that advanced Wars two came out.

596
00:44:54,196 --> 00:45:04,391
Speaker 1: Yeah so the reason I think I decided the I came up with the idea to an advance or his episode now is well a because Rim has been playing it again recently Yep, partly because I I just needed some stuff to kill time.

597
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:10,614
Speaker 0: now that I'm actually doing stuff at work I needed some downtime with my brain to work on something logical.

598
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:18,582
Speaker 1: Yep, and B. You know advanced Wars one came out and as soon as it started to fade advanced Wars two came out It started to fade.

599
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:24,921
Speaker 1: advanced or as DS came out started to fade and now, you know advanced swords is sort of disappeared from the public View.

600
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:25,684
Speaker 1: so I gave it.

601
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,994
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it a little boost until advanced or as ds2 comes out.

602
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:36,896
Speaker 1: Yeah or advanced or as we There is an advanced Wars kind of an advanced Wars game for the game.

603
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:38,020
Speaker 0: to what battalion war?

604
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't buy that now.

605
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:45,797
Speaker 0: Well, if you see it for like five bucks pick it up, I guess You know, there are very few GameCube games that aren't worth a couple bucks.

606
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:49,092
Speaker 0: That's true But it's as our friend Scott Johnson could tell you.

607
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:50,780
Speaker 0: he has every freaking game ever.

608
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's.

609
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,955
Speaker 1: it's a bad game from what I hear.

610
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:55,000
Speaker 1: It doesn't have anything.

611
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:58,854
Speaker 1: I mean it kind of has something to do with advanced Wars, but not really.

612
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:02,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so Yeah, don't that doesn't count.

613
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:05,457
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying as a final challenge to all of you out there.

614
00:46:05,477 --> 00:46:12,100
Speaker 0: I defy Anyone in our forums to consistently beat me at advanced wars.

615
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:13,743
Speaker 1: Too bad.

616
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:14,669
Speaker 1: It doesn't have Wi-Fi.

617
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,720
Speaker 1: That's I know that'll be in the next verse.

618
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:22,674
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if advanced war said Wi-Fi speaking of which we said way back We were gonna try to organize some sort of DS Wi-Fi gaming night.

619
00:46:22,714 --> 00:46:23,418
Speaker 0: I think we should do that.

620
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,069
Speaker 1: sometimes Everyone forgot about it.

621
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:25,573
Speaker 1: What's wrong with?

622
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:26,539
Speaker 0: because I want to do it.

623
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:30,630
Speaker 1: It's all you all right.

624
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:37,253
Speaker 0: sometime probably after Otacon I'm going to try to organize some sort of night where we'll all play a DS game.

625
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,720
Speaker 0: Hopefully Mario Kart Tetris man Tetris.

626
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tetris is easier.

627
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,029
Speaker 0: But Mario Kart is awesome.
