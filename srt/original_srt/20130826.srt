1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,307
Speaker 1: It's Monday, August 26th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:10,508
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:13,920
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,570
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,100
Speaker 1: Tonight, online gambling.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,398
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,820
Speaker 1: So I got a little bit of a conundrum.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,465
Speaker 1: Okay.

9
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,128
Speaker 1: I got a Sprint cell phone.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,000
Speaker 1: You know, 4G works pretty great.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,720
Speaker 1: Unlimited data with the old grandfather Sprint plans that are awesome.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,299
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they still have unlimited data.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,127
Speaker 1: They may or may not.

14
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:36,410
Speaker 1: I don't know.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,200
Speaker 1: Mine's just super cheap.

16
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,172
Speaker 1: But my trouble is it's not LTE 4G.

17
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:41,613
Speaker 1: It's WiMAX 4G.

18
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:48,360
Speaker 1: And WiMAX is slowly disappearing.

19
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:55,540
Speaker 1: So I don't have a lot of options here because all modern cell phones that are on iPhones suck.

20
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,020
Speaker 1: And I do own a Nexus 4, which is a great phone.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,376
Speaker 1: It's Pentaband, GSM, just with SIM cards for travel.

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 1: Like I use it for work.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,700
Speaker 0: It's gigantic.

24
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,633
Speaker 1: It's huge, but it's also not 4G.

25
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:10,292
Speaker 0: Now, Conrad- I was in Nexus 4, not 4G.

26
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:11,748
Speaker 1: It's not 4G.

27
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,579
Speaker 1: That's why it's cheap.

28
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,260
Speaker 0: Google Nexus 4.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,320
Speaker 1: It's not 4G, Scott.

30
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:15,936
Speaker 0: What?

31
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,133
Speaker 1: A lot of smartphones are not 4G, you realize.

32
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,700
Speaker 1: Even ones that are coming out now.

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,926
Speaker 0: That's incredible.

34
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:22,493
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,426
Speaker 1: Because people don't care about it.

36
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,959
Speaker 1: Only super nerds care about it.

37
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:29,040
Speaker 1: And the Nexus 4 is super cheap.

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,039
Speaker 1: Now, there is the fact that it does have the chips in it to do 4G.

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,420
Speaker 1: But it does not supposedly have the antenna required to do it fully.

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,332
Speaker 1: Our friend Conistrad did one of the hacks.

41
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,220
Speaker 1: Radio fuckery to enable it.

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,920
Speaker 0: And it seems to work fine.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,048
Speaker 0: Wow, it really isn't 4G.

44
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:47,793
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

45
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:50,079
Speaker 0: that the top of the line Android phone- I can't believe you didn't know that.

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,640
Speaker 1: The top of the line Android phone- 4G does not exist in most places, Scott.

47
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,620
Speaker 1: It is not a concern for most people.

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,152
Speaker 0: What about the Galaxy Express 4?

49
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,180
Speaker 0: Isn't it the same damn thing?

50
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,640
Speaker 0: The Galaxy Express 4?

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
Speaker 0: Isn't it almost the same phone?

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,119
Speaker 1: I heard the 3.9 was really fast.

53
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,900
Speaker 1: It only has 4G capabilities, possibly, because they use a generic chip that has the 4G stuff in it.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,320
Speaker 1: It doesn't have the right antenna.

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,600
Speaker 1: There's tons of ways to enable that radio if you fuck around.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,800
Speaker 0: But it doesn't have the right antenna.

57
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,260
Speaker 1: But it works fine according to Conrad.

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,040
Speaker 1: So I'm waiting for him to let me know the fullness because it works fine.

59
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:28,200
Speaker 1: He enabled 4G, as many people on the internet have.

60
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:33,480
Speaker 1: But I've read numerous reports that its signal strength is not that great.

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,719
Speaker 1: And as a result, it ends up using more battery.

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,060
Speaker 0: Well, it's gonna do that anyway.

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,900
Speaker 1: But more battery than it should.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,120
Speaker 1: So I'm waiting to see if there's any confirmation.

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,930
Speaker 0: Is there some sort of case you could put on it.

66
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,117
Speaker 0: that would be an antenna?

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Speaker 1: Maybe two, but I have not found any hobbyist that did anything like that.

68
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,300
Speaker 0: You have tons of money, Vice President.

69
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,658
Speaker 0: Why don't you just go get a Samsung Galaxy S whatever that has 4G?

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940
Speaker 1: Because then I'll own three perfectly good smartphones.

71
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,817
Speaker 0: Sell the other ones.

72
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,438
Speaker 1: They're not worth that much.

73
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:03,160
Speaker 0: They're worth more than zero.

74
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,140
Speaker 1: The reason I have the Nexus 4 is because it's pentaband and it works overseas great.

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,119
Speaker 1: Like in Australia, it was stupidly fast.

76
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,700
Speaker 1: Despite not being 4G because of the HSPA+, whatever.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,140
Speaker 1: But my conundrum is not really phone because the 4G thing doesn't matter that much.

78
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,519
Speaker 1: 3G is also stupid fast for what I use a phone for.

79
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:29,500
Speaker 1: My problem is if I want to have just one device, I can either go with AT&T, which I figured would be expensive.

80
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:30,900
Speaker 0: It's way more expensive.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,480
Speaker 1: It's ridiculously expensive.

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Speaker 1: I'd be looking at 90 bucks before tax and fees and whatever minimum.

83
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,959
Speaker 0: That's what I'm paying.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,600
Speaker 1: Or you could go T-Mobile and that's great, except it won't fucking work at conventions if experience is any indicator.

85
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,345
Speaker 0: I don't know.

86
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,360
Speaker 0: I haven't seen people.

87
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:50,800
Speaker 0: People sort of get the idea that T-Mobile is smaller network, whatever.

88
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,020
Speaker 0: I know people using it and not having any problems.

89
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,700
Speaker 1: I do too and that's not the impression I get.

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,720
Speaker 1: The impression I get is that its coverage is fine, but at events like conventions where there's tons of people.

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,060
Speaker 0: Who have you met at a convention where T-Mobile is having a problem?

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Speaker 0: Bunch of our listeners.

93
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,717
Speaker 1: They'll always be hanging around like by Pony Ops and they'll be like, "Man, I can't get any

94
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:09,099
Speaker 1: signal.".

95
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,900
Speaker 1: And I'm sitting here with my non-T-Mobile with four bars of full data.

96
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,738
Speaker 0: I've never seen that.

97
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,200
Speaker 1: I've run into that frequently.

98
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,339
Speaker 0: I don't think you'll have a problem.

99
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,499
Speaker 1: I think you just don't pay attention to people who are around you saying things.

100
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:22,240
Speaker 0: Listen, it's not a problem.

101
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
Speaker 0: You're not going to the middle of nowhere.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,560
Speaker 1: That's not what the complaint ever was.

103
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,978
Speaker 1: The complaint that I see...

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,180
Speaker 0: None of the networks really always work when there's a ton of people around.

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,880
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but in my experience, every time some listener's been hanging around us...

106
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Speaker 0: So you're just going to make a decision based on random anecdotal evidence?

107
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,759
Speaker 1: I haven't made a decision yet.

108
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,020
Speaker 1: I'm saying that is the anecdotal evidence I have.

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,580
Speaker 1: That people with T-Mobile seem to have more problems at the conventions I am at where I simultaneously do not have problems.

110
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,320
Speaker 0: I've seen most people having problems at conventions who do not have T-Mobile because there's more people on those other networks and there's less people on T-Mobile.

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
Speaker 0: So there's less clogging them up on those frequencies.

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,300
Speaker 1: But T-Mobile might not have as much coverage in these areas.

113
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,120
Speaker 0: They have coverage in every major populated place.

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,620
Speaker 0: They only don't have coverage in the states.

115
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,640
Speaker 1: Coverage and as much coverage are not the same thing.

116
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,760
Speaker 0: They have plenty.

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,831
Speaker 0: My co-workers have T-Mobile.

118
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,780
Speaker 0: They basically have no problems.

119
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,847
Speaker 0: They don't even have the voice plan.

120
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,460
Speaker 0: They're just using data in Google Voice.

121
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,520
Speaker 0: And they have no issues whatsoever.

122
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,440
Speaker 0: They're getting the full signal pretty much everywhere.

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:31,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the biggest problem is if I drop Sprint to go with T-Mobile or AT&T, I lose my direct Google Voice integration.

124
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:32,339
Speaker 0: Wah wah.

125
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,320
Speaker 1: Because that was great and existed and basically is not offered and does not exist anymore.

126
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,920
Speaker 1: So if I ever leave my current plan, that's gone forever.

127
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:52,080
Speaker 1: And I've got to tell you, it's pretty great to have my actual phone number ring all my phones at the same time and my computers and have spam filtering for phone calls and have transcription of all my voicemails in Google.

128
00:05:53,342 --> 00:06:01,200
Speaker 1: If I give that up, then I've got to start giving people my Google Voice number, which has the delay, or my main number, which will use T-Mobile's or AT&T's voicemail.

129
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,140
Speaker 0: I would just go get a 4G Android phone.

130
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,820
Speaker 1: That doesn't solve my problem of Google Voice Direct.

131
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,720
Speaker 0: And use it with your Sprint.

132
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:15,320
Speaker 1: The point is that if I buy a new phone, I want one phone that I use everywhere.

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,480
Speaker 0: Right, so you get a Sprint phone.

134
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,661
Speaker 1: Sprint?

135
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,712
Speaker 1: I can't, what, a Sprint phone.

136
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,060
Speaker 1: A CDMA phone.

137
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get a Sprint, a world phone from Sprint.

138
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sprint's world phones suck fucking ass.

139
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,108
Speaker 0: Let's see what they have.

140
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,200
Speaker 0: They have the HTC One.

141
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:29,594
Speaker 1: Yep.

142
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,181
Speaker 0: Samsung Galaxy S, 3 and 4.

143
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:33,245
Speaker 0: Yep.

144
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:35,500
Speaker 0: And iPhones.

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,900
Speaker 0: I guess you can get the HTC Evo, you don't want that one.

146
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,518
Speaker 0: Alright, so you can get the HTC One or the Galaxy S4.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, so those are unlocked, out of the box, and 4G, and work on GSM and CDMA.

148
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,217
Speaker 0: I'm sure they do.

149
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:58,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, I've got to decide what to do, because my old Nexus S is starting to have a few issues.

150
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,780
Speaker 1: Battery's not lasting that long anymore, and buying a new battery costs enough to where I wouldn't even bother.

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,620
Speaker 1: I was getting a new phone.

152
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,580
Speaker 1: And it's actually starting to be super slow now that Google updated its hangouts.

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,451
Speaker 0: Okay.

154
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:12,120
Speaker 1: Okay.

155
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,480
Speaker 1: You have a shitty iPhone, so you don't have any opinion on this.

156
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,299
Speaker 0: You mean I have no problems because I have a great iPhone?

157
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,540
Speaker 1: You mean your iPhone doesn't work with Google Glass?

158
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,072
Speaker 0: That's not iPhone's fault.

159
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,180
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with the iPhone.

160
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,060
Speaker 1: Ah, but the fact remains.

161
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,636
Speaker 0: The beta Google Glass does not do everything?

162
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, no kidding.

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it doesn't do the most basic thing, the GPS thing, the primary thing.

164
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,860
Speaker 0: The Google Glass doesn't even work with the Google apps, even though they just said that they're working on it.

165
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,031
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:36,085
Speaker 0: All right?

167
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, the beta thing.

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,060
Speaker 1: But I wonder when you'll get GPS, because that's kind of a killer app for that thing.

169
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,800
Speaker 0: Probably after iOS 7 comes out and fixes Bluetooth.

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,462
Speaker 1: Maybe.

171
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:46,971
Speaker 1: Maybe.

172
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,360
Speaker 1: Anyway, got any news?

173
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,744
Speaker 0: Almost definitely.

174
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:50,587
Speaker 0: I do have news.

175
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:54,420
Speaker 0: Something that nerds have been waiting for for a long time finally happened.

176
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:07,919
Speaker 0: Stevie B, and not the one you're thinking of, the tech one, not the anime cel-drawn one, has said that within 12 months he's going to retire pretty much as soon as they find someone to replace him.

177
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,160
Speaker 0: So, of course, you know, the whole true story never really comes out in any sort of confirmed way.

178
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,524
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.

179
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,140
Speaker 1: What has Microsoft done recently?

180
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,380
Speaker 1: The Windows phone kind of didn't go anywhere.

181
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:24,680
Speaker 1: The Windows 8, wildly hated, as opposed to Windows 7, which was widely loved.

182
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:33,460
Speaker 0: Supposedly the straw that broke the camel's back, so they say, is the $900 million write-off for the failed Windows RT tablets.

183
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,014
Speaker 0: Even though the Surface Pro is good, the Surface RT went.

184
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,100
Speaker 0: pfft, right?

185
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,558
Speaker 0: And they're trying to sell off the Surface RTs at low prices to schools and stuff just to get rid of them.

186
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:43,839
Speaker 0: And to get some amount of money back.

187
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,860
Speaker 0: Because no one wants your shitty tablet that really sucks and doesn't do anything.

188
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,779
Speaker 0: We like the one that actually runs Windows and is for reals.

189
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,360
Speaker 1: That's what I run into a lot with tablets in general.

190
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,227
Speaker 1: For example, Emily's tablet, right?

191
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,694
Speaker 1: It's an actual laptop.

192
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,000
Speaker 1: It's just a tablet form factor.

193
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:00,800
Speaker 1: It's a full-on computer.

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,691
Speaker 1: And a lot of apps try to be like, "Oh, I see you're running a tablet.

195
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,198
Speaker 1: Let me give you my bullshit tablet version of X, Y, and

196
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:08,238
Speaker 1: Z.".

197
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, well, I would like that if your bullshit tablet version was actually fucking good.

198
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,420
Speaker 1: Or if I'm actually on a shitty tablet.

199
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:16,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm not.

200
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,480
Speaker 0: I'm on a for reals tablet.

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Speaker 1: And I think tablet-level shit OSs really don't need to exist in the long run.

202
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,360
Speaker 1: Tablet will just be a form factor for a computer.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,830
Speaker 0: But look, the iPad, right?

204
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,040
Speaker 0: It's like no one's complaining.

205
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,954
Speaker 0: You know, the iPad is basically the same thing as the Surface RT.

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,000
Speaker 0: It's a limited tablet.

207
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,356
Speaker 0: The thing is, an iPad app on the iPad is not some shitty version you don't want.

208
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,660
Speaker 0: It's actually good.

209
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,903
Speaker 1: I think it's more subtle than that.

210
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:52,100
Speaker 1: If you're going to use an iPad, the limited device, Apple kind of wins in the limited interface arena right now.

211
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:57,719
Speaker 1: If you want an interface that's simple and mostly just works, Apple's pretty much got it down.

212
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:15,469
Speaker 0: It's really just, with the Surface RT, if you get these apps trying to run in a tablet mode, but they're actually full apps and they're trying to make their user... It's not like a simple website.

213
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,518
Speaker 0: Notice only the really simple websites can be responsive.

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,379
Speaker 0: Any website that actually has a lot going on can't really do that.

215
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,304
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

216
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,720
Speaker 0: You have an app like Photoshop and you try to make a tablet interface for it.

217
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,803
Speaker 0: It's like,

218
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:30,043
Speaker 0: "Eh.".

219
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,512
Speaker 0: That's why they have Photoshop Touch, which is completely different.

220
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:34,394
Speaker 0: I have it on my iPhone.

221
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,256
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

222
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:36,660
Speaker 0: Anyway...

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,700
Speaker 1: In general, people seem very happy about him leaving and it seems like the market's also very happy.

224
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,691
Speaker 0: People don't know the history necessarily.

225
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 0: They might know developers, developers, right?

226
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:57,900
Speaker 0: Basically, when Microsoft started, it was Bill Gates and then shortly after, one of the earliest people they brought on was Steve Vollmer and he was the sales guy.

227
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,122
Speaker 0: He wasn't a tech guy.

228
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,365
Speaker 0: He was the sales guy.

229
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:05,096
Speaker 0: You can even go on YouTube and see videos of him in commercials trying to sell Windows in the '80s and the '90s.

230
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:07,924
Speaker 0: That's what he did.

231
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,500
Speaker 0: He was a salesman and he was in second in command after Bill Gates, the tech guy.

232
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,315
Speaker 0: Then Bill Gates retired, he came up and was the number one guy.

233
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,520
Speaker 0: He went from number one guy being a tech guy.

234
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,780
Speaker 1: He also apparently has the Legion of Honor for real.

235
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:21,483
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:26,840
Speaker 0: He went from number one guy being the tech guy to number one guy being the sales guy.

237
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:30,012
Speaker 0: He did what sales guy does, right?

238
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,359
Speaker 0: He didn't do what tech guy would do.

239
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:37,552
Speaker 0: Even though he did some good things, the net effect was not so good.

240
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,580
Speaker 0: Some of it was his fault and some of it wasn't his fault.

241
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:47,380
Speaker 1: Part of your job as a CEO is basically to where you make it all your fault.

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,064
Speaker 1: You're kind of the escape hatch.

243
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,789
Speaker 1: The company's going in a bad direction.

244
00:11:52,331 --> 00:12:03,980
Speaker 1: Even if you weren't the one actually making it go in that direction, your job is to step down to tell the world, "Yes, we're changing direction," even if you had nothing to do with it in the first place.

245
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:07,287
Speaker 0: It's like he was there for a long-ass time, first of all.

246
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:13,060
Speaker 0: Another thing is that they recently had a reorganization which sort of fixed some of their problems.

247
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:20,978
Speaker 0: Someone wrote an article and it was like, "Bomber looked around the room after the reorg and realized he was the only old fogey

248
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:21,279
Speaker 0: left.".

249
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,255
Speaker 0: And was like, "Oh, well

250
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:23,457
Speaker 0: then.".

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see what happens because regardless of the personal stuff with Bulmer, it signals that Microsoft is trying to change some direction towards something different.

252
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,324
Speaker 1: We don't know exactly what.

253
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,640
Speaker 1: I'll bet they're going to back off of the Windows 8 direction they've been going.

254
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:42,477
Speaker 0: Probably.

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,620
Speaker 1: I'll bet they're going to back off on tablets and I bet they're going to try to do something different.

256
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,039
Speaker 0: I can't really guess what they'll do though.

257
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,559
Speaker 0: I mean, I tried to think like, "Man, if I was like CEO of Sony, I could do so much awesome

258
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:54,800
Speaker 0: shit.".

259
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,189
Speaker 0: But if I was CEO of Microsoft, it's like, "What could I do?

260
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,399
Speaker 0: that would be an obvious move that would make a ton of

261
00:12:59,419 --> 00:12:59,599
Speaker 0: money?".

262
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,280
Speaker 0: So make Windows like 20 bucks or 10 bucks.

263
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:12,040
Speaker 1: I would go after making Windows be what it's good at, as in being the desktop operating system for every company in the world.

264
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:12,721
Speaker 0: Obviously.

265
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:16,460
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I'm talking about you can't just become the business only, right?

266
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,835
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's the first thing I do because right now there's still the problem of old companies remain using Windows XP to this day for various reasons.

267
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,060
Speaker 0: We've talked about that problem before.

268
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would do something to get them to upgrade.

269
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,282
Speaker 0: Definitely.

270
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:39,340
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you have to keep that business market going and you have to keep working at it to make even more money on it, but you can't abandon the consumer business.

271
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,399
Speaker 1: Well, we know what happens if you do that, BlackBerry.

272
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,667
Speaker 0: IBM.

273
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:42,972
Speaker 1: IBM.

274
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:43,440
Speaker 1: IBM BlackBerry.

275
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,083
Speaker 0: Right.

276
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,540
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's like, what could I do a Microsoft to get the consumer business back?

277
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:48,941
Speaker 0: Right.

278
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:53,599
Speaker 0: Well, I would make, you know, we do the obvious thing where Xbox games just run on the PC, vice versa.

279
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,440
Speaker 1: Ah, but that's stealing from Peter to pay Paul.

280
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,959
Speaker 0: That's not a problem.

281
00:13:58,622 --> 00:13:59,566
Speaker 1: It is for Microsoft.

282
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,120
Speaker 1: As soon as you're cannibalizing part of sales from one side to go after another side.

283
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,406
Speaker 0: The Xbox is such a tiny percent.

284
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,180
Speaker 0: Those graphs showing like the amount of revenue for Microsoft.

285
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,945
Speaker 0: The Xbox doesn't even chart.

286
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:09,547
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,037
Speaker 0: Compared to the other things Microsoft makes money from.

288
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:12,840
Speaker 0: So it doesn't even matter.

289
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,628
Speaker 0: You need to increase the pie.

290
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:19,780
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter which, you know, if you sell more Windows is or if you sell more Xbox.

291
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,537
Speaker 1: But simultaneously, they just killed Windows games in a general sense.

292
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:25,320
Speaker 1: Games for Windows Live.

293
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:25,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

294
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,340
Speaker 1: They haven't replaced it with anything.

295
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,753
Speaker 0: Well, you got to get Xbox One, the actual real Xbox Live.

296
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,179
Speaker 0: You have to get on the PC.

297
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:32,856
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,063
Speaker 0: Right.

299
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:37,819
Speaker 0: You know, maybe you could, you know, partner with Valve instead of competing with them.

300
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,140
Speaker 0: I don't know.

301
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:51,460
Speaker 1: That is, I believe there are Geek Nights episodes from years ago where I said that the real way to win is for Microsoft and Valve to team the fuck up and just have PC gaming and console gaming locked.

302
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,841
Speaker 0: Yep.

303
00:14:52,861 --> 00:15:01,780
Speaker 0: And sure, there's something they could do if they actually teamed up and, you know, even if they were like, you know, Valve, look, we'll do whatever is beneficial to make your shit whatever you want.

304
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:11,900
Speaker 0: As long as, you know, the only benefit we're going to get from it is the fact that tons of people are going to want to install the newest Windows or whatever, you know, for 10 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever, you know.

305
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,171
Speaker 0: Office for normal people, 20 bucks.

306
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,262
Speaker 0: Business, $1,000.

307
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:16,413
Speaker 0: Yep.

308
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,733
Speaker 0: I guess SQL Server, you're just some guy in your house, free.

309
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 0: You're a company, a million dollars.

310
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,620
Speaker 0: Right.

311
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,142
Speaker 0: Same one.

312
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,666
Speaker 0: None of these different versions of shit.

313
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:30,297
Speaker 0: with this express and, you know, Visual Studio, oh, you're just some kid, free.

314
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,420
Speaker 0: The whole thing for reals.

315
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:33,472
Speaker 0: Oh, you're a company, million dollars.

316
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:34,096
Speaker 0: Right.

317
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:34,759
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

318
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,209
Speaker 1: You know, Unity does something similar with their licensing.

319
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,520
Speaker 1: Below a certain level, you basically don't have to pay.

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,101
Speaker 0: Yep.

321
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,086
Speaker 0: But Microsoft does it with.

322
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,795
Speaker 0: like all this, you know, this DRM and like, oh, you get Visual Studio Express for free.

323
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:46,978
Speaker 0: It's like, wah wah.

324
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:47,960
Speaker 0: It does not compute.

325
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:48,791
Speaker 1: It works OK.

326
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:49,198
Speaker 0: I use it.

327
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not.

328
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:54,780
Speaker 0: You know, if you want to do something for reals, it's missing like the one bit you really need.

329
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,124
Speaker 0: You know, I'd be like, well, you get the one bit.

330
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:02,655
Speaker 0: And then if companies try to, you know, use the express one, it's like, well, we'll fucking know.

331
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:03,376
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,398
Speaker 0: And then we'll get you.

333
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,420
Speaker 0: Anyway.

334
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,550
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I got a really brief news here.

335
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,900
Speaker 1: So Chromecast, according to...

336
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,999
Speaker 0: That's that thing, the USB, the HDMI thing you plug into your TV.

337
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,427
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Speaker 0: It's sort of like an Apple TV for Android, Chrome, whatever.

339
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,722
Speaker 1: You know what it is?

340
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:27,180
Speaker 1: It's one more failed monument to the never ending stream of people who try to make the set top box.

341
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,087
Speaker 0: You know, Google TV?

342
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,200
Speaker 0: What happened to that shit?

343
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,983
Speaker 1: Apple TV.

344
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,832
Speaker 1: It's multiple iterations.

345
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 1: I still don't know anyone who uses Apple TV.

346
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,948
Speaker 0: I know a few people use it, but basically they're people who are like all in on Apple.

347
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:37,991
Speaker 0: Like they buy people.

348
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,540
Speaker 0: Anyone who buys TV and movies on iTunes and stuff is using Apple TV.

349
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,999
Speaker 0: Because then what you can do is you sit there with your iPad, you tap on a movie and it plays on your TV.

350
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,377
Speaker 1: Now that is a killer app, having the...

351
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,879
Speaker 0: If you're all in on Apple.

352
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, the multi-device integration of your phone, computer, TV, refrigerator, vibrator, all interact with each other live all the time.

353
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,283
Speaker 1: And you just pass things back and forth.

354
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,170
Speaker 1: But, so Google breaks.

355
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,400
Speaker 1: Chromecast's ability to play local content was the headline.

356
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,333
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

357
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:16,319
Speaker 1: The real headline should be journalists don't know how private, unpublished APIs work.

358
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:24,114
Speaker 1: So there is an unpublished non-production API that is being changed.

359
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:27,099
Speaker 1: It's not to be used for production apps for Google Chromecast yet.

360
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,620
Speaker 1: And people have made devices, or not really devices, they made software that will stream your local content to Chromecast.

361
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,060
Speaker 1: Because everyone has their little NAS.

362
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,880
Speaker 0: The same way that people hack the Apple TV.

363
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:44,760
Speaker 1: Everyone has a NAS with like 100 terabytes of whatever anime they care about or whatever movies they pirated.

364
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Speaker 1: Their entire music collection from when they were in high school, whatever.

365
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,214
Speaker 1: But, uh, that broke.

366
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,000
Speaker 1: Again.

367
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,443
Speaker 1: And that was the news.

368
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:56,960
Speaker 1: Like, oh my god, this local streaming thing was broken because Google's trying to lock out local content.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna quote the TOS.

370
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Speaker 1: Warning, the Google Cast STK is a preview STK intended for development and testing purposes only, not for production apps.

371
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:12,658
Speaker 1: Google may change this STK significantly prior to the official release of Google Cast STK.

372
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:17,200
Speaker 0: The reason you're a tech journalist and not a technologist is because you don't know that much.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,320
Speaker 0: It's the same problem we see in a lot of journalism of specialized areas of interest.

374
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,458
Speaker 0: You know, especially games journalism is that, you know, there's a lot of games journalists out there who are good, but most aren't.

375
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,700
Speaker 0: And most of them, even the ones I say aren't good in general, they're good at writing.

376
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:37,300
Speaker 0: I think most games journalists, most people who their job is games journalism, they're great.

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,569
Speaker 0: They're way better at writing than me because that's what they do.

378
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,280
Speaker 0: And I read what they write and I'm like, wow, they're not bad at writing.

379
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,233
Speaker 0: But they just don't have the knowledge of games.

380
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:46,660
Speaker 0: Here's the same thing in the tech industry.

381
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,707
Speaker 0: John Z. Dvorak is a tech journalist.

382
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:49,029
Speaker 0: Why?

383
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,340
Speaker 0: Because he can't program his way out of a paper bag.

384
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,640
Speaker 0: I mean, he knows more about technology than, say, some normal people.

385
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,383
Speaker 0: Right on this, you know, whatever.

386
00:18:57,724 --> 00:19:06,180
Speaker 0: But he doesn't know enough to actually have a job as a programmer or someone making hardware or someone making devices or, you know, anything like that.

387
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,804
Speaker 0: That's why he's writing about it.

388
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:14,920
Speaker 0: He knows enough and he knows enough about writing that he can write about the technology, you know, and other tech journalists are the same way.

389
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,202
Speaker 0: Same as this person.

390
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,489
Speaker 0: They don't understand technology enough.

391
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,412
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:20,615
Speaker 0: So but they can.

393
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,300
Speaker 0: they know more than the average person.

394
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,768
Speaker 0: So they can write technology articles for normal people.

395
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,620
Speaker 0: But then any actual tech people, if they look at it, will say, what the fuck is wrong with you?

396
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:37,160
Speaker 1: Now, in this case, the developer of cyanogen mod said that keeps saying that Google is intentionally breaking his apps.

397
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,410
Speaker 0: Well, that guy's just a crazy nut.

398
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:40,640
Speaker 1: Let's see.

399
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,262
Speaker 1: Heads up.

400
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:45,040
Speaker 1: Google's latest Chromecast update intentionally in italics breaks all cast.

401
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,180
Speaker 1: They disabled video underscore playback support from the Chromecast application.

402
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:55,500
Speaker 1: Given this is the second time this purposely removed disabled the ability to play media from external sources confers my suspicions that blah, blah, blah, blah.

403
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,099
Speaker 1: Now, I will just say this and we can move on.

404
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:09,220
Speaker 1: I would not put it past Google to lock out content to some degree in the final version of this, because Google does have a lot of vested corporate interest in this stuff.

405
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:13,660
Speaker 1: But we don't have evidence that that is what is happening yet.

406
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,580
Speaker 0: You know, that's what I would do to bring it around.

407
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,535
Speaker 0: If I was CEO of Microsoft is I would do all the fuck you moves.

408
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:21,820
Speaker 0: I'd be like, yeah, Windows Phone.

409
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,080
Speaker 0: If you both have Windows phones, you can literally simply just transfer fucking MP3s from one phone to another.

410
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:28,582
Speaker 1: Yep.

411
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:29,267
Speaker 0: Just boom.

412
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,200
Speaker 0: Fuck you music content producers.

413
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:41,800
Speaker 0: If you if you run Microsoft, Microsoft, if you run Microsoft Windows and your friend also runs Microsoft Windows, it's easy as balls just to send files back and forth any file you want.

414
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,807
Speaker 0: Well, you don't even give a shit.

415
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,699
Speaker 0: In fact, super encrypted, too.

416
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,500
Speaker 0: Oh, and when the government comes and says you want to put back doors in, I'll say that was the old Ballmer Microsoft.

417
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,345
Speaker 0: We've taken all the back doors out.

418
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:56,840
Speaker 0: We're even patching all back to XP to remove those black hole, those back doors.

419
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:57,519
Speaker 0: Now, now, now, now.

420
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,151
Speaker 0: Fuck you, government.

421
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:58,599
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

422
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,379
Speaker 1: Here's the problem with the security side, because...

423
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,200
Speaker 0: And that I'd advertise the fuck that I'm doing that.

424
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

425
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:11,780
Speaker 1: And I would simultaneously go to the government and say, look, we're going to fucking open ourselves the fuck up and bend over to you because all the people who care about security are going to buy Windows.

426
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,338
Speaker 0: Well, I would also be like...

427
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,686
Speaker 1: That's the one benefit of open source for security.

428
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:23,440
Speaker 1: is that some nerd is going to find the back door if there's any back door in open source code.

429
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,901
Speaker 0: That's true.

430
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:28,299
Speaker 0: No, but it's like if Microsoft does stuff like that, where it's like... Yeah, that's why I said before.

431
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're taking all the DRM out.

432
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,492
Speaker 1: Microsoft and Valve, Microsoft should be the one that make the set top box.

433
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,960
Speaker 1: Windows on the TV should be the default.

434
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:38,720
Speaker 0: It was, but they couldn't really make it work.

435
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,210
Speaker 0: They almost had it.

436
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:41,260
Speaker 0: I'd go back to that, too.

437
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,160
Speaker 0: The thing is, the Xbox just plays any fucking video in the universe.

438
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,571
Speaker 0: It's got all the codecs.

439
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:47,560
Speaker 0: We keep them all up to date.

440
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:48,667
Speaker 0: It's just perfect.

441
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:49,352
Speaker 0: It just works.

442
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,540
Speaker 0: No fancy weird setups.

443
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,395
Speaker 0: Just any video fucking file.

444
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:52,920
Speaker 0: No hacks.

445
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:58,420
Speaker 0: If anyone ever has to hack a Microsoft thing, then that means the CEO of Microsoft didn't do this strategy.

447
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,740
Speaker 0: The strategy would be you never need to hack our shit because we, our developers here made everything so perfect that it's already the way you want.

448
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 0: Super free to watch all the videos and share all the files and do all the things.

449
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:16,611
Speaker 0: So, what's interesting is I basically- Oh, and Xbox Gold would be, there wouldn't even be gold.

450
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,100
Speaker 0: It would just be everyone has free Xbox Live accounts.

451
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,760
Speaker 1: I would sell Platinum, though.

452
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

453
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:24,800
Speaker 0: Maybe you could have a Platinum for money that does even more crazy shit.

454
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,260
Speaker 1: Copper, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Ultra Platinum.

455
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,911
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

456
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,758
Speaker 0: Just- Chromium.

457
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,091
Speaker 0: It would be more like Amazon Prime, right?

458
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:32,720
Speaker 0: Where it's just Amazon and Amazon Prime.

459
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:37,260
Speaker 0: But there wouldn't be any, you'd only need Platinum if you were like super hardcore.

460
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:41,540
Speaker 0: Normal people, they could watch their Netflix and use the Twitters and all that without paying for the Platinum.

461
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:51,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't really pay attention to the news on these things because I'm one of those people who just has a real computer running a desktop OS connected to my TV.

462
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

463
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,777
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

464
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,446
Speaker 1: I watched the first season and a half of Breaking Bad.

465
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,289
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

466
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:03,670
Speaker 1: I like it.

467
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,830
Speaker 1: Not as good as House of Cards or Adventure Time or any of these other things, but it's pretty good.

468
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:14,570
Speaker 1: I kind of stopped watching and I kind of want to watch the new season just because people are talking about it and it looks good.

469
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:26,110
Speaker 1: So here, for you, in case you want to do the same thing and are in a similar boat, is a super spoilers for obvious reasons, really good recap of the first five seasons of Breaking Bad.

470
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,110
Speaker 0: How long does it take to watch it?

471
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,880
Speaker 0: 27 minutes.

472
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,018
Speaker 0: Well, that show is pretty slow then, isn't it?

473
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,423
Speaker 0: There's a lot of filler.

474
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:34,650
Speaker 0: You can watch five seasons in 20 minutes.

475
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:40,450
Speaker 1: The show does have a lot of... I wouldn't call it filler, but it's more like there's a lot of atmosphere.

476
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,030
Speaker 0: Quiet scenes with cicadas chirping?

477
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,368
Speaker 1: Yeah.

478
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:42,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

479
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,530
Speaker 1: Which actually is super... I mean, if you call that...

480
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,270
Speaker 0: I like those, yeah.

481
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

482
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,350
Speaker 1: If you call that filler in Ava, like, all right.

483
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,690
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I like those.

484
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:52,005
Speaker 1: Imagine the no cicada Ava cut.

485
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:52,650
Speaker 1: That would be awful.

486
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:53,896
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

487
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:54,300
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

488
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,230
Speaker 1: I want to make the only cicadas cut.

489
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,370
Speaker 0: You'd have to watch it in slow-mo because, like, what just happened?

490
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,910
Speaker 0: When the cicadas are chirping, that's where you try to figure out what you just saw.

491
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,361
Speaker 1: You know what we could do after we finish.

492
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,469
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Presents Utena?

493
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,390
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Presents Ava, and then because we're doing it anyway, I could make a super cut of every cicada.

494
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

495
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:09,213
Speaker 0: You know what?

496
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,670
Speaker 0: Every time cicadas chirped in Ava, you know what my brain thought?

497
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,020
Speaker 0: Huh?

498
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:13,576
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

499
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:15,530
Speaker 0: No one can have any babies on all of Earth.

500
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,671
Speaker 0: Oh, because the room of... Oh, or, oh, right, everyone... Yeah.

501
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,277
Speaker 0: Or, oh, right, everyone left.

502
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:24,570
Speaker 0: There's no one left in this town except, like, these tender people, and that's it.

503
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:25,490
Speaker 0: Everyone's gone.

504
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:29,029
Speaker 0: Or, oh, right, they moved the whole city underground and kept it there.

505
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:29,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

506
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:33,370
Speaker 0: Or, oh, right, that was all I thought every time that it was cicadas chirping.

507
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,146
Speaker 1: Anyway, Breaking Bad, the first five seasons in 27 minutes.

508
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:36,850
Speaker 1: Super well done.

509
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:53,389
Speaker 1: The only thing I want to point out is that there's a character who... There are so many scenes, if you watch this, in the later seasons, where a particular character holds a gun to another character's head and says, "Give me a reason not to fucking shoot you," and the guy's like, "Just hear me out, just hear me out, just hear me

510
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:53,470
Speaker 1: out.".

511
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,410
Speaker 0: That happens over and over again?

512
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:54,692
Speaker 0: Yeah.

513
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,589
Speaker 1: You know what the moral of this recap is?

514
00:24:56,853 --> 00:24:58,048
Speaker 1: He should have just fucking shot him.

515
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,780
Speaker 1: The first time.

516
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:01,350
Speaker 0: Anyway.

517
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,297
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, thing of the day.

518
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:13,389
Speaker 0: There's this dude named Martin Manley, and he wasn't really, you know, he was a very interesting person, and what he did is he killed himself.

519
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,370
Speaker 1: Oh, this guy was all over Fark.

520
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:16,827
Speaker 0: Yeah.

521
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,310
Speaker 1: And there's also a story because this web provider shut his website down at first.

522
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:28,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right, but the thing is, is he wasn't really crazy, at least not super crazy, like, you know, or super depressed or anything like that.

523
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:40,810
Speaker 0: I'm sure he wasn't perfect because he killed himself, but, you know, he was an intelligent, well-spoken person, and, you know, he killed himself for reasons, his own reasons, and everyone has their own reasons, and he has a right to those reasons.

524
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:46,730
Speaker 0: The interesting thing is that before killing himself, he wrote this huge website explaining the hell out of everything.

525
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,850
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of people, they explain things when they kill themselves.

526
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:52,050
Speaker 0: They leave behind a note or something of that nature.

527
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:57,230
Speaker 0: They make a Facebook post or Twitter or something, but, you know, usually you don't get to see that.

528
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,770
Speaker 0: It's like if the family has a suicide note, it's like no one sees that, right?

529
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:18,889
Speaker 0: So people who haven't, you know, collected a suicide note in their lives, or were, you know, lucky enough, such as we are, to not collect a suicide note in their lives, right, don't really know what's going through some of those people's heads, and a lot of those people are crazy or depressed, so even if you had the note, you know, it wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you.

530
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,550
Speaker 0: But here it's just really, really interesting.

531
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:36,550
Speaker 0: This is, you know, I'm sure there are other cases, but this is the first widely published, you know, case, where a guy wrote this huge website, and you can read and really see what he was thinking and, you know, what was going through his head and why he decided to kill himself and whatnot.

532
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:41,206
Speaker 1: I remember there was one point I was poking around through it, and there was a bit that was like 9/11 conspiracies.

533
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,329
Speaker 1: I was like, uh-oh.

534
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:46,209
Speaker 1: But then I clicked on that part, and he was basically like, yeah, you're all morons.

535
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:48,763
Speaker 1: It wasn't a conspiracy.

536
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:49,350
Speaker 1: Calm down.

537
00:26:51,032 --> 00:27:05,810
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is definitely worthwhile reading, simply to, you know, look inside the mind of another human being who had nothing really to hide because they were dead, and maybe learn something about yourself from the death of this other person.

538
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:12,470
Speaker 1: I feel like I have a very complicated position on the rights of the dead.

539
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the website.

540
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:18,070
Speaker 1: Yes, because on--well, it was taken down by Yahoo, so this is-- Oh, the guy also donated his organs and stuff.

541
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he even set it up to where police would find his body so no one would be traumatized, and he set it up to where they'd find it right away.

542
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, look how not crazy he was.

543
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:27,804
Speaker 1: Yeah.

544
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,342
Speaker 0: He thought all of this out.

545
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, he put it really down.

546
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,330
Speaker 0: It's like he decided long in advance.

547
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:42,270
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, he wasn't ill, this guy, but it was similar to like Terry Pratchett wants to, you know, because he has Alzheimer's.

548
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,750
Speaker 0: This guy, I don't think, had Alzheimer's.

549
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:54,490
Speaker 1: So on one hand, I feel like the dead should have no rights to things that they might have wanted because they're gone, but I also feel like-- It's like you're dead, whatever you want, it doesn't matter anymore.

550
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:01,390
Speaker 1: But I also feel like certain kinds of wishes should be maintained, especially if they paid for them in advance, like this website.

551
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:10,170
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if I pay someone for services, like I sign a contract with someone that says like, "After I die, you will jump up and down ten times," it's like that contract is still binding.

552
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:10,770
Speaker 0: I paid you.

553
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,270
Speaker 1: But at least it's binding to the estate.

554
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:20,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, like if I bought a piano, right, and the piano was going to be delivered tomorrow and I die today, they still got to deliver that fucking piano tomorrow.

555
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,301
Speaker 0: They can't just be like, "Oh, he died.

556
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:22,128
Speaker 0: We don't have to deliver it

557
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:22,310
Speaker 0: now.".

558
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:23,890
Speaker 0: You got the money, right?

559
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,150
Speaker 0: You give the money back or you deliver the piano.

560
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,510
Speaker 0: It was paid for just because the person you paid for is dead, right?

561
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:30,109
Speaker 0: That kind of thing needs to stay.

562
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:36,606
Speaker 0: But it's like if I'm dead and I just write in my will that I want someone to do something, it's like, "You don't have to fucking do

563
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:36,769
Speaker 0: that.".

564
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,906
Speaker 1: And look at how many people--.

565
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,730
Speaker 0: If they don't want to.

566
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,830
Speaker 0: If they want to, okay.

567
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:47,089
Speaker 1: Important literary works that were not published where the person who died left instructions to not publish them or tried to hide them and just publish them.

568
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,670
Speaker 0: That's fine.

569
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's great.

570
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,990
Speaker 0: Funerals are for the people who are still alive.

571
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,850
Speaker 0: They're not for the dead people, right?

572
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,250
Speaker 0: All that stuff is for the living people.

573
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,210
Speaker 0: Dead people are dead.

574
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,509
Speaker 0: They don't do anything for them.

575
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,690
Speaker 1: Now, I do believe we in the United States should ban burial.

576
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:05,086
Speaker 0: I also agree, but it's a separate episode.

577
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,409
Speaker 1: It is a separate episode.

578
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:11,910
Speaker 1: So, not this weekend, but oh shit, it actually is this weekend.

579
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,889
Speaker 1: It's time.

580
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,409
Speaker 0: P motherfucking A to the X.

581
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,769
Speaker 1: You actually said to the X.

582
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,470
Speaker 0: That's right.

583
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,970
Speaker 1: You said that.

584
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,870
Speaker 0: To the X. You said-- Every day hustling.

585
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:23,527
Speaker 1: Okay.

586
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,589
Speaker 0: It is time to hustle.

587
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,050
Speaker 1: So, we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

588
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,530
Speaker 1: It's a convention about gaming and a webcomic called Penny Arcade.

589
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,309
Speaker 1: It's in Seattle on Friday.

590
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,850
Speaker 1: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

591
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,770
Speaker 0: I'm laughing for a different reason that you don't realize.

592
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,488
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck.

593
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,229
Speaker 1: So, we're going to be there.

594
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,850
Speaker 1: We're going to be presenting on Monday at noon in the Wolfman Theater.

595
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:43,570
Speaker 1: Bad.

596
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:43,858
Speaker 0: Monday?

597
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,470
Speaker 0: Wait, PAX is on Monday?

598
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:46,389
Speaker 0: Are you shitting me?

599
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,048
Speaker 1: Bad games.

600
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,790
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't need to come to that if it's bad.

601
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,949
Speaker 0: There's plenty of good games at PAX.

602
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,203
Speaker 1: Bad games.

603
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,129
Speaker 1: Bad games.

604
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,390
Speaker 1: I'll let you all in on a secret.

605
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going to do a little bit of that angry video game nerd.

606
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,150
Speaker 1: Like, haha, look at this bad game, but it's not what the panel's about.

607
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,230
Speaker 0: Our panel is never about what it says it's going to be about.

608
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,008
Speaker 0: That's what we do.

609
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:03,487
Speaker 0: Well.

610
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,710
Speaker 0: If you don't know that and you're listening to the show, really?

611
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,470
Speaker 0: I point out, did you just start listening?

612
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,309
Speaker 1: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

613
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:10,530
Speaker 0: Have you not watched our panel on YouTube ever?

614
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,250
Speaker 1: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons is about exactly what it says it's about.

615
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,930
Speaker 0: It's not about Dungeons and Dragons at all.

616
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

617
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,989
Speaker 1: It's about how Dungeons and Dragons is bad.

618
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, anyway.

619
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:29,930
Speaker 1: But we're also going to be at another event, the pre-Pax Sky High Tabletop Play Benefiting Food Lifeline event in the Columbia Tower Club.

620
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:31,109
Speaker 0: It's a charity dinner.

621
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:34,230
Speaker 0: I'm going to eat dinner on Thursday night in Seattle anyway.

622
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,606
Speaker 0: Why not have the money I would have spent on dinner at a restaurant?

623
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:38,330
Speaker 0: go to charity?

624
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:42,241
Speaker 0: And, side benefit, good gaming tables.

625
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,890
Speaker 0: I don't have to fight over for a whole night of pre-Pax.

626
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:48,050
Speaker 0: Usually you have to fight in like the Sheraton lobby for a tiny shit table.

627
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,470
Speaker 0: This is, oh, along with dinner?

628
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,310
Speaker 0: I can then play games on these super nice tables in comfort without having to fight for them?

629
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,810
Speaker 0: Yes, I will gladly pay money for that service.

630
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,149
Speaker 0: Oh, the money goes to charity, you say?

631
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:02,270
Speaker 0: What is bad about this situation?

632
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,410
Speaker 1: We will be VIPs at the event.

633
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,370
Speaker 1: We will be running and teaching some games for people at the event.

634
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:16,949
Speaker 1: So if you go to this thing, we might teach you how to play Agricola or Glory to Rome and then maybe play a game with you.

635
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,710
Speaker 1: Fuck you Rome.

636
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,330
Speaker 1: We might run some Burning Wheel or some Inspectors.

637
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,730
Speaker 0: We'll play whatever games are going to be played because it's just a game night.

638
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,690
Speaker 1: We might run a big action castle for all the people.

639
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,110
Speaker 0: If someone else plays Netrunner, we'll just play Netrunner all the time.

640
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,677
Speaker 0: Well, at least I will.

641
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:30,649
Speaker 0: Because that's what I do.

642
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,030
Speaker 1: I feel like we should run a big action castle with everyone there.

643
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,539
Speaker 0: We'll see what the people are doing there.

644
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,023
Speaker 0: It's a dinner.

645
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:35,989
Speaker 0: People do what they do.

646
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,830
Speaker 1: Well, it's a dinner and drinks and hanging out.

647
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,691
Speaker 1: Now kids, you gotta be 21.

648
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,130
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

649
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,390
Speaker 1: And also, read the FAQ.

650
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,230
Speaker 0: There's a dress code also.

651
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,570
Speaker 1: You have to dress not like a hobo.

652
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,670
Speaker 0: I think it was like jeans and a shirt is like enough.

653
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,510
Speaker 1: Well, there's two levels.

654
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:57,710
Speaker 1: I think we only have to make it to the first level because the club room, there's like two levels in the FAQ from the tower itself.

655
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:01,045
Speaker 1: And the second tier said, "Gentlemen must be wearing a

656
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,427
Speaker 1: jacket.".

657
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,510
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't think we have to wear a jacket.

658
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,650
Speaker 1: I don't think so, but I'll have a jacket with me anyway just in case.

659
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,749
Speaker 0: Does that mean I have to bring a jacket?

660
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:07,636
Speaker 1: I don't know.

661
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:08,570
Speaker 1: I'll bring a jacket anyway.

662
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:09,670
Speaker 1: I always bring a jacket to PAX.

663
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,150
Speaker 1: I bring that awful seersucker that I wear everywhere.

664
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:12,547
Speaker 0: I only have one.

665
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:13,555
Speaker 0: Really?

666
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:16,992
Speaker 1: I have like 11.

667
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,202
Speaker 1: The Book Club book is Stazzyland.

668
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:19,029
Speaker 1: You should read it.

669
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:20,945
Speaker 0: I finally just got a copy of it.

670
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:21,410
Speaker 0: Borrowing.

671
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:22,348
Speaker 0: I finished it.

672
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,390
Speaker 0: I'll read it on this plane to Seattle maybe.

673
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,642
Speaker 0: Ooh, there's a map of Germany.

674
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,070
Speaker 0: East Berlin, West Berlin.

675
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:28,989
Speaker 0: I've seen that map.

676
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna learn a lot about that map.

677
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,202
Speaker 0: Huh, Brandenburg Gate.

678
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,909
Speaker 0: What is that?

679
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:34,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, Alexander Platz.

680
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:35,664
Speaker 1: Platz.

681
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:36,703
Speaker 0: What's Platz?

682
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,370
Speaker 0: This reminds me of a James Bond movie that involved a circus and a nuclear bomb.

683
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:45,050
Speaker 1: Gambling.

684
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,123
Speaker 0: Gambling.

685
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:46,730
Speaker 0: Gambling.

686
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:48,310
Speaker 0: Roll them bones.

687
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:50,230
Speaker 1: I don't really gamble anymore.

688
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:52,770
Speaker 0: I gamble almost zero.

689
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:53,549
Speaker 0: There was a time.

690
00:32:54,192 --> 00:33:01,550
Speaker 1: There was a time when Scott and I were in Wildwood and we went up the state a little bit to Atlantic City.

691
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,710
Speaker 1: We walked into the roulette table and we just kept betting on red.

692
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,370
Speaker 1: And we walked out, each with a couple hundred bucks.

693
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,710
Speaker 0: I bet on a few other things randomly.

694
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,250
Speaker 1: I pretty much just bet on red.

695
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:13,490
Speaker 1: Once I bet on the one-third bet instead of the one-half bet.

696
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,109
Speaker 1: You can bet on like one-third of the board.

697
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:25,450
Speaker 1: But pretty much for as long as the internet's been going on, people have been trying to gamble over it because local laws often ban gambling.

698
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,310
Speaker 1: And the internet is very difficult to regulate.

699
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:32,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm of the opinion if you want to gamble, go ahead.

700
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:37,350
Speaker 0: But also, hey, the way gambling is set up basically is just a regressive tax.

701
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,790
Speaker 0: It takes money away from poor, not smart people and gives it to rich people.

702
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:50,387
Speaker 1: So in the very least, I'm okay with regulation on gambling to ensure that if someone allows gambling, that the gambling is itself fair and what it says it is.

703
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,250
Speaker 1: I mean, if I run a casino and the slot machines just never pay out, yeah, jail for me.

704
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:56,644
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,330
Speaker 0: That's fine.

706
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:06,890
Speaker 0: And this is the thing with internet gambling is that you'll see, you know, by forcing it underground, by making it illegal, how can I trust those places are not totally shady and just cheating me?

707
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:07,587
Speaker 0: I can't.

708
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,070
Speaker 0: So even if I wanted to gamble, which I don't, I can't because I don't trust that shit.

709
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:19,590
Speaker 0: But if they allowed it, then I could go to places that were above board and regulated and I could trust that I wasn't getting screwed.

710
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,989
Speaker 0: But think about this.

711
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,969
Speaker 0: Let's say we're playing video poker, right?

712
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,708
Speaker 0: Blackjack, you and me.

713
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:25,246
Speaker 0: All right.

714
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:26,181
Speaker 0: You're in your house.

715
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:26,889
Speaker 0: I'm in my house.

716
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,170
Speaker 0: But we're sitting at the same virtual blackjack table.

717
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:29,810
Speaker 0: Okay.

718
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,190
Speaker 0: I play some cards.

719
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,170
Speaker 0: You play some cards.

720
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:37,509
Speaker 0: You never really get to see the card that I have faced down.

721
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,790
Speaker 0: It tells you you lose.

722
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,848
Speaker 0: It tells me I lose.

723
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:44,590
Speaker 0: But really, you know, it looks like you won on my screen.

724
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,168
Speaker 0: It looked right.

725
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,510
Speaker 0: It's like they don't have to show us the same damn thing.

726
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,790
Speaker 1: Well, I think poker is a better example that people want to play online poker with other people.

727
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:56,790
Speaker 1: But at the same time, how do you know they're not just bots or not just completely made up?

728
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,282
Speaker 1: Yep.

729
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:01,009
Speaker 0: And people who do play online poker play like a zillion tables at once.

730
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:01,810
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,490
Speaker 0: And they're doing all this crazy stuff, which is totally unfair.

732
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,830
Speaker 1: It's more that those people.

733
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,810
Speaker 0: We can't even stop people from cheating at Counter Strike.

734
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,090
Speaker 0: How are we going to stop people from cheating?

735
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:10,610
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

736
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,833
Speaker 1: There's a lot of.

737
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:15,569
Speaker 1: there's a lot of things we want to try to just talk about the technology of this game.

738
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:15,890
Speaker 1: wise.

739
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:24,070
Speaker 1: The people who play like 10 poker games at the same time are the same said people who play 10 bingo cards at the same time.

740
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,250
Speaker 0: They're just trying to do it for a living so they don't have to get a job.

741
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:27,805
Speaker 0: Yes.

742
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:30,570
Speaker 1: Even though you don't make that much money doing that.

743
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,989
Speaker 1: And also that's really kind of sad.

744
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,069
Speaker 1: And what are you gonna put on your resume?

745
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,549
Speaker 1: I play video poker online every day.

746
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,290
Speaker 1: Ten video pokers.

747
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,350
Speaker 1: I can play 10 video pokers simultaneously.

748
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:51,370
Speaker 1: But beyond all that, you know, you were saying the problem with online gambling or gambling in general is that, you know, basically it's a regressive tax on poor people.

749
00:35:52,150 --> 00:36:04,350
Speaker 1: But if we let it happen online, then we reduce the one benefit that institutionalized gambling has that you push it into certain sort of syntax areas like Las Vegas.

750
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:06,814
Speaker 1: And those are the places in quotes.

751
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:18,290
Speaker 1: people go to do their gambling, get their gamble on, and you can milk the economic benefit more directly and maybe even intervene in the people's lives who are doing it improperly or to their own detriment more easily.

752
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,955
Speaker 0: It also actually might help those areas.

753
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:26,590
Speaker 0: Like if you hurt the Vegas casinos, maybe Vegas will just be awesome shows and get rid of the casinos or have less of them.

754
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,370
Speaker 1: But if gambling happens everywhere, no one's going to Atlantic City.

755
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, Atlantic City will just get worse.

756
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,070
Speaker 1: Except all those people who want to buy all you can eat crab legs.

757
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,358
Speaker 0: I read a thing today that said like in the United States, I mean, Internet isn't fast or cheap in the

758
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:38,739
Speaker 0: U.S.,

759
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,970
Speaker 0: but it was like, yeah, there's only like two a very like a single digit percentage of people who can't get Internet in the U.S

760
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,253
Speaker 1: I read that 20 percent

761
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:50,963
Speaker 0: of Americans, 20 percent don't, even though they could write, they could get it.

762
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:52,185
Speaker 0: They choose not to.

763
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,450
Speaker 0: And those people are basically the problem.

764
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,450
Speaker 1: Did you see the follow up that the majority of those people and they least they're old and poor?

765
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,600
Speaker 1: Nope.

766
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,550
Speaker 1: Former Confederacy.

767
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,669
Speaker 0: Also that.

768
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,290
Speaker 1: Former Confederacy lines up directly with the states that have the least percent of Internet use.

769
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:08,931
Speaker 0: Yep.

770
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:13,748
Speaker 0: But the people who are not getting the Internet are basically the old, the poor, the uneducated, etc.

771
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:21,570
Speaker 1: So in a way, maybe it would be fine because the people who are sitting in the slot machines all day are not the people who know they can use a computer.

772
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,110
Speaker 0: And hopefully they wouldn't use a computer even if they could.

773
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:34,930
Speaker 1: And hopefully the old, lonely people who do it because they have nothing else to do, by the time our generation gets that old, more of us will have a few old friends left thanks to Facebook and we'll go live somewhere in person.

774
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:41,070
Speaker 0: But what if having online gaming legal might get the old, uneducated, poor people onto the Internet?

775
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:48,610
Speaker 0: They might learn something while they're there the same way that guy who comes to PAX just for League of Legends might learn something while he's there about another game.

776
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,750
Speaker 1: Online gambling is mostly illegal.

777
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,130
Speaker 0: In the United States.

778
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,176
Speaker 0: Yes.

779
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 1: So how are so many people doing it anyway?

780
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:03,530
Speaker 0: They just like VPN to some other country where it's legal, get a bank account in like another country, a credit card from another country, use bitcoins, turn them into some other currency.

781
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,550
Speaker 1: Notice how technological measures, this is the beauty of the Internet and the beauty of free speech.

782
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,340
Speaker 1: The fact that the Internet is so decentralized means that online gambling sites appeared outside of the U.S.

783
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,426
Speaker 1: that were perfectly legal where they were and the U.S.

784
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:18,250
Speaker 1: couldn't do fuck all about it.

785
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:18,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

786
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,759
Speaker 0: All they can do to you if you start trying to gamble is the like, oh, you're using a U.S.

787
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,962
Speaker 0: credit card for online gambling.

788
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:26,030
Speaker 0: We're just going to shut that down and freeze your bank account and whatever.

789
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,229
Speaker 0: Because that's in the U.S.

790
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,475
Speaker 0: They have to go after the like legal side routes.

791
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,196
Speaker 1: They have to Al Capone you to take it down.

792
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:38,670
Speaker 1: because technologically I have an SSL connection to an IP address.

793
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,049
Speaker 1: There are many like it, but this one is mine.

794
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:47,708
Speaker 0: I'm using the VPN, a non 103 from that VPN is connecting and playing video poker.

795
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:48,430
Speaker 0: Who the hell is it?

796
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,110
Speaker 0: What account is being used to play that video poker site?

797
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:53,756
Speaker 0: It's a British bank account.

798
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:57,150
Speaker 0: that could be a Britain person using the VPN and doing that.

799
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,650
Speaker 0: It could be a Chinese person.

800
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,350
Speaker 0: Now, we have no clue at the same time.

801
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,510
Speaker 1: They still will go after you with legal means, like, well, if they know that it's me, how would they know?

802
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,468
Speaker 0: The only way they can know when I transfer money from that account to my U.S.

803
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:08,830
Speaker 0: account.

804
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,730
Speaker 1: Yes, repatriating the money, money laundering.

805
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,409
Speaker 0: There's an easier way to deal with that.

806
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:19,810
Speaker 1: Buy bitcoins with the money from the account, transfer them to another account and then transfer them to cash.

807
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,809
Speaker 0: Well, that could work, yes.

808
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,330
Speaker 0: But another way to do it would be to just don't transfer it to the U.S.

809
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,670
Speaker 0: Go to Britain on holiday and then, you know, use the money for your vacation.

810
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:31,270
Speaker 1: That's not a bad idea.

811
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,930
Speaker 1: But then again, Britain is not the best example because they might have.

812
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,980
Speaker 0: They have tons of gambling.

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,050
Speaker 0: They're just like Australia.

814
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:36,333
Speaker 0: Yep.

815
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:37,850
Speaker 1: Oh my God, Australia.

816
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:44,870
Speaker 0: I watch like some illegal, you know, streams of sports because basically some guy in the UK pays a bunch of money to get a dish.

817
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:49,343
Speaker 0: So he gets the football game and then he streams the football game back to people in the U.S.

818
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,710
Speaker 0: over the, you know, Internet's.

819
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:58,548
Speaker 0: And the commercials during like American football in Britain are all like, you know, bet on games.

820
00:39:58,608 --> 00:39:59,250
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

821
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,870
Speaker 0: And it's basically you can do all the stuff that you could bet on at that at that footy game from your computer at home.

822
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:15,970
Speaker 1: But anyway, technologically, online gambling has to do the same things that people who want to share child porn or hide information transfer or spy have to do.

823
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:28,610
Speaker 1: You have to make it to where people can use the sites and make financial transactions over them but simultaneously not be easily identifiable by outside people like the government.

824
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know that Silk Road site that just sells drugs and sends them by UPS?

825
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:33,676
Speaker 0: You can only pay them in bitcoins.

826
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,830
Speaker 0: Why don't we just open up a casino and you can only get to it if you're on tour?

827
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,570
Speaker 0: Why don't we set up a site that is just a casino that's on tour and you can only gamble in bitcoins?

828
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,472
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea.

829
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:48,370
Speaker 0: I was going to say in general that the problem is we need enough bitcoins to be the house.

830
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:49,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

831
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:51,844
Speaker 1: Also, we'd have to run it somewhere with.

832
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:52,790
Speaker 1: none of this is illegal.

833
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:54,913
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's.

834
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:55,959
Speaker 0: no one would know where it is.

835
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,629
Speaker 0: Just like no one knows where the Silk Road is.

836
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's probably not in the United States.

837
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,010
Speaker 0: I almost definitely not in the United States.

838
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,211
Speaker 1: Exactly.

839
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:03,754
Speaker 1: That's the point.

840
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,162
Speaker 1: We couldn't build it here.

841
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:07,709
Speaker 0: Also, I'll bet the NSA- We just buy servers somewhere else.

842
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,529
Speaker 1: I'll bet the NSA knows exactly where it is.

843
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:10,649
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

844
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,990
Speaker 1: Because Tor is pretty easy to attack.

845
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,868
Speaker 0: Well, that's because there were some untrust, there were some basically no good people on Tor running bad nodes.

846
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,750
Speaker 0: They got rid of the bad nodes.

847
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:24,810
Speaker 1: All discussions like this, and this is why we keep bringing it up, come down to circle of trust.

848
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:33,830
Speaker 1: No matter how great the encryption in the world you use, if you use Google's SSL certificate, Google can decrypt everything you're sending them.

849
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,171
Speaker 0: Right.

850
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,910
Speaker 0: That's the whole point is I want to communicate with Google and Google only.

851
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,885
Speaker 0: Google has my Gmail, I have my Gmail, and no one else.

852
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:40,750
Speaker 0: That's the goal, right?

853
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,430
Speaker 0: But if I can't trust Google, Google can just read my Gmail and send it to anyone they want.

854
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:51,067
Speaker 1: If I want to communicate with just Scott and not Google, we have to use our own encryption scheme.

855
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,010
Speaker 1: that's just between us.

856
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:57,390
Speaker 1: And I have to trust that Scott won't just take all my communication and share it with a bunch of other people.

857
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:03,130
Speaker 0: I could do something like, let's say I have a file that has secrets in it, so I encrypt it, but I store it on my Amazon bucket.

858
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,923
Speaker 0: Well, Amazon has it, but it's encrypted.

859
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:05,750
Speaker 0: They're not going to break that.

860
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,409
Speaker 1: Yup, that's fine.

861
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,830
Speaker 0: But I'm basically trusting me and only me, and I can't send that information to anybody.

862
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,370
Speaker 0: And then let's say I share it with RIM, so RIM can decrypt it.

863
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:16,850
Speaker 1: I could also put it on Pirate Bell.

864
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,949
Speaker 0: And then RIM, as soon as he decrypts it, I mean no one else has it.

865
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:26,970
Speaker 0: I was successfully sent a secret message to RIM, but then he just posted it on his Twitter and his Tumblr, and everyone saw it.

866
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,210
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, fuck you RIM.

867
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,750
Speaker 0: It's the same thing with the gambling, right?

868
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,010
Speaker 0: You have to trust the casino isn't cheating.

869
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,590
Speaker 0: You have to trust the people you're playing with aren't cheating.

870
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:41,230
Speaker 0: You have to trust there's no one in between you and the casino taking your monies or fucking up with your game across the internets.

871
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,936
Speaker 0: There's so many things you have to trust.

872
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:49,970
Speaker 0: to believe in the online gambling itself is sound, technologically, right?

873
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,290
Speaker 0: Even if it was legit and regulated by the government, you still have to trust.

874
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,508
Speaker 0: I mean, Counter Strike, people still cheat at it.

875
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:56,967
Speaker 0: Yup.

876
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,389
Speaker 0: Even with Valve with their VAC.

877
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,569
Speaker 1: Or people don't cheat and get accused of cheating, like me.

878
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:02,244
Speaker 0: Yeah.

879
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,929
Speaker 1: I got kicked and banned from a server not that long ago.

880
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:10,600
Speaker 0: And if people online gambled like crazy, it's like someone would hit jackpots.

881
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,650
Speaker 0: pretty, you know, it's like, yeah, the percentage of people hitting jackpots would be about the same, but the absolute number would go way up.

882
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:26,410
Speaker 1: It kind of delves into non-Monday territory, but I suspect that if you did a huge study of people who gamble online, there's two distinct classes.

883
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:37,770
Speaker 1: There are the people who gamble because it's fun to gamble with friends, maybe for money, like they're doing it for money or whatever, but they're doing it not to make a living, they're doing it because it's fun.

884
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:45,070
Speaker 1: And then there's the much bigger group of people who are doing it to make money or because they think it's easy money.

885
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:53,226
Speaker 0: And the latter- I know a lot of people, especially college age dudes, basically try to do like online poker as their job.

886
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:54,930
Speaker 0: They thought they were so good at it or whatever.

887
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,160
Speaker 1: Yup, because those sites, I mean, part of the reason they do it is that you start to trust the sites because they do pay out.

888
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,967
Speaker 1: They do pay out, but they don't pay out forever.

889
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:05,830
Speaker 1: They don't pay out all the time.

890
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,758
Speaker 1: In fact, because they're not regulated, they could pay out a lot early on and then not pay out anymore.

891
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:19,010
Speaker 1: And as long as it takes you longer to figure out it's not paying out anymore, then the time it took you to build up the money you'd gotten, it's a net profit for them.

892
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:19,569
Speaker 1: Yup.

893
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,894
Speaker 1: And it caused them almost nothing to do because the security stuff's pretty easy.

894
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:25,458
Speaker 1: There's another factor with the circle of trust.

895
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:30,144
Speaker 1: If I want to gamble online, I have to trust the fuck out of that casino.

896
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,868
Speaker 1: Casino doesn't have to trust me at all.

897
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,570
Speaker 1: It's got my money, it could just disappear.

898
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,515
Speaker 1: So it's a one-sided arrangement.

899
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:42,330
Speaker 1: Only one party is hurt by a lack of trust or a failure to uphold trust.

900
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:51,650
Speaker 1: As soon as you're communicating with someone where the other party will be harmed if you break the trust, but you are not harmed if they break the trust, it's very similar to the game theory.

901
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,410
Speaker 0: You're basically relying on them to be nice.

902
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,809
Speaker 0: Please be nice and don't fuck me.

903
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,910
Speaker 1: I mean, if I have nukes and you don't, you just have to trust me and not use nukes.

904
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,151
Speaker 0: Anyway, I go into a casino.

905
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:04,454
Speaker 0: I give them a hundred bucks to give me a hundred dollars in chips, right?

906
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:15,525
Speaker 0: Those chips are only worth anything because basically, effectively, as a libertarian would say, the federal government has a gun to the casino's head that forces them to give me a hundred bucks if I give them the chips.

907
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,709
Speaker 0: Otherwise, the casino would just sell chips and be like, "Man, we made a fortune selling chips.

908
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:19,969
Speaker 0: We're

909
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:20,370
Speaker 0: closed.".

910
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,051
Speaker 1: Yup.

911
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:24,590
Speaker 1: One day, you just stop cashing in chips and see how long it takes people to figure it out.

912
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:24,985
Speaker 1: Yup.

913
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:31,750
Speaker 1: And because it's a libertarian world, you buy up all the newspapers first, so the newspapers keep running stories about huge payouts.

914
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:36,009
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good idea.

915
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,190
Speaker 1: Let's start voting Republican.

916
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,966
Speaker 0: Sure.

917
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:48,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I'm much more interested in the gambling, the first type of gambling, like salty bet with real dollars.

918
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,169
Speaker 1: That would be kind of fun.

919
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:58,829
Speaker 0: The problem with salty bet is that it's not, uh, I wanted to use it as a thing of the day, but I guess we're talking about it now, right?

920
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,450
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it another time.

921
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:07,130
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, casino games that you see in real casinos or sports or things that have uncertainties, right, where the odds are set, right?

922
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:14,730
Speaker 0: Salty bet is like, well, you can't really, you know, get like a firm, the casino, the house wouldn't always win.

923
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,717
Speaker 1: Well, that's why there's no house.

924
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,986
Speaker 1: The house takes a rake or a cut.

925
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,545
Speaker 0: It's just like- Oh, like poker?

926
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:20,749
Speaker 0: Yeah.

927
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:21,392
Speaker 1: Like poker.

928
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:26,750
Speaker 1: That's the interesting kind of gambling where you set up a system where people are gambling with other people.

929
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,235
Speaker 1: You just take a cut.

930
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:31,890
Speaker 1: Now, you're just, you're the broker of trust.

931
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,910
Speaker 1: Security-wise, it's such an elegant analogy for how to do secure networks.

932
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:46,890
Speaker 1: If you do a game like Texas Hold'em and you want to be the casino, you now have a vested interest in making sure that all the people playing trust you.

933
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:51,410
Speaker 1: Because if you're, if people stop trusting you, your business disappears.

934
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,869
Speaker 1: Your cut is only from the fact that people trust you.

935
00:46:55,331 --> 00:47:02,510
Speaker 1: So now everyone has an incentive to validate your trust or their trust of you and you have an incentive to maintain that trust.

936
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:05,770
Speaker 1: And then everybody gets what they want, except the people who lose at poker.

937
00:47:07,414 --> 00:47:08,689
Speaker 0: But I guess in a way they get what they want.

938
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:16,390
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, we could set up a thing where it's like, you know, it's Counter-Strike and you just bet on actual Counter-Strike games and we don't take any of the money.

939
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:22,630
Speaker 0: You're betting against other people betting on the same Counter-Strike game and the money goes to the winner and we just take a cut for our services.

940
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:32,670
Speaker 1: Now, most gambling in the sad loser sense tends to use point spreads and different mechanisms to pretty much always make the odds even.

941
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,054
Speaker 1: Because that's what's best for the house.

942
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:41,430
Speaker 1: It's not good for casinos or bookies to do the kind of betting that's more fun of who's going to win.

943
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,050
Speaker 1: The Oakland Raiders or the Detroit Lions.

944
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:50,561
Speaker 0: If you look at Salty Bet, you can see a lot of times it's just a fucking foregone conclusion.

945
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,005
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, waifu vs DBZ.

946
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:54,368
Speaker 0: Waifu's going to win.

947
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,581
Speaker 1: But that's the kind of betting that Among Friends is a lot more fun.

948
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:01,406
Speaker 1: You're not going to win that game with El Grande.

949
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,469
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck yes I am.

950
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,529
Speaker 0: I'll bet on myself.

951
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,430
Speaker 0: Because you're betting on skill, you're not betting on chance.

952
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:07,352
Speaker 1: Exactly.

953
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:09,110
Speaker 1: That's more fun kind of betting.

954
00:48:09,812 --> 00:48:10,433
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

955
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:13,681
Speaker 0: With computers, with skill, it's sort of known.

956
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:17,210
Speaker 0: You can know what people's skills are or you can look up the skill.

957
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:18,578
Speaker 0: When you bet on...

958
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:21,449
Speaker 1: Whatcha doing there with your boom?

959
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:21,995
Speaker 0: I don't know.

960
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:22,850
Speaker 0: Weird stuff just happened.

961
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,415
Speaker 0: You think about horse betting.

962
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:29,427
Speaker 0: They know which horse is better because they read a horsey newspaper.

963
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:29,888
Speaker 0: Maybe.

964
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:30,510
Speaker 0: Maybe.

965
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,710
Speaker 1: You know which horse is better because the odds are so meticulously done.

966
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,585
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you go on the internets to bet on something of skill, you can look up so much information on the internet.

967
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:41,270
Speaker 0: You know exactly what the fuck's going to happen.

968
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,592
Speaker 0: There's no secrets.

969
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:50,270
Speaker 0: And if you bet on something of chance, well, now we've got issues because in the real world of gambling, you've got a roulette wheel.

970
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,795
Speaker 0: No one knows where that ball's fucking going.

971
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:56,785
Speaker 0: But with a computer, you've got a hardware random number generator.

972
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:58,109
Speaker 0: Is it a block of cesium?

973
00:48:58,129 --> 00:48:58,590
Speaker 0: What do you have?

974
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,026
Speaker 0: You have a block of cesium for every virtual roulette table?

975
00:49:02,046 --> 00:49:02,510
Speaker 0: What are you using?

976
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,195
Speaker 0: I can totally fuck with that.

977
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:14,130
Speaker 0: Even if your casino was legit, the integrity of the game itself is under question because it is in software.

978
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:26,390
Speaker 1: But at least if it's regulated and tested, then the incentive is entirely on the house to maintain its integrity and odds because if it doesn't, people are going to win more often.

979
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:27,893
Speaker 0: And that could be me.

980
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:31,900
Speaker 0: But that's the psychology.

981
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,426
Speaker 1: People in college keep trying to play online poker.

982
00:49:35,446 --> 00:49:37,269
Speaker 1: They feel like, "I can game the system and

983
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:37,550
Speaker 1: win.".

984
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,233
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's happened.

985
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,078
Speaker 0: Counting cards and blackjack, same thing.

986
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:46,330
Speaker 0: We'll just see another thing like that when people are counting and figuring out random number generators.

987
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:51,990
Speaker 1: But casinos love people who try to count cards because those people usually fuck up and lose more money than they win.

988
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,799
Speaker 0: Right, but what if a computer does it for you?

989
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,010
Speaker 0: All you gotta do is have casino script kiddies.

990
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:02,849
Speaker 1: Well, notice how some casinos have single-shoe blackjack where there's just one deck of cards and they act like, "Oh, look, if you want to count cards...".

991
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,306
Speaker 1: People think, "Oh, it's one

992
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:05,569
Speaker 1: deck.".

993
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,786
Speaker 0: If you actually count cards, they kick you out and if you fail, they go,

994
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:08,947
Speaker 0: "Huh?".

995
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:22,770
Speaker 1: The tables that have single-card or single-deck or single-shoe or whatever they're going to call it usually have slight other changes to the rules related to blackjacks to where the payouts are actually less even if you do count cards.

996
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,711
Speaker 1: But I digress.

997
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:40,036
Speaker 1: Really, it's just that online gambling is in every sense a perfect example of how trust networks and encryption and security and all these things in other areas of computing apply to the real world.

998
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:44,510
Speaker 1: It's a real-world example of these things that's really easy for people to understand and analyze.

999
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:57,710
Speaker 0: And if you solve those problems, those solutions will be very applicable to other things and they'll be very worthwhile in finance or any other kind of computer security networking areas.

1000
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:10,310
Speaker 1: The solution that verifiably lets me and Scott and all our friends bet on things in a way where we can't renege and we can't cheat can be used to do allocations in the stock market just as easily or even a stock market itself.

1001
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,930
Speaker 0: Which is why anyone who could do that is just doing the stock market to begin with.

1002
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,770
Speaker 1: Why do you think I work for the stock market?

1003
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,490
Speaker 0: It's where most of the money is because that's where the bank... It's like you say the banks are where the money is.

1004
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like my favorite joke is always like, "Oh, you should work for the bank.

1005
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,862
Speaker 0: That's where the money

1006
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:24,962
Speaker 0: is.".

1007
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:27,310
Speaker 0: It's like, "Well, no, actually, the banks just put all their money in the stock

1008
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:27,450
Speaker 0: market.".

1009
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,190
Speaker 1: Scott, you should work for Grant's tomb.

1010
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where Grant is.

1011
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:32,489
Speaker 1: All the Grants.

1012
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,334
Speaker 1: All the Grants.

1013
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,346
Speaker 0: I don't need any Grants, though.

1014
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:35,970
Speaker 0: But if I do...

1015
00:51:36,252 --> 00:51:37,970
Speaker 1: I will take as many Grants as you've got.

1016
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:38,973
Speaker 0: I got two.

1017
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:40,541
Speaker 0: One and his wife.

1018
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:42,170
Speaker 0: That's the two I got.

1019
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,109
Speaker 1: Alright, I think we're good.

1020
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:51,517
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1021
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:56,550
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1024
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:09,130
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
