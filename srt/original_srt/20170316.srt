1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,724
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, March 16th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,185
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:17,477
Speaker 0: I'm not wearing a grandpa sweater And this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:26,749
Speaker 0: We ain't afraid of no sleep, and we ain't afraid of no bed busted Literally talking about beds, but not sleep only beds.

5
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:29,407
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,359
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,469
Speaker 0: uh we're back from PAX.

8
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:40,010
Speaker 0: This was the worst weather that has ever occurred out of PAX in the history of PAX as far as I can tell.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,492
Speaker 1: That is true.

10
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:44,550
Speaker 0: It was dangerously cold coupled with the fact that Boston

11
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,615
Speaker 1: It was woman cold

12
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:56,327
Speaker 0: being the city of cowards Not only forces packs to have ridiculous security where they check Everyone's bag coming in and out of the convention center and the convention center holds at one time like 40,000 people.

13
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,110
Speaker 0: But they also have metal detectors.

14
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:05,090
Speaker 0: So the lines take forever and people were trapped outside of the dangerous cold.

15
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:07,160
Speaker 0: And it was a giant shit show.

16
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,555
Speaker 1: it wasn't just witches tit cold It was like it was witches.

17
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,181
Speaker 1: lesbian orgy cold.

18
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:18,304
Speaker 1: well, which is lesbian orgy sounds great sure But it's also really cold which is don't heat up when they get it on.

19
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,670
Speaker 0: you're thinking of the wrong kind of witch.

20
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,681
Speaker 1: Imagine getting it on with like a block of ice.

21
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:26,361
Speaker 0: Maybe the Ice King is a better example.

22
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,570
Speaker 1: Well, that's what a witch is only the Ice King's a dude.

23
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:41,370
Speaker 0: But on top of all that like I put it this way it was so cold like I ski right It was cold enough to where that's the kind of weather where I say it's too cold to ski, and I don't go skiing.

24
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,582
Speaker 1: It's always too cold to ski.

25
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,749
Speaker 0: No You're just a baby.

26
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:48,502
Speaker 0: But this is kind of why I like cuz.

27
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:56,550
Speaker 0: you know we dish anime Boston this year And the reason was actually straight up cuz I know isn't it like next week or the week after or something in April sometime?

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,881
Speaker 0: I don't even know cuz I didn't you know do anything.

29
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,086
Speaker 1: It's too soon is the point.

30
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:10,717
Speaker 0: but The actual reason we skipped anime Boston this year is because the security getting an anime Boston is even more of a shit show Because I guess anime Boston doesn't have as much clout.

31
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,558
Speaker 0: so like the city does way worse security for them than they do for even packs And there's way less places.

32
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:29,606
Speaker 0: so the lines are even worse than anime Boston, but I don't know if I can ever go back to anime Boston cuz even packs East is trying my patience like The fact that I can mostly skip the line is the only reason I go to PAX East anymore.

33
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,430
Speaker 0: as much as I love packs It's a real annoying.

34
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:44,884
Speaker 0: I really hope packs leaves Boston when their contract is up with Boston because this shit is real bad And I think PAX East is going to be For the foreseeable future the only Boston convention we will ever go to.

35
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:48,477
Speaker 1: yeah when there's conventions in the Javits There's no fucking security.

36
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:51,970
Speaker 1: you can just walk right into the auto show packs prime packs, Australia.

37
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:57,596
Speaker 0: You just walk in and wander around and while San Antonio has their you know security Multiple times.

38
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:05,837
Speaker 0: I went into that line which took two seconds and the dude Literally looked at my bag that was not open looked up at me and just gave me the head nod of yeah Just go in.

39
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:06,730
Speaker 1: that's called being white.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the separate problem.

41
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:17,615
Speaker 0: But I do think that pack San Antonio is mostly just checking for people who are carrying guns in because there's weird guns Stuff in Texas.

42
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:20,470
Speaker 1: yeah, you can carry a gun outside the convention center all you want.

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,874
Speaker 1: You just can't bring it in the building because it's Texas And that's how they do.

44
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:30,821
Speaker 1: so they have to check everyone to make sure you're not trying to sneak one in there because it's totally Cool to just walk around with one right outside.

45
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:42,849
Speaker 0: well totally cool by the law But not totally cool by like modern human standards no, but all that aside uh My laundry room has been unavailable for about a week in this building.

46
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,595
Speaker 1: You haven't done laundry in a week.

47
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:48,670
Speaker 0: uh no which luckily our laundry was like a hundred percent ahead.

48
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:52,229
Speaker 1: Why don't you just bring your laundry to some nice Greek lady like I do who do it for you?

49
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,481
Speaker 0: Because we I mean the lottery in the building is nice.

50
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,186
Speaker 0: It's not like yours.

51
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:55,850
Speaker 0: that takes forever.

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,484
Speaker 1: I was like real good whatever, but you know why has it been unavailable?

53
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:08,797
Speaker 0: so the last time this happened It was because an unnamed young lady who I would guess was in her early 20s Started a fire in the dryer.

54
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:11,046
Speaker 0: because you know how do you start a fire in the dryer?

55
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:11,850
Speaker 0: what lots of ways?

56
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,149
Speaker 1: What did you put in there like?

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:13,911
Speaker 1: Matches.

58
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:18,870
Speaker 0: so the primary way dryer fires start and I know a lot about dryer fires cuz my dad was a fireman.

59
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,286
Speaker 1: So it's not empty the lint you take the lint don't throw it in one you don't empty the lint.

60
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,952
Speaker 0: and there's a surprising number Of adults.

61
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,137
Speaker 1: lint is way flammable.

62
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:31,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't know you have to do that like you would be surprised How many people literally don't know.

63
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:36,630
Speaker 0: lint traps exist own houses and have completely clogged lint traps?

64
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,770
Speaker 1: I empty the lint before and after every time I use the dryer.

65
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,222
Speaker 0: I'm like obsessed with the lint trap stuff.

66
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,106
Speaker 1: Also lint is awesome.

67
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,650
Speaker 0: We yeah Actually, I got a new shirt and something happened to me.

68
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,962
Speaker 0: That is not happening to me many years.

69
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,376
Speaker 0: at the end of the day I had a whole bunch of belly button lint.

70
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,902
Speaker 1: I have belly button every day.

71
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,770
Speaker 0: I do not get belly button lint.

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,359
Speaker 0: I guess the shirt just like you have an Audi belly button.

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,764
Speaker 0: I got a pretty deep belly button.

74
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:58,527
Speaker 0: It's just no lint.

75
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:03,307
Speaker 0: in there There's a couple is like a speck of lint.

76
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,353
Speaker 1: I guess That was it.

77
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:06,541
Speaker 1: I have like too many layers.

78
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,729
Speaker 1: I can't get to the lint hold on.

79
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,309
Speaker 0: wow We haven't done a show in a while because of the snowstorm and everything and I suddenly here's my here's my lint for today.

80
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,725
Speaker 0: I'd say there's decent amount of lint back there.

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,269
Speaker 1: It's a little guy.

82
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:29,185
Speaker 0: so anyway, the other thing that'll cause the fires is the motor burns out because you have a shitty ass dryer and While your lint trap is clean There's lint inside your dryer and all these places you have no idea about.

83
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:34,330
Speaker 1: especially you have a crappy Top-loading dry and there's a spark somewhere inside the dryer that catches the lint on fire.

84
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,413
Speaker 0: Something like that.

85
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:38,964
Speaker 0: or a wire will heat up and start a smolder of some lint.

86
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,764
Speaker 0: and then you know when the dryer kicks in And air comes pretty much all lint related.

87
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:54,890
Speaker 0: Yeah The lint if you have external lint exhaust and air exhaust lint gets in there and actually, you know You know that ours blows out the building, you know that accordion style like two people use.

88
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,161
Speaker 0: Yeah ain't supposed to use that shit that she has been deprecated.

89
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:02,394
Speaker 0: You're supposed to use straight steel Tubing like pipes.

90
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:03,238
Speaker 1: No.

91
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:10,643
Speaker 0: All right, and if you have turk corners, you should have a Steel or a pipe corner not one of those elastic foldy things.

92
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,618
Speaker 0: if you have the elastic floaty thing fully things You should clean them or replace them like every year.

93
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:19,078
Speaker 1: All right, if I see any of those around in anyone's house I'll let them know like that's bad news.

94
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:19,802
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,390
Speaker 0: There's probably a lot of lint in there.

96
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:31,563
Speaker 0: I've also seen people because I was remember we were trying to buy houses and Beacon who are literally just venting that lint like Into their walls are at it because they don't realize you're

97
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,990
Speaker 1: supposed to vent it out of your house like

98
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:40,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, like people who have a you know, the the grease hood that usually those just go back into the kitchen through the grease filter But sometimes they go out of the house.

99
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:45,109
Speaker 0: I've seen houses where they look like they're going out of the house, but they actually just go into the attic.

100
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:59,689
Speaker 1: Yeah Even in my mom's house, which is way old Right if you're in the backyard and the dryers on you can see there's this thing on the back of the house And is definitely air coming out because you can tell when you're outside if the dryers on or not.

101
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:09,950
Speaker 0: But the other cause of dryer fires are people who either put clothing That cannot be put in a dryer in a dryer that has flammable shit in it.

102
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,357
Speaker 1: What kind of clothing is this?

103
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,949
Speaker 0: some kinds of sports stuff some kinds of high-fashion stuff?

104
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,370
Speaker 0: cosplay stuff often Anything that has certain kinds of vine?

105
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,108
Speaker 1: I mean that's got to be something kind of really weird that you put.

106
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,389
Speaker 1: I mean I imagine like vinyl would just melt in there if it's too hot.

107
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,326
Speaker 0: So it might melt depending on how hot the dryer is.

108
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,030
Speaker 0: it might melt.

109
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,356
Speaker 1: But how could it start a fire?

110
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,381
Speaker 0: but that is older.

111
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,430
Speaker 0: it doesn't have to necessarily start a fire fire.

112
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:35,289
Speaker 0: Most fire fires actually just cause a lot of smoke damage.

113
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:36,593
Speaker 1: You know what?

114
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:37,035
Speaker 1: It could be.

115
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:48,250
Speaker 1: it could be something that's like that goes in there Right and heats up a whole bunch and it like traps the heat in such a way So that the cotton touching it then starts on fire.

116
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:49,937
Speaker 0: All sorts of mechanisms right.

117
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,710
Speaker 1: like the dryer itself doesn't get hot enough.

118
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,761
Speaker 1: You know it doesn't spit out hot enough air to burn cotton.

119
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,130
Speaker 1: otherwise obviously every dryer would start a fire ever.

120
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,489
Speaker 1: But maybe you could put like for example a pizza stone in there.

121
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,235
Speaker 0: Yeah don't put a pizza stone in there.

122
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:11,430
Speaker 1: and then or a piece of a pizza stone and the piece of a pizza stone keep getting Hotter and hotter and hotter as it absorbs heat and eventually some cottons touching it would ignite.

123
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,477
Speaker 1: I don't know.

124
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,130
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing that might not be possible.

125
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,770
Speaker 0: People will leave say a cell phone with a big-ass battery in their dryer in their pocket and do wash it.

126
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,834
Speaker 0: So it's nice and wet.

127
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:25,370
Speaker 1: and why is your cell phone not on your body at all times?

128
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:36,089
Speaker 0: But the other off thing that'll happen is if certain kinds of clothes if you clean them with certain kinds of solvents like fancy clothes And there's some of that solvent left that will smolder or ignite in the hot dryer.

129
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,390
Speaker 0: Lots of ways you can cause a. you can put such a heavy load that it burns out the motor and causes a smoke problem.

130
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,076
Speaker 1: Flammable is in flammable.

131
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched that episode recently.

132
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:49,276
Speaker 0: Okay, go to their old Simpsons Last night.

133
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,427
Speaker 0: We just watched the gabbo episode.

134
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:53,616
Speaker 1: He's also flow.

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,310
Speaker 0: so the first time this happened, uh We're in the apartment and we're asleep and I start I wake up and I have that danger sense.

136
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:03,469
Speaker 0: You know, sometimes you like danger sense like something's wrong.

137
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:10,959
Speaker 0: Rabbits are thumping like something's wrong and I said that rabbit warning system And I smell like a little bit of smoke.

138
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,690
Speaker 0: and you know, dad a fireman I mean there's smoke there's fine.

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:20,690
Speaker 0: I jump out of bed I'm like, ah fuck and I turn on the light and there is like this burning smell and a little bit of smoke.

140
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:28,979
Speaker 0: And it's coming in from the outside of the building as I figured out by doing some air test Trying to figure out if I wasn't in your apartment.

141
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,782
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

142
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,067
Speaker 1: Nothing fire extinguisher.

143
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:31,970
Speaker 1: I go downstairs.

144
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,510
Speaker 0: I walk down because you know don't get in the elevator duh, so I go down the stairs.

145
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,517
Speaker 0: I get to the second floor.

146
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,410
Speaker 0: the smoke smoke fire alarm wasn't going off.

147
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:42,261
Speaker 0: No I get to the first floor and it doesn't get a lot.

148
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:43,386
Speaker 0: it gets a little stronger.

149
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,613
Speaker 1: a con 911.

150
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:46,830
Speaker 0: No, cuz I'm I know what I'm doing.

151
00:09:47,190 --> 00:10:02,565
Speaker 0: I get to the ground floor and it smells like smoke and the doorman is standing there looking at this girl And she's just like I just got to go into the laundry room to check on something and he's like there was a fire in There because somebody put something they shouldn't have in the dryer.

152
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,858
Speaker 0: and she was like, it wasn't me I didn't put anything weird in there.

153
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,490
Speaker 0: I just need to check something.

154
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,263
Speaker 0: and he's like what dryer did you use?

155
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:11,296
Speaker 0: and she's like I Just need to check something.

156
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,306
Speaker 0: I just needed it was definite.

157
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:14,110
Speaker 0: It was her clothes.

158
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,739
Speaker 0: She put something in there that caused the smoke problem.

159
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,542
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

160
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:19,750
Speaker 0: The same thing happened again while we were at PAX.

161
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,241
Speaker 0: I assume it was another 20-something.

162
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,346
Speaker 0: It doesn't know how to do laundry.

163
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,070
Speaker 0: I might be wrong.

164
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,776
Speaker 0: I kind of hope it's the same person.

165
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:30,550
Speaker 1: Okay, that's never happened in my laundry or even RIT's laundry.

166
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,427
Speaker 0: I have an RIT's laundry's all the time.

167
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:33,850
Speaker 1: Didn't have one.

168
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,673
Speaker 1: I was there ever.

169
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:35,355
Speaker 1: the laundry.

170
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:39,550
Speaker 0: the laundry room in colony was shut down multiple times for people fucking up shit in there.

171
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:40,429
Speaker 1: I never had that problem.

172
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,834
Speaker 0: Someone pulled once.

173
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,178
Speaker 0: some of it was vandalism.

174
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:46,247
Speaker 0: someone filled a bunch of the washers with crayons one time.

175
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:47,150
Speaker 0: That's bad.

176
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:50,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone put a bunch of bricks in the dryer and turned it on.

177
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,006
Speaker 0: I remember that one.

178
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:51,810
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

179
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:58,810
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I currently can't do laundry unless I go to a semi-public laundromat and hopefully they will done.

180
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,878
Speaker 1: You just bring your clothes to a nice lady who will clean them.

181
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I could.

182
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:07,444
Speaker 0: that's so decadent weird though And I feel like a better use of my money would be getting a cleaning lady.

183
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:08,990
Speaker 1: It's not that much more expensive.

184
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,400
Speaker 1: It cost me like 20 bucks Which is like what it costs to run all those laundry machines.

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,109
Speaker 0: to do a load of laundry for us cost like a dollar 50 cost me 250 and the dryer costs like a dollar 250. the washer takes 23 minutes.

186
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,637
Speaker 0: The dryer takes 40 minutes.

187
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:23,765
Speaker 1: They take 40 minutes each.

188
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,215
Speaker 0: Yeah 40 minute washer.

189
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,562
Speaker 0: what the hell kind of washer do you have?

190
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,170
Speaker 1: and whatever kind of washer they got in the building.

191
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,217
Speaker 1: Top loader no side load.

192
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:31,618
Speaker 1: All right.

193
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,826
Speaker 0: It's making sure cuz top loaders are bullshit.

194
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:34,869
Speaker 1: It's the ripoff guy.

195
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:38,393
Speaker 0: That was a tangent.

196
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,175
Speaker 0: you got any news.

197
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:40,719
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

198
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:47,823
Speaker 1: they announced that they're gonna I guess this is reboot the matrix Movies, so there was only one matrix movie.

199
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:49,110
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's one of them.

200
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,710
Speaker 1: There's one matrix movie and I guess reboot doesn't mean remakes.

201
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,870
Speaker 0: They're not gonna retell the same story Which I guess is good because a big part of the matrix was that most of us went into it.

202
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,175
Speaker 0: I have no idea what it was about.

203
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,825
Speaker 1: They're gonna tell new stories in the matrix universe.

204
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,411
Speaker 0: So animatrix, that's fine I guess.

205
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:11,690
Speaker 1: I guess yeah like animatrix only live-action movies and more of them because they got no new ideas.

206
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,775
Speaker 0: My my concern.

207
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:14,576
Speaker 0: there's two ways.

208
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:15,178
Speaker 0: This could go.

209
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:20,570
Speaker 0: it could go the Star Wars like rogue one way where they're all pretty good stories.

210
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:28,470
Speaker 0: It could also go the like World-building for nerds way because I don't want to learn more about that world.

211
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:32,526
Speaker 1: Well, there was already that matrix MMO where you could learn everything you need to know about that work.

212
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:37,241
Speaker 0: Yeah Shame that that was canceled alongside those second two movies.

213
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:45,118
Speaker 1: They were planning on making yeah, you know, so Matrix is like is like it's the thing about this.

214
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:49,270
Speaker 1: right is like they're doing this constantly everywhere with everything these days.

215
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,120
Speaker 0: But I don't feel like that's a these days thing old man.

216
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,670
Speaker 0: I feel like that's just like it's the same burn rate.

217
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,238
Speaker 0: We talked about this before we went live.

218
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:02,886
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is the matrix one is Still so good, and I love it.

219
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:14,679
Speaker 0: So Is on a very short list of movies that if I'm like at a relative's house or there's a TV somewhere and that Movie is on unless something stops me.

220
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,984
Speaker 0: I'll just wherever it stops.

221
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,430
Speaker 0: I'll just watch it to the end, right?

222
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:19,618
Speaker 0: It's not episode four.

223
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,703
Speaker 0: if that's on no matter even if it's at the end of the movie beginning the movie I'm just gonna watch it.

224
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,665
Speaker 0: That's just gonna happen, right?

225
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:35,470
Speaker 1: So You know making more stuff in that universe is sort of like mmm, you know matters for some reason, right?

226
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,462
Speaker 1: Just like making more Star Wars matters.

227
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,068
Speaker 1: No, so Let's see what happens.

228
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:53,750
Speaker 0: Well, yeah The thing is Star Wars had a lot of mystique in the sense that when we were kids Star Wars was all already out And they're like there was no chance as far as we could tell of them ever making more and the toys weren't being made.

229
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:58,582
Speaker 0: So like Star Wars stuff was like this thing from a bygone age.

230
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,146
Speaker 1: All right, well think about this right?

231
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:05,164
Speaker 1: what year did Episode one the bad Star Wars movie come out?

232
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:05,967
Speaker 0: bad Star Wars.

233
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:06,690
Speaker 0: I was in high school.

234
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:13,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like 98 or 99 right when did Return of the Jedi Come out.

235
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:14,369
Speaker 0: Oh, that was what?

236
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,892
Speaker 0: 85.

237
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,142
Speaker 1: no, I think it's like 81, right?

238
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:25,677
Speaker 1: Like the year before you're born 83 83. so we were one year old.

239
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were.

240
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:26,900
Speaker 0: we were both.

241
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,061
Speaker 0: we hit.

242
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:34,109
Speaker 0: so 83 to 99 is how many years some number of years 16 years right between.

243
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,234
Speaker 0: I'm saying there was a lot more Cultural baggage.

244
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:41,565
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there were 16 years between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, right?

245
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:45,282
Speaker 1: No the matrix one Came out in what year.

246
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:52,567
Speaker 0: also in high school I think I could drive so pretty much of effectively same time as Phantom Menace.

247
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,223
Speaker 1: and How many years ago was that?

248
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:55,868
Speaker 1: Yep?

249
00:14:55,868 --> 00:15:02,850
Speaker 0: 16 or 17 1999 16 or 17 years between.

250
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:08,469
Speaker 0: But the matrix did not have extensive toy lines that were mystical to kids.

251
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,878
Speaker 0: The the matrix did not have like.

252
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:16,316
Speaker 0: you see it and your dad you're like your parents show it to you like hey Here's something you ain't ever seen.

253
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:16,918
Speaker 0: Yeah.

254
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,083
Speaker 1: Well cuz now we've seen it.

255
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's very different situations like.

256
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:25,250
Speaker 1: But I mean the matrix is not Star Wars, but it's still so good.

257
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,519
Speaker 0: I'm just not excited about the matrix reboot.

258
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:29,702
Speaker 1: who said anything about being excited.

259
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,128
Speaker 0: I'm barely even interested in it.

260
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:42,244
Speaker 0: Cuz I don't feel like There are long interesting long-form stories to tell in that world unless you get into world building Which is literally the last thing I care about.

261
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:53,030
Speaker 0: in the matrix Animatrix was only good because it was shorts that took the concept of Virtual reality world and like the fact that there's the stuff going on and told really short stories within that.

262
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:57,050
Speaker 0: But the key I think was that they were short and did not address the world itself.

263
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:09,228
Speaker 1: Just make some badass action movies with some hacking and some you know Keep the shit in the matrix or shits cool Don't none of this outside the major but the outside of the matrix was inside the matrix - done done.

264
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,190
Speaker 0: It's almost like they're just making it up as they went along.

265
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:23,490
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so this is a moderately contentious news That was around and a lot of people were reporting on this from a lot of different angles.

266
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,103
Speaker 1: You really think this is a much bigger news than I think it is.

267
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,289
Speaker 1: This is like a tiny news.

268
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:34,750
Speaker 0: It was there So a lot of people who were reporting on it were reporting on it from a particular angle to try to prove various points.

269
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:51,330
Speaker 0: But the gist of this because this is a minor drama that has happened Perennially because of the internet and the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act and the extensions to it Don't necessarily fully account for the way that the modern internet progressed.

270
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:54,606
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the last extension to it was the 1990 ish.

271
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,677
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know the.

272
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:05,666
Speaker 0: uh, so basically the story was that Berkeley Started a university University University of California, Berkeley.

273
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:10,210
Speaker 0: Yes State University started putting all the things that you know.

274
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,666
Speaker 0: They video lectures and they have one set of lectures and videos.

275
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,369
Speaker 0: That's for students.

276
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:25,646
Speaker 0: Like you're in a class you can go to a thing like watch a video lecture but they took like 5,000 of their lectures that they just happen a video of and said skirt and audio to like.

277
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:36,630
Speaker 0: some of them were just basically like Audio recordings and just put it all on YouTube and iTunes and other places for free saying hey Here's a bunch of educational content and it cost us nothing to just give it to everybody.

278
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,937
Speaker 1: Well, it cost Google something cuz.

279
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,682
Speaker 1: then what's hosting?

280
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:40,090
Speaker 0: it cost them nothing, right?

281
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,696
Speaker 0: Just put it out there for people to use.

282
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,247
Speaker 0: I believe most of it was licensed Creative Commons.

283
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:57,540
Speaker 0: Sure Basically Because of title two of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a lawsuit They were ordered to make all of that free content.

284
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,147
Speaker 0: not for students because they already comply with the ADA.

285
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:04,457
Speaker 0: for students if a student Needs an accommodation to access course required materials.

286
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:09,610
Speaker 0: They make that accommodation obviously, but they were not making those accommodations for this free public stuff.

287
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:22,544
Speaker 0: they just put out and Upon examining it they decided that there was no way they could in any reasonable timely or cost-effective fashion Make even general accommodations for all this content.

288
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,010
Speaker 0: They took it all down instead.

289
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:29,770
Speaker 0: Now they have pledged that they do want to re-release it conforming to these standards.

290
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:35,306
Speaker 0: So subtitles closed captions those sorts of things aren't those the same thing, but it?

291
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,530
Speaker 0: well, they're not actually the same thing.

292
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,529
Speaker 0: They're actually very different in subtle ways.

293
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,230
Speaker 0: That could be a whole topic of a show if you want to get into that.

294
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:48,825
Speaker 0: I waited to learn a lot about that in RIT Anime Club because we we presented subtitled screenings.

295
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:51,690
Speaker 0: We did not present closed captioning anyway.

296
00:18:53,094 --> 00:19:00,791
Speaker 0: They do want to put it all back online But that's going to be at substantial cost and it'll take a long time to do so effectively.

297
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:21,479
Speaker 0: all that stuff is offline and the debate is whether or not that Action and everything that happened here serves the intended purpose and spirit of the ADA because on one hand The ADA has to be somewhat strict because otherwise Everyone who has a profit motive will push the line and do the minimum possible to comply with it.

298
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:33,680
Speaker 0: but on the other hand You basically forced a lot of free educational material that a large number of people could use that wouldn't exist Otherwise off the internet for an indefinite period because it wasn't as compliant as it could be.

299
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:34,613
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

300
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:51,794
Speaker 0: The twist to this is that because it was licensed mostly Creative Commons bunch of nerds Downloaded it all and are making it publicly available on another website because due to technicalities They do not have to be compliant with the ADA.

301
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:52,397
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:53,281 --> 00:20:01,319
Speaker 0: So this is all a very interesting story and not being disabled and also not having Sort of like a policy expertise here.

303
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna weigh in with a very strong opinion because I have a very complex opinion and this is just a very interesting story.

304
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:23,580
Speaker 0: I'm curious to see how this all shakes down because there's a fight like for example geek nights if we had to make our lectures Closed captioned and someone wouldn't just do it for free Probably wouldn't put any of our lectures online because I couldn't afford to make that happen

305
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,401
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

306
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:30,618
Speaker 0: but at the same time we are not a state-run institution nor are we a large for-profit institution.

307
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:36,618
Speaker 0: nor you know We're a small fry and this is all just very interesting and you can read these articles to find out more about it.

308
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,407
Speaker 0: Okay, you don't have any opinion on this.

309
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:46,834
Speaker 1: I just feel like you know, I like the ADA a lot But I feel like your solution should not be.

310
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:50,158
Speaker 1: you know This doesn't make you know, you're not.

311
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:52,708
Speaker 1: this Solution doesn't solve the problem, right?

312
00:20:52,748 --> 00:21:01,800
Speaker 1: It doesn't make anything more accessible by removing if there's a Pizza place in town and the pizza place has stairs to get up to it, right?

313
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:11,600
Speaker 1: It's like you can force this pizza guy to put in a ramp if he can afford it But if he can't and you force him to close all you did was make things worse for everyone.

314
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,109
Speaker 1: You didn't make the world a better place.

315
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,880
Speaker 1: You need a different solution, right?

316
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,380
Speaker 1: You know find a way to get money for the pizza guy to build a ramp.

317
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,017
Speaker 1: Don't find a way to just shut him down if he can't build one.

318
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:25,760
Speaker 0: Yep Well, I think it specifically comes down to taking but also don't not do anything.

319
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,472
Speaker 0: It is let a pizza guy operate with a staircase But in the case of taking existing media and making it.

320
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,260
Speaker 0: making it online as opposed to not making it online.

321
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:46,999
Speaker 0: You're sort of forced to not make it online if you are I guess held to the standards of the ADA because you're that kind of organization Which means you're most likely not going to make it online because you were gonna make it.

322
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:49,600
Speaker 0: You're only putting online because it cost you nothing to do so.

323
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:58,920
Speaker 1: I mean, this is the another thing is, you know In general, I see a lot of people putting stuff online and then putting it online in such a way that it gets taken down.

324
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:05,380
Speaker 1: It's like dudes just anonymously bit torrent that shit and then there's no one can take credit for it.

325
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,675
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of people don't do that Specifically because they want to take credit like fansub.

326
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:14,800
Speaker 1: people want to take credit So they won't just put some anonymous fansub on the internet.

327
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,205
Speaker 1: You know people make like some.

328
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:16,686
Speaker 1: there's.

329
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,680
Speaker 1: Nintendo has gone around hitting a lot of people who made like remakes of Nintendo games.

330
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,870
Speaker 1: There's that like 3d chrono trigger remake.

331
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,593
Speaker 1: They got shut down.

332
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,160
Speaker 1: Remember that it's like dudes.

333
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:40,440
Speaker 1: If you just didn't put your shit on a website that was identifiable and track trackable to you and just put builds up on bit Tor anonymously, there would be no one to send a takedown notice to and the whole internet could enjoy whatever awesome thing that you're making.

334
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:45,540
Speaker 1: It's simply your greed of wanting to take credit that is preventing this beautiful sharing of artwork.

335
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:51,790
Speaker 1: If I was Berkeley and I realized I mean they didn't realize it to begin with Right, I would just be like, oh, okay.

336
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:52,955
Speaker 1: Take it off my website.

337
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,462
Speaker 1: put it on bit torrent myself So I will.

338
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,687
Speaker 1: I will do that.

339
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:56,450
Speaker 1: who did that?

340
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,293
Speaker 1: I don't know that one.

341
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:04,960
Speaker 0: It's a four terabyte archive Sure, but to most people they only know how to use YouTube to see anything.

342
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:07,739
Speaker 0: So putting it on bit torrent basically means no one will see it.

343
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,813
Speaker 1: You can ask me if some something is something people want now.

344
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,836
Speaker 0: people don't know why it.

345
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:13,900
Speaker 1: torrent is so easy.

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,304
Speaker 0: There's so many people want to watch like their TV shows their cartoons and rather than using a bit torrent To see them legit.

347
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:23,096
Speaker 0: They watch those like mono audio.

348
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:27,043
Speaker 0: That's distorted Thing.

349
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:32,860
Speaker 1: I've been complaining about pretty much my whole life is people would rather do hard work and get shitty results and learn something.

350
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:33,880
Speaker 1: It's so easy.

351
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,572
Speaker 1: You literally click a link with a magnet next to it and the file downloads.

352
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:41,384
Speaker 1: then you double click the file and it opens in VLC it does.

353
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,776
Speaker 1: how is it really that I mean, yes, it's easier to go on YouTube.

354
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:45,940
Speaker 1: where you go to a website click.

355
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,572
Speaker 0: So I think it's like it's like two less steps.

356
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:50,836
Speaker 0: downloading is not their problem.

357
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:51,980
Speaker 0: they don't know how to find the stuff.

358
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,366
Speaker 0: You can't just go to pirate Bay.

359
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:55,833
Speaker 0: Pirate Bay is getting pretty bad.

360
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,360
Speaker 1: Pirate Bay has never failed for me.

361
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,810
Speaker 0: I can think of a lot of things pirate Bay will not have Or any torrent site that's legit.

362
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,140
Speaker 1: you type in the thing you want you see a link to that thing.

363
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,495
Speaker 1: You click it you click the thing with the magnet next to it.

364
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:08,099
Speaker 1: It downloads.

365
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,706
Speaker 0: A lot of things are not available.

366
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:13,500
Speaker 1: They're just saying oh, those are things you shouldn't be watching because everything that I watch is on there.

367
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:14,644
Speaker 0: Okay, mr.

368
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:19,120
Speaker 0: Only watches Korean dramas, I don't watch any Korean drama only Korean music videos.

369
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:26,773
Speaker 0: Those are on YouTube for legally This library site quote until library launches to the public in April.

370
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:29,920
Speaker 0: The videos are only accessible to technical users via the command line.

371
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:34,078
Speaker 0: Okay They have a command line for this.

372
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,733
Speaker 0: Here's a guide to access library UC Berkeley.

373
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:39,720
Speaker 0: What do we have is if I click on this in a browser?

374
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:52,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, the browser does not handle LBRY colon but anyway things of the day.

375
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:57,984
Speaker 0: so You guys know that I'm variously for whatever reason.

376
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,510
Speaker 0: I know a lot about nuclear weapons.

377
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:03,182
Speaker 0: So many people have been messaging me or emailing me evil.

378
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,390
Speaker 0: That's why I'm tweeting at me to tell me this exists.

379
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,589
Speaker 0: Yes, I know it exists and it is now my thing of the day.

380
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:25,130
Speaker 0: basically, uh a whole bunch of videos of Atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons like the named ones like hardtack and The ones in the islands, yep, but mostly the ones that are on the a tolls, but also some that were in the desert.

381
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:32,970
Speaker 0: Videos of these have been declassified and they're all being scanned in and ultra high quality and just put on YouTube.

382
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,499
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I've already seen a whole bunch of these.

383
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,064
Speaker 1: so I guess there's more that we didn't see.

384
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:41,923
Speaker 0: there are hundreds There are 216 tests and there are.

385
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:48,639
Speaker 0: I think they didn't destroy the world and they're between Thousand films of these.

386
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,150
Speaker 1: Oh, cuz they're felt multiple films of each one.

387
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, different angles close and far and also there's I mean what's to be classified?

388
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:56,650
Speaker 1: It's a big mushroom cloud.

389
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,570
Speaker 1: Well, so depending what can you learn from watching it?

390
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:06,387
Speaker 0: You can learn a lot because remember atmospheric testing is banned and most nuclear testing is banned.

391
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:06,929
Speaker 0: actually good.

392
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:13,932
Speaker 0: The only way nuclear weapons can be developed is mostly by trial and error because the engineering problems are Immense.

393
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:18,649
Speaker 1: these videos contain like zoom in details of the bombs like insides before they like.

394
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:29,989
Speaker 0: now it's just a lot of stuff gets classified because While the individual data in general related nuclear weapons, the individual data are not particularly useful to making a nuclear weapon.

395
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,150
Speaker 0: Correlating pieces of information from disparate sources has let people figure some shit out.

396
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,470
Speaker 0: There probably should not have been figured out by those people.

397
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,753
Speaker 1: I do not think that watching videos of mushroom clouds will teach you how to make So some.

398
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:51,033
Speaker 0: in the early days videos like this could be used to estimate yields thus estimating nuclear Capabilities.

399
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:58,130
Speaker 0: but in the modern era these videos are not particularly useful for that purpose So they wouldn't be wouldn't declassify them if they were useful.

400
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:07,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is they've been declassified now because in the modern era they are probably not as useful or it is now Cost effective to make them public.

401
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:08,662
Speaker 0: Mmm.

402
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:15,985
Speaker 0: So these videos are fascinating because many of them are Views of nuclear weapons that you never could have seen before.

403
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:25,756
Speaker 0: some of them are slow motion Video extremely slow motion of the frame by frame of the actual reaction and the plasma ball itself Mm-hmm add some scary shit.

404
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:27,220
Speaker 0: and these things are kind of amazing though.

405
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:37,582
Speaker 0: A lot of the videos are just black Forever and then a white thing appears in the distance and then black again because There's a lot of videos for different purposes.

406
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:40,935
Speaker 0: if you're a nuclear enthusiast These are all fascinating.

407
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,467
Speaker 0: and the cool thing is if you watch a video, they're all classified.

408
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:45,852
Speaker 0: It's like the one on this page I'm looking at.

409
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:47,441
Speaker 0: is the nutmeg.

410
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,977
Speaker 0: I guess launch or the nutmeg Detonation from operation heart attack one.

411
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:56,287
Speaker 0: you go to Wikipedia and read exactly what the deal was with that.

412
00:27:56,327 --> 00:28:01,845
Speaker 1: individual tests Like did they just like put these bombs down run the fuck away and then set them off?

413
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,250
Speaker 1: or did they drop them from planes?

414
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,336
Speaker 1: Or did they shoot them for summer?

415
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,810
Speaker 0: all different kinds all different guys all different kinds.

416
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,548
Speaker 1: I want to watch some of the submarine ones.

417
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,658
Speaker 0: There's a famous video of a submarine launch.

418
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:13,546
Speaker 0: That is okay you to watch.

419
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,755
Speaker 1: they didn't The bomb part.

420
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,161
Speaker 1: I want to see how the submarine shoots it.

421
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:18,427
Speaker 0: Uh, those exist.

422
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,130
Speaker 0: I'll send you some links.

423
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:20,267
Speaker 0: Those are cool.

424
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:24,025
Speaker 1: But though these are these are the surface and then open up a hole on top.

425
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:26,714
Speaker 1: or can it shoot it from when it's on From under the water.

426
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, so just a missile just comes out from under the water basically.

427
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:31,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's scary shit.

428
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:31,870
Speaker 0: Yeah it is.

429
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,979
Speaker 0: But yeah, these are videos of the explosions primarily.

430
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:37,600
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,305

00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:48,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's in a commercial selling you something.

435
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:56,866
Speaker 1: the thing he is selling you is Manischewitz wine, but not just any manischewitz wine not the shit you get on Passover.

00:28:57,387 --> 00:29:01,594
Speaker 1: He's selling you Almanetta Manischewitz one like almond.

437
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:04,582
Speaker 1: It is almond flavored manischewitz wine.

438
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:05,705
Speaker 1: I don't know if they still make it.

439
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,247
Speaker 1: It might.

440
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,753
Speaker 0: that sounds Horrifying.

441
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:09,377
Speaker 1: I don't know.

442
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:10,483
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna drink the shit.

443
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:11,689
Speaker 1: I don't have to find out.

444
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 1: But Sam Davis jr.

445
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,886
Speaker 1: Says you should drink it.

446
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:15,510
Speaker 1: Maybe you should.

447
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:16,557
Speaker 0: All right.

448
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:16,919
Speaker 0: Let's see.

449
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,390
Speaker 0: I'm looking at a wine website.

450
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:23,528
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah Cream almanada, I guess you can get it.

451
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,077
Speaker 0: Okay, this website's bad.

452
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,122
Speaker 0: I give up.

453
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:28,905
Speaker 0: Okay.

454
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:30,110
Speaker 0: I don't want to taste this.

455
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:33,476
Speaker 1: Sammy says otherwise know what?

456
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:39,882
Speaker 0: so everywhere I click on seems to say email us and we'll tell you Look, I don't think you can get it.

457
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the all the Google I'm finding actually comes back to that.

458
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:53,458
Speaker 1: Sammy Definitely existed at one point when Sam Davis jr.

459
00:29:53,478 --> 00:30:00,948
Speaker 1: Was young when Jewish wine was big with Gentiles - When you couldn't get a lot of other wine shortly after prohibition.

460
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,627
Speaker 0: Many oh my god, this just the more I look at this the more terrified I am of it.

461
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,766
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can get some other almond wine and to see how I like amaretto, but that's a cordial.

462
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:14,508
Speaker 1: It's not wine.

463
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a cordial.

464
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:19,177
Speaker 1: This is grapes plus almonds in the same.

465
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:22,507
Speaker 0: that does not feel good at best.

466
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:25,270
Speaker 0: at best That'll be the same as making like an oatmeal.

467
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:25,715
Speaker 1: I mean, it's.

468
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:33,399
Speaker 1: I don't sure I don't drink wine But imagining having almonds on my left hand and grapes in my right hand and shove it in both of my face at the same Time and that's not the worst.

469
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:37,032
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Hmm.

470
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:42,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I could mix a little bit of amaretto with like a super sweet wine.

471
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,919
Speaker 0: We could try it and see what that tastes like.

472
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,198
Speaker 1: I could just take my grape juice and Put some home and eat some almonds.

473
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,439
Speaker 1: You need some drink drink some grape juice while the almond Want an almond extract of some kind.

474
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,630
Speaker 0: I could give you a tincture of almond drops and get almond butter.

475
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:00,244
Speaker 0: I I don't think almond butter is gonna do it.

476
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:04,950
Speaker 0: I don't think you want to mix Butter with your beverage unless you're making a sitting bull.

477
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,505
Speaker 0: I mean just like almond butter, which is a cocktail that if anyone actually orders that in a bar.

478
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:10,750
Speaker 0: My hat is off to you.

479
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,842
Speaker 0: Look at what a sitting bull is and you'll enjoy it.

480
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:18,399
Speaker 1: You're gonna get a Harvey while banger In the meta moment.

481
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,850
Speaker 0: we were just at PAX East.

482
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:23,190
Speaker 0: I will try to get the video up of our panel as soon as I have a chance.

483
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:28,198
Speaker 0: I've been busy with a lot of other stuff and I'll be out of town this weekend So hopefully sometime by next week.

484
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,022
Speaker 0: I will get that going.

485
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,022
Speaker 0: our next con is kinetic on.

486
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:37,024
Speaker 0: maybe kinetic on and like July and zinc icon, I guess I'll be at that.

487
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:44,543
Speaker 0: you won't be at probably and Pax prime and I'll probably be at PAX Australia this year.

488
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,449
Speaker 0: That's probably gonna happen guys.

489
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,357
Speaker 0: Well, so, uh people keep bugging me.

490
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:49,441
Speaker 0: you keep that every year.

491
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:49,963
Speaker 0: you guys like.

492
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,449
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you come back to PAX OS.

493
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,744
Speaker 0: Pretty likely I'm coming back this year.

494
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:56,720
Speaker 0: You come with me.

495
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:57,809
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see.

496
00:31:58,852 --> 00:31:59,858
Speaker 0: You can decide way later.

497
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,770
Speaker 0: cuz if I'm going I'm putting the panels in anyway.

498
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,242
Speaker 1: I'm playing a lot of Zelda right now cuz you know, I don't play some Zelda.

499
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,670
Speaker 1: So I I set up this thing.

500
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,895
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty good.

501
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:09,719
Speaker 1: I highly recommend it.

502
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,687
Speaker 1: It's been working terrifically called restream.io.

503
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,035
Speaker 1: They they have a website.

504
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:21,516
Speaker 1: you make an account and then you stream to them with RTMP and they stream to YouTube and Twitch And maybe even other places at the same time.

505
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:26,247
Speaker 1: so you can watch me play Zelda either on YouTube or twitch.

506
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:29,499
Speaker 1: Whoa Two different channels whichever one you like better.

507
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:32,130
Speaker 1: You can use that and watch me play Zelda.

508
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:41,170
Speaker 1: And if you it's better if people chat to me because then I have things to say and it won't just be me sitting there Quietly, you're not gonna be like welcome to my live stream up gamers.

509
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,459
Speaker 1: No, that's not how I do.

510
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,950
Speaker 1: But if you talk to me, I'll talk to you.

511
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,590
Speaker 1: So, you know, otherwise, I'm just sitting there collecting, you know, spirit orbs and it's not exciting.

512
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:51,856
Speaker 0: Well, it's like if I did.

513
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,850
Speaker 0: people keep asking me do a live stream of sieve.

514
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,402
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand what a live stream of me playing sieve is like.

515
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:05,950
Speaker 0: it's literally me staring at the screen Suddenly moving a bunch of stuff around and then going into like menus full of numbers and staring at them for like a minute.

516
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is it's.

517
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:07,957
Speaker 1: it's weird, right?

518
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:11,510
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure out this sort of like chicken and egg problem of streaming.

519
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,559
Speaker 1: It's like the people have exciting streams.

520
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,017
Speaker 1: They can do it because they have a. they're popular already They have this big old chat full of people.

521
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:26,150
Speaker 1: and because they have a big old chat full of people they can like really get Some action going right when you play lighter games and you have banter going like all the time.

522
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:33,289
Speaker 1: But like if I if there's not even I don't need thousands of people I just need like, you know 20 people and like at least one or two of them.

523
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:42,050
Speaker 1: So at any given moment at least one or two are paying attention or saying something and then I can keep you know The talking going while the streaming is happening.

524
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,310
Speaker 1: It won't just be me video of me being quiet while the game is playing.

525
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:52,703
Speaker 0: The other option is to do like my advanced war streams where you know enough about the game where you are Constantly talking about the game in detail.

526
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can do that.

527
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,021
Speaker 1: But the problem is is like I run out of materials like I did Faxanadu and I talked a whole bunch of the beginning of Faxanadu.

528
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,150
Speaker 1: then I ran out of material and then it got quiet.

529
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:08,629
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever ran out of material on my old advanced war stream Zelda 1 I did a pretty good job because there was always something to say the whole time.

530
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:13,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, I say everything I know about the game and then it's just me playing the rest of it.

531
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:18,710
Speaker 0: I should bring those advanced war streams back anyway, I Haven't done that.

532
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,072
Speaker 0: When did I?

533
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:19,554
Speaker 0: let's do that?

534
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:20,076
Speaker 0: That's what.

535
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:22,184
Speaker 1: that's some content for you while rim is away.

536
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:22,545
Speaker 1: Whatever.

537
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,072
Speaker 0: Yeah, February 2015.

538
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:29,947
Speaker 0: Whoa, a lot of people watch that one Like way more than I thought I'm gonna be doing a lot of switch streaming.

539
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,597
Speaker 1: in general I got it all like set up.

540
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,889
Speaker 1: So it's not a lot of effort for me to just keep doing it.

541
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,402
Speaker 1: So once I finish Zelda, I'll probably move on to some others these comments.

542
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,110
Speaker 0: who the hell was watching my advanced wars?

543
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:39,773
Speaker 1: I'm sure though.

544
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,319
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of advanced wars content.

545
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,303
Speaker 1: It's people like advanced.

546
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:42,563
Speaker 1: Wow.

547
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:46,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, these comments are all like But worth nitpicking.

548
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,384
Speaker 0: you didn't move your bomber south of the AAS on that base.

549
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:51,069
Speaker 0: You kept attacking on this one turn.

550
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,793
Speaker 0: Dude.

551
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:57,074
Speaker 0: okay, I'm not gonna argue with you, but maybe that was a better move I am confident.

552
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:58,644
Speaker 0: I made the correct decision in the street.

553
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,590
Speaker 1: You didn't even know what you did.

554
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,961
Speaker 0: I am real fucking good at advanced war.

555
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,664
Speaker 1: How do you remember?

556
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,950
Speaker 1: Maybe that guy's the one who can beat you.

557
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,833
Speaker 0: It's lands end.

558
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:07,142
Speaker 0: I know that map like inside and out.

559
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:09,230
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's the one that's shaped like Italy.

560
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,274
Speaker 1: Let's talk about beds.

561
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:12,903
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah beds.

562
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:20,213
Speaker 0: I've been using the same mattress for Years.

563
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,739
Speaker 1: doesn't it like get worn out?

564
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:22,280
Speaker 1: and me?

565
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,445
Speaker 0: it's a super.

566
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:24,970
Speaker 0: it's like a double pillow top.

567
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,529
Speaker 0: It's like oh, it's more than a foot thick.

568
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,836
Speaker 1: I don't like them pillow top.

569
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,610
Speaker 0: and it's on top of a box spring because it's an old-style bed.

570
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:32,830
Speaker 0: Oh, well, and then it's got member.

571
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,986
Speaker 0: I bought the slats to replace the slats that broke because they were like a hundred years old.

572
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,070
Speaker 0: because it's an ancient bed.

573
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:39,709
Speaker 1: That's fine.

574
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:47,236
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm thinking about getting a new mattress because I bed technology has changed a lot and the box spring is Obsolete.

575
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,730
Speaker 1: matches are tough, right?

576
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,082
Speaker 1: Cuz you know how they rip you off right and it's like you have this.

577
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:52,390
Speaker 1: this weird thing that goes on.

578
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,193
Speaker 1: We're number one.

579
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,561
Speaker 1: you go to the mattress store, especially sleepies.

580
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,102
Speaker 1: Don't go there.

581
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:59,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're super regulated and like the mattress The industry is kind of fucked up.

582
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,970
Speaker 1: It's like they try to rip you off and charge you a fortune for this mattress.

583
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,489
Speaker 1: It's not worth the fortune, right?

584
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:10,530
Speaker 1: But then on the other hand on the other hand a more expensive mattress is clearly superior.

585
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:13,099
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's like and you gotta try it out.

586
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,443
Speaker 0: You can't just buy one online cuz?

587
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,306
Speaker 0: you don't know right?

588
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,771
Speaker 1: How do I Cuz?

589
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:21,186
Speaker 1: it's something like a mattress and this is this a line that mattress salesman will tell you.

590
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,190
Speaker 1: but it's also true.

591
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,466
Speaker 1: You sleep on this thing Hopefully eight hours a day, right?

592
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,570
Speaker 1: Every goddamn day you use your mattress probably as much as if not more than you use your computer.

593
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:35,802
Speaker 1: It is one of the most important things.

594
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:43,270
Speaker 1: you own it also slowly Your vital juices and oils I'm saying of all the things you own you use that thing a lot.

595
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:50,270
Speaker 0: So getting a good one is Well case in point remember that show we did where Scott and I back and we didn't have a lot of money.

596
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,519
Speaker 0: Bought our fancy chairs, right?

597
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,477
Speaker 1: Exactly, right in this chair no matter how Or you are.

598
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,970
Speaker 1: a good mattress is a good investment and that's you know.

599
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:04,250
Speaker 1: It's like a thing mattress salesman that are sleazy will tell you but it's also a true thing.

600
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,886
Speaker 1: But not true thing they tell you is like woo woo.

601
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,899
Speaker 1: We're like this mattress will heal your energies.

602
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,508
Speaker 1: and but right it cost five hundred dollars more.

603
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:13,150
Speaker 1: get this one.

604
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck you Right.

605
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:22,468
Speaker 0: the ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves Covered with skins or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss.

606
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:24,879
Speaker 0: Sure I'm not in the Wikipedia page for bad.

607
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,185
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I'm gonna look at here.

608
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,899
Speaker 1: We're not ancient though We're modern so we don't do that.

609
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:33,517
Speaker 0: But yeah, so, uh I'm a rock in the queen-size bed.

610
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,210
Speaker 0: I remember in RIT because you had a like a tiny bed.

611
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,649
Speaker 0: Was that a single or a twin?

612
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,177
Speaker 0: Like that's how you had.

613
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:44,930
Speaker 0: you basically slept on a cot at RIT I mean, I just I arrived at college.

614
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:55,470
Speaker 0: They would go into our bedroom because one of the computers in there and they would always Always no matter what comment on the fact that I had this gigantic bed and Scott had a car in college.

615
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:57,630
Speaker 1: You know the fact that we're in college.

616
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,500
Speaker 1: It was unusual for you to have a gigantic bed in

617
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:11,740
Speaker 0: our apartment was like people would look at our window and bother us sometimes Just because if you walked around colony and looked in people's windows I think we were the only apartment in the entire place that had real furniture Maybe like we had an actual couch.

618
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,530
Speaker 0: we had like a wine cabinet, right?

619
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't unusual for you to have a tiny bed in college.

620
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:18,430
Speaker 1: It was unusual for you to have a large one.

621
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:19,655
Speaker 0: Yeah great eyes.

622
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:26,470
Speaker 1: as soon as he moved into colony we Went over to the furniture store and I bought the cheapest bed they had because it was a college bed.

623
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:27,859
Speaker 0: But it's still like my whole life.

624
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,036
Speaker 0: as soon as I had a bedroom by myself I have always used a queen bed.

625
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:34,088
Speaker 0: queen bed has always been the minimum size of a bed for one.

626
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:36,437
Speaker 0: Mmm, I cannot I have.

627
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:46,318
Speaker 0: I do not like sleeping on twin beds and a single that did Might as well be a coffin Because I like to I like to.

628
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,950
Speaker 0: I form the starfish if I'm in a bed.

629
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:54,263
Speaker 1: Well, there's a full-size bed, which is like it's weird Like you hardly ever see a full-size bed because but I had one.

630
00:38:54,283 --> 00:39:00,730
Speaker 1: this is a weird size I guess bigger than twin and smaller than Queen but it's it's big enough for one person sleeping there.

631
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:10,669
Speaker 0: My parents when I was a kid had a king-size bed in the bedroom like big-ass bed But partly because you know adults but - we had dogs and the dogs want to sleep on the bed.

632
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:11,822
Speaker 1: Have you got dogs?

633
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:12,530
Speaker 1: You need the king-size?

634
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, a queen-size bed plus any number of dogs not gonna work.

635
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,170
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be tiny tiny dog.

636
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, we never had tiny dogs.

637
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,009
Speaker 0: We had real dogs.

638
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,984
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know people make a big deal about bed size and it's like.

639
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:36,090
Speaker 1: clearly king-size is superior But if you're just one person as long as the bed is big enough to contain your body within its edges It's got to contain your body and your expected sprawl, right?

640
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,863
Speaker 0: You know as long as it has got to be queen-size unless you sleep like a dead vampire.

641
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:45,770
Speaker 1: No, I mean full-size is Big enough to hold an average adult person, right?

642
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,770
Speaker 1: But maybe you're like fucking Andre the Giant and the king-size isn't even big enough.

643
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,079
Speaker 0: Well get a king-size sleep on it sideways.

644
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,890
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, you know, it depends on your body.

645
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,640
Speaker 1: You just need a bed big enough for your body.

646
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:58,470
Speaker 1: What if you're a tiny person?

647
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,617
Speaker 1: You don't even need a full-size.

648
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,427
Speaker 1: You could fit in a twin size like right in the middle.

649
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,852
Speaker 0: No problem I'm pretty.

650
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:06,990
Speaker 0: there was a. I feel like there was a time where the double queen was in fashion.

651
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,615
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm looking at bed sizes now.

652
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,564
Speaker 0: So small single or cot are all the same.

653
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:14,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's that's even baby.

654
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,637
Speaker 0: There's single twin or bunk.

655
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:17,339
Speaker 0: They're all the same.

656
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,764
Speaker 0: There's an extra long twin.

657
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,230
Speaker 1: I've never seen an extra long twin.

658
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:25,700
Speaker 0: All right, there's a Olympic queen Expanded super California.

659
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,166
Speaker 0: What the fuck are all here?

660
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:30,706
Speaker 1: Here's a chart Like an aspect ratio chart.

661
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:36,625
Speaker 1: Yeah So California King is slightly longer and slightly less wider than a regular.

662
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:36,765
Speaker 1: can?

663
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,430
Speaker 0: it seems like the stupidest possible?

664
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:45,547
Speaker 1: Unless you're really tall, I guess a king is actually not any longer than Queen.

665
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:46,510
Speaker 1: It's just a little bit wider.

666
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the Queen though.

667
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:52,382
Speaker 0: I always thought of you know twin full Seven feet tall the king isn't long enough.

668
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:53,709
Speaker 1: I guess you need the California King.

669
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,410
Speaker 1: I guess that extra few inches, but even that might not be long.

670
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:56,997
Speaker 0: That's why cuz.

671
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:03,569
Speaker 0: in McMansions there was a time because I remember talking to real estate agents where they always talk about how this bedroom will fit a double queen.

672
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:08,580
Speaker 0: cuz Double queen seemed to be the thing whatever And there'd be two queen beds.

673
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,164
Speaker 1: the point is as you can see on this chart This is a full-size bed is a reasonably sized bed.

674
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,250
Speaker 1: You just don't see them too often.

675
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:17,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz but twin is way too small.

676
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,441
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you're an adult Yeah, if you're a child and you fit on one is not a problem.

677
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,918
Speaker 0: even as a child middle school high school I had a queen-size bed.

678
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,136
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Enough of that bed sizes, right?

679
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:33,770
Speaker 1: The point I'm gonna make is that a harder mattress is bullshit and you'll die you want.

680
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,216
Speaker 0: Ideally, you want a pillow top slab.

681
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,121
Speaker 0: just sink into it.

682
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:42,690
Speaker 1: pillow tops are for babies and princesses who worried about peas and shit.

683
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:44,025
Speaker 0: I'm real worried about peas.

684
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:46,896
Speaker 0: now It's like my mouse right if there is.

685
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:52,900
Speaker 0: if there is so much as a speck of sand under my mouse pad I know I don't feel it.

686
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,465
Speaker 1: I'll feel it.

687
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,913
Speaker 1: but Bed now.

688
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,504
Speaker 1: the bed should be like a slab of granite with a sheet on it.

689
00:41:58,665 --> 00:41:59,026
Speaker 1: So it's not.

690
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:00,092
Speaker 0: why don't you sleep on the Floor?

691
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,001
Speaker 0: then why don't you get a futon?

692
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:01,748
Speaker 0: Why even have a bed?

693
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,220
Speaker 0: So the Japanese futon the problem.

694
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:07,750
Speaker 1: sleeping on the floor that shit is cold.

695
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:08,874
Speaker 0: It's not cold.

696
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:10,200
Speaker 0: If you're living a nice place.

697
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,164
Speaker 1: No, it's cool.

698
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,329
Speaker 0: Our floor is not cool.

699
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,191
Speaker 0: fine Then get.

700
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:17,382
Speaker 0: why don't you actually get like an elevated futon of some kind?

701
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,350
Speaker 1: because it's not hard and it's not the right.

702
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:20,952
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

703
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:21,997
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna get it.

704
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:26,716
Speaker 1: You just gotta get an extra firm mattress actual mattress But also extra firms.

705
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,550
Speaker 1: you lay on it and it moves a tiny bit.

706
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,582
Speaker 1: So it fits the shape of your body because your body isn't flat right.

707
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,730
Speaker 1: it fits the shape of your body moving.

708
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,154
Speaker 0: That's called being soft.

709
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:42,049
Speaker 1: It fits the shape of your body, but then Every part where it touches your body has no give.

710
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,915
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, it's like.

711
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:45,500
Speaker 1: it's like if someone but that's not.

712
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,765
Speaker 0: That's like memory foam.

713
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:51,960
Speaker 1: No memory foam squishes too much right a firm mattress.

714
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,125
Speaker 0: How can it squish too much?

715
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:54,049
Speaker 0: once you sink into it?

716
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,274
Speaker 0: Everything has equal pressure.

717
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:59,489
Speaker 1: then you're all sunken in like Like an adult.

718
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:00,253
Speaker 0: I hate that shit.

719
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,122
Speaker 1: no sleep my side I.

720
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:08,480
Speaker 0: so I actually I think part of our disagreement is that I'm pretty skinny and my bony em stick way out.

721
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:15,325
Speaker 0: a big big chunks of my body can be described as Antlers encased in skin.

722
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:16,227
Speaker 1: I have that.

723
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:21,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I sleep on my side for one my arm Will fall asleep.

724
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:22,448
Speaker 1: that happens to me a lot.

725
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:24,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, no matter what not no matter what.

726
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:29,524
Speaker 0: but unless I twist a month or so and Also, I crush my balls.

727
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:31,692
Speaker 1: I don't have that problem.

728
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:36,491
Speaker 0: unless I put a spacer pillow between the knees I could just push my balls out front.

729
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:38,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can push them out front, but that shit ain't comfortable.

730
00:43:39,262 --> 00:43:39,965
Speaker 1: I don't really have problems.

731
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,720
Speaker 0: I do like the hip splay, but then that's not comfortable.

732
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:43,988
Speaker 1: I don't really have a problem with that.

733
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:48,966
Speaker 1: I actually do sleep on my back Just like way back.

734
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,274
Speaker 1: are they like growing out of your taint instead of out of the front?

735
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:55,227
Speaker 0: they actually have a pretty sizable Roaming range.

736
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:59,949
Speaker 1: let's say How close are they?

737
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:01,340
Speaker 1: are they much closer to your asshole?

738
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,194
Speaker 0: I think no, I think they ever.

739
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:03,980
Speaker 0: they have quite a range.

740
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:10,053
Speaker 0: I think it's just that my thighs are actually really thick Really big sure like I cannot.

741
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:13,169
Speaker 0: if I close my legs together I will crush them right now.

742
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,277
Speaker 1: so another important aspect of a bed Not just the mattress which is the most important part of the bed because it's the part that's actually functional right.

743
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:23,098
Speaker 1: the other parts are Just like decorations that hold the mattress up off the ground unless you have.

744
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,926
Speaker 0: so There's the difference between.

745
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,679
Speaker 0: like there's a modern beds often are much lower to the ground.

746
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:31,040
Speaker 1: Then older beds where I don't understand why you want a high up bed.

747
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,491
Speaker 1: It's like what you want to climb into that shit.

748
00:44:32,632 --> 00:44:34,724
Speaker 1: just keep it down low So it's easy to get into.

749
00:44:34,764 --> 00:44:36,733
Speaker 1: and if higher up is warmer you want.

750
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:38,440
Speaker 1: by your own definition higher up is warmer.

751
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,563
Speaker 1: It's barely warmer.

752
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not warm enough to make a difference.

753
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,235
Speaker 1: Your thermometer would not change.

754
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,760
Speaker 0: also being up high is kind of nice.

755
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:53,309
Speaker 1: No, if you're in a bunk bed you want That is at a height at which if you sit down on it It is a chair levels.

756
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:55,179
Speaker 1: That way it can also be used as a chair.

757
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:57,551
Speaker 0: Never sit on the side of your bed.

758
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:58,940
Speaker 0: I like to jump up into my bed.

759
00:44:59,021 --> 00:45:03,952
Speaker 1: You can sit on the side of your bed and put your slippers on Or sit on the side of it and then swing your legs into it.

760
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,660
Speaker 0: also higher a bed means storage underneath.

761
00:45:06,243 --> 00:45:09,440
Speaker 1: I mean every bed should have a little storage underneath unless it's one of those ultra modern beds.

762
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,793
Speaker 0: That's basically like way low to the ground making a bed.

763
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,920
Speaker 1: That's literally on the ground.

764
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,485
Speaker 1: It's just sacrificing storage space.

765
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,132
Speaker 0: also super high up bed means the rabbits can't jump into it.

766
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:17,875
Speaker 1: Well, that's the end.

767
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,239
Speaker 1: cause trouble different problem.

768
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:24,218
Speaker 0: That is a very specific problem to our household.

769
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:28,379
Speaker 0: So yeah, Scott if you're in a bunk bed you want the upper bunk in the lower bunk.

770
00:45:29,263 --> 00:45:29,886
Speaker 1: I don't really care.

771
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,332
Speaker 0: You really Wow, really?

772
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:38,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why people care so much I mean when you're a kid the up one is so fun Right because I say you fall out of it like I did at RIT.

773
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:43,940
Speaker 1: Well, the point is the top part is so fun like we right until you roll out of bed.

774
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:50,331
Speaker 1: But the bottom part is like ah so luxurious Right, and especially the bunk beds we had when I was a kid.

775
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:52,680
Speaker 1: the bottom part was full and the top part was twin.

776
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,719
Speaker 1: So it was like the bottom part was way better.

777
00:45:56,532 --> 00:46:05,820
Speaker 0: But I do like the super soft pillow top Because I don't I just I enjoy the very calm soft comfy like sink into it very decadent feeling.

778
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,201
Speaker 0: I'm very.

779
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,285
Speaker 0: that's very much my time.

780
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:08,751
Speaker 1: I like the hard time anyway.

781
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:13,450
Speaker 1: other bad aspects sheets Thread count ain't no joke.

782
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:15,500
Speaker 0: It's also mostly counterfeit lies.

783
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:16,799
Speaker 1: It's also true.

784
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:22,220
Speaker 1: See at the one hand you go into the store and it's like man thread count a billion and you're like what let me see.

785
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,031
Speaker 1: And it's actually thread count like a hundred and like this.

786
00:46:25,071 --> 00:46:26,356
Speaker 1: shit is like fucking sandpaper.

787
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:27,300
Speaker 1: fuck that shit, right?

788
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,460
Speaker 1: It is lying to you, you know.

789
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:36,689
Speaker 1: But if you do actually get the high thread count biz like silk or like whoa It feels so good.

790
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,900
Speaker 1: You lay down into it like whoa.

791
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:51,399
Speaker 0: But I find that the sheets themselves don't matter as much as what kinds of blankets you put over them because if you have A blanket that is a little more airy It'll make even crappy sheets feel way better.

792
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:52,925
Speaker 0: Well, let's just do coal.

793
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:53,086
Speaker 0: see.

794
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:56,440
Speaker 1: the sheets are about the texture of the material touching your skin.

795
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:57,608
Speaker 1: That's what the sheets are about.

796
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:02,369
Speaker 1: the blankets just go on top of the sheets And keep you warm as long as they got.

797
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:07,572
Speaker 0: so usually the blanket is the base layer for base warmth And then that comforters are actually keeping you warm.

798
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:11,580
Speaker 1: However, I Like the sheet is the part that touches your skin.

799
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,132
Speaker 1: So the textures of the other parts don't matter.

800
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:15,800
Speaker 1: only their insulation properties matter.

801
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:21,637
Speaker 0: But if they're if they're insulating but also have a little bit more air give like the whole air is insulating.

802
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,765
Speaker 1: That's what the air is for.

803
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:24,849
Speaker 0: It depends.

804
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:25,954
Speaker 0: So it's like technical fabrics.

805
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:27,440
Speaker 0: You could have things that will insulate it.

806
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,068
Speaker 0: Do you know by unidirectional blankets?

807
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:33,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually that might be pretty good tactical blank tactical blankets.

808
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:40,035
Speaker 0: but I Don't like comforters and I would never own one because my.

809
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:40,978
Speaker 1: what are you doing?

810
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,759
Speaker 1: What do you wear in the?

811
00:47:44,128 --> 00:48:02,800
Speaker 0: What I'm getting to is my entire life I have only ever ever lived in places with the exception of colony Manor at RIT Where the HVAC systems were such that there were not drafts and the house was always Pretty much everywhere a very nice temperature to where a comforter was literally never ever ever needed ever.

812
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,372
Speaker 1: So you just heat your whole house with fire and then not use blankets.

813
00:48:06,773 --> 00:48:07,656
Speaker 0: No, I'd use blankets.

814
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,740
Speaker 0: I would not use comforters.

815
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:20,535
Speaker 0: I would always have a sheet and then a reasonable medium or thin blanket Depending if it's summer or winter and never have a comforter Because the comforter would always be way too hot because the house is always like 76 degrees.

816
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,589
Speaker 0: So This apartment.

817
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:28,900
Speaker 0: we're in New York, right?

818
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,480
Speaker 0: The other thing about no control over your heat your apartments always like a million degrees.

819
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,409
Speaker 1: The other thing about do you have a comforter?

820
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:35,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, you use it.

821
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:38,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm using it right now While your apartment's way too hot for that.

822
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:40,646
Speaker 1: That's the thing about a comforter.

823
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:44,580
Speaker 1: is that even in the summer you get under the comforter and it feels great.

824
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:45,403
Speaker 1: It feels great.

825
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:46,306
Speaker 0: No matter what too hot.

826
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:46,848
Speaker 0: You'll sweat.

827
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:47,430
Speaker 1: It's it's.

828
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,380
Speaker 1: it's temperature regulating magic of the comforter, right?

829
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:50,882
Speaker 1: Is that like?

830
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:52,691
Speaker 0: what kind of cover do you have?

831
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:54,479
Speaker 0: This temperature regulating comforters are just too much.

832
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,790
Speaker 1: No, you get under it and you always feel great.

833
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,840
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what the temperature is outside.

834
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,648
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get under your comforter.

835
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,352
Speaker 0: It'll be too hot.

836
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:02,658
Speaker 1: There's no such thing as too hot.

837
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,520
Speaker 0: There you you were just implying that keeping my house at 76 degrees was too hot.

838
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:10,720
Speaker 1: No, I said is a waste of energy when you just get under the blanket.

839
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:11,060
Speaker 1: Let's see.

840
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,599
Speaker 0: However, it was not much of a waste of energy because I've also always lived in super fucking insulated houses.

841
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,874
Speaker 1: Anyway, modern like it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

842
00:49:22,135 --> 00:49:23,980
Speaker 1: you put a blanket people even in fact.

843
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:26,460
Speaker 0: Actually now they live in your days in New York.

844
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,613
Speaker 0: The problem is stuff stays too warm because a lot of people have control over the heat.

845
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:33,808
Speaker 1: even in the days when people had Fireplaces in their bedrooms they still had blank.

846
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:37,881
Speaker 0: because fireplace in the bedroom means you live in a drafty ass piece of shit pre-world War.

847
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,869
Speaker 1: one house fireplace in the bedroom is way warm.

848
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,195
Speaker 0: Yes one till you burn your house down to.

849
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:44,820
Speaker 0: fireplaces are way too warm.

850
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:54,200
Speaker 0: I lived in a house for a while when I was in Poughkeepsie that was heated primarily by Fireplaces, let me tell you it was way too.

851
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,716
Speaker 0: I slept naked on the top of my bed because that that thing had two settings.

852
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:01,204
Speaker 0: no the Sun and Nothing.

853
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:04,702
Speaker 1: no such thing is too warm It's cold.

854
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:08,255
Speaker 0: You gotta get warm, but I actually prefer these days to have just a sheet and no blanket.

855
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:15,373
Speaker 0: pretty much ever even in hotels In the summer, yeah, even in the winter cuz that's just so airy and the hotel.

856
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:17,420
Speaker 0: you want to turn off that AC?

857
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:22,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the summer yeah just a sheet.

858
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,840
Speaker 0: I Feel like we should skip pillows cuz that could be a whole show in and of itself.

859
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,605
Speaker 0: Pillows could be a whole show.

860
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:29,930
Speaker 1: I switched to the Z pillow.

861
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:30,752
Speaker 1: It's been working out.

862
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought the highest rated.

863
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,408
Speaker 1: See memory foam is bullshit.

864
00:50:35,428 --> 00:50:36,393
Speaker 1: I don't like no memory foam.

865
00:50:36,514 --> 00:50:37,640
Speaker 0: I got you should try my pillow.

866
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,607
Speaker 0: It's the highest rated pillow on Amazon.

867
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,313
Speaker 1: No mine is the highest rate pill on Amazon.

868
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,818
Speaker 0: is that your mind is eyes memory phone?

869
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,429
Speaker 1: It's silicone type stuff.

870
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,020
Speaker 1: It's pillow shaped not like a weird blob.

871
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:51,038
Speaker 0: I want the hump and then bigger hump.

872
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:54,871
Speaker 0: now I need neck support cuz I sleep on my back.

873
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:57,137
Speaker 1: the Z pillow has neck support.

874
00:50:57,338 --> 00:50:59,043
Speaker 1: the way it works Is that it is.

875
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:04,300
Speaker 1: even though it is normal pillow shape the middle area is has more bigger holes in it and is less dense.

876
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:07,828
Speaker 1: So it squishes more than the part Normal pillow.

877
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:08,372
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

878
00:51:08,452 --> 00:51:13,768
Speaker 1: It is shaped like a normal pillow But when you put your head on it The middle part goes in more than the edge part.

879
00:51:13,788 --> 00:51:16,215
Speaker 0: you find the pillow that I bought some bullshit.

880
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:24,780
Speaker 0: memory foam memory foams garbage Foam is great except while you're so people who say they have memory foam have some bootleg crab That smells like the inside of a factory from China.

881
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,420
Speaker 1: You know, you scrolled a lot way down this page for the highest rated pillow.

882
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:28,741
Speaker 1: It shouldn't?

883
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:30,248
Speaker 0: it's sorted by irrelevance not high.

884
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:31,674
Speaker 1: It may be the first one.

885
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:32,920
Speaker 0: average customer review.

886
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:33,622
Speaker 0: Let's see.

887
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,129
Speaker 1: Is it the first one that black thing?

888
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,114
Speaker 0: It's that weird blousey.

889
00:51:38,736 --> 00:51:39,979
Speaker 1: It's not that weird black thing.

890
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:42,446
Speaker 0: I'm guess No, it's not looking for it.

891
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,010
Speaker 0: I bought this pillow like three years ago.

892
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:45,154
Speaker 0: So, uh-huh.

893
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:47,380
Speaker 1: What if Z pillows where it's at?

894
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:49,326
Speaker 0: Only on the top?

895
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:49,948
Speaker 1: that's bullshit.

896
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:51,816
Speaker 0: Also doesn't need cold pillow.

897
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:52,620
Speaker 0: It looks more like this.

898
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:53,603
Speaker 0: Yeah This pillow.

899
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:59,802
Speaker 0: the selling point was that the core is like a heat sink almost So it always feels cool no matter what.

900
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:06,605
Speaker 1: that is what the Z pillows all about has the holes in it and those holes make it always nice and cold and You get your pillowcase on.

901
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,520
Speaker 0: there is you know, it's not this pillow, but it kind of looks like this pillow.

902
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:10,550
Speaker 1: It's weird, right?

903
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,620
Speaker 1: You can never be too warm.

904
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,290
Speaker 1: But for some reason I'm all about the cold pillow and when one part of the pillow warms up I move my head to a different part of the pillow.

905
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:17,813
Speaker 1: That's warm.

906
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,985
Speaker 1: I mean, it's cold and I got.

907
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:21,950
Speaker 0: I got these sleep.

908
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,536
Speaker 0: Oh, it's lost of stars since I bought it.

909
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:24,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's some garbage.

910
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,143
Speaker 0: Oh, I bought it in 2014.

911
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,911
Speaker 0: All right, that's some bull three years ago.

912
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:27,654
Speaker 0: So look at this.

913
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:28,920
Speaker 0: See it's nice shape.

914
00:52:29,486 --> 00:52:30,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a piece of shit.

915
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:41,394
Speaker 0: It's this is the best fucking pillow and I have lent this pillow to friends who stay over because all my other normal pillows I actually have bird feathers in them because they're like fancy down pillows.

916
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:46,700
Speaker 0: down pillows are real comfortable But uh, if you're allergic to chickens, that's bad news.

917
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:54,971
Speaker 1: the only problem I have with feather pillows is that when the feather bottom parts poke out and stab you a Well-designed down pillow will not have that problem.

918
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:56,818
Speaker 1: pillows on my couch have that problem.

919
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:00,168
Speaker 0: Yep This pillow is the best pillow.

920
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,271
Speaker 0: It's so garbage.

921
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:04,440
Speaker 0: It's so cool on your skin garbage.

922
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:06,067
Speaker 0: Wonder why it got low rate?

923
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,160
Speaker 0: because you used to have five stars because people wise up and got the Z pillow.

924
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:10,204
Speaker 0: I think I got the Queen.

925
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:11,931
Speaker 1: one realized memory foam is bullshit.

926
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:13,076
Speaker 0: All right, let's see.

927
00:53:13,116 --> 00:53:14,100
Speaker 0: Let me look at these reviews.

928
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:14,743
Speaker 0: Let's see.

929
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:16,953
Speaker 0: what people say is I have a blah blah blah.

930
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:18,380
Speaker 0: I want to see the one star reviews.

931
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:21,867
Speaker 1: They're always gonna say something stupid.

932
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:24,500
Speaker 0: a few things went terribly wrong with this pillow.

933
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:27,571
Speaker 0: Oh the pillow I got was not the one it's okay.

934
00:53:27,611 --> 00:53:30,040
Speaker 0: So this guy got ripped off and got a bootleg pillow.

935
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:32,385
Speaker 0: This pillow sucks.

936
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:33,248
Speaker 0: no support at all.

937
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:34,534
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

938
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:35,940
Speaker 1: It's like it must have a giant head.

939
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:37,365
Speaker 0: It was hard to sleep on.

940
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:39,171
Speaker 1: okay, dude, maybe you had it upside down.

941
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:40,475
Speaker 0: they smell horrible.

942
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:41,820
Speaker 0: No, you got a bootleg.

943
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:44,230
Speaker 0: I'm not happy with this pillow.

944
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,660
Speaker 0: I got it help cooling my head at night.

945
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:47,223
Speaker 0: Bad smell.

946
00:53:47,283 --> 00:53:48,567
Speaker 0: No bad smell.

947
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:50,032
Speaker 0: No, it was so hard.

948
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:51,195
Speaker 0: This pill is not hard at all.

949
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:53,439
Speaker 0: I Think these people are all day.

950
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:58,879
Speaker 0: This is like so when we were in on the ski trip right sound like a game developer reading their own steam reviews.

951
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:02,540
Speaker 0: Yeah When we were in on the ski trip, right?

952
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,190
Speaker 0: I was looking at reviews because there aren't that many restaurants out in the boonies and there's this Mexican place and Most of the reviews were like this food is garbage.

953
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:11,215
Speaker 0: It'll make you sick.

954
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,159
Speaker 0: Fuck this place.

955
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:13,023
Speaker 0: Like.

956
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:14,148
Speaker 0: the reviews were real bad.

957
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:17,160
Speaker 0: The place had like three stars total, maybe two and a half.

958
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:23,639
Speaker 0: There was one review and all it said was two words all lowercase run away.

959
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,926
Speaker 1: But best review ever.

960
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,772
Speaker 1: it still gave it three stars.

961
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,039
Speaker 1: Well three stars run away.

962
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:36,919
Speaker 1: I Never seen my run away be one star.

963
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:43,760
Speaker 0: I really want to know what the story is there to where it still got the extra star Two star bonus for runaway.

964
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:54,850
Speaker 0: But I'm thinking about buying a new bed because that mattress is accumulated 16 to 20 years of my.

965
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,496
Speaker 1: yeah, that's about the lifetime for a mattress.

966
00:54:56,717 --> 00:55:01,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I've been told by people are trying to sell me mattresses that every five years you buy a new one.

967
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,947
Speaker 1: That's people trying to sell you mattresses.

968
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:03,690
Speaker 0: See how I'm gonna.

969
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:05,619
Speaker 0: I'm gonna Google right now also often.

970
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:13,591
Speaker 0: I type how often and the first Google representations.

971
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:14,373
Speaker 0: Should you poop?

972
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:15,576
Speaker 0: Should you shower?

973
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:16,780
Speaker 0: Should you wash your hair?

974
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,028
Speaker 0: Should you change your sheets?

975
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:21,946
Speaker 1: Okay I don't change my shoes enough.

976
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:25,197
Speaker 0: I do not change mine enough either, but I'm trying to change it more often.

977
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:29,228
Speaker 0: your Mattress that's actually one of the recommendations here.

978
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,580
Speaker 0: five to seven years according to the National Sleep Foundation.

979
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:37,173
Speaker 1: The National Sleep Foundation is an organization that is trying to sell more mattresses.

980
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,600
Speaker 1: My mattress is already like eight years old.

981
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:44,980
Speaker 0: I'm not buying a new one for consumer reports, which is also kind of a scam and not as much consumer reports.

982
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,669
Speaker 1: Hey, you're mostly legit ten years.

983
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,940
Speaker 1: All right, so I plan to buy a new mattress in three years.

984
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,984
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with the mattress.

985
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:53,580
Speaker 1: I am mine is just so old that I bought it when I moved to New York.

986
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,460
Speaker 0: Oh, no, and it's probably gained ten pounds from the oily secretions of my body over the last.

987
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,325
Speaker 1: Oh, that's something else.

988
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:03,839
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't have these but I highly recommend the mattress pad.

989
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,524
Speaker 0: Mattress pads.

990
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:08,660
Speaker 0: I have felt like are obsolete and black.

991
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,930
Speaker 0: So the mattress pad is pads always.

992
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,995
Speaker 0: you know what I used to use them for.

993
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:14,888
Speaker 0: if you have a shitty mattress It makes the mattress more comfortable.

994
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,240
Speaker 1: No, so you're looking for that pillow top action, right?

995
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,160
Speaker 1: I mattress pad I have does not provide any pillowy top.

996
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:24,212
Speaker 1: It is merely sort of like a mattress protector.

997
00:56:24,273 --> 00:56:33,559
Speaker 1: in a way you put it over the mattress Then you put your sheets on and that way your oily secretions go into the mattress pad Which you can replace and your mattress is still beautiful to new always

998
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:35,287
Speaker 0: But I feel like that's what

999
00:56:35,347 --> 00:56:36,713
Speaker 1: it's for

1000
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:41,576
Speaker 0: and make the mattress worse In terms of airiness because I actually part of what

1001
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:43,002
Speaker 1: I'm mine Do not affect.

1002
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:46,853
Speaker 1: the one I have is does not affect the feel of the mattress in any way.

1003
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:59,440
Speaker 1: All right, it is simply a Absorbing oiliness protector to keep the mattress itself You know relatively clean because it's easy to clean and take a mattress pad and throw it in the washing machine.

1004
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:05,100
Speaker 1: It's not easy to throw a mattress in the washing machine and the sheet is not enough to protect the mattress from your body.

1005
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:07,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely not the sheets themselves.

1006
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:08,996
Speaker 1: You'll see that you need that extra layer.

1007
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:13,114
Speaker 1: So My mattress pad is all like yellow from skin oils.

1008
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, my mattress is all.

1009
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,043
Speaker 1: yeah It's supposed to be.

1010
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,200
Speaker 1: I should probably actually replace the mattress pad because even after washing it it's still yellow with skin oils.

1011
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,446
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm thinking about dishes.

1012
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:28,707
Speaker 0: So actually if anyone wants an antique like Fancy rosewood bed.

1013
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:31,276
Speaker 1: I mean a bed the bed part is a bed, right?

1014
00:57:31,296 --> 00:57:34,740
Speaker 1: It doesn't even fucking matter It's just if I get a modern bed.

1015
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:37,834
Speaker 1: All the bed does is hold the mattress off the.

1016
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:47,420
Speaker 0: if I get a modern mattress I want to get a modern bed frame because this is a classic old-style bed frame meaning It's two pieces of wood on the side a headboard a footboard and you put slats.

1017
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:48,612
Speaker 1: What do you think a modern bed is?

1018
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,360
Speaker 1: It's some sort of square structure that you know has slats and elevates a mattress off the ground.

1019
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:55,986
Speaker 0: Often modern ones don't have slats.

1020
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,940
Speaker 0: They just have a pad like a plate like a pad or rails to put the thing on.

1021
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:00,799
Speaker 1: It's all the same.

1022
00:58:00,901 --> 00:58:11,379
Speaker 0: It's some sort of platform that is Have built-in storage and stuff in a way that I don't want to just like slide shit under the bed Sure, but that those aren't related to the bed part.

1023
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:20,492
Speaker 0: So if anybody I don't want to put a modern mattress on this Current bed frame because it's an ancient as bed frame doesn't matter.

1024
00:58:20,532 --> 00:58:22,820
Speaker 1: It'll the mattress is the part you sleep on.

1025
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,040
Speaker 1: It'll feel the same no matter what frame is elevated.

1026
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of the modern mattresses I want this one because it has the slats.

1027
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:32,680
Speaker 0: I'd have to have a box spring or something under the mattress.

1028
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,325
Speaker 0: I just have a modern.

1029
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:40,557
Speaker 1: my IKEA bed had came with slats and I just put a big flat piece of wood over the slats And then put the mattress on top of that.

1030
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:43,848
Speaker 0: And it's what kind of matches do you have?

1031
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:44,954
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

1032
00:58:44,974 --> 00:58:45,980
Speaker 0: no box spring though?

1033
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:48,360
Speaker 0: No, I do feel like box springs are obsolete.

1034
00:58:49,282 --> 00:58:52,506
Speaker 1: You need a box spring depending on the kind of frame I don't know.

1035
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:55,325
Speaker 0: or if you got an old Usually use the box spring.

1036
00:58:55,365 --> 00:59:05,979
Speaker 1: if the kind of frame you have is the kind is just like a metal rectangle with wheels under it And then you put the box spring on that and the box spring basically is the platform that the magic can go on.

1037
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,715
Speaker 0: here We go types of frames platform frame which is used without box frames.

1038
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:10,760
Speaker 0: That's the modern ones.

1039
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,884
Speaker 0: That's the one I'm looking at getting.

1040
00:59:12,326 --> 00:59:14,094
Speaker 0: captain has drawers beneath the frame.

1041
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,500
Speaker 1: I guess that's what I had when I was a kid.

1042
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,288
Speaker 0: Oh water beds.

1043
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:19,518
Speaker 0: water beds were real big in the 80s water beds.

1044
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:20,843
Speaker 1: There's a kid I knew who had one.

1045
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:23,010
Speaker 1: it was really cool and fun, but I don't

1046
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,034
Speaker 0: know

1047
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:27,548
Speaker 1: if it's a good idea to actually Sleep on one every night the

1048
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:27,890
Speaker 0: ones that

1049
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:36,199
Speaker 1: was like this thing where you see one or you're laying one And it's so cool and so awesome, and then if you actually do it every day, and that's like your main bed I think it's bad.

1050
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,780
Speaker 0: They're not actually that comfortable if they have baffles to prevent them from sloshing.

1051
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,020
Speaker 0: Then you lose a lot of the aspects of it being a water bed.

1052
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:47,675
Speaker 0: But if you don't have those baffles every time you move it'll make waves also.

1053
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:48,940
Speaker 1: What if it lock leaks?

1054
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, that happens.

1055
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:50,286
Speaker 0: Also.

1056
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:52,440
Speaker 0: They're so heavy that they will break your floor.

1057
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,207
Speaker 0: true and there's.

1058
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:58,877
Speaker 0: they're probably full of bacteria and nasty as water in there.

1059
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:02,435
Speaker 0: well I mean sealed system, so it doesn't matter a lot of leases in New York.

1060
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:03,480
Speaker 0: ban water beds.

1061
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:06,631
Speaker 1: Yes, cuz you'll flood your fucking neighbors if it's not happens.

1062
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:07,213
Speaker 0: Don't go also.

1063
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:07,836
Speaker 0: They're too heavy.

1064
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:08,940
Speaker 1: That's also bad.

1065
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:11,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything on water beds is bad.

1066
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,557
Speaker 0: I feel like they were a trend in the 80s, then they just died.

1067
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:20,240
Speaker 0: yep So the modern version painted 1971 Popular in the 80s and 90s and now they're basically dead.

1068
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:28,705
Speaker 1: I feel like you can make a water bed like a new design out of something like you know more modern Material that doesn't just have one big blob of water But has lots of little.

1069
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:30,772
Speaker 0: that's what a lot of the ones in the 90s did.

1070
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:36,556
Speaker 1: they had various baffles or like some pone in Some water chamber, oh, but it's like you could just use air instead.

1071
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:37,260
Speaker 1: air is fine.

1072
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,962
Speaker 0: Oh, they also had to be heated.

1073
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:40,764
Speaker 0: you had to heat that crap.

1074
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:41,465
Speaker 1: That's not good.

1075
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:44,148
Speaker 0: Wow.

1076
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot.

1077
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:47,638
Speaker 0: Okay, there's a whole article on water beds.

1078
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:48,904
Speaker 0: another a bad news bear.

1079
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:50,810
Speaker 1: yeah air mattress is fine You don't need a water.

1080
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:59,189
Speaker 0: Only good thing for air mat for water beds is when you were a kid in the 80s and 90s You'd have regular trips to the mall with your family's lived in the burbs and think you did Rookstone would have it.

1081
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:04,812
Speaker 0: You'd you go into the department store because you always went into the department store because there's something your family always had to buy In there.

1082
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:07,727
Speaker 0: and what I would do me and my brother is we run off from her parents.

1083
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:09,229
Speaker 0: every time There's a bed on display.

1084
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:17,125
Speaker 0: We'd run at it and jump on it to see if it was a water bed Because maybe one in ten was totally a water bed back then also.

1085
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:25,597
Speaker 1: There's also those beds that like Like the motor to recline and change whatever Used to see those on TV commercials.

1086
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:28,025
Speaker 0: you still see those on TV commercials if you watch TV.

1087
01:01:28,045 --> 01:01:29,370
Speaker 0: those are for old people or injured.

1088
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:35,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like technology beds because I feel like like a bed with a massage or a heater inside.

1089
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,750
Speaker 0: I feel like those are all just cheap crap that are gonna break or aren't actually that pleasant?

1090
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:42,076
Speaker 1: Yeah There hasn't been one yet.

1091
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:45,328
Speaker 1: if there was one that was so good it would become the new standard for beds everywhere.

1092
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:48,950
Speaker 0: unless I were Bedridden or old I would never want a bed that does that reclining nonsense.

1093
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:50,816
Speaker 0: I would just get our recliner.

1094
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,803
Speaker 1: and about a nice nice vibrating bed.

1095
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:54,730
Speaker 1: you put a quarter in a ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket.

1096
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, last time I ran into one of those was in a real bad motel.

1097
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:03,022
Speaker 0: I think we've exhausted our bed talk.
