00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,791
Speaker 0: It's Thursday June 9th 2016.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,780
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,238
Speaker 0: Twitter plays geek nights.

4
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:20,532
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:27,880
Speaker 0: So Over the weekend, you know, sometimes the toilet just starts running a little bit.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,700
Speaker 0: You know like juggle a handle like it makes noise that thing that a lot of people's houses we visit just do constantly.

7
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,540
Speaker 0: So I replace the bit that causes that problem and I read the rubbery ring on the inside.

8
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little rubber thing that the flap that comes up the flapper.

9
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:47,580
Speaker 1: Yeah I need to replace my flap too because mine also has a tiny tiny leak and yeah constantly makes noise.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,080
Speaker 0: It started doing it over the weekend and I was like well, nope, and I just I went to Amazon.

11
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:55,014
Speaker 0: I immediately ordered it and the funny thing was I was likes your own.

12
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,584
Speaker 1: you didn't get the super to fix it Why would I?

13
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:00,953
Speaker 0: but the super would take like a week and then they'd come in and track some like.

14
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:01,775
Speaker 0: it's a pain in the ass.

15
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:10,138
Speaker 1: Put the old home back out like a showerhead, but I paid like a dollar for it.

16
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:12,065
Speaker 0: It took 30 seconds.

17
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:12,851
Speaker 1: How did you get one?

18
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,900
Speaker 1: That's the right one for your toilet?

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,570
Speaker 0: So well the how I did it this time is I sat down.

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,718
Speaker 0: I said fuck what kind did I get?

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,402
Speaker 1: so I searched and did you like empty the tank by like turning the water off and then flushing and So.

22
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:28,393
Speaker 0: so I guess I've done a lot of handyman stuff a lot.

23
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,831
Speaker 0: He's tell us so basically I Go to wear gloves and reach your hand in the tub.

24
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,615
Speaker 0: why even wear gloves?

25
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:34,258
Speaker 0: it's clean in there.

26
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,986
Speaker 1: Mine mine actually has.

27
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:43,600
Speaker 0: I have a problem a separate problem and that not only do I have to wait wait What problem could cause that water to be unclean poop coming back up?

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,321
Speaker 1: No, why?

29
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,367
Speaker 1: nobody did an upper decker in there?

30
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,514
Speaker 1: that I know of but there's some sort of like.

31
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,210
Speaker 0: there's some sort of silty residue Up there and I told it as the same thing.

32
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:52,754
Speaker 1: I don't know.

33
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:53,840
Speaker 1: I don't know how to clean it out.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,808
Speaker 0: That's a New York thing.

35
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,200
Speaker 1: Oh, is it a New York thing?

36
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:03,960
Speaker 0: There's silt in a lot of our water Especially because it'll happen anytime they lie, but it's only in my toilet not in any of my water sources.

37
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:07,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's pretty diffuse and I don't know and it keeps dirtying up my bowl.

38
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how do I clean it out of there?

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,833
Speaker 0: Uh empty it and just clean it out with like paper towel and a scrubber.

40
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:14,576
Speaker 1: That sucks.

41
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, or just leave it There doesn't hurt anything.

42
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:18,627
Speaker 1: It makes my toilet bowl.

43
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,880
Speaker 1: I had to clean my toilet bowl more often because it keeps getting brown.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,194
Speaker 0: Oh, it doesn't get into the toilet bowl.

45
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:22,739
Speaker 1: mine does.

46
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,920
Speaker 0: Usually when that happens it's because there was recent construction and they shut off your water at some point.

47
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:36,148
Speaker 0: You don't know if they did because the New York they pretty much always do it because it'll happen in a neighborhood and if you Don't have a doorman like they won't even tell you.

48
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,080
Speaker 0: between like noon and 3 on a Wednesday The water will just be off and then it'll be on again and most people have no idea this happened.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,164
Speaker 1: I guess that could have happened.

50
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,809
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty common.

51
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,800
Speaker 0: The only reason I know when it happens here having to work a lot.

52
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it happens all over in New York.

53
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:58,820
Speaker 0: But because we have a doorman Whenever it happens the doorman puts a sign in the elevator that says yo water's not gonna work for this one hour period on Thursday.

54
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,025
Speaker 0: So I just know every time that happens.

55
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:03,071
Speaker 0: It happens like once every couple months.

56
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:07,324
Speaker 1: I mean maybe like a Little less than a year ago.

57
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:11,260
Speaker 1: the water main way down the street broke, but that was like six or seven blocks away.

58
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:12,589
Speaker 1: I don't think it was affecting me.

59
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,340
Speaker 1: My water worked fine during that period.

60
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,891
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I go to.

61
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,453
Speaker 0: I sit down at Amazon and I'm like, oh wait What the shit for tying up?

62
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,770
Speaker 0: There's a Kohler toilet I think.

63
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:30,531
Speaker 0: so I just type flapper valve and the first result that shows up help replace mine too is one that says you Purchased this on this date.

64
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:31,556
Speaker 0: When did you know?

65
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,299
Speaker 0: when did you buy one?

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,913
Speaker 0: I bought one about three years ago because Emily's toilet has started running.

67
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,440
Speaker 0: So I just clicked rebuy.

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,230
Speaker 0: It came the next day.

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,094
Speaker 0: I spent 30 seconds.

70
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 1: So there's a recent song called rebuy that just came out.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,699
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically all you got to do is just look up like the name of your toilet and There's probably doesn't have like a model number written on it.

72
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:54,748
Speaker 0: I didn't even.

73
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,327
Speaker 0: I just looked up the name The maker of the toilet.

74
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:00,245
Speaker 1: cuz my toilet is made by I guess I have to look at the flap and then look You know what?

75
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,823
Speaker 0: You'll have a Bemis Kohler like.

76
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,995
Speaker 0: I don't even know any other names of toilet brands.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Speaker 1: I Got a white the most plain gennaro white porcelain potty you ever seen and it's New York modern building.

78
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,966
Speaker 0: I will bet you a dollar.

79
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,815
Speaker 0: It's a Kohler koh le are or something like that.

80
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,732
Speaker 0: I'll take a look at it but yeah, so I replaced the thing.

81
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:31,780
Speaker 0: and Then I was thinking because I know a lot of people some of these people I still know Where they will say things to me like oh, you've got a jiggle the toilet to make sure it stops.

82
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,790
Speaker 1: That means it's broken.

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,723
Speaker 0: fix it And they've been.

84
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,939
Speaker 1: mine is mine doesn't have the jiggle problem, but so mine started up.

85
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,030
Speaker 1: the jiggle Just makes noise, but there's.

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,214
Speaker 1: no there's no point in jiggling.

87
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,579
Speaker 1: It just constantly makes noise.

88
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,852
Speaker 0: So when I will usually the jiggling will like reseat the flap a little bit and then it'll like stop it temporarily But once you flush it's gone again.

89
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:51,740
Speaker 1: No, I mean mine.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,613
Speaker 1: Well, if you no matter what if you jiggle it'll just keep making noise.

91
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,120
Speaker 1: cuz like there's this tiny leak in the thing.

92
00:04:56,642 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 0: Oh mine would just like get kind of like weak so it would fall into the hole a little bit.

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,538
Speaker 0: But if you jiggle it right it would get a better seal that it wouldn't run.

94
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,831
Speaker 0: But the the flapper was a little loose too.

95
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:07,835
Speaker 0: So I fixed that.

96
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,160
Speaker 0: that took I don't know eight seconds.

97
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,539
Speaker 0: I don't know.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people out there who seem to like when something minor happens to them in a house, especially houses.

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,280
Speaker 0: It's not even apartments because at least some lazy people will call the super in an apartment.

100
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:28,014
Speaker 0: But like people who own houses will not fix Obviously annoying things for ever like they'll just never fix them.

101
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,020
Speaker 0: It's just like well, there's a hole in this wall.

102
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,309
Speaker 0: I guess this is my life now.

103
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:32,780
Speaker 0: This hole is just here.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,390
Speaker 1: I mean if something is not broken to the point where it actually like, you know, like people have a computer that's all slow But it's like they're still getting their work done.

105
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,879
Speaker 1: They'll just suffer through the slowness.

106
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,283
Speaker 0: Yeah But why.

107
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:52,280
Speaker 0: but it like suffering through your toilet making an annoying noise basically all the time wasting water Constantly when you can spend a dollar and 30 seconds to fix it.

108
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,185
Speaker 0: Like you just not know.

109
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:54,767
Speaker 1: they just don't.

110
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,880
Speaker 0: you just think toilets work that way cuz your parents never replaced your flapper.

111
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,805
Speaker 0: I don't even think It's kind of like how a lot of people we know have really nice houses and yet they have the default like shit-ass Showerhead up there.

112
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,267
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:07,955
Speaker 0: Like guys 20 bucks.

114
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,525
Speaker 0: You get a real showerhead Like I don't understand.

115
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:14,338
Speaker 0: people don't upgrade their software or the people because today I noticed this.

116
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:19,015
Speaker 0: I was biking and I'm not complaining about fixies, but this other class of people.

117
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:23,259
Speaker 0: they have bikes with gears Usually don't use them, but well, I'm not even talking about that.

118
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:35,968
Speaker 0: But I'll see him biking because I pass them and their bikes are squeaking So loud squeaking and clanking and rattling like you've probably never Sprayed anything on those gears.

119
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,640
Speaker 0: that chain is probably dry as my best bones in the desert.

120
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:47,850
Speaker 0: Surprise, the changes doesn't snap and you fall over like the bike is screaming to you to end its misery Like if you never maintained a bike before.

121
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,137
Speaker 0: at least the stupid fixie people, you know They make a big deal about.

122
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:56,840
Speaker 0: oh I got my simple bike and I care a lot about simplicity for some stupid reason even though it's objectively inferior.

123
00:06:57,364 --> 00:07:07,040
Speaker 0: But these are the people who have a more complex bike Obviously maintain it less than the simple bike and the bike still goes and they complain about it being like it's low maintenance.

124
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:22,014
Speaker 0: Yeah Like you can take a bike with gears Literally never maintain it and while it'll squeak and squeal and scream at you constantly and rattle and be slow It seems like 80% of New Yorkers ride bikes like that everywhere.

125
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,118
Speaker 0: So still works.

126
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,413
Speaker 1: Toilet still removes the poop so they don't.

127
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,504
Speaker 1: you know, that's it Why don't?

128
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:29,748
Speaker 0: here's a YouTube video.

00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:38,718
Speaker 0: go around the city buy like one thing of lube and Go around the city to bikes that are chained up on the street and just lubricate them all just like lubricated.

130
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,524
Speaker 0: make a video about it.

131
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,447
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Go for it public service.

132
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:43,572

00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:01,657
Speaker 0: so Anyone need some bike lube?

140
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,386
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

Speaker 1: I Couldn't really find any normal geek nights news.

142
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,220
Speaker 1: So I guess we'll just go with the serious news, right?

143
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:19,554

144
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:22,720
Speaker 1: we don't usually talk about celebrities dying On geek nights, right?

145
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,767
Speaker 1: Usually because most of the time we don't care.

146
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,620
Speaker 1: That's just people mean there's millions of people dying all the time.

147

148
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:34,658
Speaker 1: just cuz you're a celebrity doesn't make you any more important than anyone else But mom and Ali is more important than everyone else.

149
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,559
Speaker 0: Muhammad Ali, I mean one if you don't know like we're not right.

150
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,168
Speaker 1: It's not even the fact that he died.

151
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:44,360
Speaker 1: that is notable because to be honest it was like he was dead.

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Speaker 1: He said Parkinson's disease and been like basically not able to do much for quite a significant period of time.

153
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,726
Speaker 1: So it's like he's been dead, right?

154
00:08:54,187 --> 00:09:05,180
Speaker 1: What's notable I think is, you know, the fact that he has died obviously brings out You know everybody who you know never knew who he was and you can see the typical internet reactions.

155
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:09,300
Speaker 1: But mostly, you know the the yeah, we expected it.

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,200
Speaker 1: But when you act, you know, there's the reaction that you expected.

157
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:19,054
Speaker 1: But once you actually see it you still shake your head Which is the punk kids who didn't know who he was because they're too young.

158
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,680
Speaker 0: So yeah, like I'm gonna link to it.

159
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,240
Speaker 0: It's kind of my thing of the day, but I'll just talk about it now.

160
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:28,177
Speaker 0: So there's a famous famous monologue that Billy Crystal and already half you were thinking.

161
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:28,960
Speaker 0: Who's Billy Crystal?

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:43,179
Speaker 0: Did and basically he recounted Muhammad Ali's life up to that point as a Monologue and it was funny but serious because Muhammad Ali's life so amazing that people haven't seen this.

163
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,395
Speaker 0: yeah, like this is this was a staple like I just like everyone saw this.

164
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:51,468
Speaker 0: everyone knew about this and Apparently Billy Crystal is gonna do.

165
00:09:51,528 --> 00:10:01,897
Speaker 1: or did the eulogy for Muhammad Ali's funeral like he was Considering the Howard Cosell who also people listen to this don't know who that is Yeah is died in like 1990 something but most of Twitter was left.

166
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,573
Speaker 0: They were like who the hell is this Billy Crystal and why?

167
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,080
Speaker 0: what the hell does he have to do with Muhammad?

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,948
Speaker 0: I leave and who's this Cassius Clay guy?

169
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:10,349
Speaker 0: Like?

170
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,271
Speaker 0: was it his brother?

171
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:17,340
Speaker 0: Like I found some shit poking around on the internet The thing that I saw the moat the thing.

172
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,080
Speaker 1: Well, I shake my head at the people who don't know who he was, right?

173
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:25,675
Speaker 1: And I think I think the 90s is like the cutoff right because like I was born in the 80s Which is still after the end of his career.

174
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,000
Speaker 1: pretty much Yeah, right.

175
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:39,428
Speaker 1: But I still knew everything there was to know about him and saw all his fights before YouTube and then saw his fights again When YouTube came out, he was the last great hero of boxing And he was also just kind of a hero as a person.

176
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:47,740
Speaker 1: there weren't I mean there aren't really if you think about you know True like actual heroic human beings that were real people and weren't fictional.

177
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:54,133
Speaker 1: There really aren't many right who alive Could you say is like at the superhero level.

178
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,419
Speaker 0: if Muhammad Ali?

179
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:04,020
Speaker 0: Person can you even think of the guys level the guy that they made Hotel Rwanda about the NATO guy who saved all those people?

180
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,280
Speaker 0: Sure, he was great UN guy UN UN, right?

181
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,863
Speaker 1: But he's not.

182
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,120
Speaker 1: he's not even like half Muhammad Ali love.

183
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:23,813
Speaker 0: There's the thing if you took if Muhammad Ali had not existed and you wrote a movie script about a guy like Muhammad Ali with that level of Just humor and presence and record and everything It seems like a fictional person like people would say that dialogues unrealistic.

184
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:26,483
Speaker 0: No human is that clever in Conversations?

185
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:27,487
Speaker 0: no humans that funny.

186
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,740
Speaker 0: No humans that real and no one could be that good of a boxer.

187
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,483
Speaker 1: It's like.

188
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:32,764
Speaker 1: so.

189
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:36,620
Speaker 1: here's the things that people still don't understand right if you're a punk kid, right?

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:49,100
Speaker 1: First of all, people don't understand that between the year up until like the 80s and 90s Right actually up until the 90s pretty much Boxing was the number one sport, right?

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,807
Speaker 1: Football was not the real football is.

192
00:11:51,928 --> 00:12:12,493
Speaker 1: in the United States football is number one and in the whole world soccer was always one Right, but before the 90s before like the end of Mike Tyson's career Right like Tyson Holyfield era from that going backwards all the way back to like, you know Joe Louis times right in the ancient days like 40s 50s, right?

193
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:15,119
Speaker 1: Whatever, you know max Fleming, whatever, right?

194
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,813
Speaker 1: Boxing was the number one sport in the entire world.

195
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:23,419
Speaker 1: It was the most important thing There was in sports right horse racing was like number two.

196
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:29,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know baseball was bigger than you know, but it's like football ice hockey basketball.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,895
Speaker 1: Those are all like sideshows right the way that all these other sports aren't, you know, and if you were the heavyweight champion of the world You were like the most dangerous man on earth, right?

198
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:45,800
Speaker 1: You were like the most famous but it's like You know.

199
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Speaker 1: You look today like some of like the biggest like standalone individual sport athletes like like Novak Djokovic He's like the champion of tennis right now or like Tiger Woods, right?

200
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:01,200
Speaker 1: Muhammad Ali was like 10 times as famous and big compared to Tiger Woods.

201
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,400
Speaker 0: It's very important.

202
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,217
Speaker 0: Is that he had a voice?

203
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:04,318
Speaker 0: that?

204
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,652
Speaker 0: Would have otherwise been ignored had he not had that fame that the position he held.

205
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:17,374
Speaker 0: his skill at boxing made him so powerful in Society that the shitty white people couldn't ignore him.

206
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:18,798
Speaker 1: No, you couldn't ignore him.

207
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:19,360
Speaker 1: He's the most.

208
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:20,508
Speaker 1: That's like you.

209
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,294
Speaker 0: look at this Wikipedia.

210
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,180
Speaker 0: Look at this record.

211
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:31,340
Speaker 0: It's just like this crazy sea of winds The years where he wasn't allowed to box because he refused to fight Vietnam because he refused to go kill brown people overseas.

212
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,872
Speaker 0: Well, you know when they never called him nigger they never did anything to him.

213
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,020
Speaker 1: He didn't say that he said something like that.

214
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,287
Speaker 0: He said I don't.

215
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,615
Speaker 1: you said I ain't got no quarrel.

216
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:40,400
Speaker 1: No Viet Cong.

217
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:45,420
Speaker 0: There was another longer quote that he gave in an interview that I pulled up a little while ago.

218
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,140
Speaker 1: I'll find it cuz I really good right but that's another thing right is so, you know, he was right a Muslim, right?

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,708
Speaker 1: And we are here at geek nights.

220
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,940
Speaker 1: Very anti Skyman, right?

221
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,039
Speaker 1: Yeah So you think why are you so in love with Muhammad Ali who is as pretty much as pro Skyman as you can be?

222
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,488
Speaker 1: Well, the fact is is that even though he was pro Skyman He was Malcolm X Skyman style, right?

223
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,440
Speaker 1: And the fact is that type of Islam that he believes in right?

224
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

225
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,672
Speaker 1: He believes in a ridiculous Skyman that doesn't exist which is not good, right?

226
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:26,259
Speaker 1: But that imaginary Skyman's Imaginary teachings happen to be the same thing that my complete lack of Skyman also teaches me, right?

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,127
Speaker 1: It's like he was you know, he wasn't uh, you know, like a terrorist Muslim right like killing everybody.

228
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,900
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, he refused to go to the war and kill Vietnamese people.

229
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:44,839
Speaker 1: I would have done the same exact thing yeah for a different reason and they suspended him from boxing in basically his prime years.

230
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:56,068
Speaker 0: and When he finally won his court case because again, he was so famous and powerful that he couldn't be ignored He finally won he started boxing again And he was still an unbeatable powerhouse.

231
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:01,382
Speaker 0: Nate silver wrote an article a little while ago on 538 that said that his greatness defied Statistics.

232
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:05,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically you had this like invincible human being right?

233
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,116
Speaker 1: There was a comic book.

234
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,062
Speaker 1: That's famous like Muhammad Ali vs Superman.

235
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:12,480
Speaker 1: it's like yet and that made sense because he was the closest thing to Superman that ever existed.

236
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:18,960
Speaker 1: Right, this isn't like, you know, like even Wayne Gretzky isn't even half as great right Wayne Gretzky?

237
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,279
Speaker 1: His name is the great one.

238
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:26,960
Speaker 1: Not even you could combine like Wayne Gretzky Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan and you still wouldn't have one Muhammad Ali, right?

239
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,932
Speaker 1: He's like a historical figure like Alexander the Great, right?

240
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:42,767
Speaker 1: This is this is like, you know, the supreme Amazing human being right people don't understand because they weren't alive when he was still a person that you would see You know walking around and talking whatever.

241
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,473
Speaker 1: so I guess is that big.

242
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:49,546
Speaker 0: I guess what I should say to you guys that he was a hero to multiple generations of people.

243
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 0: like we grew up at the end of the era where kids looked up to this guy and like really Understood and remembered him and here we were probably like the last generation to understand who he was and his message.

244
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:06,920
Speaker 0: You know everything that he stood for as a person for the most part is not only relevant today, but it's sort of starkly relevant.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,180
Speaker 0: Like really wish Parkinson's hadn't taken him out cuz we could kind of use him.

246
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,073
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, he got punched in the head a lot.

247
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:22,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he punched Right, I mean basically and the thing is right, you know is the other major thing, right?

248
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,800
Speaker 1: So when he started his career, he was gonna fight Sonny listed right after winning the gold medal the Olympics, right?

249
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,059
Speaker 1: And nobody gave him a chance.

250
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:31,736
Speaker 1: Of course Nobody gave him a fucking chance.

251
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,095
Speaker 1: As little as people know about Hamad Ali people don't know anything about Sonny listed.

252
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:49,780
Speaker 1: at the time Sonny listed was the scariest Mother fucker to ever walk the earth because if you were the heavyweight champion in the world You were the scariest most dangerous most famous athlete on the face of the earth, right?

253
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,737
Speaker 1: Like if Sonny listed you heard he was that he was gonna be in your town soon.

254
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,382
Speaker 1: You would run away Right.

255
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:59,479
Speaker 1: This is like the most dangerous human being there ever was and some punk kid who's like 20 something.

256
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,443
Speaker 1: It's like.

257
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,460
Speaker 1: it's like so incredibly confident that he's gonna beat the shit out of him.

258
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,133
Speaker 1: Like imagine if you saw me right coming up like I'm gonna beat up Superman.

259
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:12,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can take him I can take him I'm gonna take him down in eight eight rounds.

260
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,874
Speaker 1: No seven.

261
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,762
Speaker 1: No, I'll make it six I'll take him.

262
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:15,044
Speaker 1: right.

263
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:22,669
Speaker 1: you and you see me with like not looking very scary at all Right, like I'm this beautiful, you know human being.

264
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:31,139
Speaker 1: right, you know, I'm look kind of strong, but I don't look scary Like I can take Right and I'm acting like I'm gonna do it.

265
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,340
Speaker 1: Right, first of all, everyone's gonna hate you and think you're a moron and bet against you, right?

266
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,716
Speaker 1: Which is why it was such a humongous deal anyway, so people just don't get it.

267
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:41,980
Speaker 1: It's like you weren't there.

268
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,171
Speaker 1: I wasn't there and I get it.

269
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,100
Speaker 1: How come you weren't there?

270
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,200
Speaker 1: But you also don't get it.

271
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,931
Speaker 1: I guess if you don't you don't have to be there to understand.

272
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:52,689
Speaker 0: if you don't know anything about Muhammad Ali Yeah, you're still curious why.

273
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,539
Speaker 0: who this Cassius Clay guy as we talked about earlier, too.

274
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:11,119
Speaker 0: Watch the Billy Crystal thing because it's inspiring and the most beautiful thing about it I watched it again because I hadn't seen this since I was a kid is that it has this little insert of Muhammad Ali Watching Billy Crystal like Asian TV.

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's just.

276
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:13,048
Speaker 0: it's.

277
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,580
Speaker 0: it's really inspiring and it's it's a good thing to watch.

278
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:19,560
Speaker 1: You mean you should just actually watch Muhammad Ali fight.

279
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:30,473
Speaker 0: also, you should also read all the things he wrote and said because I mean this thing is boxing is boxing gave him The platform to be right, you know, he saw unlike other people right?

280
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,220
Speaker 1: He sought out the camera at all times, right?

281
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,180
Speaker 1: He was a person who tried on purpose to like go out there.

282
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:50,120
Speaker 1: He wasn't someone who was like, you know, you know, like you look at say some current athletes like, you know, no comment You know like I got nothing like Marshawn Lynch would be like the example of someone just like avoids the media at all costs or like when Pete went at even athletes that don't avoid the media.

283
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,760
Speaker 1: It's like they only talk to it as much as they have to and they always make politically correct non comments.

284
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:57,913
Speaker 1: They don't say anything right.

285
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:03,140
Speaker 1: and it's like man I really wish one of these athletes who just say whatever they really wanted to say all the time.

286
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,480
Speaker 0: It's like whenever they do it's always like ridiculous racist nonsense, right?

287
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:19,799
Speaker 1: But it's like we already had that and you really know in a way not doing it is sort of like, you know You know sort of like saying look I can't do it as well as Muhammad Ali did.

288
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,826
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not even gonna bother.

289
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,171
Speaker 0: in his Wikipedia article.

290
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,540
Speaker 0: There's an entire section about his trash talk.

291
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,288
Speaker 0: Why not like a big separate section?

292
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:34,669
Speaker 0: all le le regularly taunted and baited his opponents Before the fight and often during the bout itself.

293
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,414
Speaker 0: He told Frazier in the match.

294
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,979
Speaker 0: He was too dumb to be champion.

295
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:40,385
Speaker 0: This is good stuff.

296
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:46,312
Speaker 0: So another kind of interesting news, you know AlphaGo like Humans have no input and go anymore.

297
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,458
Speaker 0: Ai's got it.

298
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:52,031
Speaker 0: There's something really fascinating going on now and I'll just link to one of these.

299
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:58,148
Speaker 0: but basically they're pointing the same AI Google's deep mind at Atari 2600 games.

300
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,253
Speaker 1: that should be pretty good.

301
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:00,900
Speaker 1: I mean pong should be real easy, right?

302
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,944
Speaker 0: The rationale.

303
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:07,040
Speaker 0: but they're not seeding it with the historical information or historical games.

304
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:13,539
Speaker 1: Right because they wanted to do AlphaGo just like self-trained 100% instead of training it on previous games, which they did.

305
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:17,116
Speaker 1: Yep, well, they did both but right but I'm saying did it with their goal?

306
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:17,780
Speaker 0: history of go?

307
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:21,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but their goal was to be able to do it with only self practice.

308
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,168
Speaker 0: So this is interesting because the AI is give it.

309
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:29,746
Speaker 0: basically this AI is learning to play Atari games the way me and Scott Literally don't play Atari games.

310
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,328
Speaker 0: We were little.

311
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,316
Speaker 0: we sat down in front of an Atari.

312
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:40,540
Speaker 0: We could see the screens We could hit the buttons We didn't have the instruction books and we would just sort of do stuff until we eventually figured the game out.

313
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:51,020
Speaker 1: I mean, but are they telling it things for example, like, you know The score going up is better because usually if you have like a normal old genetic algorithm You would say like a score up better score down worse and then it would figure things out.

314
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,212
Speaker 1: Are they doing that or they just so they did a bunch of different things?

315
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:56,220
Speaker 1: or are they letting it figure out that score to?

316
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,642
Speaker 1: Go up.

317
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:57,408
Speaker 0: So get this.

318
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,840
Speaker 0: This is where it gets crazy.

319
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,209
Speaker 0: They did a bunch of different things, but they're trying something.

320
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,880
Speaker 0: The goal is they're calling it intrinsic motivation.

321
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:23,859
Speaker 0: Basically, they want the AI to get addicted to finding novelty Because the only way to find novelty in a game is to progress through the game mm-hmm and Basically, like if they don't give it that Sense that goal of try to make things happen that I've never seen

322
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:24,000
Speaker 1: right?

323
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,660
Speaker 1: They doesn't know how to value one thing over another right?

324
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,999
Speaker 1: Could play pong and decide that losing is good.

325
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,092
Speaker 0: It basically went back and forth between these two screens and never really progressed anywhere.

326
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:43,020
Speaker 0: as soon as they told it with no other Thing to seek novelty then it's explored already more than half of Montezuma's revenge, which is one.

327
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:43,584
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not.

328
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:44,792
Speaker 1: it's not playing versus games.

329
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,020
Speaker 1: It's playing a single-player game.

330
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:55,595
Speaker 0: It has all the buttons of an Atari and it can see the screen and that's always gonna put it on lowest difficulty maybe.

331
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,814
Speaker 1: So I'd like to I'd rather it play outlaw watch itself.

332
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,582
Speaker 0: watching this is Fascinating.

333
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:12,620
Speaker 0: It's a lot like watching an AGD Q and I look forward to the day when AGD cues will basically just no one has to manually make a tool assisted speed run.

334
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,466
Speaker 1: You just have an alpha.

335
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,056
Speaker 1: go does the speed run and there it is.

336
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:16,883
Speaker 0: Yep I mean alpha go.

337
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:28,873
Speaker 0: they think about all the human effort and now I'm not saying it was wasted in the sense that the people Doing it enjoyed it like the Final Fantasy 4 run where the dude fucking like memorized random Right, but imagine if we can just have a computer just like.

338
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:29,960
Speaker 1: make the perfect run.

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,809
Speaker 1: It would discover things you didn't even discover doing frame by frame.

340
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

341
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,000
Speaker 0: So this is just really fascinating stuff.

342
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,195
Speaker 0: But again, I stress the reason I bring them up is new.

343
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:38,920
Speaker 0: this up is news.

344
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:47,947
Speaker 0: AI is moving so much faster than you realize and Like you saw Google's making their own chips now Just for AI.

345
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:49,940
Speaker 0: like they're not even selling them to other people.

346
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:54,865
Speaker 0: They're making their own chips to use themselves to do That.

347
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,331
Speaker 1: I know of they are.

348
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,580
Speaker 0: they are either acquiring or building one.

349
00:22:58,861 --> 00:22:59,564
Speaker 0: I don't know the four did.

350
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:03,864
Speaker 1: they just buy like one of each machine and make a tiny fab so that they could make like One chip at a time.

351
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,196
Speaker 0: It's not quite how it works.

352
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:08,004
Speaker 0: Yeah But it was so.

353
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,791
Speaker 0: actually I know there's an FPGAs.

354
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:20,560
Speaker 0: the reason I know they're not so the reason I didn't read Like I don't know all the details of that is that that's my Monday news and we skip skip to Monday shows I'm doing the next Monday, but they're making the tensor chips tensor flow stuff.

355
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,795
Speaker 0: So basically they're chips that only do the stuff they need for neural networks and nothing else.

356
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,400
Speaker 1: is making a hardware version of?

357
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,303
Speaker 0: Yes So they can.

358
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:35,380
Speaker 1: basically they're just taking their software and making a hardware chip that does of the software does to make it go fast.

359
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,120
Speaker 1: Cuz if you cuz think of it this way a general-purpose computer has to the calculations Like if I made a counter-strike chip and I think there's a computer that just like.

360
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:44,610
Speaker 1: It's just like.

361
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,279
Speaker 1: yeah, there we go.

362
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,080
Speaker 0: but it's a little more unique than that because this tensor flow stuff is kind of fuzzy logic or like it's not like the.

363
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,776
Speaker 0: you Know the old days where Pentiums if you multiplied certain numbers would get the wrong answer.

364
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,539
Speaker 0: and how that that was.

365
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,780
Speaker 1: That was one Pentium chip and it was like one specific.

366
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,847
Speaker 0: Well, it was the first run of Pentium and it was.

367
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:05,567
Speaker 0: it was that they were not accurate beyond a certain point in Floating point calculations.

368
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:06,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was some register.

369
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:07,839
Speaker 1: So those busted I forget.

370
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,750
Speaker 0: now It was a logic error from what I read.

371
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:11,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, I could go look it up again.

372
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,655
Speaker 0: I I looked it up to do a talk on it like ten years ago.

373
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:15,217
Speaker 0: Okay.

374
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:18,054
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, I digress it never mattered.

375
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:20,066
Speaker 0: keep an eye It mattered to a few people.

376
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:29,744
Speaker 0: you keep an eye out for this AI stuff like I bring it up on Thursday because Monday is like check out what it's doing and Tuesday would be AGD cues.

377
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:35,040
Speaker 0: but Thursday is the shit's gonna affect your life in a real way way sooner than you realize.

378
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:41,250
Speaker 0: Probably something that was funny today is You know that the president like the nomination process in America is over.

379
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:42,073
Speaker 0: It's Trump and Clinton.

380
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,277
Speaker 0: They're running like that's it.

381
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:43,618
Speaker 0: Whatever.

382
00:24:43,979 --> 00:25:01,300
Speaker 0: but What's interesting is that nothing the crazy candidate from all reports actually like reads his own Twitter Himself and like type shit into it Which is crazy because like any professional politician hires someone to do that for them also doesn't have time to do that.

383
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:10,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and it appears that the crazy one also takes it all really personally like literally just responds to random people And it's just like that sort of thing is happening.

384
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:24,016
Speaker 0: So the Hillary account tweeted something that was you know The delete your account like Trump's have something dumb and it was like delete your account and it went crazy viral What was interesting and I didn't even think about this until I found these compilations.

385
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:24,759
Speaker 0: This is one of them.

386
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:29,957
Speaker 0: Anyone older than like 35 has no fucking idea what that means.

387
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:37,260
Speaker 0: It means It means what you said is so egregious that you should just delete your account and literally go away from this social network forever.

388
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:39,199
Speaker 1: Right as in you know, you have a Twitter account.

389
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,433
Speaker 1: Delete it so that you don't see your tweets anymore and you stop tweeting.

390
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you shouldn't be on this.

391
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,293
Speaker 1: What at me I mean, it's pretty and there's no jargon there.

392
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:48,920
Speaker 1: It's delete your account.

393
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,284
Speaker 0: What's the main?

394
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:56,524
Speaker 1: like regular old media like and it's like say it's like say like if someone says something stupid to you and you Say kill yourself.

395
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:14,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is a video and there are many of these Of all the sort of mainstream news outlets around the world who don't understand what this means Trying to explain it badly to the people who watch TV news meaning the people who also don't understand what it means.

396
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:20,410
Speaker 0: It is amazing to watch the generational divide so starkly and clearly demonstrated.

397
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:30,016
Speaker 1: Well, you know what as you know, you might be laughing at those people, but hey the people who know what delete your account means They don't know who Muhammad Ali is but the people watching the news do.

398
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:32,146
Speaker 0: yeah Of course.

399
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:43,320
Speaker 0: at the same time the people are watching the news Also have their hands on the money and power and at least currently because they're old and also I'm sure some of the people watching The news are those racist types who were like they know who?

400
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,900
Speaker 1: Like use a slave name because they hate him they hate him or they're like, you know die Muslim whatever right?

401
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:49,988
Speaker 1: There's that kind of people.

402
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:58,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck them Things of the day.

403
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:00,353
Speaker 0: I already talked about the Billy Crystal thing.

404
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,960
Speaker 0: Just watch it like seriously.

405
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,531
Speaker 1: So he's using your news as a team.

406
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:07,004
Speaker 0: Okay, that was my thing of the day, but it was relevant I guess.

407
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,598
Speaker 0: so, I guess I got another thing here.

408
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:22,240
Speaker 0: this is a video of a guy who is playing around with the steady cam like a for-real one and he's got a $70,000 fancy camera on the steady cam the steady cam that like you wear with like a vest and she up and he's like Holy shit.

409
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,863
Speaker 0: this is amazing.

410
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,089
Speaker 0: and he's like check out stable does this?

411
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,238
Speaker 0: and he starts jumping around and acting the fool.

412
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:33,100
Speaker 1: and uh So if you've never used a steady cam before you got to be first of all to use a steady cam in the first place.

413
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,104
Speaker 1: You got to be jacked right?

414
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:36,051
Speaker 1: Like I couldn't wear one because it's too heavy.

415
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,315
Speaker 1: I'm just like follow could wear.

416
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,239
Speaker 0: you could wear this one.

417
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:43,340
Speaker 1: I've seen like every time I ever see someone with the kind where there's a they look way bulky.

418
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,664
Speaker 0: They're not that heavy.

419
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:52,235
Speaker 1: No, no, but every time I see someone wearing one it they're always a buff, dude Like, you know, you ever see cameraman cameraman are always huge.

420
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,180
Speaker 1: You never see like a little skinny.

421
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of them aren't buff.

422
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:56,040
Speaker 0: They're fat.

423
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:03,289
Speaker 1: There's still us and underneath that if you took all the fat off me and all the fat off them They would be jacked and I would not.

424
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,479
Speaker 1: I still wouldn't be able to do a push-up.

425
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:09,559
Speaker 1: If I had less to push it's because I lack in the pushing power not in me.

426
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,462
Speaker 0: So I'll put it this way

427
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,526
Speaker 1: not that the pushing is

428
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:24,576
Speaker 0: steady cam type things like these camera stabilization things are amazing technology but they're the kind of technology that will fail on you in Crazy ways if you're not trained and you don't know how they actually work

429
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,400
Speaker 1: like tempered glass.

430
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:32,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this guy Let's the arm extend a little too far because it'll like.

431
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:38,060
Speaker 0: you can jump up You can let go of it and jump up and down and it'll be perfectly steady.

432
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:50,459
Speaker 0: But if that arm extends a little bit too far like beyond its safety Then now you've got this long thin skinny arm with a lot of like Mechanical logic in it and you've got a really heavy camera on the end of it.

433
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:53,079
Speaker 0: It hits the safety threshold and it just collapses.

434
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:57,300
Speaker 1: Why don't they change the hinge so it can't extend farther than it should?

435
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:02,173
Speaker 0: Well No one who's ever used one of these things would make that stupid mistake.

436
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,600
Speaker 0: is one to put it that far away from your body?

437
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,857
Speaker 1: To get even close to that you have to like let go of it.

438
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,289
Speaker 0: Yeah You already have to be.

439
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,819
Speaker 1: no one has an arm that long.

440
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,005
Speaker 0: Try to give an equivalent.

441
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,280
Speaker 0: like to get to the point you'd have to like run away from it.

442
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:18,738
Speaker 1: Like leave it there and run.

443
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:20,366
Speaker 0: Like to turn.

444
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:26,730
Speaker 0: like imagine you're riding a bike and you just suddenly turn your front wheel 90 degrees to the left as hard as you can.

445
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,400
Speaker 0: like yeah, the bike will let you do that.

446
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:31,694
Speaker 0: You know not to do that.

447
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

448
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:38,380
Speaker 0: So this guy basically turned the wheel 90 degrees to the right and it is a sublime moment.

449
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,275
Speaker 1: Alright, so here's a video that I saw a long time ago like in the RIT days.

450
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:44,058
Speaker 1: It went around.

451
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 1: I think This was uploaded to YouTube when that'd be interesting information if I could see.

452
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:54,929
Speaker 0: That's not on the front page of a YouTube video anymore Like it used to be a lot more prominent when it was uploaded.

453
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:56,394
Speaker 0: I think YouTube pulled that away.

454
00:29:56,414 --> 00:30:04,678
Speaker 1: I don't know anyway, so This video is from 1998 right and basically what happened here is there was a hacking group.

455
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:05,240
Speaker 0: Oh, it's still there.

456
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,622
Speaker 0: I see it.

457
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,290
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't say it in the app.

458
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,255
Speaker 1: What does it say other?

459
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,340
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not on that video.

460
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,123
Speaker 0: Let me go to that video now.

461
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:11,067
Speaker 0: I picked a random video.

462
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:18,070
Speaker 1: I had YouTube open anyway, so this video is 14th 2011. it's a long time ago.

463
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,625
Speaker 0: the videos from March May 19th 1998.

464
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,800
Speaker 1: so this is there was a hacking group called loft heavy industries.

465
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:40,520
Speaker 1: Obviously the O was a zero and F in loft was a pH And it was a big deal because these dudes with their hacker names like Brian oblivion kingpin space rogue Mudge weld pond Stefan one

466
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:41,865
Speaker 0: Right

467
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:56,780
Speaker 1: these dudes who are like the most stereotypical hackers you've ever seen testified before Congress And when the news reported on this in 1998. basically all the news said was Hackers testified before Congress and say they could take down the internet in 30 minutes.

468
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,774
Speaker 1: But really there's a lot more than they testified to Congress.

469
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,259
Speaker 1: and this was in a day when?

470
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:14,100
Speaker 1: Congress was a little bit better than it is now Interviewing people and Getting you know asking them questions and trying to actually learn from them instead of you know being real dumb.

471
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:21,506
Speaker 1: it was a little bit less corrupt than it is now and This is a really interesting congressional testimony.

472
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:32,760
Speaker 1: if you're a nerd of any kind especially one who cares about technologies and You know it informs a lot of you know what our government thinks about technology these days.

473
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I feel like the Gulf between.

474
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:36,960
Speaker 0: I saw this a long time ago.

475
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,460
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it recently, but if I it's think it just came back up again.

476
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,900
Speaker 0: So I had it like well like my thing of the day on Monday is gonna be that elevator hacking thing from Defcon.

477
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,032
Speaker 0: That thing's way old, but I came up in my feet.

478
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,319
Speaker 0: I was like all right that thing.

479
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,950
Speaker 0: fun fact they gave that lecture at the end of Defcon.

480
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,909
Speaker 0: because imagine if you gave a lecture on how to hack elevators at the Beginning of a long convention of hackers.

481
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:59,478
Speaker 1: I mean they could have fixed the elevators in that hotel.

482
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:07,397
Speaker 0: and now The gist of that video is an Elevator is just an unsecured stairwell.

483
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:16,378
Speaker 1: yes Also, if I was the person doing that presentation I would have during the presentation triggered the elevators in that hotel to do what I say.

484
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,714
Speaker 1: yeah I've been like oh and as I'm speaking the elevators in this hotel are all going to the basement.

485
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:25,868
Speaker 0: the elevators of this hotel have all Exited their shafts and our arms.

486
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,198
Speaker 1: They're all going up to the roof with the doors open.

487
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,418
Speaker 0: But what this video?

488
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:45,241
Speaker 0: The as much as there's this wide gulf between the people testifying and the old men who don't know better interviewing them That Gulf is like four times wider today than it was back in 1998.

489
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:46,927
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm pretty much so.

490
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:54,478
Speaker 0: in the moment the book club book will be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood Even though the handmade sale would probably be more relevant to the current state of America possibly.

491
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,000
Speaker 0: But I got to finish the last wheel of time book first so I can do that last special podcast with Kehil White at PAX Prime.

492
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,771
Speaker 0: I'm halfway through the last book of the wheel of time.

493
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:06,976
Speaker 1: tell me about the snake thief.

494
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:08,060
Speaker 0: I know what's in that tower.

495
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,087
Speaker 0: I know what the deal is for that tower.

496
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,160
Speaker 0: I know what's up with Mazram tame that motherfucker.

497
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,146
Speaker 0: I learned something interesting.

498
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:19,500
Speaker 0: You know how the SNI can make up and bond a man as a water.

499
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,939
Speaker 0: So the male wizards later they learn that they can bond a woman the same way.

500
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:25,325
Speaker 1: What a tubule.

501
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:27,091
Speaker 1: bond each other at the same time.

502
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:32,486
Speaker 0: so someone just did that and it's like Don't if that's bad idea.

503
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,573
Speaker 0: Okay, that that that causes prop.

504
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:38,023
Speaker 0: basically that happens by accident and It's it.

505
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:44,184
Speaker 0: It's like if you see a script that was written poorly starts looping It's stuff goes down.

506
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,194
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm gonna know a lot about the wheel of time real soon.

507
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:48,960
Speaker 0: The patreon is going strong.

508
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:54,431
Speaker 0: I just uploaded and I'm gonna rapid-fire the rest of these now The second of the beta episodes of geek nights.

509
00:33:54,491 --> 00:34:07,039
Speaker 0: and the craziest thing is that as I upload these people who apparently have still been listening to geek nights and hanging out in the forum who haven't posted or said anything for Five plus years are all coming out of the woodwork.

510
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,931
Speaker 0: Some people who remember these episodes.

511
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,820
Speaker 1: How could you remember some beta episode?

512
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,639
Speaker 0: No, because our friends listened to all of them and gave us feedback.

513
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,100
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah What's great about this?

514
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,260
Speaker 0: Is that the first one was pretty entertaining like the first thing we ever did just for various reasons.

515
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,263
Speaker 0: You can hear my commentary.

516
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:31,060
Speaker 0: the commentary that I did when I remastered them will be free for everyone not just patrons.

517
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,623
Speaker 0: I'll update that.

518
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:34,295
Speaker 0: I'll upload that over the weekend as a public update.

519
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,360
Speaker 0: So you guys can hear the commentary.

520
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:50,793
Speaker 0: What I'll say is this if listening to that first beta episode you were somehow under the misapprehension That we figured out what we were doing and made a good show like right away The second episode will disavow you of that illusion, I think it's.

521
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,780
Speaker 1: you know, it's like penny arcade, right?

522
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,120
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, first one's bad.

523
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,719
Speaker 1: The only difference is that the current penny arcade is real good and the current geek nights is still bad Just less bad.

524
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,679
Speaker 0: We decided that we needed to argue more so than when we did this one.

525
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:10,635
Speaker 0: like we start some bullshit arguments and then we get really mad at each other and just keep arguing and keep arguing and then At the end that this beautiful like don't listen to it.

526
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:11,480
Speaker 0: It's actually really bad.

527
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,365
Speaker 0: Just listen to the commentary.

528
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:21,500
Speaker 0: but in the very very end of the file I Interrupt Scott and I'm like, you know what this episode got stupid Just cut it off and then Scott says you're the one who made it stupid.

529
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,754
Speaker 0: You started one of your arguments and literally I say what do you mean?

530
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:26,096
Speaker 0: What?

531
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:27,280
Speaker 0: and then the audio cuts out?

532
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,060
Speaker 0: Like I Imagine we must have argued for another hour or two after that.

533
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,200
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that we didn't and we didn't record it, but it was tough to listen to this one.

534
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,450
Speaker 0: We don't know shit because we're arguing about shit.

535
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,515
Speaker 0: We don't know shit about.

536
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:43,520
Speaker 1: what did we argue about?

537
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:49,960
Speaker 0: You argued that there is no culture of anti-intellectualism in the United States, that's wrong.

538
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:53,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I made it all up and in credit.

539
00:35:53,473 --> 00:35:54,136
Speaker 1: That's what I said.

540
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:54,959
Speaker 1: Are you not putting words?

541
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,483
Speaker 1: Yeah Why would I say that?

542
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the United States is nothing.

543
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:09,117
Speaker 0: but you and I also talk and argue about politics a lot but we Like we get way out of the shit We know and we clearly do not know a lot.

544
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:13,040
Speaker 0: at one point We both start talking about what language or languages might be spoken in India.

545
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:18,181
Speaker 0: Let me tell you we're real dumb in 2005.

546
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:21,691
Speaker 1: Listen, people don't learn things by being young.

547
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:22,313
Speaker 1: Yep.

548
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,500
Speaker 1: This is what it's relevant.

549
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:30,220
Speaker 1: I was watching Simpsons clips the other day, whatever the age I am is the age you are when you're the smartest.

550
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:35,220
Speaker 0: This is one clip where like the producer for itchy and scratchy just comes in to a focus group.

551
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,629
Speaker 0: But he's like you.

552
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,263
Speaker 0: kids are all stupid Stupid.

553
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,228
Speaker 0: you don't know what you want.

554
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:42,420
Speaker 0: That's why you're young because you're stupid.

555
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,427
Speaker 0: So we'd had some ideas.

556
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,170
Speaker 0: what did the show on?

557
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,690
Speaker 0: we actually considered just doing a whole show on Muhammad Ali But I figured you're better.

558
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,900
Speaker 0: you're better served by reading his Wikipedia page.

559
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,180
Speaker 1: You're better served by just YouTube for like until the crack of dawn.

560
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,999
Speaker 1: I mean, yep, once you start watching, you know Muhammad Ali do anything you're gonna be watching for like days.

561
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

562
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:06,720
Speaker 0: I really wish I could have met him or hung out with him or just talk to him.

563
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:08,056
Speaker 1: I'd have been happy to talk to you.

564
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,189
Speaker 0: Anyway.

565
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:14,756
Speaker 0: So I tweeted earlier today at 1151 a.m What should we do the show on tonight?

566
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:16,762
Speaker 0: I got a lot of Suggestions.

567
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,685
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna go through these.

568
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:20,616
Speaker 0: we're gonna pick one if all of them are bad.

569
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:21,540
Speaker 0: This is your fault.

570
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:22,816
Speaker 0: internet.

571
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,589
Speaker 0: Andrew Milim said Syria.

572
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,480
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't think so.

573
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,930
Speaker 0: My response to him was quote.

574
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:36,580
Speaker 0: if I had to make a list of things God is least willing to talk about either on geek nights or in real life I'll talk about Syria.

575
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,616
Speaker 0: See oh you want to not tell that the Assyrians came down like the wolf on the fold.

576
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,963
Speaker 0: the courts are gleaming in purple and Gold.

577
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:47,552
Speaker 0: Yes that guy Real like current Assyria like that region politics.

578
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:49,660
Speaker 0: or do you actually know about old ancient Assyria?

579
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,855
Speaker 1: I know about fictional ancient Assyria.

580
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,818
Speaker 1: All right That fought that fought with fictional Jews.

581
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:57,824
Speaker 0: I'd be interested.

582
00:37:57,844 --> 00:38:00,900
Speaker 1: show on ham radio, but I don't know much about ham radio.

583
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:05,032
Speaker 1: I can tell you that in summer camp There was you could you know where they had every nerdy thing.

584
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:10,396
Speaker 1: ham radio was one of the nerdy thing And it's pretty much only the old grog nard types to do ham radio.

585
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,300
Speaker 1: Not a lot of young people.

586
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:17,889
Speaker 0: It's the kind of thing where I hope that a few people I know Are into it enough cuz it's like say Mad Max or something crazy happens.

587
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,096
Speaker 0: that shit gets really useful real quick.

588
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:28,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise I was actually really into radio as a kid But I didn't have the money or the time or the inclination to do ham.

589
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:30,780
Speaker 1: just use like CB radios the truckers use.

590
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,001
Speaker 0: I was about to say I actually I was a CB radio hobbyist Like.

591
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,437
Speaker 0: I had all these different crystals and I had a base station with a fucking big antenna.

592
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,320
Speaker 0: There's probably illegal.

593
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:43,319
Speaker 1: I mean if I see the apocalypse corners buy some on Amazon or bust into a truck and take it.

594
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,055
Speaker 0: I had random just conversations with truckers driving by like.

595
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:51,735
Speaker 0: I learned a whole bunch of stuff I used to know more about like radio etiquette back then.

596
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:52,860
Speaker 1: because yeah, no one cares.

597
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't have enough.

598
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:56,778
Speaker 1: go watch contact next.

599
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,927
Speaker 0: Conspiracy theories.

600
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:01,539
Speaker 1: don't believe in the next.

601
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,064
Speaker 0: Terminator 1 vs.

602
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,007
Speaker 0: Terminator 2.

603
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:07,312
Speaker 1: Terminator 2 is a better movie next.

604
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,677
Speaker 0: Terminator 1 was a good movie though.

605
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:09,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was not bad.

606
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,780
Speaker 1: I know we could do wasn't even half as good.

607
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,792
Speaker 0: We ever actually do a show on Terminator 2.

608
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:19,420
Speaker 0: I watched it in a couple years up Sometime down the road like when it's bad outside.

609
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:23,500
Speaker 0: Let's watch the two Terminator movies and then review them as Thursday episodes.

610
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,345
Speaker 0: We do a lot in Jurassic Park.

611
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,651
Speaker 1: We can do a Terminator show on all things Terminator.

612
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:29,135
Speaker 0: You have the two movies.

613
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:29,898
Speaker 0: Yeah.

614
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:34,480
Speaker 1: Yeah exactly Ah.

615
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,785
Speaker 1: Also the Terminator 2 video game.

616
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:40,640
Speaker 0: Matt offered to do a guest episode and do a review of the state of New Jersey.

617
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,849
Speaker 0: Call him we could review the state of New York.

618
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,713
Speaker 1: call him right now.

619
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,340
Speaker 0: He said he's busy playing overwatch.

620
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,308
Speaker 1: I think that means he can call him right now.

621
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,320
Speaker 0: Luke's Bert Luke Burge suggested driving just driving.

622
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,259
Speaker 0: I don't think we ever did a show on that.

623
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,759
Speaker 1: It's fun, but don't do it.

624
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,060
Speaker 0: If you don't have to don't have anything to say about I could tell you I do a whole show on driving.

625
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:58,680
Speaker 0: I had anecdotes about like we've done this already.

626
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,610
Speaker 0: We might have I don't know and also future transport like the future of transportation and driving Car will drive itself and hopefully so.

627
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,127
Speaker 0: actually that presents some problems though I was thinking about this a couple weeks ago.

628
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,716
Speaker 0: self-driving cars are great, right?

629
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:15,717
Speaker 0: Yeah here There's one drawback to them right now.

630
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:25,159
Speaker 0: If you're if you're one of those terrible people who insists on living in the suburbs and driving an hour to work every day At least you're punished for it with a horrible commute.

631
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:41,719
Speaker 0: If you have self-driving cars will probably quadruple the traffic and all those shitty like suburban towns Will be full of commuters driving to work like riding to work in their pods and will probably actually make Closer in mass transit and like city infrastructure worse in the short term.

632
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:44,424
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

633
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:45,648
Speaker 0: Why not?

634
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:49,845
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know like this is something I've thought about but I haven't really formed Just concrete opinion on it.

635
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:54,386
Speaker 1: I mean just cuz you're not driving the car It's still gonna be.

636
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:55,791
Speaker 1: if it's still being to be traffic.

637
00:40:55,832 --> 00:41:01,330
Speaker 1: if there's too many of them more than the road can handle Right, yeah, but will it self-driving cars?

638
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,055
Speaker 0: will they just increase the like?

639
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:04,600
Speaker 0: will they overload the road?

640
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:10,140
Speaker 1: Also people are gonna like get in those cars together because you're not gonna like want to own one because that's that defeats the point.

641
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,589
Speaker 1: You're not gonna have right old cars, right?

642
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:14,232
Speaker 1: So you just got a car will be on your street somewhere You'll get in it.

643
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,806
Speaker 0: But I guess there's a wider battle.

644
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:18,921
Speaker 1: improve society by making people socialize with each other like.

645
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:22,512
Speaker 0: will it reduce the need for mass bulk local transport?

646
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:28,020
Speaker 0: or will it cause an explosion of Towns like beacon that are kind of sleeper communities?

647
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:35,414
Speaker 1: Well, I mean just come here even if people stop getting on the Metro North first of all Right, the thing could just take you to the Metro North because then what the fuck is the difference?

648
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,720
Speaker 1: whether it takes you to?

649
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,700
Speaker 1: The train or not, right?

650
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Speaker 1: But also the cars used to all hook up to each other and make a train in which case it's just a fucking train.

651
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,486
Speaker 1: It just has a lot more wheels.

652
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,069
Speaker 1: What's the difference?

653
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:57,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, and actually what one thing, you know the my counterpoint like my counter argument to that idea and Is that think about what happened in a lot of the developing world where they never had phone infrastructure and Then they leapt to cell phones.

654
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,700
Speaker 0: So they skipped like one generation of bullshit.

655
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:04,820
Speaker 0: It's like in Civ 5 when like I build a bunch of bullshit spearmen.

656
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:09,620
Speaker 0: But what if you just don't build spearmen you get to the point of making pike men?

657
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,587
Speaker 0: You skip a whole generation save a ton of money and just make like the good stuff, you know That's what I would have done.

658
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know if I had money right now I could have like a knight but I instead I have a horseman.

659
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,478
Speaker 1: because not cuz I don't know how.

660
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,786
Speaker 1: to night I haven't played.

661
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:32,634
Speaker 1: I've always armor sitting around but the armorsmith one I know how to make it you don't and I'm like, dude Listen, your whole blacksmith shop this whole town's gonna get burnt to the ground.

662
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,020
Speaker 1: If you don't just give me some free armor.

663
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,308
Speaker 1: We have so much iron.

664
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,655
Speaker 1: Just give me free armor.

665
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:38,600
Speaker 1: No, you got to pay.

666
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:43,077
Speaker 0: You don't have that many humans living in your cities because I I have my one city.

667
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:43,940
Speaker 0: I have three cities.

668
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,560
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have a fourth reel soon and all three of them have more population than your capital.

669
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:51,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't get because I basically lived in a desert place.

670
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:51,616
Speaker 1: There's not.

671
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,420
Speaker 1: there wasn't enough food.

672
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, you think I started in a good place?

673
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:54,801
Speaker 1: I had.

674
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:58,800
Speaker 1: no I still have like so low food, even though I got the tradition plus food capital.

675
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:00,999
Speaker 0: I feel like we should start the fourth game.

676
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:06,034
Speaker 0: I feel like that also but we can let this one go until like it's over we could start the fourth game.

677
00:43:06,054 --> 00:43:09,930
Speaker 1: because if we start thinking I'm thinking someone who Was war based and duels only war matters.

678
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:12,340
Speaker 0: Uh, I was not going to war you at any point.

679
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,069
Speaker 0: I had never planned on actually invading you.

680
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,918
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm going to is to end this.

681
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:18,667
Speaker 0: I Was planning almost.

682
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:19,630
Speaker 0: I made all those videos.

683
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,156
Speaker 0: you could have left my caravans alone then that was a like 2007 era geek nights tangent.

684
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:28,023
Speaker 0: I Posit that.

685
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,449
Speaker 0: possibly the fact that the u.s.

686
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:37,268
Speaker 0: Never had mass transit anywhere except New York City pretty much Might and we built all these highways.

687
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:48,054
Speaker 0: if we jump to self-driving cars Suddenly skip over bullet train every single highway We built becomes mass transit and America has this explosion.

688
00:43:48,074 --> 00:44:00,543
Speaker 0: We have this amazing infrastructure Except for all the bridges that are collapsing But suddenly it turns into mass transit like there might be a renaissance in America if we survive the next 20 years of our infrastructure Collapsing.

689
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:01,045
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

690
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:01,749
Speaker 0: We'll see.

691
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,900
Speaker 1: That's it's very optimistic.

692
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:10,560
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because it's here's the problem even if that if what you say is true.

693
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,813
Speaker 1: Right, the self-driving car doesn't go 500 miles an hour.

694
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:14,495
Speaker 1: Like the bullet train.

695
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:15,620
Speaker 1: does you need the bullet train?

696
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,021
Speaker 1: You can't.

697
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:16,945
Speaker 0: why do you need the bullet train?

698
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:20,160
Speaker 1: for so I can get somewhere in less than fucking 10 hours?

699
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:21,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, where are you gonna go?

700
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,079
Speaker 0: Where do we go?

701
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:26,840
Speaker 1: We go to Boston in a self-driving cars takes for fuck ever.

702
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,760
Speaker 0: So there should be bullet trains along the Northeast corridor and along the west coast, but nowhere else.

703
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,820
Speaker 1: I mean there should be one that just goes across the whole goddamn country.

704
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,728
Speaker 1: Why can't I take the train to California?

705
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,531
Speaker 0: who would ride that?

706
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:40,500
Speaker 0: flying is actually way better at that?

707
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,079
Speaker 1: I mean the train is used less energy and goes just as fast.

708
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,327
Speaker 1: How fast does the plane fly?

709
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,473
Speaker 1: about 500 miles an hour?

710
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:48,660
Speaker 1: How fast does the bullet train go?

711
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,030
Speaker 1: You know if the bullet train was going through like the middle of the nowhere that is the middle of America It could go probably even faster than 500.

712
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,800
Speaker 1: It could probably go six or seven hundred.

713
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:59,111
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna touch that one.

714
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:00,200
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna let that stand.

715
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,100
Speaker 1: You don't think that the really long train uses less energy than the plane that has to not only go forward but also go up?

716
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:10,020
Speaker 0: I don't think bullet trains are the solution to Transcontinental.

717
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:15,940
Speaker 1: You think that like a nuclear power plant hooked up to like maglev rail is less efficient than a jet engine?

718
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:18,778
Speaker 0: I think planes are still better at that.

719
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,771
Speaker 0: Also, you never saw the train movie right?

720
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:25,396
Speaker 0: which one the truth.

721
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:29,936
Speaker 0: There's only one train movie Galaxy Express 9 9 9. there's only one train movie.

722
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:39,694
Speaker 0: That's not animated Trains planes automobiles That's also planes and automobiles and actually that that movie is mostly cars.

723
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,000
Speaker 1: so the general with Buster Keaton.

724
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:46,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that is also a train movie.

725
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:48,315
Speaker 0: anyway That's the only train movies.

726
00:45:48,436 --> 00:45:55,149
Speaker 1: I know deciding what restaurant to eat at The one we're deciding what to do the show on.

727
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:57,015
Speaker 0: that's Chris Reimer suggested.

728
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,279
Speaker 1: You've done that already did we?

729
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,731
Speaker 1: yes We've done that like a hundred times.

730
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:02,800
Speaker 1: we've done this exact episode.

731
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,463
Speaker 1: We're doing now 100 times.

732
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:04,286
Speaker 1: No this episode.

733
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:05,069
Speaker 0: We're actually doing.

734
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,154
Speaker 0: we're doing though.

735
00:46:06,174 --> 00:46:08,685
Speaker 0: We're I don't think we've done one That was stated goal.

736
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:11,498
Speaker 0: We're just going to do a show on how we decide what to do the show on.

737
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,279
Speaker 0: I think we've ever done that.

738
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:16,010
Speaker 1: This is what it sounds like to decide what to do the show on.

739
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,656
Speaker 0: we we do a bring up.

740
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,860
Speaker 1: we bring up crab people.

741
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:20,410
Speaker 0: We do a one to two minute show.

742
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,819
Speaker 1: I reject most of them.

743
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:27,395
Speaker 1: Oh We find the least the the most tolerable crab people and then we settle on it.

744
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:30,654
Speaker 0: the threshold for what's tolerable Continues to drop the hungrier.

745
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:35,977
Speaker 0: we are Deciding what restaurant to eat that actually could be a good show to do.

746
00:46:36,118 --> 00:46:36,259
Speaker 0: not.

747
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:37,892
Speaker 1: now I don't think we could do 20 minutes.

748
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:38,679
Speaker 0: I think we could.

749
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,906
Speaker 0: So here's the topics.

750
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:46,592
Speaker 0: all right, so here's how I'll give you guys this cuz we're not gonna Do this show on this cuz this show is actually almost done.

751
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:48,440
Speaker 0: We've been going for like 50 minutes.

752
00:46:49,901 --> 00:47:02,008
Speaker 0: There's the one the problem of like conventions like deciding where to eat forming the group of people to eat splitting up the group's reservations how everyone just fucking sucks at that and You know there's a lot to say.

753
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,039
Speaker 0: there's probably like eight minutes of stuff on that.

754
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,876
Speaker 0: There's us ourselves and how much easier that got.

755
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 0: we moved to New York And there's literally like 30 restaurants within a 15-minute travel of our apartment plus grow up hub.

756
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:17,294
Speaker 0: But you could grow up from multiple places.

757
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,100
Speaker 0: deal with the picky people.

758
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:21,934
Speaker 0: We could talk about the picky people and how you just need to cut them out of your group.

759
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:23,821
Speaker 1: or don't be don't be picky Babies.

760
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:28,194
Speaker 1: if you're gonna be picky then look I don't like certain things right?

761
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,100
Speaker 1: you know everyone doesn't like certain things.

762
00:47:30,702 --> 00:47:39,312
Speaker 1: But if like if I go to a restaurant for example like I'm not really into Radish and like you know radishes.

763
00:47:39,352 --> 00:47:40,780
Speaker 0: There's a restaurant that has just radish.

764
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,290
Speaker 1: I mean radish is okay, but like I will never buy a radish.

765
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,700
Speaker 1: I'll never intentionally put a radish in my food, right?

766
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:57,923
Speaker 1: I won't order a radish focused dish at a restaurant But if I get a salad if I get a salad and there's mad radish on it or even moderate radish on it You know what I fucking eat it cuz I'm not a child Right.

767
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:10,165
Speaker 1: so when you so when you go to a restaurant if you have like celiac disease or an allergy and you say no Bread, please that's absolutely acceptable, but if you say no radish You're a fucking baby.

768
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,774
Speaker 1: Just fucking eat it or order something else now.

769
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:13,696
Speaker 0: It is one thing.

770
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,762
Speaker 0: Let's say the Like.

771
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:21,050
Speaker 0: the menu listed the things in it, and it didn't list radish and yet radish was a significant component.

772
00:48:22,793 --> 00:48:28,586
Speaker 0: I Even asked like hey, what's in this?

773
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,580
Speaker 0: and they still like didn't mention radish even once and then it's just like covered in radishes.

774
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:35,074
Speaker 1: That's a little weird and bad restaurant.

775
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:35,940
Speaker 1: Don't go there again.

776
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,638
Speaker 0: I've run into those situations before but it hasn't happened since I moved to New York.

777
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:42,828
Speaker 0: There's also so there's a side topic there.

778
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:43,791
Speaker 0: I noticed something.

779
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:57,659
Speaker 0: This is a problem that I never considered specifically in this context until the last Pac South Because remember we needed to find a place to eat and everyone was crowded and had a long wait.

780
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,530
Speaker 0: And pass like San Antonio is one of those weird places where despite being crowded Restaurants will take reservations, which I think is ludicrous.

781
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,147
Speaker 0: like if you're a good restaurant, and you're like filling reliably You should never take reservations.

782
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:11,040
Speaker 1: No need to take a reservation like in New York.

783
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,113
Speaker 0: No good restaurant except the super super upper-end places that are so expensive.

784
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:15,955
Speaker 0: They don't fail.

785
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:23,053
Speaker 0: like no one takes reservations You're just like stand outside for an hour if you want to eat a salt and fat Yep, or go it like the worst possible time.

786
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:24,400
Speaker 1: It's like they're gonna fill all their seats.

787
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:27,507
Speaker 0: They don't need your reservation And we had a constraint of.

788
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:30,899
Speaker 0: we had a pretty large group of like 12 people and we all want to eat together.

789
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:37,911
Speaker 1: now in The old days like I think everyone else always wants to everyone eat together I'm happy to just eat and it's like just split up guys.

790
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:38,433
Speaker 1: make it easy.

791
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:38,634
Speaker 0: Well.

792
00:49:38,654 --> 00:49:39,900
Speaker 0: That's it in the old days.

793
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,803
Speaker 1: Just go ever.

794
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:51,518
Speaker 0: we would like put great effort into being able to all eat together and I've decided that that is always a wasted effort especially at like a convention or whatever.

795
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:52,040
Speaker 0: right.

796
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,526
Speaker 0: But there's a side thing.

797
00:49:53,847 --> 00:50:03,757
Speaker 0: we found a place that would seat all of us immediately and We got a giant table and that seemed fine and in fact I noticed this happen a bunch of times.

798
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:04,480
Speaker 0: in San Antonio.

799
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,479
Speaker 0: There were restaurants that had the seating to accommodate a giant group of people.

800
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:19,279
Speaker 0: However Places like that places that aren't like New York or Chicago that have a huge population of people doing that sort of thing all the time They have slow kitchens.

801
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:25,239
Speaker 0: They're never going to have a kitchen that could actually deliver that much food in time.

802
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:35,819
Speaker 0: So you run in the situation in San Antonio where you'll find a restaurant that will seat all 20 of you right now And then it'll take them literally an hour and a half to bring out your food.

803
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,950
Speaker 0: So that's a further no new argument.

804
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:42,800
Speaker 0: one don't go to places in cities that aren't New York.

805
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,628
Speaker 1: Oh, you got 12 people right.

806
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,500
Speaker 1: don't even go up and be like we got 12, and we can split up.

807
00:50:47,621 --> 00:50:49,760
Speaker 1: No, just say we got fo table four.

808
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,025
Speaker 1: We got three tables before.

809
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:51,386
Speaker 1: now.

810
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:56,069
Speaker 0: the drama problem is that usually in any in any large towns You don't know each other.

811
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:56,616
Speaker 1: fo fo fo.

812
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:00,051
Speaker 1: Well in any large group, you know you didn't get my fo fo fo.

813
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,035
Speaker 0: I got your fo fo fo.

814
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,300
Speaker 1: yo you get that reference.

815
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:02,806
Speaker 1: I think so.

816
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:03,798
Speaker 1: What is that reference from?

817
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,985
Speaker 0: There's nothing with Ross's.

818
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,090
Speaker 0: got it a Ross right?

819
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:08,335
Speaker 0: no no I got nothing.

820
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:09,400
Speaker 1: then it's a basketball right?

821
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:12,475
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck that is that I don't watch basketball.

822
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:15,674
Speaker 0: I don't like basketball I don't know anything about basketball.

823
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:16,379
Speaker 0: and I go ahead.

824
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:23,017
Speaker 0: I'm bad at basketball - like real bad at it like Preternaturally bad at basketball if you watch me try to play like it's awful.

825
00:51:23,218 --> 00:51:26,583
Speaker 0: continue Right.

826
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:33,440
Speaker 0: if you have it like sometimes like the front row crew like when like in the old days like when we'd all get together We all want to go to the same restaurant.

827
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,831
Speaker 0: Everyone wanted to sit with everyone else like we were all chills.

828
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,600
Speaker 0: if we split up it literally didn't matter who sat with who?

829
00:51:41,866 --> 00:52:02,060
Speaker 0: but Usually if you out there or are at a convention Or you have a large group of friends, and you all decide you want to get out together There are definitely a lot of people who don't actually want to share the table with certain other people Like there's the newer friends Stuck with like the second tier people like they want to sit with the prime people.

830
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:03,819
Speaker 0: They want to sit at the cool table.

831
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,089
Speaker 0: It always ends up being the hierarchy of like.

832
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:08,540
Speaker 0: there's two tables were like cool crafts happening.

833
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:11,879
Speaker 0: Then there's the table with all the people who aren't like super in the group.

834
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:16,475
Speaker 0: And then there's the table with like the super annoying CPM who somehow is in your group.

835
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:17,438
Speaker 0: You couldn't get rid of them.

836
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:26,820
Speaker 0: and There I think we could do a whole show on how to file like how to decide where to eat How to deal with small and large groups, I think we do a whole show Thursday.

837
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:29,747
Speaker 1: Hmm what I wasn't listening.

838
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,272
Speaker 0: I think people would listen.

839
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:31,955
Speaker 0: I think you would like it.

840
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:33,079
Speaker 1: I wasn't listening to you.

841
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:34,366
Speaker 0: Okay, what were you doing?

842
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:35,029
Speaker 1: reading some internet?

843
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:35,673
Speaker 0: Okay?

844
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:36,799
Speaker 0: Uh?

845
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:37,692
Speaker 0: Indy car.

846
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,504
Speaker 0: It's car racing.

847
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:40,628
Speaker 0: I don't know enough about it.

848
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:44,442
Speaker 0: That's mostly died frequent flyer programs And like.

849
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:48,200
Speaker 0: so like the jet blue stuff or the I guess the bolt bus thing.

850
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,023
Speaker 0: I'm member of that.

851
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:53,280
Speaker 1: I get free rides from all the time you do it a lot, and then you get free shit.

852
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:54,250
Speaker 1: What's there today?

853
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:59,339
Speaker 0: I mean The airplane stuff kind of matters because that's how I get like upgrades.

854
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:05,181
Speaker 1: yeah You can get a lot of you can get more value you get a large amount of values worth and a lot of people do It.

855
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:09,900
Speaker 1: I don't understand why companies Allow their individual employees to keep those benefits.

856
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,954
Speaker 0: I would not fucking fly anywhere ever if my company didn't let me keep my air miles.

857
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:15,238
Speaker 0: I would refuse mm-hmm.

858
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:18,773
Speaker 1: That's why yeah like if I'm a company.

859
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,440
Speaker 1: I'm like fly here, or you're fired.

860
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,505
Speaker 1: It's your job to fly there.

861
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,915
Speaker 0: no except literally no no one would do it.

862
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:29,673
Speaker 0: pretty much Partly the accounts are usually tied to individuals like the corporate there.

863
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,880
Speaker 0: usually they'll be like a corporate pool and weird stuff.

864
00:53:32,061 --> 00:53:39,460
Speaker 0: But generally no you you use your own air miles But at the same time your company might say you're not like you can't buy that ticket.

865
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,276
Speaker 0: That's I know you want to fly Delta or whatever, but that ticket cost twice as much.

866
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,398
Speaker 0: fuck you you're flying jet blue whatever.

867
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,996
Speaker 0: uh One thing I can say is that I've seen people who?

868
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,920
Speaker 0: Try to min max it and spend a lot of time like trying to game those systems.

869
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,103
Speaker 1: Spent that time working.

870
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,026
Speaker 0: yeah, don't bother.

871
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:07,300
Speaker 0: the only the only time it is worth your while to like buy air miles There's some nonsense like that is if you're already in the wealthy class because then like it actually is cheaper than buying business class.

872
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,227
Speaker 0: You're already wealthy though.

873
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:09,940
Speaker 1: Does why do you even need to save fucking money?

874
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:11,166
Speaker 0: I'm not.

875
00:54:11,186 --> 00:54:12,800
Speaker 0: I didn't get rich by wasting money.

876
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,693
Speaker 1: Scrooge McDuck would do that kind of shit.

877
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:16,680
Speaker 0: I would do that.

878
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:26,773
Speaker 0: I mean I do that a little bit like I have all my frequent flyers stuff and I might buy a bunch of miles on Cathey for next year so that Emily and I can just fly business class.

879
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:31,399
Speaker 0: if we go to Australia like something like that Do whatever you want be way cheaper than buying a business class ticket.

880
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,890
Speaker 0: Vaporwave I'm not gonna talk about vaporwave for if it doesn't exist Comixology changing subscription model, I just don't use Comixology.

881
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,114
Speaker 1: I don't use that either.

882
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:44,865
Speaker 0: I would but I Read books on my Kindle instead.

883
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:50,765
Speaker 1: I read comic books on paper not because I'm obviously not anti Digital read things.

884
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:52,732
Speaker 1: I would much rather read things digitally.

885
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:58,198
Speaker 1: but comics at least, you know most of the ones I read were made with paper in mind.

886
00:54:58,218 --> 00:55:10,052
Speaker 1: and Unlike say reading a book digitally, which there's not really any fucking difference If a comic book was made for paper and then you read it digitally That's like watching a widescreen movie on a 4/3 TV.

887
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:11,096
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

888
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,186
Speaker 0: Ah All right home organization systems.

889
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:16,975
Speaker 0: I get a lot of thoughts to unpack on that one.

890
00:55:17,035 --> 00:55:18,359
Speaker 0: So get it.

891
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:19,526
Speaker 1: It's not funny.

892
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,312
Speaker 0: That was real funny.

893
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:23,906
Speaker 0: No music Talked about music.

894
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,496
Speaker 1: It's too general music.

895
00:55:25,536 --> 00:55:28,969
Speaker 0: We like Almost all of it music.

896
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:31,559
Speaker 1: We particularly like almost all of it.

897
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:39,747
Speaker 0: you gotta have something like if you like if you're like a B test like it's in a Monomart song and Pretty good, like a Beatles song pretty good.

898
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:43,738
Speaker 0: Like what if you had to pick one like prioritize which song is it?

899
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,426
Speaker 0: Yeah It's got to be somebody's like.

900
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,758
Speaker 0: I don't like a lot of modern R&B.

901
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,281
Speaker 0: that much Depends.

902
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:59,720
Speaker 1: but they see like that's a very narrow any any any genre that you pick out and you And you try to tell me I don't like that genre.

903
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:05,806
Speaker 1: I'll find you like some songs in that genre that are so awesome because I think what I really like like What about country or Western?

904
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:06,670
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

905
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:08,640
Speaker 1: I like some country songs.

906
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:14,040
Speaker 1: I like songs with a strong melodic hook regardless of sound like, you know what?

907
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,785
Speaker 0: I think Garth Brooks like Thunder rolls.

908
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:19,096
Speaker 0: That's just like a twangy country kind of cliche song.

909
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:20,300
Speaker 0: It's not a bad song.

910
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:21,363
Speaker 0: I like it.

911
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:35,924
Speaker 1: like you could take the same exact song and have some you know like Dolly Parton sing it and then have say I don't know I used to earth sing it and I'll probably if it's a good song.

912
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:36,826
Speaker 1: I'll like it both ways.

913
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:37,648
Speaker 1: It was a bad song.

914
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:38,530
Speaker 1: I'll hate it both ways.

915
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:47,306
Speaker 0: I Don't like the subject matter Like if it's the same like.

916
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:51,119
Speaker 1: yeah, I tend to listen to more foreign or non lyrical music.

917
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:57,502
Speaker 1: Cuz then you can't hear the awful lyrics right because I won't hear awful lyrics Right.

918
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:02,080
Speaker 1: and awful lyrics include things that are just like, you know awful.

919
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:05,900
Speaker 1: You know gangster rap that I run into that pretty often.

920
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:14,506
Speaker 0: I like a lot of rap and hip-hop and yet the lyrics to the some of the songs that I really enjoy are Fucking awful, right?

921
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:14,707
Speaker 1: It's like.

922
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:15,270

Speaker 0: It's actually legit.

955
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:34,777
Speaker 1: Simpson wave Right now today.

956
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:46,082
Speaker 1: I listened to so low-end Entertainment which is like one of the major kpop labels made a deal with Spotify So all of these past albums and things that were never on there.

957
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,350
Speaker 1: It was like a huge dump of like new whatever, right?

958
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:59,742
Speaker 1: So but right now I think XO just came back and as usual They have one good song and an album full of crap songs and one good song but they're like the biggest deal in the world at least for other people.

959
00:58:59,843 --> 00:59:05,915
Speaker 1: and then I listened to like The vorjax 9 6 or 9.

960
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:07,983
Speaker 0: symphony is probably the one you're thinking of.

961
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:09,650
Speaker 1: I'd bow but I think they put on Spotify.

962
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:10,638
Speaker 1: There might have been this.

963
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:12,090
Speaker 1: I forget which one that went on Spotify.

964
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you really like him, you should.

965
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,206
Speaker 1: he's my number one guy.

966
00:59:15,326 --> 00:59:16,010
Speaker 0: You should go back.

967
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:17,319
Speaker 0: Do you like piano concertos?

968
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:18,810
Speaker 0: Do you want like the big orchestra there?

969
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,273
Speaker 1: I don't really care.

970
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:22,539
Speaker 0: go listen to a bunch of Franz Liszt.

971
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:23,922
Speaker 1: I already listened to Franz Liszt.

972
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:25,507
Speaker 1: Okay teaching me anything new here.

973
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:29,122
Speaker 0: Uh You have you ever gone deep into the Rachmaninoff?

974
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:31,874
Speaker 0: I don't like Rachmaninoff as much But how do you like Liszt?

975
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:33,339
Speaker 0: but knock rock not Rachmaninoff?

976
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:33,880
Speaker 0: It's different.

977
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:35,305
Speaker 0: What what did you describe?

978
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,630
Speaker 0: how they're different at least?

979
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:41,182
Speaker 0: Is more superficial like tone-poem nonsense.

980
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:49,475
Speaker 0: Like this is a song about a painting I'm looking at at least Rachmaninoff has the crazy skill depth of the piano part The ones I.

981
00:59:49,515 --> 00:59:51,744
Speaker 1: the one I really don't like the most is Vivaldi.

982
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:52,567
Speaker 1: That's my.

983
00:59:52,608 --> 00:59:55,984
Speaker 0: it's my not Vivaldi's good background music, I guess.

984
00:59:56,728 --> 01:00:00,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever I'm really into lately the kind of music they play in the clothing store.

985
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:04,170
Speaker 1: Like I'll go into a clothing store and put on Shazam and then go home and listen to that.

986
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,497
Speaker 1: So it's funny not buy clothes.

987
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:10,187
Speaker 0: I said I'm listening to Simpson wave and like I'm not joking look, I literally am listening to Simpson wave.

988
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:14,261
Speaker 0: but That is very aesthetically similar to the kind of music.

989
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:20,086
Speaker 0: They tend to play late at night in the rock climbing gym I go to and I'm digging that aesthetic a lot.

990
01:00:20,146 --> 01:00:23,697
Speaker 0: It's this is sort of The Muzak got to you.

991
01:00:23,717 --> 01:00:26,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a step up from Muzak because it's a little more.

992
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:41,914
Speaker 0: It's more sparse than Muzak and yet more punctuated at the same time Mm-hmm, like sparser more punctuated melodic and rhythmic elements Basic income.

993
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:48,107
Speaker 0: so that's been coming up a lot and I'd love we could do a whole show on that probably basic guaranteed income.

994
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:51,170
Speaker 1: What's there to say other than we're just waiting for it?

995
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,119
Speaker 0: I think I could say a lot about like cool.

996
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,204
Speaker 0: Where could it succeed?

997
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:54,888
Speaker 0: Where could it fail?

998
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:55,370
Speaker 0: What would it do?

999
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,175
Speaker 0: What would we do?

1000
01:00:56,497 --> 01:00:58,470
Speaker 0: What's the threshold where we wouldn't work anymore?

1001
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,355
Speaker 0: Like that kind of stuff.

1002
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:10,130
Speaker 0: if I can just live my life comfortably Comfortably you mean comfortably like our New York high-fluent lifestyle or like living in like a shack outside of Albany somewhere.

1003
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,336
Speaker 1: No, I'm not living in a shack.

1004
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:11,899
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

1005
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,495
Speaker 0: a warm shack though, like you don't have to do anything Got internet.

1006
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:17,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, can I still buy comic books every month?

1007
01:01:17,562 --> 01:01:19,207
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but you can't afford to go to Pax's.

1008
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:22,513
Speaker 1: fuck that Why live?

1009
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:26,529
Speaker 0: the problem is everyone was talking about basic income because they're like all Switzerland's doing it.

1010
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:28,056
Speaker 0: No, Switzerland's not.

1011
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,290
Speaker 0: they're voting on it and no one in Switzerland wants it to happen.

1012
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:37,404
Speaker 0: They're almost everyone in Switzerland is like crazily Violently opposed to the idea of basic income.

1013
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:48,622
Speaker 0: Also, they have mad money Need the basic income like the places where this is being put forth for referendums or debate The the tide is overwhelmingly against it.

1014
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:50,087
Speaker 0: Like this is not moving forward.

1015
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:50,729

1017
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:52,895
Speaker 0: There's poor people there.

1019
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:56,810
Speaker 1: it's not mostly poor people like other countries.

1020
01:01:57,151 --> 01:02:00,684
Speaker 0: Uh ride-sharing like lyft and uber those aren't ride-sharing.

1021
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:06,710
Speaker 0: Those are just like evil subcontractor like slave wage slave nonsense companies.

1022
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,493
Speaker 0: That should be banned.

1023

1027
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:23,110
Speaker 1: No one wants that and like people do it because it's a cheaper ride.

1028
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:31,748
Speaker 0: It's only slightly cheaper and from everyone I've heard who talks about it It is Russian roulette with what crazy motherfuckers sitting next to you in that car.

1029
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:40,557
Speaker 0: Sure It is bad news bears and also forget that the ride the people who do drive those cars are just exploited Subcontractors.

1037
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:09,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it takes a long time to do a bunch of things for five minutes instead of one thing for Do we do more than four things?

1038
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:09,509

1051
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:50,540

1052
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:58,840
Speaker 0: so if you actually want us to do one of those topics just Posting the forum and tweet at us and talk about how good of an idea you think it is.

1053
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:06,959
Speaker 0: now you really want to hear our opinions because That'll give me a little more ammo to trick Scott into doing a show on one of these things.

1054
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:09,880
Speaker 0: But anyway now I leave you with something odd.
