00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,846
Rym: It's Tuesday March 12th 2019.

2
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:14,815
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:23,360
Rym: the newest hottest hotness Autochess a mod in dota 2 that has nothing to do with chess.

4
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:25,958
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:29,909
Rym: So there's a thing I knew about for a while.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,220
Rym: It's happened in New York in several waves.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,087
Scott: I was hoping to me actually mostly last year.

8
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:36,094
Scott: It never happened to me.

9
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:37,840
Scott: Oh I had for like about a week.

10
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,951
Scott: I was getting them constantly and I blocked them all.

11
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:50,000
Scott: but basically it's a. it's a scam call But it's a scam call that targets Chinese people who live in the United States Tells them probably I think a scam about immigration to try to get them to send money to someone.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:01:05,960
Scott: Yeah, and since you live in New York City where there's a lots and lots of Chinese people that call was hitting us Because I guess of our area code they were targeting Whereas other parts of the country with less Chinese population probably weren't getting this particular evil scam call.

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,360
Rym: Well part of the reason why I never got it is that I have two phone numbers.

14
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:13,360
Rym: One of them is in an area code in the mid Hudson Valley where I don't live.

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,440
Rym: So I just blocked any phone call from that area code because no one who lives there would ever call me.

16
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,096
Rym: And if somehow I know someone who lives there that sucks.

17
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:23,920
Rym: You just can't call me.

18
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:25,758
Rym: I'm not willing to deal with it.

19
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:33,140
Rym: And then my other phone number is a New York City phone number, but it's on Google Voice that has spam filtering.

20
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,460
Scott: Yeah, I just have an app on my phone that spam filters.

21
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,835
Scott: It actually has been working betterly or either there's less spam calls or the app is improved lately.

22
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:45,632
Rym: So I was at work today and My phone at my desk rings, which doesn't.

23
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:47,460
Scott: oh you have a office phone.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,260
Scott: Yeah, but I always refuse to have an office phone and it has been very good for me.

25
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:55,540
Rym: I don't even know what the phone number is to call that phone.

26
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,400
Scott: I haven't had an office phone since I worked at the company that sent me to the middle of nowhere.

27
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:03,765
Rym: I had an office phone when I was at that broker-dealer So long ago.

28
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:07,020
Scott: companies are saving so much money just not having my last company.

29
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:09,696
Rym: They were like you want a phone and I was like, why would I want a phone?

30
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,388
Rym: Hell no Yep, and I was.

31
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:12,920
Rym: and they were like, well, how should people call you?

32
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,298
Rym: And I was like, why would I ever want anyone to call me at the office?

33
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:16,720
Scott: That's right.

34
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,276
Scott: Do not call ever.

35
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:23,448
Rym: Yep And then I set up like a Google Voice for myself at work and like I set up Google Voice for everybody It just worked.

36
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:23,852
Rym: It was great.

37
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:27,347
Scott: email me Those are the work approved communications.

38
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:29,615
Rym: anyway this phone rings and I'm just like what.

39
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:31,000
Rym: what's that sound?

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,607
Rym: What the hell is going on?

41
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,900
Rym: And because it's a fancy company everything's integrated.

42
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,554
Rym: So then it pops up on my screen and it's like phone call from the outside world.

43
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:44,137
Rym: because I guess your VoIP system with the software Yeah, cuz I guess if someone called me internally like I'd see their picture.

44
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,770
Rym: Yep We're big on video chat like.

45
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:51,340
Rym: yeah, if I want to talk to someone at work I literally just click a button and a video chat opens like at their desk and we see each other and just talk.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,824
Rym: It's awesome.

47
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,686
Rym: So, uh, I Answer this call because I'm just like what.

48
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:56,730
Rym: why would anyone?

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,720
Rym: and immediately that music starts and I hear the Chinese game.

50
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:09,103
Rym: so I hang up and then I noticed that a Phone a few deaths down for me rings and they pick it up and they these and they mutter under the breath What the fuck?

51
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,713
Rym: Oh and then they hang up and then another phone on the floor rings it.

52
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:16,284
Rym: it called every goddamn phone number in My company one by one.

53
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:22,301
Rym: All right, and the reactions range from I have a phone To.

54
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,719
Rym: why is someone calling this phone who even knows this phone number?

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,739
Scott: Robot who's just iterating through phone numbers?

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:41,120
Rym: yep, and then I got home and I noticed that the spam filter on my New York number had picked up a spam call to Voicemail and it gave me the notification like by the way, there's the spam voicemail just in case you care.

57
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:42,344
Rym: So I looked at it.

58
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:46,298
Rym: I clicked on it just now and it was the from the music and then the Chinese spam.

59
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:46,820
Rym: Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:47,730
Rym: So there we go.

61
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,419
Rym: That's my story.

62
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,132
Scott: Okay, yeah, that's what that's that's not like.

63
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,138
Rym: that's my opening bit.

64
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,190
Rym: great I can't talk about the water in the ceiling.

65
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,800

Scott: We do have a gaming.

72
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,880

00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,901
Scott: So I we might have talked about it on the show before but you've definitely talked about this Again.

74
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:14,143
Rym: so there's

75
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:34,586
Scott: a If you follow the speedrunning biz other than a GDQ as GDQ on their twitch channel They have they host other speedrunning things like quick fixes and whatnot and one of the things they host is the mystery race, which is a speedrunning race where People sign up.

76
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:35,770
Scott: you can even do it yourself.

77
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,997
Scott: You don't have to like be as pro to join in.

78
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:51,240
Scott: you can try to win And they surprise everybody by sending them a game they've never played before and Everyone has to race it sight unseen just using your raw video game skills and see who finishes the fastest.

79
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:55,420
Scott: And I was watching one of these mystery fun races and I saw a game.

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,029
Scott: it was a game made it a game jam a nice cute little puzzle game called Baba is you?

81
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,920
Scott: and Then I went and I said, oh my god, I want to play this game.

82
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,280
Scott: So I got the game free game jam version, but it's a very short game.

83
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:09,279
Scott: Why you know was in this little speedrun race.

84
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,132
Scott: And then I said are they ever gonna turn this in like a big real game?

85
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:19,215
Scott: and I went and I saw some imitators people Stealing the idea for this game making ripoffs, but now for reals.

86
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:23,710
Scott: officially tomorrow Baba is you the not game jam.

87
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:30,276
Scott: real deal game is gonna come out on Steam I think and switch and I don't know what platforms but whatever it is.

88
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,240
Rym: I'm conflicted again.

89
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,973
Rym: I guess it's not online so I might as well just get it on the switch.

90
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,300
Scott: March 13th 2019 Which might be today for some people.

91
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,230
Scott: Get this game.

92
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:40,456
Scott: This game is amazing.

93
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,220
Scott: Here's how it works.

94
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:53,928
Scott: There's a grid and you walk around and push stuff like Lolo Watching it makes like the trailer tells you everything you need to know right and you at the start of the game You know, you are sheep.

95
00:05:53,968 --> 00:06:03,722
Scott: You are Baba and then as you push stuff around You are pushing objects and when you push them into configurations the rules of the world Change.

96
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:13,589
Scott: as you push you can always reset I think and it is best in most innovative puzzle game I've seen in many moons like this game.

97
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:14,291
Scott: get this game.

98
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:18,769
Rym: the concept of this game alone is Utterly fucking brilliant.

99
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,459
Scott: It is a work of genius.

100
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:27,126
Scott: possibly game of year 2019 like this is a Unmissable gaming experience.

101
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,594
Rym: This is this is on the level of when portal came out.

102
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,222
Rym: Everyone's like wait this puzzle FPS What's going on?

103
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:32,784
Rym: And then they played it.

104
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,413
Scott: They're like, oh, yeah, it's just a cute little 2d game.

105
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,942
Rym: Yep, and now it's legit It's out.

106
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,691
Rym: It's on Steam in some other news.

107
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:46,020
Rym: Uh, I Just kind of assumed this has already happened, but I guess it didn't because it's only now happening.

108
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:54,603
Rym: So in March of this year, so very soon, you know Nvidia has their driver updates like game ready drivers If you don't know.

109
00:06:54,623 --> 00:07:00,625
Scott: so when you install the Nvidia driver, right you can during installation It will prompt you.

110
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:02,699
Scott: yo, you want geforce experience.

111
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:07,840
Scott: Yes No now geforce experience does some stuff you might want and also does some stuff you might not.

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,388
Scott: Well, I do use geforce experience.

113
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,252
Scott: I did use it now.

114
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,036
Scott: I don't use it anymore.

115
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:19,820
Rym: So Because actually there's on my previous computer the shadow cast it does was way good performance compared to OBS back then.

116
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,097
Scott: Anyway, so the thing is the main feature of geforce experience that you do want.

117
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:25,418
Rym: Oh shit.

118
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,969
Scott: There's a driver Automatic notifications of new driver updates.

119
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,011
Rym: Are you gonna plug your Twitter?

120
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:32,134
Scott: Yeah, I am.

121
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:33,497
Scott: I made a Twitter bot.

122
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:38,617
Scott: It's called Driver Envy, I think twitter.com.

123
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,684
Scott: driver Underscore Envy.

124
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:43,075
Rym: I was good doesn't have enough Google juice.

125
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:44,300
Scott: No, no one knows about it.

126
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,409
Scott: That's what I think.

127
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,599
Scott: It's driver underscore Envy I believe.

128
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:55,307
Scott: Verify that anyway what it does my I mean little bot that basically checks the Nvidia website to see if new Drivers come out.

129
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,760
Scott: It only checks for the windows 64-bit driver.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,579
Scott: It doesn't check for any other OS is or versions or bits a 32-bit drivers or anything like that.

131
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:14,960
Scott: But anytime the driver gets updated it tweets and then you can click and manually get the driver and then install by hand And avoid the geforce experience and just have the Nvidia driver.

132
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:21,955
Scott: Just make sure when you're installing a driver don't click the geforce experience box Unless you know what it does and want it because it's not bad.

133
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:23,020
Scott: It's not great.

134
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,759
Rym: What's what's what's not great about it?

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,561
Scott: So that shadow play that you love so much Messed up my sim 5 for quite a while and I had to until I figured out that that was the thing that was messing It up.

136
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:36,880
Rym: Yeah, I do remember when that was a problem, but I reckon I found out that was a problem right away.

137
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,746
Scott: Anyway, that's just one example.

138
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:39,008
Scott: Yeah.

139
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:39,731
Rym: What is there?

140
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,960
Scott: another example clogs up my system tray with more shit.

141
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,336
Rym: It's not in my system train as I tell it to be.

142
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:44,779
Rym: yeah.

143
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,440
Scott: Anyway anyway follow my follow my bot on Twitter to find out about Nvidia driver updates and avoid the geforce experience.

144
00:08:52,641 --> 00:09:04,373
Rym: So the last version of driver 418 will be released in April of 2019 and 418 will be the last driver ever to support something.

145
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,640
Rym: You've probably never heard of called 3d vision, right?

146
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,793
Scott: So people might not remember because it was such a brief flash in the pan.

147
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,360
Scott: as I said it was at the time.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,080
Rym: I mean it was before 2016 and it's been a thousand years since 2016.

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,740
Scott: So before 4k TVs, but after 1080p TVs the TV and monitor manufacturers like shit.

150
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,451
Scott: We got to upgrade somehow to make people buy new TVs.

151
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,460
Scott: Everyone's got a 1080p TV and they're cheap.

152
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,447
Scott: We're not making any money.

153
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:33,900
Scott: Yeah, so they invented a 3d TV Which is basically just 120 Hertz TV that alternates between left and right eyeball.

154
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:38,640
Scott: They were kind of bad and really expensive and no one made any content for them.

155
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:52,199
Scott: yep, but if I were a nerd and you had an Nvidia graphics card and you could buy a 3d monitor and certain games would Basically play the game at 120 Hertz and make the game itself 3d.

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,335
Scott: So you can play an FPS and it would be 3d like when you go to the movies.

157
00:09:55,556 --> 00:10:05,009
Rym: It was a total gimmick Yeah But I think YouTube might have even supported it at one point like a bunch of more things supported it than you might realize There was a lens for the GF tube camera.

158
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,973
Scott: I bought that could take 3d photo.

159
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:09,528
Scott: Yeah Anyway, not videos.

160
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:11,938
Scott: But anyway, uh, and maybe could do video.

161
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,360
Scott: I don't remember.

162
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,920
Scott: Anyway, the point is it was a fad flash in the pan 3d in your home.

163
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:18,032
Scott: No one bought it.

164
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:18,780
Scott: It went away.

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:27,067
Scott: Well someone pointed out Driver still has a special module so that you can that it works so that those 3d games You can still play.

166
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,799
Rym: is it needs hardware acceleration for that?

167
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,580
Scott: I remember we would go to PAX and like Nvidia had a thing at the booth and there were glasses and a. you know There was the thing.

168
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:39,891
Scott: I think the main reason why this and then it was only at Pax's for like one or two years and then it was gone.

169
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,769
Rym: The main reason why this died is one No one bought 3d TVs.

170
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,200
Scott: No one was wearing these glasses.

171
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:51,189
Rym: But - if you're gonna wear glasses If you're gonna wear glasses to play a game might as well just do VR.

172
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:59,572
Rym: because well Pro sumer VR did not exist in a usable form when this was a thing But now 4k didn't either.

173
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:02,315
Rym: yeah pro sumer VR Exists and is fine.

174
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,370
Rym: Like if you're if you're willing to be a like one step past early adopter one step before expanded market VR user.

175
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:16,535
Rym: VR is way less of a pain in the ass than this ever was and is probably better than this For that kind of experience.

176
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,546
Rym: or if you want a really good TV, just buy a 4k TV.

177
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,476
Rym: Yeah, buy 4k.

178
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:24,539
Scott: so Nvidia.

179
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,890
Scott: obviously no one's using this shit except a few really dedicated crazy people.

180
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,086
Scott: So they're removing the feet.

181
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:31,630
Scott: I got hiccups.

182
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,229
Scott: They're moving the feature from their driver.

183
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,690
Scott: All right, Scott and the few people who care about this you probably get out.

184
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,665
Scott: They're probably this.

185
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:47,589
Scott: you know it's a very small number of people who are very loud because they bought a 3d monitor and they got a 3d game and they got these glasses and they actually use this.

186
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:53,910
Scott: And now there's gonna be so mad because they invested in something that is now worthless.

187
00:11:54,371 --> 00:12:00,310
Rym: I think there's a secondary class of people who bought very cheap 3d TVs after that whole thing failed.

188
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,790
Rym: Who are then using this for funsies?

189
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,589
Scott: I think that if you are one of the people who's mad about this what you should do?

190
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:08,497
Rym: Have a dedicated PC.

191
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,770
Scott: I just never update the driver that old Nvidia driver.

192
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,840
Scott: You got the software for that game that has 3d support.

193
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:15,844
Scott: You got a computer.

194
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:16,486
Scott: It works on.

195
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:17,569
Scott: don't update it.

196
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:20,530
Scott: No, you put it in a virtual machine or something like that.

197
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,330
Rym: And then you know, I mean you're good until like DOS box and everything like really worked.

198
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,890
Rym: There was a time when I still had this old PC that I just ran DOS on to play DOS games.

199
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,289
Rym: You know in it at RIT remember it sat under my desk.

200
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:37,912
Rym: Eventually, we we tried to install a counter-strike server on it, but wasn't powerful enough Hmm.

201
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,522
Rym: Anyway in some final news.

202
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,309
Rym: I got a little gigabyte update.

203
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,697
Rym: Okay, so war group.

204
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,984
Rym: we reviewed it on February 26th.

205
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:56,982
Rym: We had both played like Less than 10 missions in the game and like one Set of two versus matches when we did the review.

206
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,470
Rym: I have now played the entire game.

207
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,044
Rym: I've beaten everything except the entire puzzle mode and it's great.

208
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:04,530
Rym: The endgame is fine.

209
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,593
Scott: The I have not played any war groups since we did the show I have.

210
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,730
Rym: I have unlocked everything that I care to unlock.

211
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,806
Rym: I have not s ranked every map because s ranking some of the maps.

212
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:16,730
Rym: I see what to do.

213
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,465
Rym: It's not fun and I'm not willing to do it.

214
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:29,310
Rym: I said that a long time ago about the first GBA Advance Wars But I eventually in a fit of rage boredom went back and did it anyway.

215
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:36,170
Rym: So maybe I will do this to war groove, but I can say my full final thoughts were war groove Holy shit.

216
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,516
Rym: If you even had a passing interest in Advance Wars Just buy war groove and play it.

217
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:41,760
Rym: the endgame is great.

218
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,074
Scott: the last if you do a passing interest in Advance Wars and haven't played It play Advance Wars.

219
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:46,697
Rym: There's not that many.

220
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:47,722
Scott: you can just get advanced.

221
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:49,350
Rym: start with the GBA one.

222
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,361
Rym: Don't bother with the ones that weren't released in the US.

223
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:53,605
Rym: They're only worth it.

224
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:59,110
Rym: If you are full of rage Mmm, if you're desperate like that is that is going back.

225
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,174
Scott: I really want the real experience.

226
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:00,876
Scott: don't want to emulate.

227
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:01,599
Scott: go on eBay.

228
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:06,636
Scott: buy like a GBA a DS light or GBA SP.

229
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,047
Scott: buy the cartridges used you'll be all good.

230
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,819
Rym: Yep Emulating a GBA works fine.

231
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,590
Rym: Yep, emulating a DS works fine in this at this time.

232
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:18,249
Scott: And you don't get no touchscreen or that you can with a mouse.

233
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:28,635
Rym: So the thing is my previous computer could run Advance Wars days of ruin on the D on the thread the DS Emulator just fine.

234
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:33,009
Rym: if I disabled sound it could not also emulate the sound in real time.

235
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:35,901
Rym: It used a hundred percent of my CPU all the cars.

236
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:40,710
Rym: now my computer can handle that All right, but even then it actually uses a lot of resources.

237
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,254
Rym: See our work group final thoughts.

238
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:53,560
Rym: It is the best you're gonna get and I greatly look forward to Advance Wars 2. and also I Predicted who the square boss would be and I was fucking wrong.

239
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,250
Rym: Oh, the square boss was not who I expected.

240
00:14:56,572 --> 00:15:02,340
Rym: Okay, it had the twist I expected and then it had a twist I didn't expect and I was very pleased by that.

241
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,690
Scott: the same thing does seem good from what I played.

242
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:05,453
Rym: Yeah, it was.

243
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,617
Rym: it was good it.

244
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,029
Rym: the story it revealed was actually more interesting than I expected.

245
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,619
Scott: Compared to Advance Wars story it is.

246
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,145
Rym: it is a step up from an event.

247
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,893
Rym: It's a step up from the first Story.

248
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,423
Scott: visitors is characters, but in character does.

249
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:23,557
Scott: it doesn't really carry his character designs Yeah, but it doesn't have anything else.

250
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:28,210
Rym: the characters in Wargroove have more character than anything that ever happened in Advance Wars.

251
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:31,056
Rym: But there's still and the game's good.

252
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:32,360
Rym: It's great.

253
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:33,684
Rym: Just play it.

254
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,890
Rym: I've played it completely to fruition.

255
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:37,196
Scott: You get all s-rank.

256
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:47,937
Rym: No, that's the only thing that there's some maps I did not get an s-rank on and I looked at it and decided it is not worth human effort to get it because the Ranking is to you because you can't do.

257
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:48,759
Scott: I could.

258
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,923
Rym: I am I could.

259
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:50,926
Scott: here's the problem.

260
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,009
Scott: Yeah, I could do.

261
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,929
Rym: now Here's the problem compared to Advance Wars.

262
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,287
Rym: S-ranking certain missions is heavily RNG.

263
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:03,373
Rym: So it's a full web situation Advance Wars.

264
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:07,990
Rym: there is no full web situation to s-rank anything except maybe in the earliest Advance Wars.

265
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,237
Rym: But actually even then no APC trick you're good.

266
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:13,748
Rym: So you have the full web situation for s-ranking.

267
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:22,750
Rym: some of these Coupled with the fact that the algorithm to determine an s-rank is much more simplistic than the algorithm in later Advance Wars.

268
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:30,729
Rym: So it's not interesting to s-rank those maps because those maps are scripted story mode maps with just RNGs is coming out to ruin you.

269
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,526
Rym: If anyone wants to play this game online, I am 100% up for that.

270
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,869
Rym: You just have to consent to me streaming your pitiful defeat.

271
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,058
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

272
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,950
Rym: so I got something really dumb and simple.

273
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,341
Rym: I found this a long time ago and I laughed a lot that I forgot about it.

274
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,350
Rym: I found it again recently kind of randomly.

275
00:16:56,512 --> 00:17:10,368
Rym: it's just titled Simpsons blue Swede hooked on a feeling and If you watch it It is basically a mash-up of a scene from the Simpsons with the song Hooked on a feeling made famous by a number of movies.

276
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,777
Rym: It's pretty well known in pop culture.

277
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,965
Rym: as soon as you hear this song if you don't know what song I'm talking about you'll think oh that song.

278
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:25,950
Rym: and This is an interesting result of a previous meme that was not widely spread on the internet.

279
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,710
Rym: It lasted like two weeks where people were remixing this scene from the Simpsons a million different ways.

280
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:36,250
Rym: That entire meme came and went in the span of like two and a half weeks and this was its triumph.

281
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:38,930
Rym: This was what rose to the top in the very end.

282
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:42,809
Scott: So what do you got so long ago?

283
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,135
Scott: GeekNights.

284
00:17:44,336 --> 00:18:07,189
Scott: one of my things of the day was the Minnesota State High School Turned hockey tournament because they have a tradition at this hockey tournament of all the players good or bad for all the teams getting the most amazing hockey hair they can grow on their heads and then During player introductions skating up to the blue line showing off their hair to the camera that is right in their face.

285
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:16,969
Scott: And this because been a thing for quite a few years And you know back when I did it as a thing of the day, you know, it was those I think we're still living a beacon.

286
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:21,965
Scott: Yeah, I think so and this year the internet took notice of it more than it has in recent years.

287
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:31,366
Scott: So, you know but One thing interesting happened this year and that is on one of the particular teams.

288
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,235
Scott: I guess the yellow team High school.

289
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:43,488
Scott: that is The kid squiddy skated up to the blue line for his moment his time to shine And show off the hair that he worked so hard on.

290
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,863
Scott: Something funny happened and is a funny video that is thing of the day worthy.

291
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:57,728
Rym: It is definitely thing of the day worthy In the meta moment the GeekNights book club book, which we will be doing on Thursday in two days.

292
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:58,430
Scott: read the whole book.

293
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,278
Scott: Yeah, oh, he finally read it.

294
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:04,221
Scott: It's not a long book and the time it took you to read that I have almost finished.

295
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:10,783
Scott: I've read one and like a half Larger shattered earth books.

296
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:13,837
Rym: Ooh Yeah, you've hit some stuff.

297
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:17,370
Rym: You're getting closer to Evangelion and the shattered earth looks to me overseen.

298
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,827
Rym: Yeah, smoke twos gonna be over soon, right?

299
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,297
Rym: Yeah Oh, you're on three.

300
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:23,762
Scott: Yeah, I read one long ago.

301
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:25,248
Scott: Yeah, I already finished - okay.

302
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:25,569
Rym: Okay.

303
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:27,405
Scott: Okay That's what I'm saying is I'm you're reading away.

304
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:32,484
Scott: So Use my subway reading strategy has a suddenly in space.

305
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:46,949
Rym: Try gun moment happened yet I mean There is a moment many almost identical to that moment in try gun It's quite a few of them where it just cuts to a space station and some people have a conversation about a thing.

306
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:51,390
Rym: That's when it from that point on it just such moments.

307
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,073
Rym: Yeah There are several.

308
00:19:53,655 --> 00:20:00,494
Rym: one of my favorite moments is in that geode where everybody goes into that control room and is looking at stuff And that's way back already.

309
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:10,743
Rym: Yeah, that's one of my favorite moments though when they start to figure out the deal with that place And somebody touches something they shouldn't fucking touched Even I know reading the books like don't touch it.

310
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,176
Scott: It's gonna be a bad time Technology, let me mess with it.

311
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:17,823
Rym: Yep, except 2001 is face outie.

312
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:21,412
Rym: Odyssey is literally hey precursor technology Let me mess with this.

313
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:23,316
Scott: Well, it was put there to mess with you.

314
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:31,436
Rym: Yeah, you don't know that and The only thing I want to say before we get into the book club on Thursday is that 2001 having a matter that you don't know is so well designed.

315
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:48,394
Rym: having read this and Having seen the movie a long time ago The only thing the only new information I have is the like mind state like what a lot of people were Thinking in the world of a space Odyssey that was not directly conveyed in the movie.

316
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,320
Rym: Otherwise, it's pretty much the movie.

317
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:54,239
Rym: Talk about that in depth, but Thursday we will do that.

318
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,617
Rym: Otherwise, it's time to talk about Auto chess PAX East.

319
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:02,478
Rym: Oh, yeah We're gonna be at PAX East doing a panel the real harm of games.

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,391
Scott: I'm gonna start making that panel like right now.

321
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:09,928
Rym: You'd better this is all you Plus pen in the cuttlefish theater than Rym's panel.

322
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,235
Rym: Oh my panels really popular people like my panel.

323
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,746
Rym: Uh-huh We'll see how.

324
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:19,776
Rym: uh, I thought problem is all our panels lately have good titles That'll get a ton of people in the room regardless of the content.

325
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:20,219
Rym: Mm-hmm.

326
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,940
Rym: But yeah, this would be a good panel and I'll be a zenk icon.

327
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,480
Rym: I still haven't looked at what panels I'm doing.

328
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:26,437
Rym: I gotta go sort that out.

329
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:43,902
Rym: But I'm doing a bunch of panels and zenk icon not this weekend but next weekend and then the following weekend packs and then I think we got nothing until PAX West Which means we can start making videos again about things Mm-hmm.

330
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,590
Rym: All right Auto chess.

331
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,780
Rym: Auto chess came out of nowhere.

332
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,224
Scott: Well, so here's what happened.

333
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:54,480
Scott: right is hearthstone which has an expansion coming out soon and you know has sort of faded a bit.

334
00:21:55,082 --> 00:22:04,539
Scott: And there's a community of streamers that are like all nice people not bad streamers Like you usually see who played mostly played hearthstone, but if you some have veered off into other areas, right?

335
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,547
Scott: And that general streaming community.

336
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:11,338
Scott: quite a few of those players moved to Auto chess and I was at first.

337
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,586
Scott: I saw them streaming Dota 2 and I was like so sad.

338
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:18,363
Scott: I'm like, oh no, but then I clicked just to see and I was like What the hell is this.

339
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:24,660
Scott: and then I realized it's a free mod for Dota 2 and it's like and it's nothing like Dota 2.

340
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,306
Scott: And I learned how the concept of it.

341
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:30,480
Scott: and then I played it and then I kept playing it and then I made Rym play it.

342
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:40,558
Rym: yep, I'm gonna say like just like my highest level hottest take is that It is not that good nor is it actually that fun really.

343
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:53,235
Rym: but the concept of what it is is a Goddamn plus and even though the whole time I was the whole time I was playing it I had this like very ambivalent feeling.

344
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:57,436
Rym: not ambivalent in that I don't care and that I'm being pulled in equal opposite directions.

345
00:22:57,537 --> 00:23:01,460
Rym: on one hand I hate the UX and I see all these deep flaws in the game.

346
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,271
Scott: There's so many flaws because it is a Dota 2 mod.

347
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,399
Scott: They couldn't they didn't just make a brand new game.

348
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:17,800
Scott: Well, it also has deep flaws in the sense of not like knowledge requirements And all the requirement is really mostly in the UX because once you learn the UX all the knowledge is just there.

349
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:19,392
Scott: It's like just on it just there.

350
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:29,128
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time the concept is so good that it's like you're scratching an itch and Like you it doesn't stop itching.

351
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,400
Rym: I can feel like you're so close to scratching it.

352
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,520
Scott: So the UX right?

353
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:41,400
Scott: so imagine if you're playing Magic the Gathering right and someone threw a bunch of magic cards at you and The magic cards had no text and you're just like how the hell am I supposed to play?

354
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:41,822
Scott: I don't know.

355
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:43,640
Scott: if these cards do I have to learn them, right?

356
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,495
Scott: Yep But if you just you don't have to actually learn what the cards do the text is there.

357
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:55,663
Scott: you just have to learn that if You blink with your right eye twice and then with your left eye three times the text will appear and then it will be obvious What to do?

358
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:58,760
Rym: Yep, right and then you got to move a miniature around the table.

359
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,320
Rym: And if you put the miniature on top of a card, it'll automatically go somewhere else All right.

360
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:11,287
Scott: so here's what auto chess is right and it it's funny that the name so the name of the game is auto chess because You can see how they came out.

361
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,819
Scott: that name the way it works is a little a little.

362
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:29,589
Scott: It's a big Dota 2 map and it splits it up into eight boards and they look like little chess boards and you can only control what's happening on one of the boards, but you can see what's happening on all of the boards where your opponents are playing and You recruit with money Dota 2 heroes

363
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,552
Rym: called chess's

364
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,180
Scott: called chess's in this game, but they're all just Dota 2 heroes.

365
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:39,520
Scott: Yeah, and you put them into your chess field and you have 30 seconds to do this and then they automatically fight.

366
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,107
Scott: Sometimes they fight NPCs.

367
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:45,963
Scott: Sometimes they fight copies of opponents Armies of chess's.

368
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:50,076
Rym: right you have no control or interaction with this fighting at all.

369
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:50,838
Scott: It's automatic.

370
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:51,380
Scott: This is great.

371
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,688
Scott: It's like an RTS but everything is automatic.

372
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:54,832
Scott: I have no control over it.

373
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:56,940
Rym: There's no micro and it takes like 30 seconds.

374
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,483
Rym: It just happens.

375
00:24:57,503 --> 00:25:01,180
Scott: Yeah, they just fight and you want to win but maybe sometimes you also want to lose.

376
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,895
Rym: I wish I could skip the fighting entirely and just see the outcome instantly.

377
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:17,586
Scott: I also wish that but the the reason that they show you the fighting is is because it's Dota 2 and If you if you see what's happening the fighting you might be able to and you understand it You might be able to strategize.

378
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:23,107
Rym: Well, actually that's on your positioning because the game is It's got a lot of like.

379
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,440
Scott: you see that you're losing to the Kunka alt.

380
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,159
Scott: You might want to see that and then you spread your dudes out.

381
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,231
Rym: So it's interesting watching the fighting is boring to me.

382
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:31,994
Rym: Like I hate it.

383
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:38,100
Rym: I just have no interest in it at all Except you can sell your dudes during the fight and buy new dudes.

384
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:54,048
Rym: But the fighting does provide time to shop yep, but the fighting does provide a reasonably natural heuristic to figure out how pieces work and the Attributes that are not told to you by the game.

385
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,795
Rym: because the game assumes, you know how Dota works.

386
00:25:55,975 --> 00:26:02,359
Scott: Yep, so The way I see Dota auto chess is not as chess, but as poker.

387
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:09,134
Scott: Imagine you're playing poker But After you, you know what happens in draw poker right?

388
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:10,860
Scott: Not not other pokers draw poker.

389
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,006
Scott: Yeah, you draw a hand and then you discard and draw new cards in an attempt to improve that hand Right.

390
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:24,339
Scott: yet in draw poker They only let you draw like once and then it's over and then you throw out everything and you play again.

391
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:34,603
Scott: Imagine if you're playing draw poker But you keep drawing and discarding and drawing and discarding over and over to make up better and then a better hand You're making a better.

392
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:39,520
Scott: and this and not obviously the the ranks in poker would make no sense because everyone would.

393
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:51,924
Scott: Four people would reach royal flush Eventually, right, but that imagine is every time you get three aces You can turn them into one like super ace and then if you get three super aces, they become a mega Right.

394
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:54,111
Rym: So you got eight clubs out.

395
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:56,098
Rym: clubs make clubs more powerful.

396
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:08,140
Scott: Yep So it's like, you know There's a different way of ranking the hands based on The synergies like bunch of trolls bunch of elves bunch of Knights and this is a lot of synergies and they're moderately complex.

397
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:09,485
Scott: They're not that complex.

398
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,328
Scott: Well, they're.

399
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:11,714
Rym: they're simple on one level.

400
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,320
Rym: But on the other hand you got to keep them all in your head.

401
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:15,119
Scott: No, you don't because they're right on the screen.

402
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,531
Scott: They actually made it better recently.

403
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:18,498
Scott: I can show you.

404
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,115
Rym: Oh, yeah I saw that has little circles now that tell you how many synergies you've got for each thing.

405
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:25,560
Rym: if you hover over them It says what that synergy you click on a do it, dude.

406
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,828
Scott: It shows you all the things that that dude synergizes with and then you can go and hover over that and it tells you The full documentation as long as you got time.

407
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,674
Rym: He's only got 30 seconds to click on that shit.

408
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,380
Scott: It's really not hard anyway.

409
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:38,643
Scott: But yeah you.

410
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:42,900
Scott: and the thing is if you just play the game for like two days, you'll learn all the dudes.

411
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,267
Scott: Yeah, that many dudes that you can't learn them all.

412
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:51,087
Rym: basically the UX and like trying to play the game is just this Undocumented nightmare.

413
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,598
Scott: Yes, because it is a Dota 2 mod.

414
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,535
Rym: But even though Scott had figured it out and like played it and figured a bunch of stuff out.

415
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,487
Rym: I'm still awful I've made.

416
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:00,160
Rym: I tried to get the experience from scratch.

417
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:08,860
Rym: I joined a game knowing nothing other than what Scott had told me as a nightmare scenario and I was able to Fight because I couldn't figure out how to get my dude onto the board.

418
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,992
Rym: Yeah But then I figured it out and then I figured out every other thing.

419
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:17,285
Rym: like over the course of two or three plays Didn't figure everything out.

420
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:18,610
Rym: I figured everything out that mattered.

421
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,840
Rym: I started getting very close to winning very quickly.

422
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,105
Scott: Well winning isn't hard.

423
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:22,587
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,800
Scott: Well because the game is pretty rare, especially once you first start out you're getting paired.

425
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,004
Scott: There's a ranking system.

426
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:27,946
Rym: Oh my ranking.

427
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:35,047
Rym: I was paired almost entirely against people with like bishop and knight rank No pawns and no one ranked.

428
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,512
Scott: There's not a lot of people playing as pawns.

429
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:41,287
Rym: Yeah, it was me and like all bishops and knights It doesn't pair you against people but it will.

430
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:48,800
Scott: what will happen is like it doesn't match you up against people with similar rank But it adjusts your rank based on the rank of the people you played against.

431
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:51,219
Rym: Yeah But I play it against people who are all pretty good.

432
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,385
Scott: Come in like fourth.

433
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:57,900
Scott: if you have people under you are all like night and the people above you are all like Queen.

434
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,400
Scott: It's like you're gonna rank up probably if you're under night.

435
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,498
Rym: Yeah thing is even when it was all nights like I didn't come in last play the only game I came in last place.

436
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:06,546
Scott: game is Also, it's so RNG.

437
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:09,656
Scott: as long as you're playing competently, right?

438
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:10,478
Scott: You're going to.

439
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,589
Rym: on average You'll make it like 20 25 turn.

440
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,100
Scott: You'll only be down ranked if like you really just don't know what you're doing.

441
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:20,607
Scott: If you know what you're doing, you're going to rank up Over time.

442
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:22,597
Scott: in aggregate you're gonna make it was of RNG.

443
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,048
Rym: You're gonna make it 20 30 rounds in.

444
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,740
Scott: it was supposed to be an RNG game.

445
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,019
Scott: There was an AMA with the developers and a lot of people are like are you gonna fix item RNG?

446
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,686
Scott: They're like, it's an RNG game.

447
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:34,047
Scott: Yep.

448
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:34,630
Scott: They're like.

449
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,212
Scott: they are like.

450
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,100
Scott: this is a game of randomness on purpose.

451
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,440
Rym: There are already degenerate strategies.

452
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,895
Scott: They're already like definitely some dudes that are stronger than other dudes.

453
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:53,479
Scott: early mech goblin Sell them all get something later on that's stronger like yeah night or early early druid rush if you can get the later ones is pretty powerful.

454
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,721
Scott: Enchantress.

455
00:29:54,741 --> 00:30:01,420
Scott: you can upgrade druids with only two guys and three dudes and then that lets you you know upgrade them to max quickly.

456
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:05,000
Scott: But they're not the strongest units towards the end except for the lone druid who's pretty good.

457
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:07,659
Scott: Yep, the other ones are me unless you need the elves.

458
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:09,218
Scott: Anyway, yeah.

459
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:10,830
Scott: So that's how I think about.

460
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,219
Scott: I think about it as a game of poker.

461
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:21,060
Scott: You're leveling up your hand slowly over time and eventually, you know You get matched up against people and all these fights and then when you lose a fight you lose some HP.

462
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:25,683
Scott: And when you win a fight you gain some HP, but there's war you don't gain HP You just don't lose.

463
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:26,787
Rym: well, but there's more.

464
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,880
Scott: you can get completely eliminated and the last person standing is the winner.

465
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:32,399
Rym: It's not just like if it was just that whatever.

466
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:38,960
Rym: What makes this kind of like in extra interesting in magic is that the way you're making your poker hand of dudes?

467
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:42,825
Rym: is via a Communal pool draft.

468
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,210
Scott: Yeah, it's not quite.

469
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:45,816
Scott: it's not a draft like seven wonders.

470
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,000
Scott: you pass it around right?

471
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,410
Scott: The way it works is based on your current level.

472
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,680
Rym: is a communal draft from a shared pool, right?

473
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:52,445
Scott: You have.

474
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:54,720
Scott: you draw five dudes at a time, right?

475
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,523
Scott: You have a level.

476
00:30:56,844 --> 00:31:03,571
Scott: you get one XP every turn and the first few levels you just fly up Because it's like to get from level one to two is one XP.

477
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,479
Scott: to get the level two to three is one XP.

478
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,977
Scott: to get A little three to four is two XP.

479
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:11,013
Scott: But to get levels six seven eight nine is a lot more XP.

480
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:13,320
Scott: you have to spend five gold.

481
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,706
Scott: You can spend five gold anytime.

482
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:18,080
Scott: you want to get four XP and that's how you have to get the higher levels.

483
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,441
Scott: There's no.

484
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:22,277
Scott: if you you're not gonna play like 30 rounds the game will be over by then.

485
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:22,980
Scott: You won't get to level.

486
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,687
Scott: Yeah, so level 10 is max level.

487
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:29,878
Rym: most of the games I've played made it around 28 to 30 like every time.

488
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,615
Scott: like it always He's right, but to get I'm saying to get from level like eight to nine.

489
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:34,037
Scott: You need 30 XP.

490
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:36,820
Scott: You're not gonna get 30 more levels.

491
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,469
Scott: Oh, yeah gold you get.

492
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:43,680
Rym: don't use the gold to buy pieces But you can also spend gold to just buy more experience, right?

493
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,726
Scott: So you draw five dudes.

494
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:49,119
Scott: the five dudes you draw are based on your current level, right?

495
00:31:49,159 --> 00:32:00,700
Rym: So The link to read it From the dota from the autochess website is flagged by steam as being I think malformed the URL.

496
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:13,500
Scott: Anyway, so if you're level like five you have an X percent chance of drawing guys from this first pool an X percent chance of Drawing guys from the better pool an X percent chance of drawing guys from the even better pool of dudes.

497
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,710
Rym: Oh, there's a big bug that just got introduced like yesterday.

498
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:17,111
Rym: Great.

499
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:19,198
Rym: Yeah, fractional gold breaks everything.

500
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:19,780
Scott: Awesome.

501
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:22,492
Rym: So anyway, the game is buggy as shit.

502
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:23,920
Scott: It is super buggy as hell.

503
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,840
Rym: I joined one match and all the couriers were invisible and no one could start the game and then it told us all we lost.

504
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:38,260
Scott: Yep, it happens so you Draw some five dudes and it caused gold to put dudes in your hand.

505
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,389
Scott: Which are the pens?

506
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,540
Scott: you have a limited hand size?

507
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,343
Scott: It's always like what?

508
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:42,428
Scott: eight or nine something like that.

509
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,220
Rym: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight eight dudes.

510
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,140
Scott: Then you can put dudes in the field.

511
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,000
Scott: You can put as many in the field as you want But if you got more than your level they come back to the pens based on your level.

512
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:56,060
Scott: Your level is the number of dudes you can keep in the field once the battle starts.

513
00:32:56,562 --> 00:33:03,000
Scott: So you could buy like the whole shop if you got enough gold and put everyone in the field But then it'll put everyone back in your hand.

514
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:09,813
Scott: And if it's still like there's still too many dudes out in the field and your hand is full It just sells dudes that lose if that happens to you.

515
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:10,436
Rym: You're just out.

516
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:11,320
Rym: You've just you're done.

517
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,820
Rym: Well, it depends because I'd sell some garbage thing, but it might sell your one leveled up, dude, right?

518
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,890
Scott: So when you sell a dude though, you basically lose.

519
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,412
Scott: no gold.

520
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:21,344
Scott: you get the full Refund back.

521
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:24,299
Scott: you can actually make gold by combining druids and selling them.

522
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:30,360
Scott: Yeah, they sell for the cost of three, but you can upgrade for just two depending if you have enough druids anyway.

523
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,784
Scott: So yeah That's that's in.

524
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:44,135
Scott: basically you can spend I think two gold to draw a new hand and when you draw a new hand all the Dudes that were in the hand go back into the pool that everyone else is drawing from.

525
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:53,156
Scott: so if I buy all the mechs There's less mechs in the pool for everyone else to draw and if someone loses the game to get eliminated All their dudes go back in the pool.

526
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:59,740
Rym: Yep I was playing one game where I was actually I was actually doing a very heavy goblin mech strategy those working out pretty well.

527
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,120
Scott: It works early, but then they're not strong enough for the late game.

528
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Scott: So you got to switch to something else by selling them all and buying something different.

529
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,809
Rym: But a dude who had way more mechs than me died.

530
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,300
Rym: and then I got the mechs upgraded sold everything and then bought new stuff.

531
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:14,000
Scott: Yep, but yeah, that's how that's how that works.

532
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,755
Scott: So it's it's sort of like seven wonders and everyone has 30 seconds to Push cards around as fast as they can.

533
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:20,260
Scott: it only works.

534
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,699
Rym: It's a video game and you know push cards around by doing dota 2 crap in the game like with key bindings and everything.

535
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,370
Rym: Yeah, cuz you're still playing dota 2.

536
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,114
Scott: Yeah, it's.

537
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:29,958
Scott: it's a dota 2 mod.

538
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,641
Scott: It has to.

539
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:31,344
Scott: it does.

540
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:34,134
Scott: if you made this as a it's standalone game.

541
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,840
Scott: It would probably just be a card game.

542
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,199
Scott: It would be a great tabletop game.

543
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:41,591
Scott: I think you just need to figure out a way in Tabletop to evaluate the combat.

544
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,911
Scott: so sort of hand ranking system like poker Just reveal your dudes look at the other person's dudes and know immediately who won.

545
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:55,193
Rym: but a hand ranking system would mean that players could memorize Statistics and break the game with likely degenerate strategies very quickly.

546
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,100
Scott: Yeah, you'd have to make some other changes.

547
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,579
Scott: I don't think you're gonna have the infinite hand redrawing.

548
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,500
Rym: Yeah, this would be better as a phone app than a great phone at play solo, right?

549
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,913
Scott: Also, I think it would be great if the combat was more like Final Fantasy.

550
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:12,188
Scott: Yeah, then like dota Yeah, I just I.

551
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:20,660
Rym: part of the problem part of what I don't like about the game Is that the meta of it like you can figure out like the synergies the mechanics just by reading all this documentation.

552
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,917
Rym: But it really assumes that you play dota already and know all these characters.

553
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:25,740
Scott: I don't know the characters.

554
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,866
Scott: I learned them in like two days.

555
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:27,128
Scott: Yep.

556
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:30,306
Rym: I did mostly - hmm It's also items.

557
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,700
Scott: So the item RNG is just sort of like a sideshow.

558
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:44,280
Scott: so in the certain levels like the first few levels you fight NPCs and then Every fifth level, you know all the 10 15 20. you fight certain NPCs and it's always the same ones.

559
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,854
Scott: So, you know how to handle them, right?

560
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:46,519
Scott: You know, they're coming.

561
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,480
Rym: Yeah, like the wolves or whatever coming with that one round every time 15 is the wolf guys.

562
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,353
Rym: Anyway, they jump right to the back.

563
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:54,300
Rym: You gotta jump to the back.

564
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,500
Scott: So you got to rearrange your positioning after level 14 and then switch it back after level 15 anyway.

565
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,725
Scott: so When you fight the NPCs if you destroy any they randomly drop Presents.

566
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,080
Scott: you walk over with your guy to pick up the presents.

567
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,493
Scott: There could be either items in there and it's completely random.

568
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,978
Scott: some games you get like no items.

569
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,398
Scott: some games You get a bunch of items.

570
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:20,499
Scott: you can then give the items to your dudes to hold and it boosts them up basically.

571
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,831
Scott: and Then the only way to get those items back.

572
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,820
Scott: You can't reassign the items to a different, dude.

573
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,186
Rym: You have to sell the dude you gave the items to and then they fall onto the map and then you got to go get Him again, right?

574
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,800
Scott: But that's the only way to get the items back.

575
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,500
Scott: So you got a really carefully consider who you give the items to like early in the game.

576
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,152
Scott: I'll give the items to a guy.

577
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:49,839
Scott: that's good now But I know I'm gonna sell and then later in the game I can give the items to my strong late-game guy who's gonna carry who I know is gonna make good use of those items.

578
00:36:49,899 --> 00:37:03,280
Rym: Yep So all this combined makes this frantic real-time drafting Eight player game that is really fun except the UX is so bad.

579
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,928
Rym: It's very hard to learn to play it and very hard to continue to enjoy it.

580
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:11,582
Rym: Yeah, I think the like the people I played with like.

581
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:21,191
Scott: there's a lot of degenerate strategies the game super not really degenerate strategy so much as People know which combinations are stronger.

582
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:22,356
Scott: Everyone knows right?

583
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:23,480
Rym: Well cheating is rampant.

584
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,486
Scott: I didn't see any.

585
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:26,600
Scott: I haven't seen cheating, but I've seen a lot of talk of cheating.

586
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:29,034
Scott: I don't I don't disbelieve it obviously.

587
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:33,651
Scott: Yeah, right But it's you know, which guys are the strongest.

588
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,547
Scott: So sometimes it just comes down to Who drew the strong guys?

589
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:38,009
Scott: Yep.

590
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,760
Scott: Sometimes someone just start, you know, I've started three.

591
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,780
Rym: You might just have like three of the same guy just right there to buy.

592
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:47,960
Scott: I started I started games and it's just like oh you just gave me three.

593
00:37:48,181 --> 00:38:01,038
Scott: I literally I played one yesterday where I bought a dragon knight and then the next round the shop pops up and there's two dragon Knights and I'm like, well dragon knight, even though just got nerfed is the strongest dude, basically and I've got all the dragons.

594
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:01,460
Scott: Let's go.

595
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:05,472
Rym: The meta seems to change a lot based on patches.

596
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,400
Scott: when they rebound they patch the game a lot.

597
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,654
Scott: They're working hard on it trying to fix all the bugs and make it as good as they can.

598
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:13,660
Scott: It's frequently frequently updated.

599
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:19,766
Scott: so when they make a balance change that you know, it's like Stuff like mages were worthless.

600
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:20,689
Scott: now mages are hot.

601
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,217
Scott: No, right trolls used to be the bomb.

602
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,180
Scott: now trolls are I?

603
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,334
Scott: They're not the greatest they were before.

604
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,059
Scott: they were like a bomb.

605
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:31,525
Rym: I have some luck with early game like big synergy warrior combos But I had to get rid of them.

606
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,540
Scott: Warriors and mechs are way good late game.

607
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,780
Scott: You need a lot of warriors and you have to have the good warriors.

608
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:42,510
Scott: Oh mechs aren't so great late game But you can switch over to the the good mechs like the.

609
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:47,183
Scott: if you get the super late game ones the gyro and the the tinker Those are good tinker.

610
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,809
Rym: Yeah, I had a good timber.

611
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:58,185
Scott: your timber saw might be good super late game if it's level three But otherwise like, you know your clockwork and you're you're not not the Tinker techies.

612
00:38:58,346 --> 00:39:00,753
Scott: techies is the super late game one tinker clockwork.

613
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:01,395
Scott: You got to sell those.

614
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:05,031
Scott: They're not doing nothing in the late game even if they're level three.

615
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:11,496
Rym: so That this game is just unique in that no one's really made anything like this before.

616
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:12,900
Scott: No, it's like a brand new idea.

617
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:16,092
Scott: I've already seen one garbage clone on iOS.

618
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:17,116
Scott: that don't isn't worth.

619
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:23,820
Scott: it is obviously awful But I really want to turn this into a tabletop game or a streamlined video game.

620
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,700
Scott: Yeah, and it would be someone multiple companies.

621
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:38,986
Scott: This is going to be the next battle royale situation where everyone's gonna try to clone This core concept like PUBG made a thing and then fortnight came along and it's like aha Some auto chess is the PUBG.

622
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:43,379
Scott: someone else is gonna come along and make the fortnight to Dota chess is PUBG.

623
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,689
Scott: What's interesting though is that the bomb and I'm gonna play it.

624
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:52,797
Rym: some of the elements of this game are definitely like specific even though they serve these heuristic purposes that we talked about like they have this other.

625
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:55,827
Rym: like they're there for reasons or at least they serve a purpose.

626
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:13,091
Rym: a lot of the things in this game seem to have actually just been done because it apes the things that people who play MOBAs like like Rent like automatic play battling creeps like the fact that you have these Standard encounters and you literally sit there for 30 seconds just watching dudes kind of just swing.

627
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:21,560
Scott: That's You could shop during that time but also be that's the time I used to look at my opponents.

628
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,768
Scott: Yeah, cuz you've got the shared pool going on.

629
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,920
Scott: I want to know is like, alright, what are other people going for?

630
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:35,670
Scott: Oh, that guy's going mages that guy's going mages that guys I guess I'll go warriors players Because of the history and legacy and everything like.

631
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:42,815
Rym: it seems like one of the main things they like about MOBAs is just standing there last hitting and watching like creeps just die.

632
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:49,400
Rym: leveling up in a Progression like this game is all about leveling up in a progression, you know competitive idle game sort of right?

633
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:55,370
Scott: Yeah, that basically is no it's like competitive progress quest action Which is partly why I'm gonna.

634
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,514
Scott: I think is the board game.

635
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:02,259
Scott: part of it the the drafting Yeah And the strategizing of which guys to get which guys not to get which who to go for?

636
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:09,220
Scott: Right that competitive drafting aspect and you know different matchups against different opponents, right that sort of thing.

637
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,807
Scott: It's like, you know, you might think that's the strongest dude, but your opponent gets a disruptor right now You're not you got.

638
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,139
Scott: if you want you wish you had different dudes.

639
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:20,300
Rym: I will continue to play it partly because I want to make sure I fully understand.

640
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:23,155
Scott: I will show you things for like five minutes like I didn't know.

641
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:24,020
Rym: you combine items.

642
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:27,016
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna show you five minutes after the show and then I'll go home.

643
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,108
Rym: But I'm not going to continue to play this game.

644
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:34,240
Rym: I'm gonna play whatever better version of this game comes out.

645
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:34,683
Rym: I play.

646
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,877
Scott: I'm still playing auto chess, you know, but I don't play.

647
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:41,059
Scott: here's my man Probably one or two games a day and you know if I really got nothing else to do.

648
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,724
Scott: And then that's it.

649
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:45,575
Rym: a game of auto chess takes like 30 to 40 minutes.

650
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:48,225
Scott: well it is true It does take in that time.

651
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:51,618
Rym: I can play like 12 over Matt overwatch matches.

652
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,127
Scott: the game does Still way more fun.

653
00:41:54,449 --> 00:42:00,233
Scott: It's a it's the thing that is that even though it takes that long It's like a board game that forces everyone to take their turn.

654
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:00,976
Scott: real bad.

655
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:05,840
Scott: I'm invested So it's constantly engaging the whole time as long as you're still alive.

656
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:09,600
Rym: Like I increasingly want to play board games with chess timers.

657
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:15,780
Scott: It's like you have 30 seconds to get your shit in order and then it's like well fight time even settlers of Catan.

658
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,420
Rym: Imagine what settlers would be like if you had a chess timer and you had four minutes of total thinking time for the entire game.

659
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:25,613
Scott: It would be exciting though If the fight like you said was instant and it would be 30 seconds.

660
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:27,100
Scott: and then all right five seconds to think.

661
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:28,687
Scott: All right, 30 seconds.

662
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,153
Scott: Yeah, you know, that'd be great.

663
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:34,991
Rym: I also think like to your point Final Fantasy style combat final fantasy style combat.

664
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:36,716
Scott: Also, I think Pokemon would be great for this.

665
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:37,438
Scott: I got three pikachu's.

666
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:38,874
Scott: They become a Raichu.

667
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:42,060
Scott: I got three dratini.

668
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:47,081
Rym: My.

669
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:53,200
Rym: my sole goal in life right now would be to get the Pokemon license and have a studio make the auto chess for Pokemon.

670
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:54,889
Scott: Auto chess for Pokemon would be the greatest.

671
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,920
Scott: that is the perfect thing for this.

672
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,184
Rym: I would play the ever they have that they have.

673
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,427
Scott: they already have abilities.

674
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:01,288
Scott: Oh, it's like it's.

675
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,551
Scott: everything is already lined up.

676
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:10,536
Scott: Oh Pokemon would be the greatest guarantee if I wouldn't get sued.

677
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:16,400
Rym: Yep If I was in a position to get someone to make it, but that is so far beyond my abilities.

678
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,587
Scott: Nope I'm just gonna let someone else carry this one.

679
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:22,925
Rym: if anyone out there has the air the people who could make that happen I will invest in you.

680
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:27,882
Scott: and let's say I did talk to someone who's working on a thesis project based on overwatch and what they're Doing.

681
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:29,732
Scott: who is they're using?

682
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:37,060
Scott: this is genius, by the way They're making a tabletop digital hybrid and their idea was to use drop mix controllers.

683
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:45,060
Scott: You put your car your dudes onto your drop mix controller and they limited is just for but for technical reasons.

684
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:49,164
Scott: But you would put your dudes out on the for on your personal drop mix board.

685
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:56,400
Scott: get four of them together and then you look at the tablet and then you see the results of the fight Based on the dudes that you put and then you draft the card.

686
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,273
Rym: I feel like drop mix controllers are gonna be the Q cats of 2019.

687
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:08,920
Rym: Yes But I was that that'll both anger people who like drop mix and tell some people how old we are.

688
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:19,200
Scott: My idea is to just have this game where you use jackbox technology and you draft dudes on your little phone And then it's like times up and everyone looks at the TV to see what happens.

689
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,054
Rym: Yeah, and then you could like it could cut around with like pseudo commentary of like.

690
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,811
Rym: let's look at what's going on this match for 30 seconds.

691
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,986
Scott: Well, you could retheme it in such a way.

692
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:30,135
Scott: to where instead of having all these individual battles where

693
00:44:30,395 --> 00:44:31,519
Rym: you want big mega battle

694
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:47,200
Scott: royale Well, you're instead of drafting dudes for an army You're drafting like parts for a robot and then all the robots go in and in About like a royal rumble and with one man like one robot standing and you basically rank the robots each battle.

695
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:48,264
Rym: This raises a meta point.

696
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:51,920
Scott: think about everything we just said, but basically the core concept of auto chess is genius.

697
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:55,920
Scott: The history is incorporated into tabletop and other video games.

698
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:04,240
Rym: I feel like not everyone recognizes this especially people who are newer to gaming younger people Or older people who like didn't play all these games.

699
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:10,400
Rym: One of the truest and most important aspects of PC gaming is that every major?

700
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:23,040
Rym: Revolution in like new kinds of game design comes from someone just fucking making a mod Even if it's garbage just thrown it together and saying hey I made an FPS where if you get shot you just died.

701
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:29,140
Scott: It's because people who usually have the most creative game design ideas don't work in a giant studio.

702
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:32,780
Scott: They do not have the technological knowledge.

703
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,951
Scott: They're not a video game.

704
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:41,720
Scott: So the only ways that they can get those new interesting game ideas into the world is via tabletop Which is why you see lots of stuff happening in tabletop.

705
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:48,498
Scott: That's why the tabletop indie scene is so fire or by mods because mods require much less technical knowledge and skill.

706
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:53,989
Scott: someone would just game ideas and Willpower will power and dedication to make.

707
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:56,740
Scott: the mod can get that out there to see if it sticks.

708
00:45:57,122 --> 00:46:07,180
Rym: Like if I were working at a larger studio I would do almost anything to hire the team that made auto chess and give them the support Valve has a history of absorbing.

709
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:07,642
Scott: How.

710
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:09,348
Rym: what do you think happen to Counter-Strike?

711
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:13,580
Rym: Counter-Strike was just a fucking mod for Half-Life 1.

712
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,771
Scott: Valve hopefully will absorb auto chess and also people.

713
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:19,360
Scott: are you know bringing artifact into the into the equation?

714
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:24,640
Scott: There's only hundreds of people playing artifact still so it's like man.

715
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,180
Scott: It's like should valve just refund every all the artifact?

716
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:30,777
Scott: You know it cost them a lot of money to make that.

717
00:46:30,797 --> 00:46:38,540
Rym: meanwhile Auto chess is made of enough of a splash that it appears that streamer viewership of hearthstone is just collapsing.

718
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:40,459
Scott: It's not collapsing But it's down.

719
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,998
Rym: It's down and auto chess is up and the amount it's down seems to be nearly equal to the amount that auto chess is.

720
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,243
Scott: a lot Of the biggest are.

721
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:52,478
Scott: so streamers went to auto chess like I said, and that's how I discovered it from the industry information I know.

722
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:58,400
Rym: Generally any time someone says something like that the reality is no the streaming audience just grew.

723
00:46:59,262 --> 00:47:00,055
Rym: Everything is up.

724
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:04,552
Rym: But here it seems like this is one of the rare instances of game.

725
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:07,140
Rym: a just straight-up stole the viewership.

726
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:13,418
Scott: Auto chess appeals to someone who like it's an RNG game like hearthstone low investment RNG game.

727
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:13,940
Scott: It's similar.

728
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,606
Scott: It's basically a card game even though.

729
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:16,269
Scott: There's no cards.

730
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:19,260
Rym: Yep right a lot of emergent ridiculous behavior.

731
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,552
Scott: This is a meta right.

732
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:34,371
Rym: it patches frequently Which is really feels good if you're coming from hearthstone which patches rare But also creates a streaming feedback loop where a patch comes out and everyone rushes to watch the streams to see what holy hell breaks loose.

733
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:43,542
Scott: Auto chess is also a terrific game to stream because People can like in your chat can say like go that do this do that and during the fighting time you can talk to your Chat.

734
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:46,400
Scott: there's something for the chat to see because there's a big fight going on.

735
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,004
Rym: I'm waiting for.

736
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,460
Scott: twitch plays auto chess, but it's slow enough that they can give input.

737
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,086
Scott: It's not like a real-time game like overwatch.

738
00:47:51,106 --> 00:47:51,889
Rym: Twitch plays auto chess.

739
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,917
Scott: People can't really help you or talk to you about what's going on.

740
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,704
Scott: Auto chess salty bet Auto auto chess.

741
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:58,611

742
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,077

745
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:19,140
Scott: Well, I think it would be like it would be sort of like The board game downforce right where you own a car, but you also bet on the cars.

746
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:25,315
Scott: Then it shows you all the other auto chesses and you play auto chess and you're.

747
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:29,498
Scott: you want your guys to win but you also bet on who's going to win.

748
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:39,900
Scott: and unlike Unlike downforce which has one race and is kind of meh Imagine if downforce is like multiple races with multiple winners and multiple bets over time.

749
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:42,049
