8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,425
Rym: We didn't really answer it.

9
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:37,410
Scott: All right.

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,993

12
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:44,460
Rym: well I finally got around to watching some of the anime from this season and Cody.

13
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:46,003
Scott: It's not.

14
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:47,049
Scott: well, it's not Cody.

15
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,549
Scott: It's code E in code Code and then the letter E as in Cody.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,291
Scott: yes, no.

17
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:57,568
Scott: well you said it sort of like Cody like cod y Cody It's code.

18
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,238
Rym: I definitely emphasize the.

19
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,428
Scott: yes It's a good show.

20
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:03,958
Scott: he watched one episode, and I want to see more episodes.

21
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,110
Rym: so far It's my favorite show this season.

22
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:08,844
Rym: just because it's it Reminded me a lot.

23
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:14,219
Rym: just the character designs and the way they moved and moved their mouths and just a project echo like.

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,160
Scott: it's one of those cute funny Remind me a project a carrot.

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:18,721
Rym: Yeah They did.

26
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:21,975
Rym: Emily said the same thing too especially the one girl when her mouth like.

27
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:36,497
Rym: the way mouths open Widely is a lot like how mouths open widely in project a Cohen I guess The girl who likes show even if it's not like the girl who likes the boy Not the main character, but the other girl.

28
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,372
Scott: Yeah, okay, kinda.

29
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,360
Rym: Yeah pretty much exactly.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,395
Scott: Maybe we should look and see if there are any creators in common.

31
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:44,360
Rym: I haven't looked at anything yet.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,294
Rym: I'm just saying that it reminded me a lot of project echo, and it's just.

33
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,047
Rym: it's a really cute show And it's not creepy and moe.

34
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:55,800
Scott: no it's definitely surprising because you look at it And I mean there's like six or seven moe shows this season.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,428
Scott: It's like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck right.

36
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:07,017
Scott: and like some of the ones that aren't moe I checked him out like I checked out I think rental magica Which had a pretty good premise of you know renting magicians to help you out when you had problems.

37
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:07,860
Scott: that sucked.

38
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,844
Scott: That was a crap show.

39
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:09,205
Rym: well.

40
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:16,788
Scott: I expected as much yeah, but now the Cody is good This ghost hound is that what it's called.

41
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:24,960
Scott: I think that's a massive moon a shiro slash project studio I G or production IG whatever you want to call them show, but I haven't watched that yet.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,843
Scott: So we get to see on that.

43
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:27,589
Scott: there's doubt it could be bad.

44
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,540
Rym: There's the yuri kind of sci-fi and space show.

45
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:32,285
Scott: I forget what that's called.

46
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,991
Rym: drop blue drop blue drop.

47
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:34,312
Scott: you're right.

48
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:41,020
Rym: that show gives me all the vibes That moonlight mile gave me before I actually saw moonlight man.

49
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,638
Scott: We haven't seen this so we'll watch blue drop And then we'll tell you how it is.

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,809
Rym: But I got to say just from skimming through and looking at like the opening bit It feels like how I felt about moonlight mile.

51
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,280
Rym: like this is gonna be some hardcore serious sci-fi.

52
00:02:55,261 --> 00:03:00,040
Rym: But I in what I saw and what we watch so far not one Sherpa had sex.

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,357
Rym: So I got some high hopes could be somewhere between moonlight mile and to Tara if that's where it is.

54
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,389
Rym: That's pretty much Uncharted awesome waters right.

55
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:09,815
Scott: it's not a bad place to be for sure.

56
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,000
Rym: that's a really good place to be.

57
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,440
Scott: we haven't watched that one though, and there's only two other shows to mention and that is the Gundam show which is okay?

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,679
Scott: Yeah, I watched two episodes and the first episode was mostly shooting and the second episode was better.

59
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:25,776
Rym: The premise is good like I could see where it's going.

60
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:26,420
Rym: I kind of like that.

61
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,728
Rym: It's different from other Gundams.

62
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:32,212
Rym: I could dig it, but at the same time I I don't really like the character designs.

63
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:41,433
Scott: the character design is pretty crummy But Gerald from animal order said that some like Bisha Shown in like boys love character designer designed all the characters.

64
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:42,677
Rym: I mean the women's breasts.

65
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:43,680
Rym: Just don't look right.

66
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,005
Rym: They're way too big, and they're just Bloons full of helium.

67
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:47,647
Scott: is what they are.

68
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,032
Rym: that and I'll be honest the show is a little Heavy-handed, it's kind of like it's set in our world.

69
00:03:55,092 --> 00:04:01,274
Scott: I know it's it's tough because on the one hand right It's sort of this heavy-handed, but they didn't do anything interesting with the heavy-handed.

70
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:02,760
Rym: It's like right look at the United States.

71
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:12,820
Scott: But this on the other hand right they've got it's sort of like the heavy-handed is gets the obvious shit out of the way Right away like in the second episode.

72
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:16,106
Scott: They're like yeah the obvious Contradiction to fighting war with war.

73
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:22,731
Scott: and it's like Gundam shows used to be at the end like you know the whole time at the End they'd be like yeah fighting war with war doesn't work.

74
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:26,246
Scott: and like the 26th episode of the 50th episode now They're getting that out of the way.

75
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:31,360
Scott: and the second episode which gives me a tiny Hope that the rest of it will be something new and interesting.

76
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:34,325
Scott: I guess that's sort of a I don't know I Expectation.

77
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:38,745
Rym: I have really dubious Dubious, but it's possible.

78
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:42,579
Rym: the characters as they've been introduced feel really shallow.

79
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,260
Rym: now They could make him with more depth.

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,725
Rym: I mean there could be a lot more things.

81
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:56,632
Scott: because whereas in other Gundams right they sort of introduce some of the characters and they Sort of expand to give you the bigger picture over time You know they start with like just some kids and then they expand out.

82
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:59,480
Scott: this one is like starts showing you everything.

83
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,360
Scott: So the first episode is like you to see each character for like five seconds.

84
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:07,460
Rym: But even like when you see him just like they all react like half the people are like mysterious.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,020
Rym: Oh, it's begun say something cryptic and look off to the camera.

86
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:15,873
Scott: We're gonna yeah, let's not do a whole episode on it, but yeah it.

87
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,240
Scott: if you like Gundams you like it.

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,425
Rym: I guess we'll see.

89
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,020
Rym: I'm really I hate to say a little pessimistic about this.

90
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:31,099
Scott: It's on an episode by episode basis sort of like when some You're one of your athletes is on the the day-to-day injury list which means you know their day-to-day.

91
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,950
Scott: They might be playing today not playing all the shows.

92
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,275
Rym: I'm given a chance this season.

93
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,540
Rym: It's my least liked one.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,976
Scott: Yeah, the one the one there was oh the under arrest.

95
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:40,740
Scott: you're under arrest.

96
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,283
Scott: There's a new.

97
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:43,272
Scott: you're under arrest, and if you don't know about.

98
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:43,855
Scott: you're under arrest.

99
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,750
Scott: It's very old I guess not very old, but it's.

100
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,660
Scott: it's sort of a somewhat classic.

101
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,348
Rym: It's one of those old awesome show.

102
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,760
Scott: it's sort of like for the 80s 90s ish kind of thing.

103
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,607
Scott: It's a funny show.

104
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,050
Scott: all I knew.

105
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,527
Scott: I never actually saw it even though I knew about it and knew it was good.

106
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,760
Rym: It's one of those slice-of-life camaraderie shows.

107
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,900
Scott: Yes, it's a it's a buddy show about like two women on the police force.

108
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,627
Rym: You know about them.

109
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:05,390
Rym: You know what it's about.

110
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,278
Rym: It's about all the awesome side character.

111
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:10,214
Scott: pretty much Yeah, but they are you know they're actually interesting.

112
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,868
Scott: the main characters though They're not you know it's not like one of those shows.

113
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,215
Scott: the side characters are awesome.

114
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,401
Scott: in the main character suck It's.

115
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:18,479
Scott: the main characters are good and the side characters are more good.

116
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:22,827
Scott: But yeah, there's a new season of it I guess and you know not.

117
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:28,707
Scott: no not ever having watched it before, but only knowing the you know the most Publicly known details about it.

118
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,955
Scott: I you know had a little bit of.

119
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,219
Scott: there were some spots where it's like.

120
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:38,940
Scott: yeah I don't get this because I don't know these characters like I'm supposed to but it's definitely an anime made now.

121
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,247
Scott: But in the say they haven't changed the style.

122
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:42,090
Scott: it feels like.

123
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:54,194
Scott: you know you gave some people from like 1995 2007 animation technology And they just made a show the way they knew how to make one and if you like You know that kind of anime if you like you're under arrest already.

124
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,239
Scott: You should probably watch this.

125
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,770
Scott: It was funny, and I'd never seen you're under arrest before.

126
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,819
Rym: so right so in the news.

127
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,079
Rym: I don't have a lot to say about this, but people are talking about it.

128
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:08,680
Rym: The Japanese government has formally requested slash demanded that the u.s.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,407
Rym: Government do something about all this anime piracy going on in America And they.

130
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:31,899
Rym: one of the reasons they cited for this request was that it's very difficult to Actually go after or prosecute anyone over international boundaries for copyright, especially When the things they're going after are you know peer-to-peer kind of things to begin with where it's hard to even say who did it?

131
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:41,512
Rym: Basically they admitted that they can't get the fan subbers And they're hoping that the US government might have a little bit more truck Fun.

132
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,380
Rym: I Don't think this is relevant at all.

133
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,019
Rym: I think the real fear they have is not that there's anime piracy going on the US.

134
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:58,742
Rym: I think the fear is that more and more Japanese people sick of Insane DVD prices and sick of having to watch on TV with commercials or something are just downloading American fan Subs.

135
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,529
Scott: I say go them.

136
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,260
Scott: if you are Japanese in Japan download our fan subs.

137
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,344
Scott: They are gift to you.

138
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,131
Rym: How don't you just buy our DVDs?

139
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,215
Rym: You'll still save a lot of money.

140
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:08,540
Scott: Yeah, buy our DVDs.

141
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,529
Scott: What do you know?

142
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,760
Scott: you don't need to see them right away?

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,225
Scott: I mean you could see stuff on TV.

144
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,554
Scott: you understand Japanese if you're living in Japan right?

145
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,487
Scott: so you know watch it on TV And then you watch it again.

146
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,198
Scott: Just wait for our DVDs to come out.

147
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:19,500
Scott: who cares?

148
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:20,807
Scott: It's a long time.

149
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:21,792
Scott: you're not in any kind of rush.

150
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,160
Scott: You got more new anime on TV.

151
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:29,500
Rym: I just really like how this is basically like oh, we're gonna We want to go after those people, but you really should stop price gouge.

152
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,140
Rym: No, but if you read between the lines it really says we're powerless to go after these people.

153
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,760

209
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:05,679

Rym: well I guess.

211
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:16,868
Rym: worst-case scenario while we're there There's an assassination attempt that goes bad And we're both killed and then the gig night's hosting goes down And then the large hadron Collider actually kills everyone.

212
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:22,964
Scott: I guess that is but I'm talking about the worst case within this context Not the worst case.

213
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,515
Scott: you want to talk about the worst case in a complete universe context.

214
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:29,389
Rym: everything blinks out of existence But then we wouldn't know.

215
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,880
Rym: I think the worst case would be everything.

216
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,627
Scott: I'm just horrible pain forever.

217
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:46,436

218
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:51,329
Rym: men off playing baseball I love playing softball don't like watching baseball.

219
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:54,618

220
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,408

Rym: My thing of the day and I think no more needs be said.

224
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:18,295
Scott: I think your thing of the day does not talent the awesomeness of Japanese baseball, but instead further Cements the awesomeness of Japanese television.

225
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:35,090
Rym: I might have to agree You know if I were if I go to for not having a thing today on Wednesday I could get Translated like maybe an hour time shifted while some sweatshop translates it into English with subtitles Japanese TV and a TiVo.

226
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:36,135
Scott: I'd quit my job.

227
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:36,938
Rym: I'd pay for that.

228
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:44,619
Rym: I'd buy one of those fancy glasses never HUD of Japanese TV as long as my TV just for that.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,916
Rym: And they're like you start with a global statement and then you coalesce your first paragraph to a thesis exactly.

234
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,300

Scott: But yeah, they were.

271
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:53,600
Scott: they were talking about this on a forum somewhere.

272
00:16:53,701 --> 00:17:05,579
Scott: I posted a link to the penny arcade of you know, right in the mean bean machine I think that's in my top 10 of penny arcade Definitely in my top five of penny art because one it's hilarious You my bean bag.

273
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:10,012
Scott: I like tribes too, and I mean I routinely make poor decisions.

274
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,223
Rym: now to write in the mean aside She's being funny.

275
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,608
Rym: It was true.

276
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:20,675
Rym: Every update for tribes was being kicked in the nuts Metaphorically and almost physically.

277
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:27,380
Scott: Yep If my computer had a leg with a shoe on it, that's what it would have been man, right?

278
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,859
Rym: But without further ado because I want to get right into this.

279
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:40,080
Rym: we've been talking about doing a You know final thoughts episode for a while because the first time we did this was for big Oh big Oh, too And it was an incredibly popular episode.

280
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:49,425
Rym: And if you've seen big Oh and big Oh - all the way through I highly recommend you go back and listen to our spoiler spoiler spoiler Show about big Oh -.

281
00:17:49,786 --> 00:18:06,440
Scott: yeah, and I think you know from listening to a lot to other podcasts like, you know You should see in such where they review like an entire movie and talk about the whole thing even It's like, you know You review an anime or something or a comic and you're basically you're trying to introduce someone to what it's about.

282
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:23,120
Scott: So sort of you know, you get a feeling when you read something and you want to you know If someone will know if they want to read it or watch it or you know or not If you can communicate the feeling you had to them Then they will know if that is a feeling they want and they'll know if it's something they want to want to buy.

283
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,006
Scott: So that's that's the purpose of a review.

284
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:34,649
Scott: but sometimes, you know, you watch something and watching it again Doesn't exactly give you the same feeling as watching it the first time cuz you know you've seen it before You know, it's a little.

285
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,325
Scott: sometimes it's still good but it's not exactly the same.

286
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:46,576
Scott: and by these final thoughts episode the sort of the goal is by Discussing in full something, you know in a total spoiler manner.

287
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:51,212
Scott: We just talk about everything You know and the target audience is people who have already seen it

288
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,720
Rym: or people who don't give a shit about the show or people

289
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,652
Scott: Don't give a shit and they just want they you know They'll listen to all about it because they know they're never gonna watch.

290
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:03,759
Scott: it is to sort of Let them or help them to relive the feelings they had when they watched it the first time.

291
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,788
Scott: So that is what we were going to try to do.

292
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:18,057
Rym: and also it's luckily the show we're talking about is one that we didn't need to rewatch because it's a show that affected us kind of profoundly and We actually remember enough about it even despite having only seen it once.

293
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:21,126
Rym: I seen it twice I think I've seen it one and a half times.

294
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,590

00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:25,587
Scott: Yeah.

297
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:30,985
Rym: Yeah, but yeah tonight we're going to do a final thoughts episode on Trigon.

298
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,199
Scott: sorry to all you people who voted for something else.

299
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:37,059
Rym: Well, the reason we're doing try gun also is that don't have to rewatch it.

300
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Rym: Well all I want to do one on Ava and I want to do one on eska flown.

301
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,003
Rym: Gotta rewatch.

302
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:43,510
Rym: Scott's got to rewatch both of those.

303
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:44,895
Scott: Maybe I'll start then.

304
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,000
Rym: Uh, did we do?

305
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,607
Rym: No, we didn't do one on utenna yet either.

306
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,411
Rym: We didn't do anything.

307
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,220
Rym: God utenna will need like his big.

308
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,568
Rym: Oh, well need like final thoughts.

309
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,560
Scott: a week is the second one in two years.

310
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,682
Rym: Awesome.

311
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,347
Rym: Yeah, that's our trend.

312
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:56,789
Scott: Yes.

313
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:58,434
Rym: I think by next year.

314
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,899
Rym: We'll have watched Ava again.

315
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:01,540
Scott: I think so, too, right.

316
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:10,550
Rym: But if you haven't seen try gun yet first I want to tell you you should go back and listen to our review of try gun because I Am of the I don't know.

317
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,455
Scott: Is that a good show?

318
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:12,059
Scott: It's so old.

319
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:18,700
Rym: I have the feeling that try gun is one of the best like top 10 top 20 anime ever made.

320
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:22,077
Rym: Yeah, probably in fact, it might be one of the best television shows ever made.

321
00:20:22,158 --> 00:20:26,039
Scott: It's just Everyone should watch it.

322
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,860
Scott: I would know there would not be a human being on this earth where I would say no you probably shouldn't watch try gun.

323
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:36,139
Scott: Everyone should watch it and I think everyone no matter who you are You can get some sort of enjoyment out of it.

324
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,052
Rym: But regardless listen to our review.

325
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:39,078
Rym: if you've never seen try gun.

326
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:47,856
Rym: and Also, if you've never seen try gun if you have any inkling that you want to see it I would really recommend that you do not listen to the rest.

327
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,450
Scott: Oh, yeah If you do you should only watch.

328
00:20:50,591 --> 00:21:05,423
Scott: listen to this episode of GeekNights If you have already seen all of try gun all of it Or if you definitely definitely plan to never ever watch it now if you do not fall into one of those two categories Turn your iPod off Now.

329
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:07,776
Rym: well, you're obviously still listening.

330
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,832
Rym: now We'll stop at one point further on.

331
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:16,256
Rym: cuz you're a lot of you're probably thinking I don't really care to give you a second chance because there's a point at which we're gonna go.

332
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,109
Rym: super spoiler Here's your second chance.

333
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:23,246
Rym: No, no, I mean like later on But let's get into it.

334
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,492
Rym: we don't need to talk about try gun.

335
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:24,612
Rym: is?

336
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:25,376
Rym: you've already seen it?

337
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,060
Scott: you've already seen it So we're not gonna synopsize the plot.

338
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:34,268
Rym: I think the biggest thing about try gun was that it was one of those shows that Kind of reels you in with one concept.

339
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,599
Rym: cuz Ava did the exact same thing like try gun is a show.

340
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,110
Rym: Yeah, like you're not even sure.

341
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,300
Rym: like is that fascist and feed?

342
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:40,922
Rym: I don't know.

343
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,611
Scott: and that was definitely good stuff.

344
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:44,340
Scott: cuz I mean I didn't you know the manga.

345
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,490
Scott: As long as say about the manga the manga is bad.

346
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,634
Scott: Don't ask me why I'm buying it.

347
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:49,537
Rym: Yeah, just forget it.

348
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:50,540
Scott: forget the manga.

349
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:55,898
Rym: It is incomprehensible if you think wait a minute, but if I read the manga I can get more insight into.

350
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:56,460
Rym: no you can't.

351
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,453
Scott: No, it's like when I was watching the anime I felt like I'm missing something and the manga has probably got it.

352
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,120
Scott: No the manga doesn't have shit.

353
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,609
Rym: Those things are best left unthought about.

354
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:06,572
Scott: yes, just ignore.

355
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:08,740
Scott: pretend the manga doesn't exist in the show is all you've got.

356
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:13,180
Scott: Okay, so you got this show and I was the first time I was watching it.

357
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,343
Scott: You know they sorta.

358
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:18,976
Scott: it's sort of like so obvious that he's washed the stampede, but they don't.

359
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:26,180
Scott: they don't actually Confirm it a hundred percent until like what episode five four takes a while.

360
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,720
Scott: I think it's episode five where he fights the really big guy.

361
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,640
Rym: It's not even that they don't even let you Figure out like you you're not even sure if he's competent whoever this guy is and they keep hinting and hinting.

362
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,508
Rym: It's like was that an accident.

363
00:22:39,849 --> 00:23:01,051
Rym: I don't know what it may be Kinda, and then there's a few scenes like I remember when he's down in the water episode where the guy stole all the water Yeah, and the guy pulls out the gun and he's about to shoot him and he dodges the bullet Yeah, and then they kind of like write that off, but at that point it's like huh Maybe the show's not about what I thought it was

364
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,675
Scott: one of those things.

365
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:11,180
Scott: It's so obvious You know you're so sure But they do such a good job of instilling doubt in you that you can't just go with it a hundred percent.

366
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,657
Scott: It's like they're feeding you this doubt and you want to hold on to that doubt.

367
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:15,059
Scott: so you do.

368
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:22,810
Rym: But I think the first inkling I got that the show was really really not what I expected it to be was the other shows Going along and it's you're not sure.

369
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,900
Rym: and then they get on that I'm gonna say the train, but it's like a boat that goes over the desert.

370
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,812
Scott: It's like a desert steam train.

371
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,060
Rym: boat thing doesn't matter.

372
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,333
Rym: I'm gonna call it a train cuz it's it in the style of like an old Western movie.

373
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,798
Rym: It's effectively a train.

374
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:43,656
Rym: Yep, and That episode like that set of two episodes where he fights dynamites, whatever neon die.

375
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:44,880
Scott: Yeah, I think that's his name Dynamo.

376
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,584
Rym: I actually forget, but it doesn't matter.

377
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,347
Rym: the episode is going on.

378
00:23:48,387 --> 00:24:04,113
Rym: and so yeah, it's like a normal episode, but there's that Pipes those canisters out into the area where the guards are and he flips out behind and he's trying to shoot him and He shoots one of the guys and wounds him pretty badly and he's

379
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,600
Scott: all trying to bandage him up and stuff.

380
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,423
Rym: Yeah, the kids like come on.

381
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:06,824
Rym: Let's go.

382
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:14,940
Rym: and he starts freaking out like no, I can't let this man die and That really came almost out of nowhere.

383
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,460
Rym: Like you kind of got the impression that he was a nice guy or maybe a pacifist or something.

384
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:30,390
Rym: but the tone of the show changed pretty much at that point because that whole episode from that point on is just him Getting hurt and getting screwed and just it's not going well.

385
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:36,848
Rym: and suddenly he's not as badass as he was and it's because and you Realize he won't hurt these people.

386
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:40,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean for this you don't realize he's a hundred percent.

387
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,159
Scott: You don't erase all doubt of him being washed the St.

388
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,930
Scott: Pete until episode 5 because for the first four episodes.

389
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,994
Scott: he doesn't fire the gun.

390
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,520
Scott: the show's called try gun.

391
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,147
Scott: They get these guns in the opener.

392
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:53,460
Scott: He's carrying around this tremendous gun his guns everywhere.

393
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,800
Scott: This dude doesn't fire his gun until episode 5 and when he does he fires a bunch of bullets into this gigantic flying fist.

394
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,826
Scott: You know, he's not hurting anyone with him.

395
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:03,267
Scott: Really.

396
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,591
Scott: He's not killing anyone.

397
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:05,233
Scott: That's for sure.

398
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,480
Scott: And that's the moment where they go.

399
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,177
Scott: Oh my god, he's washed the stampede and she makes that big funny face and she's like, oh it's like home alone.

400
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:20,980
Rym: Yeah But I think like that episode just and then it leads up to the fight where Bosch couldn't win the fight.

401
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,045
Rym: There's no way he could have won.

402
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:24,818
Rym: It was obvious that like he would have died right then and there.

403
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:31,938
Rym: and The guy is just so impressed by I guess his testicular fortitude that he basically concedes defeat and leaves.

404
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,575
Rym: Yep, and It seemed like the show is really silly like the way things are set up.

405
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,984
Rym: and look at that guy Look at that character design.

406
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:40,767
Rym: That's silly.

407
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:41,871
Rym: That's crazy.

408
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:44,480
Scott: That's crazy because that's the style that was in the manga.

409
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,552
Scott: That's even crazier in the manga the cat.

410
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:46,994
Scott: That's one thing.

411
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,322
Scott: the character designs I mean.

412
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,580
Scott: usually they change a lot from manga to anime, you know.

413
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,847
Scott: but they change so much.

414
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:56,498
Scott: like the character designs are completely different and it's so different.

415
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,740
Scott: but Some of that craziness carries over and you can see it all over the place.

416
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:09,569
Rym: But I just it was interesting how that scene that set of scenes was so ludicrous in terms of what that bad guy was and what those people were doing.

417
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,000
Rym: and Yet what's going on on a deeper level?

418
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,176
Rym: You know what people are fighting for and what people are saying was I don't know very poignant.

419
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:31,500
Rym: and you almost start to Suspend disbelief and forget that it's this crazy guy with a neon gun and you start to just Only see the drama like you put on blinders and you just see the drama of these characters these personalities.

420
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:33,186
Rym: There aren't many shows.

421
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,071
Rym: they can pull that off.

422
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,700
Rym: Fist of the North Star, not so much.

423
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:45,204
Scott: I think part of the reason the show succeeds with that so well is that unlike a lot of other shows There is sort of a character development But it's sort of twofold right.

424
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:52,900
Scott: on the one hand you have these characters who already developed a lot before the first episode you Chronologically speaking, right?

425
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,766
Scott: but they keep a lot of those developments hidden from you and they reveal them with flashbacks or Characters to keeping secrets from other characters.

426
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:05,680
Rym: Yeah, I remember wasn't it episode 13 where we actually thought we put the wrong DVD in?

427
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:09,899
Rym: Okay, because remember it it starts out as a different show.

428
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:12,568
Scott: That's episode like 17 is it?

429
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:13,611
Rym: yeah, I remember some point.

430
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,340
Rym: it was like right after in the big plot development in the mail.

431
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,564
Scott: It's a spoiler episode here.

432
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:22,160
Scott: It's episode 17 where they go back and it's you know, Vashj and knobs and they were kids and in space.

433
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,326
Scott: Yeah, that's episode 17.

434
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:24,587
Rym: Okay.

435
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:31,934
Scott: 13 is the one where Vashj goes Diablo where the guy Oh, yeah, he freaking shoots his mask off and stuff.

436
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:32,255
Scott: The guy.

437
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,320
Rym: that was an episode.

438
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,554
Rym: I think we even talked about that in the review where just Up until that point the show is kind of a mystery.

439
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:43,774
Rym: like you've got this character Vashj you don't know what's going on and he has visions and he says things to himself.

440
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:50,900
Rym: and there's all these little scenes where You get glimpses of the depth of this character and you get glimpses of the sadness that he bears.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,889
Rym: But you don't really you're not sure what the deal is.

442
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,337
Rym: and then that episode when you still

443
00:27:56,377 --> 00:28:00,380
Scott: don't know what the deal is in That episode but he goes crazy with the crazy power you

444
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:11,516
Rym: know what the deal of the show is because in that episode there's that murderer and he's just killing people in this city left and right and He doesn't care and he just kills these people without even thinking about it.

445
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,900
Rym: and Then Vashj just loses it and he's standing over him and he shot off his mask and he's got the gun to his forehead.

446
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,992
Rym: And he just keeps saying you killed those people.

447
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:21,815
Rym: They're dead.

448
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,160
Rym: They're gone forever.

449
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:24,768
Rym: They can't come back.

450
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:26,154
Rym: you did this to them.

451
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,440
Rym: There was cocks the gun.

452
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,000
Rym: There was no reason why I shouldn't just kill you and the guys just crying and I was moved by that scene not to tears.

453
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,435
Rym: But just you can feel the fear of that person.

454
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:43,194
Rym: and on one hand I feel like how horrible would it be to kill that person?

455
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:43,937
Rym: He's crying.

456
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:49,038
Rym: Look how absolutely suddenly afraid he's feeling the most fear that you can possibly feel.

457
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:54,535
Rym: and Yet he deserves to die and he's killed hundreds of people.

458
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:58,799
Rym: if you've killed hundreds of people Then you really shouldn't be crying when someone's trying to kill you.

459
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:07,979
Rym: but yet Vashj is there and can kill him and he says he should kill him and I don't want him to kill him but yet I do and then he doesn't kill it.

460
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,660
Scott: That's also important because that's like the moment where Vashj reveals that he's got like this, you know hidden gun like in his arm.

461
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:27,380
Scott: It's like you just learned, you know more hidden secrets of previous character development that like, you know He's got he's like a mechanical arm or the gun inside of it, you know, and it's like wow He's he's a lot more fucked up than we thought.

462
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:38,780
Rym: And then you remember there's all those little things like little bits of technology and things that Vashj has that are really Anachronistic like they don't fit into the world in the setting and that starts to come together a bit more.

463
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,386
Rym: And then you realize that it's actually a sci-fi Straight up.

464
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:44,349
Scott: It's nothing like that.

465
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:49,527
Rym: I remember at that point when he revealed the second gun that machine gun I was thinking like right away.

466
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:50,410
Rym: Wait a minute.

467
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,136
Rym: The show is called Trigun.

468
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:53,440
Rym: Where's the third gun?

469
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:00,892
Rym: Yeah, and when you find out what the third gun is like, oh, man Yeah, but I guess people you know, the third gun is you've seen it.

470
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:07,815
Scott: Yeah, but I Okay, but anyway the other part of the character development right is that you know a lot of shows.

471
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:13,257
Scott: you start off with these sort Of cliche characters and then they do what you expect and they don't really change.

472
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,149
Scott: here You've got characters who developed in the past.

473
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,820
Scott: chronologically they reveal those developments.

474
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:24,617
Scott: You know as if they are secrets that they're revealed and then they continue to develop as the show goes on.

475
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,060
Scott: more new things You know like they change for episode to episode.

476
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,606
Scott: I mean, you know, they start out silly and then there's less silliness guys, you know start out bad And then they change a little bit.

477
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:44,320
Scott: and you know, like even like Brad he's in there for like what two episodes I'm like, I gotta talk about Brad that that the guys in there for like two episodes, right?

478
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:53,380
Scott: But in that in those two episodes He does more character changes and development than most characters in like a whole 50 episode anime that this this is a big spoiler thing.

479
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:05,376
Rym: But I really got to get into this cuz Brad reminded me of all the and when it first appears You don't like well know the thing that Trigun does so well throughout is that you know in a lot of shows people die and there's impact.

480
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:12,760
Rym: but Trigon is one of those shows where the death of any character whether it's a good guy a bad guy doesn't matter.

481
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:22,547
Rym: Death is actually kind of rare and it doesn't happen for a long time in the show and when people actually start dying The show makes you feel it.

482
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:27,600
Rym: It really makes you feel it no matter who the character was no matter what horrible things they've done.

483
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,680
Scott: Well, it's because you know, they pay The.

484
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:35,540
Scott: it's not like you're watching like a Gundam show where it's like, okay who's gonna die, you know, someone's gonna die.

485
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:40,940
Scott: Right, but it's like they focus so much on death because it's the whole point of the show.

486
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,257
Scott: They keep focusing on it focusing on it, but deaths of people, you know, don't actually happen.

487
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:53,040
Scott: all too often I could be focusing on it and you're focusing and there's nothing there and you're focusing and there's nothing there.

488
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,520
Scott: It's like you're honing in this microscope on nothing and then a bacteria comes into focus like oh shit.

489
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:03,233
Rym: Well, plus the show just they set it up whenever they're going to kill a character.

490
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,460
Rym: They make sure that you're gonna cry.

491
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,820
Rym: It's like they do everything right to make you feel it when that character goes.

492
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:10,783
Scott: They make sure.

493
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,433
Rym: you know, I cried like four or five times during Trigon.

494
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,820
Rym: I cried almost every time a character died.

495
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,066
Rym: That's how powerfully this show hits you.

496
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,731
Rym: I mean Brad is a good example.

497
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,157
Rym: Right Brad is introduced and you hate him.

498
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:25,163
Rym: He's an asshole He's an idiot.

499
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:26,327
Rym: He's ruining everything.

500
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:27,791
Rym: He's a bad person.

501
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:32,324
Scott: He's like, he's you know, he's on the good guys side Barely, but you know he is.

502
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:33,248
Scott: but he's sort of like.

503
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:36,820
Scott: he's not trusting Avash and he's like you gotta do my way.

504
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:44,000
Scott: you guys are all stupid and They like Starscream, you know, he's a Decepticon, but he doesn't like the way the Decepticons are going about things.

505
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:56,628
Rym: So he's all pissy, but then at the end of that little story arc when they're in the base He they just kill him out of nowhere That death comes out of the blue and he just dies and there's no fanfare.

506
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,489
Rym: just he's dead.

507
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,748
Rym: and That I just I lost it right.

508
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:08,280
Rym: then I just started crying and I thought wow I hated that character until just now and I think that was the purpose.

509
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:13,127
Rym: I think they really wanted you to hate that character Right until he died.

510
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,960
Rym: because then it's almost like that regrets like he was a good guy.

511
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:23,280
Rym: Well, it's kind of like, you know If you part with someone on bad terms and then they die and you never got to say you were sorry.

512
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,280
Scott: Well, I can imagine if like that just used to Starscream example, right?

513
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,100
Scott: Imagine if on the Autobots there was an Autobot who would just like he was good.

514
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,420
Scott: He was on the Autobot side hated Decepticons, but he was always fighting with Optimus Prime like oh, you're kind of stupid.

515
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,000
Scott: He's always sort of like the annoying guy who was you know saying that the way they were doing things is wrong.

516
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:45,080
Scott: He was belligerent, but he was on the good guys side and then he just suddenly died unexpectedly.

517
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,920
Scott: You'd be like, oh he was always belligerent, but it's not just guy that is on our side.

518
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:50,624
Rym: It's not just that.

519
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:51,349
Rym: he was a good guy.

520
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,134
Rym: He was on our side.

521
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,000
Rym: It's not that simplistic.

522
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:10,840
Rym: it's more that the way the scenes were set up in the character progression and the scenes were Brad had screen time and talked and the way they it's like the show tricks you into not liking this character and Then sets it up to where the only point at which you will start to like the character is the moment they die.

523
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:18,492
Rym: and now it's too late to take back your previous feelings and All you get is the reaction shot of all the people who knew him.

524
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:31,196
Scott: and now he's dead and was sort of crazy is like The way he dies like that crazy puppet master guys coming in and it's sort of ridiculous this yeah This puppet master guy, and it's it's totally crazy, but it works.

525
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:31,898
Scott: You're not going.

526
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,100
Scott: wow That was some fucked up shit with his puppet master stuff.

527
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,842
Scott: No, it's like oh my god He died.

528
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:45,719
Scott: and you totally believe all the crazy bad shit that's going on which is very hard for a show to do to have Ridiculous imagery and ridiculous stuff going on.

529
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,387
Scott: But you totally accept it a hundred percent with.

530
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,212
Scott: no you know you totally accept.

531
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:57,700
Scott: in episode 5 the guy who's 50 feet tall And has like a little his dad is like sitting in his pocket and his dad is a revolver for a bite.

532
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:02,839
Rym: And it doesn't matter the fact that the drama of this show comes out through.

533
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,974
Rym: that Stylized crazy, but you know Brad's death was one thing.

534
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:10,410
Rym: then there's wolf would That scene.

535
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:21,900
Rym: I to this day I have never seen the death of any character With the possible exception of one scene in cowboy bebop, and I'm not gonna say which sings is not the one you think.

536
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:33,540
Rym: I think that was the most just painful to watch Difficult to deal with death scenes and also one of the most beautifully done death scenes in all of anime.

537
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:36,408
Scott: They laid it on so thick.

538
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:46,400
Scott: I mean it wasn't like Ava where just everyone's head explodes right and it wasn't like some other Shows where it's like you know someone's in like the climax and then they say a dramatic thing and then an explosion.

539
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:50,924
Rym: It made death so real and so visceral and yet It was.

540
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:56,187
Rym: I mean look he's been shot wolf would was shot And he was seriously injured.

541
00:35:56,629 --> 00:36:18,048
Rym: and he talks to vaj and he just he goes into the church and the imagery You know he kneels down, and he's not a religious man, and he's not a. he thinks of himself as almost an evil man But he was trying to do good and all the conflict of his character comes out all at once and he's just alone in this church with that cross over his shoulder holding himself up and That music starts playing and I'll admit.

542
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:19,212
Rym: I choke up a little bit.

543
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,879
Rym: Just hear you know that Rocco and song just

544
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:39,540
Scott: Because the way they do it is a lot less like other anime do it and a lot more like someone Would die and like you know a very melodramatic play like Drawn out and you know they get like the light coming in

545
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:41,364
Rym: Watching it.

546
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:46,002
Rym: it doesn't feel melodramatic because it's so personal It's just.

547
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:52,586
Rym: it's very much like the thoughts that would go through someone's head when they're dying and he's sitting and he's thinking what you would Think.

548
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:53,624
Rym: well no I mean look he's.

549
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:59,939
Rym: he's thinking about everything that he's done And he feels bad because he shot that kid and he thought that it was the right thing to do.

550
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:07,269
Rym: but yet he doubts it and he's kind of his life is flashing before his eyes and he's starting to resign himself to death.

551
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:12,146
Rym: and then he remembers Millie and That they had a moment just before.

552
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:19,440
Rym: cuz remember in like the previous episode or maybe the same app It was right before then where he had killed that kid.

553
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,988
Rym: and he's really brought what broken up about it.

554
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:27,127
Rym: and Millie comes into the room and he's on the verge of tears and She just hugs him.

555
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:30,944
Rym: and then he says something like you're a good healer And it just leaves it at that.

556
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:32,328
Rym: like those characters have this moment.

557
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:34,516
Rym: Yeah again the show sets you up.

558
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:35,780
Rym: They're like all right.

559
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:40,434
Rym: This character has found love and this character has found solace the moment.

560
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:41,116
Rym: They're happy.

561
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,600
Rym: We're going to kill one.

562
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,488
Scott: Yeah, it's like they couldn't even like.

563
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:48,044
Scott: you know they keep it so subtle - they're like They're like is it?

564
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:54,220
Scott: it's not like they just come out with it and say here's how it is It's just they're so subtle with it like huh is a little bit of something.

565
00:37:54,461 --> 00:38:00,977
Rym: it's like this character just like suddenly a character shows an emotion and then the flashbacks to the few moments that they had together.

566
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:09,003
Rym: and and When he pictures her face the final moment before he actually dies and he suddenly says no like no I want to live.

567
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:16,430
Rym: and he starts to stand up like he's gonna pull himself up and walk out of the church and You think and they pulls you on this rollercoaster.

568
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,775
Rym: You're like he's gonna live.

569
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,860
Scott: he's gonna live.

570
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:19,998
Scott: I never thought he was gonna live.

571
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,180
Rym: well He does and he's looking and he's trying and he's like he has the will to live.

572
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:28,478
Rym: he has more will to live than he has ever had in his life.

573
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:33,318
Rym: and then the cigarette just falls out of his mouth and his hand falls over.

574
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:38,251
Rym: and I remember we were all because we all watch this like in Scott's room

575
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:45,772
Scott: like sitting in a cramped dorm room like in a low-resolution real media file on my 17 inch CRT and we're

576
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:52,753
Rym: all like standing around and There's just silence and we're just watching and nothing happens and it fades away

577
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:52,833
Scott: and

578
00:38:53,495 --> 00:39:01,500
Rym: it just cuts to the outside of the place where everyone's sleeping and Then you just hear Millie shriek and start crying and that is.

579
00:39:02,182 --> 00:39:08,940
Rym: There aren't many times in anime where a voice actor crying sounds realistic and sounds visceral and sounds real.

580
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:19,540
Rym: It always sounds kind of weird or hackneyed or forced or but that That shriek was painful to listen to and I I just started outright crying.

581
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,323
Scott: Yeah, it's just painful.

582
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,690
Scott: even think about it right now.

583
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,031
Scott: You shouldn't.

584
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:23,940
Scott: but yeah, I don't think about that.

585
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:31,531
Rym: I mean think about that this it sets you up to where the character dies and you Almost it's so powerful that you can't react to it.

586
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,840
Rym: and then they don't just let it in there.

587
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:43,639
Rym: They force you to deal with the reaction shot with the other characters especially that one character reacting to it and that's always been a thing for me.

588
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,816
Scott: where I don't react not but it's like but they give you so little to actually grab on to.

589
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:50,297
Rym: I mean like.

590
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:53,145
Scott: they don't like to give You enough to like.

591
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:56,014
Scott: poke you but they don't give you anywhere to like.

592
00:39:56,054 --> 00:39:56,335
Scott: put it.

593
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,000
Scott: It's like it's like oh, it's coming out.

594
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,624
Scott: Where do I put it?

595
00:39:58,664 --> 00:39:59,328
Scott: There's no buckets.

596
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,395
Scott: the show the episodes over.

597
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,743
Rym: Oh god They don't eat.

598
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,595
Rym: they just like show him sitting there and then the next scene.

599
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:14,189
Rym: they don't even show you Millie The boss is just standing outside the door and he doesn't know what to do and she's just shrieking Inconsolably and you don't even see her.

600
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:18,069
Rym: Yep, and then the episode just ends No music.

601
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:18,513
Rym: No nothing.

602
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,099
Rym: It just ends.

603
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,974
Scott: It's like you got this water balloon and they fill it with water and they pop it.

604
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:30,935
Rym: There's no bucket and you're like, ah Okay, and just that is one of the most powerful moments in media I've ever seen.

605
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:31,917
Scott: it's pretty good.

606
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:32,840
Scott: It's up there.

607
00:40:32,900 --> 00:41:08,399
Rym: I can't say it's the most powerful thing I've ever seen but but then again I've always and it's I don't know if this is a more universal thing but a lot of times in a show like this or in any show cuz Fullmetal Alchemist had a similar thing where a character dies and I don't feel it like I don't feel it viscerally but I feel it, you know on that like the character died and I feel bad and it's kind of like with bated breath and It's not until the other characters react or like in Fullmetal Alchemist case I didn't cry or feel sad Until the funeral scene and I had to deal with seeing all the other characters react to this.

608
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:12,260
Scott: Yeah, but at the same time, you know, it's I guess that's what it sort of is.

609
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,320
Scott: It's like, you know a funeral in real life allows you to like come to terms with it, right?

610
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:28,894
Scott: But if you don't get a funeral in the anime, you know, if you just get like a second, you know If they don't give you enough time to to deal with it It's like you can't deal with it because now you're full of it and there's nowhere to go.

611
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:41,884
Rym: But of course Because of that scene and that scene's power in episode 23 and I have watched that scene 10 or 15 times over the course of the years just because I It's perfect.

612
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:44,653
Rym: I don't think it could have been done better in the context of that show.

613
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:48,480
Rym: Maybe not but I Forgot where I was going for it.

614
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:59,099
Rym: But okay at the end at the end the fight with knives and you know the very end of the show When you hear wolf woods voice out of nowhere that that was like.

615
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:08,880
Rym: It's almost like that scene where he pulls up the cross gun and you hear wolf woods voice for just that second saying basically You idiot blah.

616
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:10,342
Rym: It's.

617
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:22,084
Rym: it's almost like that scene and that little clip of him saying that Was able to draw on all the emotion that was pent up from when wolf would died, you know three episodes prior I mean, it's like.

618
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:27,574
Scott: it's like a lot of anime at the end, you know Have a scene where it's like, you know, there's a huge battle scene at the end.

619
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,160
Scott: fighting fighting fighting fighting fighting.

620
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,639
Scott: Everyone's you know on their last breath They're they're all tired out from this incredible battle.

621
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,619
Scott: And then at the last second the good guy pulls out something amazing Holy shit.

622
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,320
Rym: Anyway, here's like the voice of like use the force Luke or like the dead mother's final words or something.

623
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,054
Scott: Yeah but this show does both of them at the same time.

624
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:47,456
Scott: you get the.

625
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:53,640
Scott: it's like Imagine if it was like use the force Luke and then he pulled out like some secret weapon that he didn't know he had.

626
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,500
Scott: So you get both and that's pretty strong stuff, right?

627
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,460
Rym: But it just it draws on all like the emotion from wolf woods death.

628
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,738
Rym: You were given no release and Millie crying and shrieking and then just the characters dealing.

629
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:18,051
Rym: after that You just you hold you carry that inside you Until that moment at the end where you hear his voice and it's almost like everything was vindicated and at that moment All the grief comes out.

630
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:24,680
Rym: Mm-hmm But and it's like you don't get released till then but I think we have to like four episodes of trouble right there.

631
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:38,140
Rym: Yeah, and of course in that time we have probably the most important scene in the entire show when legato Legato because that one last warning we're gonna spoil the fucking end of the show at this point.

632
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:46,112
Rym: Yeah, so if you say if you if you thought I don't care about Trigun and you've gotten this far seriously stop now Right.

633
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:53,060
Scott: Yeah So legato is this guy and it's sort of rough because like you're kind of sure that knives is the big top bad guy.

634
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,760
Scott: Right, but you see this legato guy throughout the show, you know in a few episodes doing this Evie's an evil guy.

635
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,208
Rym: Legato is scary.

636
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:01,094
Scott: He looks evil.

637
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:02,100
Scott: He's scary.

638
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:03,707
Scott: He's not as it's.

639
00:44:03,787 --> 00:44:06,680
Scott: his character design is not as freaky as all the other villains.

640
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:15,973
Rym: I think he is the most frightening and disturbing thing in all of Trigon probably just because he's so Understated and he's just there but all the scenes were.

641
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:22,658
Scott: he's sort of like, you know in the Simpsons He's that guy in the white suit who stands there doing nothing, but you know, he's gonna do something.

642
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,348
Rym: Awesome That's not the analogy.

643
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:24,792
Rym: I would have you.

644
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:25,800
Scott: that's what I was thinking.

645
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:30,417
Scott: But like remember that's why you think he's the most dangerous and the most evil and the most scary.

646
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:31,200
Rym: most dangerous.

647
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:33,989
Scott: Yeah, MD exactly is the MD cuz?

648
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:35,052
Scott: he's always there.

649
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:43,577
Scott: He's not always there, but he's there often Haunting and threatening and being kind of evil, but he doesn't actually use his evil.

650
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,820
Scott: I feel like the last minute.

651
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,858
Rym: I think what makes him frightening is much deeper than that that that character is a person.

652
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,360
Rym: He's basically a thrall of knives.

653
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,460
Rym: I mean all the gung-ho guns for various reasons have fallen under the spell of knives.

654
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,743
Rym: And that's another thing.

655
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:01,330
Rym: how every gung-ho gun is a horrible person.

656
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,920
Rym: and yet you feel terrible as each one of them dies.

657
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:12,518
Rym: you absolute like you hate them and then you just feel nothing but pity and remorse when they die and you wish they wouldn't die.

658
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:18,749
Scott: and I did the show sort of hints that there was more to them that you just didn't see, you know It's like from what you see of them.

659
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:19,654
Scott: when you do see them.

660
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:20,720
Scott: It's like other horrible.

661
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:22,493
Scott: But then there's like something about them.

662
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:30,410
Scott: That's not so horrible That's sort of like not just brought out like look they were not horrible, but it's like maybe they weren't hard You know, it's like the saxophone guy.

663
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:37,320
Rym: It's good saxophone Like even the sniper when he suddenly just kills himself out of the blue.

664
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,340
Scott: I remember when yes, like he didn't have to kill himself.

665
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,961
Rym: But I love that scene was done so well because like Vash catches him and Voss is just like I'm not gonna hurt you Let's.

666
00:45:45,483 --> 00:45:49,476
Rym: and then he just pulls out a gun and before Vash can even reach over.

667
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,997
Rym: He just kills himself just right in front of him.

668
00:45:52,078 --> 00:45:57,420
Rym: and The way Vash reacts was that I almost cried there just because of the way Vash handled that.

669
00:45:58,182 --> 00:46:04,520
Rym: And then that scene when Vash and Wolfwood are talking after that because that's right when Wolfwood is shot to death.

670
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:19,080
Rym: But anyway, yep, but with Legato, I mean remember the scene where Legato just sits on the opposite park bench yeah, and And he messes with the kid and like Vash just suddenly has that vision of him killing that kid.

671
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:23,791
Rym: Yep, and then oh it didn't happen and He Legato was scary.

672
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:25,198
Scott: That's like one of the best scenes in the whole show.

673
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:28,760
Scott: over there We're like the basketball's bouncing around that and he's got like the doughnut.

674
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,733
Scott: I held my breath for that whole scene because it's the thing with that scene is that they get you in You know because there's parts of the show early on.

675
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:36,920
Scott: there's a lot more parts of the show.

676
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,063
Scott: We're sort of happy and silly.

677
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:44,140
Scott: this jokes and you know people drinking and eating doughnuts and having fun, right and towards.

678
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,084
Scott: You know as the show goes on that's less and less and less and this is sort of like, you know For a second.

679
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:51,397
Scott: They're like, we're gonna return to the happy doughnut part for a second.

680
00:46:51,418 --> 00:46:53,891
Scott: You're like, yeah I like that part, you know, we haven't had that in a while.

681
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:59,973
Scott: and then like just kidding But he's sitting there holding the doughnut still and there's like this kid.

682
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:02,000
Scott: It's like Legato's there.

683
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,050
Rym: It's like oh man and well the show it just.

684
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:10,753
Rym: the show says so much at that point It almost says that you can't live the happy life.

685
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,020
Rym: You cannot get past what's going on.

686
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:16,749
Rym: There is no way to return to things that were before.

687
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,860
Rym: until all of this is resolved one way or the other.

688
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:21,784
Scott: It's at that moment.

689
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:25,839
Scott: You're like, okay, I guess we're not gonna have a lot more doughnut eating the rest of this show.

690
00:47:26,181 --> 00:47:27,907
Rym: It's well, that wasn't how I looked at it.

691
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:31,459
Rym: But yeah, but that just the scene after that work.

692
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:36,599
Rym: basically, this sets up the first of the two primary moral dilemmas in the show.

693
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:51,010
Rym: and the legato scene and then the knives fight at the end are Basically everything that Trigun has to say condensed into two moral dilemmas where there is no answer Yeah And I like how they.

694
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:59,599
Rym: they let Vashj decide Both ways and show the consequences of both and it's a very morally ambiguous show.

695
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:13,652
Rym: at that point I mean look and this is where because when I first saw Trigun to the end I thought and Scott agreed and we all thought wow that show was pretty much a Treatise on pacifism and saying that killing is never justified ever.

696
00:48:14,193 --> 00:48:15,036
Scott: Yeah, I mean they're like.

697
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:16,159
Scott: you can always you know.

698
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:20,120
Scott: But stop stuff, you know, you can resolve any situation without killing someone.

699
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,780
Scott: You can just beat them up or subdue them or something.

700
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,365
Scott: But it's like wait a minute.

701
00:48:24,686 --> 00:48:29,824
Scott: you can only do that because the guys are freaking super powered crazy go nuts Not even human thing.

702
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:32,955
Rym: Well, it's not even that like I think that that whole part of any couldn't do.

703
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:34,520
Rym: it is doesn't even matter.

704
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:55,076
Rym: It's just that the show on its surface looks like it's a treatise against the idea of killing because the show constantly is just showing you that no matter what no matter how strongly you feel killing another sentient being will Always be abhorrent and that there is no justification.

705
00:48:55,678 --> 00:49:00,520
Rym: and yet Finally Vashj is put into a perfect moral dilemma.

706
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,944
Rym: Legato has controlled the entire city.

707
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:08,314
Rym: They are going to murder Millie and What's her name?

708
00:49:08,454 --> 00:49:10,100
Rym: Meryl Meryl straight up.

709
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,183
Rym: there is no way out.

710
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:13,329
Rym: they are going to murder them.

711
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:24,369
Rym: Vashj's options are to kill all of those people to kill Legato or to let Millie and Meryl die and there is no possible way out.

712
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:29,383
Rym: He has to decide in a purely moral standpoint what he is going to do.

713
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,850
Rym: and that scene is just so well done.

714
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,332
Rym: And it just.

715
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:35,966
Rym: it waits and it waits and it doesn't even show it to you.

716
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,878
Rym: Just hear the gunshot And Legato falls over.

717
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:41,449
Rym: Yeah, and then Vashj just loses it.

718
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:44,979
Rym: He does indeed lose it and think about that.

719
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:46,843
Rym: I mean you think oh the show says pacifism.

720
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:47,224
Rym: Yay.

721
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:48,367
Rym: Think about that.

722
00:49:48,387 --> 00:50:05,106
Rym: A lot of people then said because there's another way to look at this that then at the end of the show when he doesn't kill Knives and he takes the other road out and people a lot of people I think incorrectly say that the moral of the show is It doesn't matter what you've done in the past as long as you realize it was wrong.

723
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:07,775
Rym: It wouldn't do it again But go back.

724
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,582
Rym: All right, Vashj realized that killing was wrong.

725
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:11,685
Rym: He did it once.

726
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:12,387
Rym: he regrets it.

727
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:13,290
Rym: He's atoned for it.

728
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:14,908
Rym: Would he do it again?

729
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,285
Rym: If go back to that situation if he didn't kill Legato then other innocent people would have died.

730
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:21,450
Rym: There was still no way out.

731
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:27,450
Scott: Yeah, I mean he could have somehow morally justified it to himself by saying I didn't kill the people.

732
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,379
Scott: But what does that get you?

733
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,268
Scott: He gets you no friends because they're all dead.

734
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:40,350
Rym: now My like my end Conclusion of what Trigon is trying to say because my funny answer is not that it's not about pacifism or whatever.

735
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:51,009
Rym: The moral of Trigon is very simple One fucker can ruin everybody's day Because look at it every bad thing that happens in the whole show is the direct result of one man.

736
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:55,930
Rym: Yeah, pretty much one man is the cause of everything bad that ever happened.

737
00:50:56,251 --> 00:51:12,170
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically if you believe the things the way the show presents everything right if Knives Wasn't an ass then everyone would have been being all happy like they are after the end of the show where you know They're digging up the well and they found water in the desert and they're living in their happy town with the happy people.

738
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:16,810
Scott: You know all that stuff right, but no just the one guy without he ruined everything.

739
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:22,114
Rym: But that actually plays into what I think the higher moral I guess Conjecture of the show is.

740
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:24,763
Rym: is that all right Vashj estimate.

741
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:36,836
Rym: It's basically saying that pacifism is A noble ideal and it should be the goal of every sentient being but at the same time It is an impossible goal.

742
00:51:37,278 --> 00:51:41,532
Rym: and it is I think the show is saying straight up unless you want to let bad people get Away, you know.

743
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:48,735
Scott: if you unless you want to let other bad people just get away with killing people, you know I think the show was saying that Pacifism is untenable.

744
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:53,230
Rym: Yeah, and I think that is the only thing you can truly take away from this show.

745
00:51:54,272 --> 00:52:03,540
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean look he He chewed but I. that's why the show is so great because Vashj is basically a deity a god he is.

746
00:52:03,942 --> 00:52:15,277
Rym: he is superhuman and The only reason he is able to get as far as he has without killing people to save other people Is because he's more than all those other people.

747
00:52:15,317 --> 00:52:16,299
Rym: he is inhuman.

748
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,104
Rym: and I guess the moral.

749
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:25,570
Rym: and even then look at all these wounds The show was saying that if you are not a superhuman you cannot be a pacifist.

750
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,634
Rym: It is impossible that.

751
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:33,543
Scott: that is a burden that is too great for any man to bear unless you just want to let bad guys get away with all their terrible stuff.

752
00:52:33,804 --> 00:52:41,390
Rym: and it's kind of it's like as The world will always have people like knives and the best you can do is try to change them and try to save them.

753
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:50,396
Rym: but in the end Killing is possibly unavoidable and I think that you should always Abhor the killing of other beings.

754
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:54,270
Rym: but at the same time you must not shy away from it if it's the only option.

755
00:52:54,812 --> 00:53:06,150
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I think the the strength of the show is that at the end of the very show Vashj decides not to kill knives Even though he knows that that cannot end.

756
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:13,550
Rym: Well, he knows from all of all that he's learned that that is not going to end things and that killing him would end things.

757
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:19,650
Rym: But then again, you could look at it at the same time that alright killing knives would end that but there'll always be another knives.

758
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:20,794
Rym: Are you going to kill them all?

759
00:53:21,556 --> 00:53:25,750
Rym: but yet you can't not kill them because then the innocent people die.

760
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:30,070
Rym: So it's a morally complex show and I think that is if nothing else.

761
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,820
Rym: That is what makes this show stand above so many other shows.

762
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:45,701
Scott: another thing unlike, you know, a lot of other shows I mean, there's some anime out there that are so, you know People go just batshit crazy.

763
00:53:45,842 --> 00:53:47,530
Rym: Oh, well, I think those people are dumb.

764
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,141
Rym: I think Ava was pretty straightforward and what it was saying.

765
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:55,358
Scott: there are other shows like I don't know Better just heavy-handed and just out there.

766
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,083
Scott: They're like, this is our message.

767
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:59,189
Scott: We just say it to you in plain words, right?

768
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,830
Scott: In English, this is what the show is about.

769
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:03,097
Scott: Yep, like Matt cross war is bad.

770
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:04,161
Rym: or look like Gundam seed.

771
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:14,428
Rym: Gundam seed was a great show and an emotional roller coaster But it was still a pretty simplistic Simplistic moral message in the end and they come out with it was bad killings bad, right?

772
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:22,628
Scott: Okay Yeah, try gun right delivers its moral message and a not crazy convoluted existential fuck with your mind.

773
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:26,870
Scott: kind of way Right, but not an incredibly blunt and simplistic way.

774
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:31,426
Scott: It gives you stuff that you can eat, you know work with and understand and get a hold of.

775
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:38,010
Scott: it's not batshit You know fucked up, but at the same time it doesn't just say this is the one answer.

776
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:38,653
Scott: This is the lesson.

777
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:39,376
Scott: We're trying to teach you.

778
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,290
Scott: it just gives you this stuff and says go work with that.

779
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:43,675
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do with that?

780
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:43,957
Rym: Huh?

781
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:47,150
Scott: Yeah, it asks you questions and it makes you you know.

782
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:54,130
Scott: It actually puts the ideas directly into your mind But doesn't give you like the an answer to those ideas.

783
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,581
Scott: it's just like here play around with these ideas and you go.

784
00:54:58,043 --> 00:54:59,788
Scott: and that's what makes you so upset with the show.

785
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:02,052
Scott: because it's upsetting.

786
00:55:02,112 --> 00:55:08,934
Rym: the show is upsetting because it asks difficult questions that even I mean I Don't.

787
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:11,063
Rym: I mean I say and they show you the shows about.

788
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,690
Scott: they don't give you a definitive answer.

789
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,861
Scott: They show you what the different answers are and you don't like any of them.

790
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:18,510
Scott: It's like well, here's one answer to that question.

791
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,152
Scott: We just asked you.

792
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:20,658
Scott: Here's the other answer that question.

793
00:55:20,678 --> 00:55:21,642
Scott: We just asked you pick one.

794
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:22,686
Scott: They both suck.

795
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:23,830
Scott: Yeah, don't they?

796
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,132
Rym: I I mean this.

797
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:30,830
Rym: I think this show is very uncomfortable to watch for anyone who has any sort of moral compass at all.

798
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:33,205
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I guess you've heard an evil fucker.

799
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:35,218
Rym: You'll be like, uh Go man.

800
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:36,049
Rym: Nice was awesome.

801
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:40,526
Scott: He is kind of cool as a character even though he's bad.

802
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:41,410
Rym: look at knives.

803
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,502
Rym: He's a child.

804
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:49,190
Rym: almost to the end He's a. he's a child who lashes out at people and has temper tantrums.

805
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:53,041
Rym: But because he's so powerful his temper tantrums and in the deaths of millions.

806
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:53,964
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

807
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,110
Rym: Ah, the show is just so good.

808
00:55:56,632 --> 00:55:58,117
Rym: Yeah, I I can.

809
00:55:58,217 --> 00:56:01,809
Rym: it's one of those few shows that I could watch it again and again and never get sick of it.

810
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:04,174
Scott: That I don't know.

811
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:08,550
Scott: I think I could get sick of it after a while, you know, I couldn't watch it forever.

812
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:17,066
Rym: Well, no But like I could periodically watch this show every several years for the rest of my life and probably not get sick of it I couldn't watch it back to back like I could.

813
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:17,570
Rym: Star Wars.

814
00:56:17,657 --> 00:56:27,129
Scott: Yeah Another thing is the structure of the show is sort of like this perfect balance between being like episodic and between being you know This this cereal where you can't miss an episode.

815
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:38,370
Scott: So it's like you could actually skip some episodes here and there but each individual episode is like an individual work except for like I guess the last three or four which sort of go together and some of the two partners and stuff.

816
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,546
Rym: I also like how the show is so just self-consistent like for much of the early part.

817
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:52,410
Rym: There's a lot of kind of mystical mystery like Vasch's Memories and his visions and this woman lamb and you don't know who she is and all this kind of mystical.

818
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:53,539
Rym: You know what's going on?

819
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,709
Rym: Why does he feel this way?

820
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:56,579
Rym: Vasch is always asking himself questions.

821
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,830
Rym: Like what am I and what am I doing?

822
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:05,415
Rym: And am I living up to what Lem would want and then when they ram or whatever when they give you the answer as to I like how?

823
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:11,658
Rym: the actual answer as to the back story is Straight-up face value science fiction.

824
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,323
Rym: This is exactly what happened.

825
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:14,667
Rym: It's not like Ava.

826
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:17,097
Rym: Oh Mystery amorphous.

827
00:57:17,218 --> 00:57:19,067
Scott: It's yeah, there was the second impact.

828
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:19,710
Scott: What was it?

829
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:20,553
Scott: We're not gonna come out.

830
00:57:20,594 --> 00:57:24,270
Rym: and really well actually Ava is pretty straightforward in that part like directly.

831
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:24,913
Rym: It's like the sec.

832
00:57:24,953 --> 00:57:25,756
Rym: first impact was this.

833
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:26,720
Rym: second impact was this.

834
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:28,387
Rym: third impact was this guy.

835
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:31,739
Rym: This is why yeah It was if you're paying attention kind of seriously.

836
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:33,605
Rym: It was yeah straight up.

837
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:36,775
Rym: But anyway, I digress Try gun is very much this.

838
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:40,025
Rym: then this then this now this yeah, it's like here.

839
00:57:40,285 --> 00:57:41,930
Scott: This is exactly what happened in the past.

840
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:48,770
Scott: This is the history of the but they don't give that to you until episode 17 two-thirds of the way through the show before you know the back story.

841
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,155
Scott: So it's all.

842
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:57,830
Scott: you got the the mysteries being revealed and you've also got You know things in the future things actually changing as they go forward.

843
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:03,891
Scott: So if they start you in the middle and they give you the back and the forward at the same time and it works out Really?

844
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:07,905
Rym: Well, I mean what else can I say in some try gun was awesome.

845
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:11,760
Rym: try it is super awesome And I guess I don't need to recommend it to anyone.

846
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:12,423
Rym: It's fine.

847
00:58:12,624 --> 00:58:19,149
Scott: It also has good music and good design stylings and the best characters.

848
00:58:19,169 --> 00:58:21,034
Scott: and It's awesome.

849
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:30,936
Scott: and it's only 26 episodes and I'm pretty sure it's really cheap right now Because it's an old popular show I feel like we should buy it cuz we had we own the last DVD cuz it has Every so ready that last DVD.

850
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:31,579
Rym: I don't remember.

851
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,306
Scott: I don't remember cuz it's episode 23 through the end.

852
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:40,889
Rym: Yes So it's got like all the best episodes of the show on one DVD most of the best episodes.

853
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:43,375
Scott: Try again was a good show.

854
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:45,482
Scott: And those are the final thoughts of dragon.

855
00:58:45,784 --> 00:58:46,245
Rym: I think so.

856
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:49,188
Rym: I can't say more than that I other than going through.

857
00:58:49,711 --> 00:59:03,218
Rym: I mean, I could say more but like I think one of my favorite scenes just in general was chapel and When him and Wolfwood are having their fight Yes, that's that scene is really cool.

858
00:59:03,259 --> 00:59:08,890
Scott: because in the show like this actually if you read the manga Which is impossible to understand and sucks, right?

859
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,950
Scott: They actually sort of you know discuss like all this stuff like something Michael something, right?

860
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,801
Scott: But what's the deal with the churchy people and stuff, right?

861
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:17,263
Scott: Whatever.

862
00:59:17,745 --> 00:59:18,870
Scott: but in this show, right?

863
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,690
Scott: It's like they barely say anything.

864
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:27,390
Scott: it's like this guy appears and he's like something chapel something and you look at the guy and Obviously, he's got something to do with wolf wood.

865
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:39,690
Scott: He's related to him in some way perhaps his mentor from earlier days something like that, you know, and you know something like and They don't really need to say more than that and they don't say any more than they have to to make their point.

866
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,358
Scott: But it's like up wolf woods.

867
00:59:41,418 --> 00:59:41,740
Scott: come to.

868
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,730
Scott: you know, that you knew wolf would had a secret past.

869
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:47,487
Scott: Here's enough of the secret past that all you have to know for the show to work.

870
00:59:47,949 --> 00:59:50,064
Scott: here It is and here's the resolution of it.

871
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:50,829
Scott: Oh my god.

872
00:59:51,110 --> 01:00:05,550
Rym: but just that scene and the interaction between wolfwood and chapel when they're actually fighting and both characters progress as characters in the short span of that scene and They don't show you the resolution of that scene.

873
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:17,080
Rym: You just hear it and you see the look on chapels face and how he doesn't want to do it but he's forced to and I Yep, there's no unnecessary bits and Every bit is not wasted.

874
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,870
Scott: There's no unimportant moment.

875
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:22,949
Rym: I feel like I can't talk about those two heavy scenes in more detail because I'll get choked up.

876
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,927
Rym: Seriously, the show is that emotionally impactful to me even though on the surface.

877
01:00:29,027 --> 01:00:44,969
Scott: It's a rowdy comedy about a Western post-apocalyptic creature with a cross gun who puts a confessional on your head No nuts and and a really tall insurance agent with her friend who has a million derringers.

878
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:49,239
Scott: and Yet the show is just a drunken guy who is a weaponsmith.

879
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:58,907
Rym: and if a show that silly can make me cry four or five times Handily not like, you know, the one man tear like I got and like Firefly.

880
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,475
Rym: I'm talking like Sobbing cuz.

881
01:01:01,516 --> 01:01:05,630
Rym: remember that when we first saw that, you know episode 23 with wolf or is that and the scream?

882
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,036
Rym: We're all like trying not to cry.

883
01:01:09,116 --> 01:01:19,805
Rym: and I remember there was this one moment where everyone kind of looked around and we all saw that we were All trying not to cry and then we all started crying And that was like the man bond episodes over.

884
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:23,510
Scott: so it's not like, you know You can hide your crying behind the rest of the episode

885
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:32,606
Rym: Yep And that was pretty much when the front row crew is a core Bonded fully because we all just cried openly in front of each other at a Japanese cartoon

886
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,437
Scott: in a dorm room On the CRT with a real media file

887
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,042
Rym: and and bad

888
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:39,186
Scott: subtitles barely

889
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:43,862
Rym: legible subtitles Man, actually, that's one thing I got to say.

890
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:45,130
Rym: our subtitles were wrong.

891
01:01:45,813 --> 01:02:02,719
Rym: but the scene where you know Millie comes in and just hugs wolf would and the subtitles said and I'm pretty sure it was a bad translation was all the food said was You're a good healer and I just thought that was such a great line and it kind of disappointed me when I found out that Wasn't exactly what he said.

892
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:05,375
Scott: Yeah, they're there you know, it's sort of.

893
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:20,049
Scott: I guess that can happen with anything where if you if you watch something and You get a translation of it or rendition of it and then you get a slightly different rendition There's sort of a getting used to the original one or liking one over the other and it's it's.

894
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:23,047
Scott: you know It's hard to say which one's objectively I guess better or whatever.

895
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:31,097
Rym: But yeah, you know what if you didn't cry at some point during kratri gun, you're not a human being Are you just a really cold?

896
01:02:31,137 --> 01:02:39,103
Rym: you you'd have to be pretty freakin cold because Scott and I are often Called out for our callousness and we cried like little guy Lee man.

897
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:39,544
Scott: Let's see.

898
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:41,209
Scott: Let's see who who is that cold?

899
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:43,842
Rym: Well, Legato wouldn't have cried.

01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:44,205
Rym: No.

901
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:44,850

Rym: Oh, yeah, just a little bit maybe.

905
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,858
