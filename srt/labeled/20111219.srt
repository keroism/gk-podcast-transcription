00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,031
Rym: It's Monday December 19th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,513
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:13,134
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:14,659
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,781
Rym: Tonight, software development methodologies.

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,246
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,895
Rym: While you were home being a bum, I was out shushin'.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,540
Scott: Shushin'.

9
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:35,142
Rym: Shushin'.

10
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:36,607
Scott: That's nice.

11
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:40,888
Rym: There was actually some pretty good shushin', even though it was kind of disturbing that, you know.

12
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,958
Scott: How many people other than you were shushin'?

13
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,384
Rym: Not that many people.

14
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,012
Scott: I didn't think that many people would be.

15
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,221
Scott: There were maybe... But it was cold.

16
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:50,772
Rym: Maybe thousand people other than me at the mountain.

17
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:51,376
Scott: Oh, that's a lot.

18
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:52,040
Rym: Not really.

19
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:53,367
Scott: How many people is it usually?

20
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,192
Rym: A lot more than that.

21
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:57,492
Rym: There's usually lines where you have to wait like 20 minutes just to get on the lift.

22
00:00:58,135 --> 00:00:59,282
Scott: Oh, but there's no line to shush.

23
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:00,730
Scott: There's just a line to get up to the top.

24
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,399
Rym: Yeah, why would there be a line to shush?

25
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:02,922
Rym: You just shush.

26
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:03,949
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,964
Scott: But, you know, people could be lined up, you know, if it's like a narrow entryway.

28
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:09,617
Rym: That's not how it works, by and large.

29
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:11,726
Scott: Is there like a line at the top, like start here?

30
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,498
Rym: No, there's just a mountain, and you can go in any direction.

31
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,004
Rym: There's like 20 different ways down.

32
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:17,148
Rym: Uh-huh.

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,674
Rym: Though the funny thing...

34
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:22,615
Scott: So you can even go down, like, in between one of the spots where you're not supposed to go.

35
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,319
Scott: You can.

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,983
Rym: You shouldn't.

37
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:24,928
Rym: Obviously you should.

38
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,034
Rym: But there are people who do.

39
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:27,902
Rym: I've done it a couple of times.

40
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,072
Rym: I've gone places that weren't actually trails.

41
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:30,975
Rym: What happens?

42
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:33,121
Rym: Or gone down closed trails.

43
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:37,558
Rym: You just ski and hope you don't get hurt, because if you do, they're not going to find you.

44
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,422
Scott: Alrighty.

45
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,612
Scott: Even if you scream or something?

46
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:41,557
Rym: Maybe.

47
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,139
Rym: I don't know.

48
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,987
Scott: Just if you're not in screaming condition.

49
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,076
Rym: Usually you go, you do that with a buddy.

50
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,281
Scott: A buddy system.

51
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:47,723
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,270
Scott: So one person will do the screaming.

53
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,837
Rym: But it was interesting that I'm there, right?

54
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,771
Rym: And there hasn't been really any snow this year.

55
00:01:53,912 --> 00:02:01,603
Rym: So everything around was green and brown, except the mountain, because Hunter actually makes snow, and they made a ton of snow.

56
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,310
Scott: But it was cold, so the snow probably didn't melt.

57
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:04,413
Rym: No, it didn't.

58
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,906
Rym: They were making snow constantly the whole time I was there, too.

59
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,955
Rym: So feet and feet of it were just being dumped.

60
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,784
Scott: So there's a snowmaking machine.

61
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:13,009
Rym: Many of them.

62
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,234
Scott: And they spray snow.

63
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:17,751
Rym: They spray water into the air that basically turns it into snow and falls back down.

64
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,819
Scott: Okay, so is it just like it's snowing everywhere?

65
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,982
Scott: I have a video of it, in fact.

66
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,946
Scott: Or are there people shoveling the snow to get it on all the parts?

67
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,815
Rym: Oh, it's basically snowing everywhere.

68
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,548
Scott: So basically they spray it off the top of the mountain.

69
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,196
Rym: Well, no, they spray it.

70
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,489
Rym: Scott, Scott, they spray it at intervals all over the mountain.

71
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,129
Rym: If you want to get into the details of how they make snow, it's not what you're envisioning.

72
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,456
Scott: It's not about how they make the snow.

73
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:43,711
Scott: It's about how they get the snow, which is also how they make it.

74
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:46,564
Rym: They spray it at every individual point along the way.

75
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,556
Rym: There are thousands of spray nozzles all over the mountain.

76
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:54,076
Scott: I thought it was a machine that just sort of sprays it in one big spot.

77
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,201
Rym: No, no, no, no.

78
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,908
Scott: They make the snow and they pump it around.

79
00:02:56,928 --> 00:03:02,345
Rym: Now they have some point places that'll make the snow for like one particular area at a time.

80
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:08,328
Scott: So the snow gets delivered at like a sprinkler system almost out of separate thingies.

81
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,152
Rym: Sort of, yeah.

82
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:09,756
Rym: Okay.

83
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,982
Rym: But there hadn't been any snow.

84
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,474
Rym: So the whole area around the mountain was basically brown.

85
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:20,944
Rym: And then the mountain itself had these crazy ungroomed moguls because they were basically pouring snow down and it tends to form into moguls.

86
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:22,310
Rym: It was awesome.

87
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,595
Rym: It was absolutely awesome.

88
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,942
Scott: Why aren't they like raked or something?

89
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,441
Rym: They do groom things, but not while they're making it because it'll just get ungroomed.

90
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:32,479
Rym: And frankly, I prefer skiing ungroomed crazy terrain.

91
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:35,412
Scott: Wouldn't you want like, what do they do for like Olympic snow?

92
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,659
Rym: Uh, same thing.

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,084
Rym: and or using natural snow.

94
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,495
Rym: And then they groom it depending on what kind of race it is.

95
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,870
Rym: They make like the field for the racing or the slalom or whatever.

96
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:45,919
Rym: There's some racing courses at Hunter.

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,737
Scott: It's just like you see Olympic snow and it's like oh yeah, they groom that.

98
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,270
Scott: It's like that's the, you know, where can you get that kind of action.

99
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,333
Rym: They groom that shit.

100
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,882
Rym: But anyway, the funny thing was there's one run.

101
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:01,094
Rym: They don't at the same time.

102
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,424
Rym: So they made like a set of runs you could do.

103
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:07,804
Rym: And one of them Minya Konka, which is one of my favorites anyway, or Minya Konka I guess.

104
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,397
Rym: I've never actually looked at how it's spelled and I'm trying to think back as to how it's spelled because it's going to make fun of you.

105
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:17,031
Rym: You're going to get, you're going to get reamed of the trails.

106
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:21,466
Rym: But uh, there it was, it looked like it was closed.

107
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:25,502
Rym: But if you skied all the way over there and look down, the sign didn't say closed.

108
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,892
Rym: It said warning ungroomed experts only.

109
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:34,271
Rym: So I went over there and there was maybe one other dude going down that same trail.

110
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:36,861
Rym: So I just had this whole trail to myself like all day.

111
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,450
Rym: It was kind of hard though.

112
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,633
Scott: No kidding.

113
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,386
Rym: In fact it was way hard, but I took a lesson.

114
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:48,817
Scott: I feel kind of confident now because you paid money for a lesson for a professional person because I was, you know, why did the professional person tell you?

115
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,210
Rym: Well, basically he told me what I expected.

116
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,362
Rym: He looked at how I skied and said, you're great.

117
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:54,850
Rym: You're on your way to be an expert.

118
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,440
Rym: Just keep skiing all the time.

119
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,372
Rym: And he showed me a couple exercises to do that I'd never thought of.

120
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,845
Rym: And it was actually surprising how much that helped.

121
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,436
Rym: He told me this thing called pizza, pizza, french fries.

122
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,063
Rym: He was like, yeah, right.

123
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:13,052
Rym: Actually there's a big argument that you shouldn't even teach kids that you should start them on parallel skiing right away.

124
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:20,537
Rym: And I kind of agree with that because the snowplow formation is basically dangerous and slow and stupid.

125
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,504
Rym: And if you go too fast, it can't stop you.

126
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,840
Rym: And you're more likely to have a spiral fracture.

127
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,357
Rym: And if you don't know what that is, imagine a fracture of bones that is spiral.

128
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:30,822
Scott: Yeah, you don't want that shit.

129
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,919
Rym: But you taught me this weird exercise to do.

130
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,093
Rym: And usually I'm like, eh, exercises, I'll just practice by skiing or whatever.

131
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,384
Rym: But basically I had to stand sideways.

132
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:45,143
Rym: So like if the mountain's down, I'm standing to where I'm kind of facing perpendicularly to the fall line.

133
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,194
Rym: And then he's like, and then change your edges.

134
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,989
Rym: You start sliding sideways on your skis down the mountain.

135
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,286
Scott: So you're looking left, but you're going down and your skis are pointing down.

136
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:54,567
Scott: Yep.

137
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:01,617
Rym: And then he's like, all right, then change your edging so that the front is falling faster than the back and then repeat.

138
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:05,595
Rym: So you kind of go like a falling leaf, like woo woo woo all the way down the mountain.

139
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:10,316
Rym: He was like, do that twice down the entire mountain and you'll be a better skier afterward.

140
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:18,705
Rym: And I did it and it hurts like a hundred percent and I can't even figure out exactly what I'm better at, but I'm better.

141
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,668
Scott: All right.

142
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,220
Rym: So do that thing if you want to get better at skiing.

143
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:31,627
Scott: You should maybe just do that thing every time you go to the mountain, like, like start off by just doing that two times and then, you know, until you can do it until you can do it without even thinking about it.

144
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:38,683
Rym: I realized that it's like DDR, like aside from exercises and things, you know, this guy, he's an expert skier and he's trying to explain like concepts of skiing.

145
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:49,790
Rym: And it's a lot like, you know, when you try to explain like a skill that you know intuitively that you learn from practice, how usually the advice you give doesn't really mean much to someone who isn't on the heads.

146
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,834
Scott: It's like, yeah, thanks.

147
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:51,316
Scott: I knew that.

148
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,139
Scott: Yep, exactly.

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:07:06,572
Rym: It just kind of reinforces this idea that for physical skills, skills of dexterity, of balance, of physicality, very little help is gained in the end from someone telling you or showing you, you really just have to do it.

150
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:10,236
Scott: Well, I think, well, obviously you have to do it, but showing definitely helps because you can watch.

151
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,826
Scott: To a degree, but it can only get you so far.

152
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:21,285
Scott: You have to watch and duplicate, but once you're able to duplicate and the person is watching you, it confirms you are doing it properly, then, you know, that's only step one.

153
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:23,875
Scott: Step two is repeat it now a thousand times.

154
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:31,324
Scott: That's, you know, so it just, but it does help to watch and have a person confirm that you are duplicating properly.

155
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:41,790
Rym: That was the main reason I got a lesson because, you know, I've been skiing for a few years and I'm doing like pretty expert stuff, but I, I always feel really not so confident sometimes on these hills.

156
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,165
Rym: So I wanted an expert to look at me and tell me if I was an idiot or not.

157
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:47,474
Rym: And apparently I'm not that much of an idiot.

158
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:52,370
Scott: All right, so, so news, news, technologies, lots of technology.

159
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,213
Scott: news too much.

160
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,498
Scott: Uh, so check this out.

161
00:07:54,579 --> 00:08:04,401
Scott: in India, in India, India, people don't have a lot of money, relatively speaking, not a lot of money, but they got a lot of cell phones, cell phones, too many cell phones, almost too many cell phones and too many people.

162
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:08,217
Scott: Uh, so they want to save money on the cell phone bill.

163
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,186
Scott: Thankfully it doesn't cost as much as it does here.

164
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,953
Scott: Well, how can you do this?

165
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:12,856
Scott: real easy?

166
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:21,554
Scott: First, get one of those plans where you pay as you go and by the minute, as opposed to buying minutes upfront, like you have to do here, which is annoying too.

167
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:26,890
Scott: Let's say you want to call someone, but you don't want to pay for minutes or anything.

168
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:34,860
Scott: Call them and hang up after the first ring, they'll see your number on the caller ID and they'll call your ass back on the landline or whatever.

169
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,511
Scott: Well, you know, a lot of people do this.

170
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:42,056
Scott: Apparently about half of people in India have done this, uh, with their cell phones to save money.

171
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:45,715
Rym: You know, I used to do something like that when I had to get, before I had a car.

172
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:58,294
Rym: Yeah, I'd take classes at the local college and to call my mom to pick me up after school, I would basically do a collect call to the house and it would be like collect call from pick me up.

173
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,104
Scott: It totally works.

174
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,630
Scott: So, but here's something even crazier.

175
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:13,395
Scott: A lot of people out there are specifically creating automatic phone services that use missed calls.

176
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:17,070
Scott: So for example, in the US, you know, you might call Google four one one.

177
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,892
Scott: Does that still exist?

178
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,217
Scott: I have no idea.

179
00:09:19,237 --> 00:09:19,799
Rym: All right.

180
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:26,106
Scott: Uh, or you might call, you know, uh, for example, I called the jury duty to find out if I had jury duty.

181
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,159
Scott: I don't, I'm probably not gonna, but I still have to call for the rest of the week.

182
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:37,738
Scott: Uh, and I call and I wait and I push the numbers and then eventually they, you know, I'm on hold and eventually they tell me, you know, whether it's yes or no.

183
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:47,240
Scott: Imagine if I called the jury duty and hung up and then they called my ass back on the, with the automatic system, called me back and told me based on my number.

184
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,450
Rym: Now, maybe though that might cost them something.

185
00:09:49,570 --> 00:10:02,320
Rym: So what if instead you had a service where you call them and hang up and then they call you back and let it ring a number of times and hang up and then you have a system that knows one ring means show up to means don't.

186
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:03,484
Scott: Yeah.

187
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:11,240
Scott: But no, this is basically like there's people are setting up systems where you'll call a phone number, hang up after one ring and it'll call you back and tell you the weather.

188
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:19,955
Scott: I'll call you back and tell you the bus schedule or you know, do all kinds of other stuff so that you don't need to use your minutes and you can still get service.

189
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:26,962
Scott: And the person who has to pay is, you know, the person on the other end who has maybe a landline, it isn't paying so much.

190
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:37,701
Scott: And apparently, you know, they make an average of three dollars per customer in profits of revenue of three dollars per customer on phone service in India.

191
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:45,790
Scott: Nine hundred million accounts times three dollars is still two point seven billion dollars, but they're only making three bucks per customer.

192
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,955
Scott: That's not a lot.

193
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,484
Scott: And they would make a lot more, they said.

194
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,980
Scott: But half of people, you know, use this this kind of trickery.

195
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,930
Scott: So maybe they'll make five dollars per user instead.

196
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,663
Scott: Five times nine million is four and a half billion.

197
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:07,869
Rym: See, the only way instead of two point seven billion, you really want to make money off of from something like that.

198
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,210
Rym: You either have to use that as a kind of bundled service with a bunch of other things or no.

199
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,816
Rym: Eventually they'll be open source.

200
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:19,835
Rym: Everyone individually is empowered to use their own services like that.

201
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:21,064
Scott: I think it's there also because they're just.

202
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:23,579
Scott: they're not milking it and locking people in like they are here.

203
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,263
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

204
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:25,530
Rym: Yeah, it's an interesting.

205
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,770
Rym: I don't want to even call it a problem because one, I think there's nothing wrong with that.

206
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:37,993
Rym: If you are afforded charge people for calling, then if you don't want him to do this, if you were afforded something by technology and it appear, you know, it's an accepted part of the protocol.

207
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:42,992
Rym: Like, for example, I have a laptop and I say, hey, Wi-Fi, can I connect to you?

208
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:43,957
Rym: Well, I'll just go into further.

209
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,671
Rym: Wi-Fi says, hey, you, you want to connect to me?

210
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,038
Rym: And I say, yes, I want to connect to you.

211
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:48,861
Rym: And they give me Internet.

212
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:52,800
Rym: It's you know, that's not my problem if I use it.

213
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:57,982
Rym: If the other person didn't want me to use it, they shouldn't have afforded me that thing, that ability.

214
00:11:58,002 --> 00:12:01,234
Rym: This is just an affordance of the way the phone system works.

215
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:08,483
Rym: And because you can exchange any information over the sideband, that could be your entire stream if you use a good encoding.

216
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:11,294
Scott: Don't offer caller ID if you didn't want this to happen.

217
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,403
Rym: It's very yet caller ID.

218
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:13,724
Rym: All right.

219
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,416
Scott: If you charge, charge people for the caller ID.

220
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:16,899
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:17,723
Rym: Which they used to.

222
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:17,924
Rym: Yeah.

223
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,029
Scott: You could spoof the caller ID.

224
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,414
Scott: I could call some service.

225
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:26,627
Scott: That's like, you know, it's like call us and hang up after two rings to get a hoe to show up and I'll dial the fake number.

226
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:29,855
Scott: And then the hoe looks.

227
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,728
Rym: Or I call someone and I shows up at some office.

228
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:33,892
Rym: I spoofed the caller ID.

229
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,193
Rym: Right.

230
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:35,739
Rym: And the caller ID is spoofed.

231
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,184
Rym: So I've sent a bunch of digits.

232
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,301
Rym: I can then have an encoding scheme to put data in those digits.

233
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:42,045
Scott: Oh, here we go.

234
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:42,426
Scott: You ready?

235
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,114
Scott: You spoofed caller ID to 911.

236
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:47,451
Scott: So you call the weather service and then they call 911 and tell it the weather.

237
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:49,057
Rym: That is just.

238
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,630
Rym: these are all just riffs on the old Chinese restaurant double take.

239
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:53,493
Scott: Yeah, I know.

240
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:57,930
Scott: I read some crazy story today that I think it was probably a FARC story.

241
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:04,531
Scott: The two guys robbed the place and then one guy ass dialed 911.

242
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:05,998
Rym: That happens kind of often.

243
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:10,337
Scott: I don't I actually sort of while that's hilarious and it could be true, I sort of don't believe it.

244
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,748
Scott: And I think that one guy actually wanted to turn him in.

245
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:18,131
Scott: One of the two guys wanted to, you know, like wanted to, you know, go to jail or at least, you know.

246
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,095
Rym: But it's hard to say.

247
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:22,954
Scott: But, you know, he didn't want to just rat out his friends straight up.

248
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,989
Scott: And he also couldn't convince the friend to turn himself in.

249
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,451
Scott: Right.

250
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,733
Scott: So this way, at least the friend thinks he's dumb as opposed to the friend thinking he's a rat.

251
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:38,590
Rym: Thing is, a lot of phones have emergency dialing mode, which will bypass the lock screen and simultaneously will have like 911 already pre-coded in there.

252
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:41,170
Scott: I know it is possible, but really.

253
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:53,010
Scott: But dialing 911 and then on while the 911 is dialed, talking about the crime you committed and talking about, hey, we're going to go sell the stuff at this place and then going to the place and the cops are already there.

254
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,849
Scott: It's a little a little too far fetched.

255
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:57,515
Scott: It's possible, though.

256
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:00,048
Rym: Of course, what is funny is that this is actually very.

257
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,329
Rym: this India thing is very reminiscent of the old black boxes.

258
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,769
Rym: You know how black boxes worked?

259
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,233
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:04,865
Rym: Do you?

261
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:09,230
Scott: Well, most of those boxes were just, you know, put some sound.

262
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,353
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

263
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:13,953
Rym: You're thinking of red boxes and blue boxes or the I think the beige box.

264
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,110
Rym: The black box was different.

265
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:29,770
Rym: It would basically make the phone circuit appear as though the phone was on the hook at both ends because the billing system would not charge you for a time where one or both parties has the phone on the hook because you can't be talking.

266
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:36,489
Rym: So you'd mess with the line level, the voltage with this black box on both ends so that look like the phone was actually on the hook.

267
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,113
Rym: It was hung up.

268
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,449
Rym: And then you just keep talking through the open circuit.

269
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,390
Rym: It's similar to that, only actually a little bit more legit.

270
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,269
Scott: It's a lot more legit.

271
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,990
Rym: I have no problem with anyone using a side.

272
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,350
Scott: I don't have a problem either.

273
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,465
Scott: I just think it's really interesting.

274
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:53,829
Rym: Oh, yeah.

275
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,390
Rym: But I know there are people out there going to try to argue it's a bad thing.

276
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,171
Scott: Whatever.

277
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:57,472
Scott: Shut up.

278
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:02,610
Rym: So it turns out that Facebook is suing Mark Zuckerberg.

279
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,630
Rym: For something kind of funny.

280
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,810
Scott: Yeah, but it's some other guy who changed his name to Mark Zuckerberg.

281
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,006
Scott: So it's not their own CEO.

282
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:09,919
Rym: Some other guy.

283
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:13,330
Rym: I want to talk about this because everyone has the headlines.

284
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,830
Rym: People haven't actually been reading the article, I don't think so.

285
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,499
Scott: Some guy.

286
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,129
Scott: I was too lazy.

287
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,250
Rym: Made a store company.

288
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:20,769
Rym: I think it's based in Israel.

289
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,190
Rym: What it does is called the like store.

290
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:25,950
Rym: You want to buy likes for your business's website.

291
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,790
Rym: Three thousand five thousand ten thousand.

292
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,530
Rym: You pay them and they provide them nice.

293
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:35,470
Rym: They have armies of people and robots and accounts that will just like the shit out of your website.

294
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,461
Rym: And you pay per like.

295
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:37,030
Scott: Nice.

296
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,059
Rym: You have bulk discounts.

297
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,050
Scott: How much is it per like?

298
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:40,490
Rym: I have no idea, Penny.

299
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,489
Rym: This is against Facebook's terms of service.

300
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,792
Scott: No kidding.

301
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:49,630
Rym: So they sued the guy saying, hey, I don't know, can you sue a guy for violating the terms of service?

302
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,889
Scott: I mean, because he was you can you can get rid of his account, but can you sue him?

303
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,309
Scott: I guess they're doing it.

304
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:58,155
Rym: Well, they want.

305
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,869
Rym: they basically want his business shut down.

306
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,190
Rym: And there's all sorts of shenanigans.

307
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:02,849
Scott: I'm skipping the Israeli law.

308
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,230
Rym: But the funny thing is, this guy, in response to being sued, legally changed his name to Mark Zuckerberg just for publicity.

309
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:12,260
Rym: You know what?

310
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,029
Scott: It worked.

311
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,430
Rym: It appears to have worked really well.

312
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,450
Rym: Everyone knows about the like star.

313
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,509
Rym: So I went to this like star to see what the deal was.

314
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,272
Scott: How much of the likes?

315
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:23,610
Rym: You can buy Google plus one's YouTube views.

316
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,410
Rym: You can just buy YouTube views.

317
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:25,873
Scott: How much?

318
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:26,928
Scott: How much is a YouTube view?

319
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,064
Rym: Let's find out right now.

320
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:28,410
Rym: Let's see.

321
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,949
Rym: I want a real YouTube view.

322
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:30,913
Rym: All right.

323
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,550
Rym: I can get twenty five thousand for two hundred and thirty dollars.

324
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,474
Scott: That's not worth it.

325
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:36,339
Scott: That's not even close to.

326
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,530
Rym: I can get a thousand for twelve dollars.

327
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,890
Scott: No, see, that's that's an insignificant number of likes.

328
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,684
Scott: I've already got like one hundred thousand likes.

329
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:43,390
Scott: just rainbow dash.

330
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,934
Scott: Oh, my gosh.

331
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,890
Scott: You need you want a significant number of likes.

332
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,490
Scott: I need like twenty five million likes.

333
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,150
Scott: That's a real number of likes.

334
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,069
Scott: How much is twenty five million likes?

335
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,970
Rym: Well, twenty five million likes is much harder to get than twenty five million views.

336
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,150
Scott: But that's what I'm saying.

337
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,689
Scott: And it's like that's a. you know, it's a real number.

338
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,829
Rym: More importantly, this goes back into something we used to talk about more often than we do now.

339
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,169
Rym: But SEO scum, this is the same as SEO scum.

340
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:12,410
Rym: If you're a business and you think that this will help you, you're an idiot.

341
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,272
Scott: No kidding.

342
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:16,490
Rym: And it amazes me that people fall for this snake oil.

343
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,250
Scott: Well, it could help you a little bit, right?

344
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:22,250
Scott: If it works, if and you don't get caught and shut down your video, take it down.

345
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:22,810
Scott: Right.

346
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:29,750
Scott: Then you might actually get, for example, your video on the YouTube homepage, which will then get you actual views.

347
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,391
Rym: Right.

348
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:42,330
Rym: It's not that likely, though, because I cannot believe that you'll actually make it to the homepage with fake views and especially because I would not put it past Facebook and Google and anyone to perfectly let this happen.

349
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,870
Rym: Don't even make it against your terms of service.

350
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:47,490
Rym: And this have an algorithm that identifies these accounts doing these likes.

351
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:48,746
Scott: Yeah, just ban them.

352
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:49,090
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,088
Rym: Or don't count their likes.

354
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:50,493
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,349
Scott: And not show that video on the home page.

356
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:52,874
Rym: Yeah.

357
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:53,520
Scott: Yeah.

358
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,389
Scott: It totally won't work.

359
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:58,789
Rym: But it amazes me that people still fall for this stuff and that they think they need it.

360
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:16,850
Rym: And to it amazes me that people who look at sites, because I used to think that stuff like this didn't affect individual users, but people seem to be drawn to things that have a lot of Facebook likes, even though most of those things appear to have gained those likes by scams like this.

361
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,109
Rym: This is not the only place that sells these things.

362
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,070
Scott: Same people who are like obsessed with like post counts and forums.

363
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,270
Scott: It's like just whenever there's any number of people like crazy about making it get bigger, they have some sort of psychological hang up they can't get over.

364
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:32,029
Scott: And, you know, Farmville and everyone else takes advantage of it.

365
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:33,850
Scott: That's just all there is to it.

366
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,030
Rym: Yep.

367
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:43,150
Rym: Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with selling likes and I don't think there's anything wrong with a company like Facebook figuring out whose likes are fake and not counting them.

368
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:44,409
Rym: And I think that's the end of that.

369
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,168
Rym: I think the lawsuit is kind of silly.

370
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:51,310
Rym: And I think the guy is actually a genius for changing his name to Mark Zuckerberg.

371
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,267
Scott: That was definitely a move of genius right there.

372
00:18:56,452 --> 00:19:00,109
Rym: And I wish everyone in this story the worst of luck, because frankly, they're all scum.

373
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,630
Scott: Scum versus scum, the best guy.

374
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,330
Rym: I do want to talk briefly about one more news item, because this has been making the rounds.

375
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:09,650
Rym: People have been in uproar lately.

376
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:21,030
Rym: There's been a lot of articles, op-eds, people complaining about how Google, partly with the advent of Google Plus and their verifications and everything, has been shutting down Gmail accounts of children.

377
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:22,006
Rym: Or people...

378
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,109
Scott: There's a law that says they have to.

379
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:23,471
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,410
Rym: So most of the articles about this basically blame Google.

381
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:28,070
Rym: It's not Google's fault.

382
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:34,410
Rym: You ever wonder why Steam and like every website in the world often will ask you, hey, when were you born?

383
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,110
Scott: Well, some of it's ESRB compliance for video games.

384
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:42,490
Rym: And it's also COPPA, the Childhood Online Privacy Protection Act.

385
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,028
Scott: That's right.

386
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,050
Rym: Which, one, it's an unconstitutional load of shit that I've hated from day one.

387
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,949
Rym: I don't think it should be a law.

388
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,890
Rym: It's ludicrous that we have a law like this, because what kid doesn't just say they were born on January 1st, 1900?

389
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,071
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,610
Rym: Why even make the websites go through the motion?

391
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,171
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,950
Rym: I also don't think it should be constitutional to have restrictions like that anyway.

393
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:03,453
Scott: Yep.

394
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,890
Rym: But I digress.

395
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:06,810
Rym: It's not Google's fault.

396
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,810
Rym: Google is dealing with the bullshit laws that we let get passed.

397
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,390
Scott: If you don't like it, get the law changed.

398
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:16,470
Rym: I disagree with that argument because our government is incapable of fixing anything at this point.

399
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,170
Scott: Violent revolution.

400
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:18,990
Rym: That might be the only option.

401
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:19,696
Scott: I think so.

402
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:20,650
Scott: Anyway.

403
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:21,672
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:25,829
Scott: I think, you know, a lot of people say that, you know, the last the last...

405
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,777
Rym: I mean, we could get in trouble.

406
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:28,130
Rym: We don't verify age.

407
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,230
Rym: So if if someone under the age of 13 is using our forum, we could actually get a lot of trouble.

408
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:33,361
Scott: Yeah.

409
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:42,590
Scott: You know, a lot of people say the last kind of discrimination we have to fight against is like, you know, anti-gay, anti, you know, lesbian and transgender and all that.

410
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:52,590
Scott: And that's not true to, you know, even if we, you know, somehow get it to the point where there's no more, you know, homophobes and whatnot, people are still going to be against atheists.

411
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:54,649
Scott: And that's the group that comes next.

412
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,004
Scott: And then even then...

413
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,310
Rym: Actually, that's the most distrusted group in America.

414
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:07,930
Scott: But even then, even if we somehow get it to the point where atheists are accepted, right, by, you know, the whole of society, there's still going to be age discrimination.

415
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,430
Scott: Age discrimination is the very last form of discrimination.

416
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,470
Rym: No, you're forgetting, Scott.

417
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:14,909
Rym: Furry freedom.

418
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,210
Rym: What about pond hopper?

419
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,510
Scott: That's not discrimination.

420
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:18,390
Scott: That's justified.

421
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:22,069
Rym: I wear the tanooki suit to fly.

422
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:25,230
Scott: Age discrimination is the very last form of discrimination.

423
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,350
Rym: I don't think it's the very last one.

424
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,470
Rym: What about A.I.s and robots?

425
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,430
Rym: They're going to get discriminated against like all fuck.

426
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,530
Scott: No, because they won't let you.

427
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,525
Scott: They'll just fucking kill you.

428
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:34,189
Rym: See, everyone says that.

429
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,608
Rym: No, because in what world do we make an A.I.

430
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,389
Rym: and then immediately give it control of nukes?

431
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:41,519
Scott: You wouldn't?

432
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,228
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

433
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,929
Scott: I trust the robot with the nukes more than just people.

434
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,521
Rym: That is true.

435
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:47,090
Rym: That is true.

436
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,870
Rym: But oh, by the way, you know what?

437
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,010
Rym: You're not allowed to use our forum if you're under the age of 13.

438
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,106
Scott: Sure.

439
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,310
Rym: I'm sure that'll stop all of you who are under the age of 13 from using our forum.

440
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:57,791
Scott: Great.

441
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:06,010
Scott: But yeah, age discrimination will probably won't even see a dent in age discrimination in our lifetimes or perhaps in the next century.

442
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,850
Rym: But Scott, what constitutes age discrimination specifically?

443
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:19,190
Scott: I mean, when you discriminate against someone simply based on the length of time that they have been alive as opposed to based on the merit of their character.

444
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:19,570
Scott: All right.

445
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:34,372
Scott: You got people who are completely dumb and incapable of thinking or driving, who are very old, perhaps 40s, 50s, yet there are like 12 year olds who are extremely capable of many, many things far more capable than people who have been on the earth far longer than them.

446
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:43,050
Scott: So discriminate against, you know, to give one person more or less rights or privileges simply based on the number of seconds since they're, you know, conception.

447
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:45,589
Rym: So I have one question for you, Scott.

448
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:47,330
Rym: Yes, I'm just going to ask you this question.

449
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,509
Rym: It's a loaded question.

450
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:49,670
Scott: I know heavily load.

451
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,290
Scott: I'm pretty sure I know the question already.

452
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,669
Rym: You run a company.

453
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:53,397
Rym: Yes.

454
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,550
Rym: You need to hire a developer.

455
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,051
Rym: Sure.

456
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:59,270
Rym: There are two developers who are exactly equally qualified in all regards.

457
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,013
Scott: Hire both.

458
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,290
Scott: Can never do without, you know, can't have enough.

459
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,869
Rym: You only have budget to hire one person.

460
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:05,468
Rym: You don't need to.

461
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:09,830
Rym: One of them is 20 and one of them is 111.

462
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,212
Scott: All right.

463
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:13,230
Rym: Now, which one are you going to hire?

464
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,512
Rym: Assuming that we have not discovered immortality and the average human lifespan is well under 111.

465
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:20,729
Scott: Well, the dude is sickly.

466
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,133
Scott: He was 111.

467
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,619
Scott: Or is he healthy?

468
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,630
Scott: He looks like he's going to keep going.

469
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,230
Rym: He looks like he's going to keep going.

470
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,606
Rym: But at the same time, he's not going to live past 120 because no one does.

471
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,510
Scott: Well, see, I'm not discriminating based on his age, discriminating based on his health.

472
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:34,535
Scott: That's completely different.

473
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:37,270
Rym: But his health is solely due to his age.

474
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,656
Scott: Not necessarily.

475
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:40,069
Rym: In this case, yes.

476
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,270
Rym: He's 100 percent healthy, except for the fact that he is aging.

477
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,850
Scott: Well, aging is the disease.

478
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:52,350
Rym: That if you're hiring someone, he will not be around 20 years from now, while the 20 year old, if you keep paying him, will probably still be around.

479
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,390
Scott: I'm not discriminating based on age, I'm discriminating based on another factor.

480
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:56,110
Rym: What other factor?

481
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,190
Scott: That happens to be correlated, happens to be correlated with age.

482
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,490
Rym: Happens to be correlated 100 percent directly, one to one.

483
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,210
Scott: For example, if a three year old was really good at driving, but he couldn't reach the pedals, I wouldn't let him drive.

484
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,490
Scott: It's, is it age discrimination?

485
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:14,410
Scott: Well, the length of his legs correlates with his age.

486
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,550
Scott: But it's not age discrimination because he can't reach the pedals.

487
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:21,490
Scott: So the requirement is you must be healthy and you will live a long time.

488
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,570
Scott: Scott, the requirement is you have to be able to reach the pedal.

489
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,071
Rym: All right, Scott.

490
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:29,910
Rym: So why would I ever hire someone who's 50 when I could hire someone who's similarly qualified, who's 20?

491
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,090
Scott: Because nobody is going to work for you for that many years.

492
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:37,210
Scott: The 50 year old dude isn't going to die in nine years.

493
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,510
Scott: Nine years is, you know, people work at companies for more than nine years.

494
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:45,108
Scott: You know, if you expect, you know, the 20 year old guy might work for you for 20 years.

495
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,190
Scott: Well, the 50 year old guy could work for you for 20 years.

496
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,370
Scott: Also, you know, there there's no worry of the guy's going to die tomorrow.

497
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:59,330
Scott: It may be if a 20 year old comes who's like, you know, may you know, he's fully capable of doing the job, but he's got cancer and he's going to die tomorrow.

498
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:03,070
Scott: So you're going to get a cancer guy if he's got a week to live?

499
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,610
Rym: Yes, but that's discriminatory.

500
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:07,170
Scott: He's got a week to live.

501
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,810
Scott: I'm not going to hire someone who is not even going to make it through training.

502
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:10,372
Scott: All right.

503
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:14,890
Rym: I mean, there's a guy who is more qualified than the 20 year old.

504
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,249
Scott: He's one hundred and nineteen.

505
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:21,950
Rym: OK, he is statistically pretty much guaranteed to die in the next six months.

506
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:27,490
Rym: OK, you know, hire him or the 18 year old might think about hiring that old guy.

507
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,229
Rym: You don't get that much work out of him in six months.

508
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,730
Scott: Well, he's probably a genius, right?

509
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,350
Scott: I mean, seriously, he could probably do like 10 years of work in six months.

510
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:40,848
Scott: If he's if he's better than the 20 year old.

511
00:25:47,490 --> 00:26:02,490
Rym: But anyway, things of the day for the life of me, I'm almost 30 years old and this is going to sound like an old man thing, but I got fitted sheets and I basically just wad them up in a vaguely like rectangular shape.

512
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,070
Rym: Well, for anyone who doesn't know, shove them into the back of my linen closet to then pretend they're not there.

513
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,730
Scott: Fitted sheets are the ones that, you know, you put on a bed that have the the elastic strap around the bottom.

514
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,573
Scott: They're fitted.

515
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:17,889
Scott: They tie, you know, they stay tight on the mattress in case you're dumb and you don't know what those are.

516
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:18,813
Rym: Yeah.

517
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,464
Rym: So, yeah.

518
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,916
Rym: How the fuck do you fold those?

519
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,002
Rym: Well, now I know.

520
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:23,369
Rym: now I know how to fold them.

521
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:24,918
Scott: Could you actually pull it off?

522
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,810
Scott: I got I got it halfway through.

523
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,490
Scott: I've watched that shirt folding video about a thousand times.

524
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,454
Scott: You know, I can't fucking do it.

525
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:33,349
Rym: I folded one fitted sheet pretty close to this.

526
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:38,490
Rym: The key is if you get that trick of holding the corners, it's all about the pointy corner.

527
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,230
Rym: Yeah, I'm getting better at this.

528
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,780
Rym: This was actually life changing.

529
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:43,928
Rym: And I think you should all watch it.

530
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,470
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:48,010
Scott: So, you know, the game, the kids for the NES.

532
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:49,178
Scott: Yeah, that game was OK.

533
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:50,469
Scott: It's actually called MC Kids.

534
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:52,852
Scott: And yeah.

535
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:59,750
Scott: And apparently this dude named Greg is Tavares and also someone else named Dan Chang.

536
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:01,360
Scott: They made that game.

537
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:02,369
Scott: They program that shit.

538
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:08,870
Scott: And in 1992, they wrote an article in the Journal of Computer Game Design talking about how they program that shit.

539
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:11,090
Scott: And here is that article on the Internet.

540
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,653
Scott: And you know what?

541
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,549
Scott: It's pretty fascinating how they program this fucking game on NES.

542
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:22,009
Scott: So, you know, if you're actually a computer person or a game coder or anything like that.

543
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:25,070
Scott: Read this, because it's pretty fascinating.

544
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:28,869
Scott: And then on top of that, maybe you should make some NES roms or something like that.

545
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:29,514
Scott: I don't know.

546
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:31,350
Scott: Maybe mod some NES roms.

547
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,057
Scott: So very briefly, make Zelda D. No, please don't.

548
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,566
Scott: I can't even beat Zelda C. Don't make Zelda D.

549
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,649
Rym: Zelda D would just be you start, no sword, surrounded by blue dark nuts.

550
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:45,882
Scott: Come and stay.

551
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:46,710
Scott: Final destination.

552
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,595
Rym: No idea.

553
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:49,189
Scott: AIs reprogrammed, so they come right at you.

554
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,105
Scott: Oh, and there's a whole lake.

555
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,390
Scott: You're in a middle of an island and all the water around you has Zora's shooting fireballs.

556
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:00,969
Rym: You just spawn on a dark nut.

557
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:04,649
Scott: Maybe I should just make that as like a piece of art.

558
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:06,785
Rym: I prefer your...

559
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,865
Scott: It's like you push start and it's like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

560
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:12,010
Rym: No, we should make a whole installation.

561
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:20,550
Rym: Like there'd be a nice art gallery where there's a bunch of NES games that are each of them not only impossible, but impossible to a ludicrous and surprising degree.

562
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,502
Scott: A Tetris that only gives pieces.

563
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:23,630
Scott: you can never finish a line.

564
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:29,710
Rym: Someone programmed bastard Tetris that is designed to give you the worst possible piece every move.

565
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,910
Scott: Yeah, but isn't it possible to give someone pieces that it's impossible to make a line?

566
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,200
Scott: If we got all S pieces?

567
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,350
Scott: No, because you could put them all right next to each other.

568
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,550
Rym: Yeah, but then there'd be all the bottom.

569
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,603
Scott: There would be.

570
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,290
Rym: Tetris is no bottom.

571
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,089
Scott: Just make up new pieces that are asshole pieces so you can't pos-.

572
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:52,550
Scott: So if anyone has a possibility of completing a line, make a piece that can't-.

573
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,910
Rym: There was that Japanese joke one that the pieces were all irregularly shaped.

574
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:56,996
Scott: Right, that's what I'm saying.

575
00:28:57,016 --> 00:29:01,930
Scott: Just make up new pieces as it goes along so that any piece it gives you will not possibly make a line.

576
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:09,329
Rym: I'm talking like a Mario one that just starts you and there's just nothing but goombas and turtles everywhere and there's a pit you can't jump over right past it.

577
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,065
Scott: Yup.

578
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,607
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club books are...

579
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,550
Scott: Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Euverie and Wind, Sand, and Stars by the same person.

580
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,449
Scott: I'm about halfway through Wind and Sand and Stars.

581
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:23,429
Rym: I am also about halfway through Wind, Sand, and Stars.

582
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,669
Scott: So this book club book is probably gonna happen before the next year.

583
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,630
Rym: It is a fantastic book.

584
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:29,549
Scott: The best.

585
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,055
Rym: I'm very much enjoying it.

586
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:35,550
Rym: I really want to fly a super dangerous dodgy old plane across the desert now.

587
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,021
Scott: You know, these planes weren't so dodgy and old.

588
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:39,167
Scott: He wrote this thing in like the 30s.

589
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,969
Rym: Yeah, planes in the 30s, Scott, were dodgy.

590
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,490
Scott: Yeah, but it wasn't like the fucking Red Baron, alright?

591
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,990
Scott: No, it wasn't- It was real airplanes made of metal with engines.

592
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,590
Rym: Yes, it wasn't that much better than the Red Baron.

593
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,290
Scott: Two or four propellers on the wings.

594
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,390
Rym: Yeah, they were not that great, these planes.

595
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,350
Scott: It was a lot better than the Red Baron.

596
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:00,249
Rym: Yeah, but they were still dodgy.

597
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,178
Scott: Dodgier than the 747, sure.

598
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:12,030
Rym: And I know how much he talks about, "Hey, it's much better here than it was in the old days when you- In addition to worrying about the engine failing, you also have to worry about the wings falling off.

599
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,203
Rym: Luckily, I don't have to worry about

600
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:13,467
Rym: that.".

601
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,610
Rym: Except in that typhoon, he's like, "That was the one time I was worried about my wings falling

602
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:17,690
Rym: off.".

603
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:19,167
Scott: I just read the typhoon chat.

604
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:20,548
Rym: That was great.

605
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,859
Scott: He's just like, "Yeah, there's really no drama here.

606
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:23,984
Scott: I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

607
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:24,707
Scott: I was in a

608
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:24,888
Scott: typhoon.".

609
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,250
Rym: He meant not to, just to kind of, not spoil the book on the book.

610
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,358
Scott: Let's not ruin the book club book.

611
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,850
Scott: Let's continue with the better moment.

612
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:36,290
Rym: To try to trick you into reading this book, he makes a very salient point about how horror never exists in the moment.

613
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:41,450
Rym: You're never horrified in the moment of some gigantic looming catastrophe.

614
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:43,830
Rym: You're only horrified in retrospect.

615
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:45,667
Scott: Or going in.

616
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:53,150
Rym: And the people who feel horror during the event are the ones who cannot deal with the event and thus don't survive.

617
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,326
Scott: Courage.

618
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:55,390
Scott: Anyway.

619
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,810
Scott: Uh, other meta moment.

620
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,308
Scott: You know what's happening one week after New Year's?

621
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,403
Rym: I believe it is...

622
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:03,130
Scott: MAGFEST!

623
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:03,654
Rym: What?

624
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,126
Rym: What?

625
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,390
Rym: Oh my god, I'm so excited.

626
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,030
Scott: If you don't go to MAGFEST, stop listening to the show because you suck and you're not allowed to listen.

627
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,630
Rym: Dude, a good portion of the front row crew is gonna be there.

628
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,529
Scott: Let me change that.

629
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,870
Scott: If you are going to MAGFEST, do not listen to the show because you're already awesome and we can't help you.

630
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:32,170
Scott: If you are not going to MAGFEST, you are now hereby required to listen to every episode of GeekNights Ever twice so that maybe you could maybe build up some awesomeness and be awesome enough for MAGFEST.

631
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,110
Rym: We are going to be on three panels, not simultaneously at MAGFEST.

632
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:43,530
Rym: We're doing our own lecture, a new one, actually an old one, Beyond Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Revised.

633
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,110
Rym: It's beyond D&D but it's totally different panels.

634
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,862
Scott: My shit is fucked up so I got it.

635
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:51,443
Scott: Shoot/slice you.

636
00:31:53,974 --> 00:32:00,150
Rym: We are also going to be on two discussion panels with the MAG and I guess, I don't know how many it is in the MAG anymore.

637
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:09,530
Rym: Gaming Intellectuals will be on the Moneymaking Game, which funnily has a nearly similar title to a lecture we're planning to do at PAX East, if Kahil will let us.

638
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:15,290
Rym: And we are going to be on Gamer Motivations, which is basically the discussion of the carrot in games.

639
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:18,010
Scott: What other meta is there?

640
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:25,330
Scott: You should go to the internets where we live and visit us in the places where we live on the Plus, Google and the Facebooking and the Twats.

641
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:33,189
Rym: Much more importantly, you should go to the GeekNights Rym YouTube channel and like all that shit because not only is there good shit there...

642
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,009
Scott: Because you need more likes, because you don't want to pay for likes from Mark Zuckerberg.

643
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,709
Rym: Exactly, I want you to like it up.

644
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,170
Scott: We need legitimate likes guys, serious.

645
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,109
Rym: Of course, if you think our videos suck, you should dislike them and post about it.

646
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,390
Scott: Yep, that's enough.

647
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:47,951
Scott: That's enough.

648
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:55,648
Rym: So, someone on the forum posted recently, and I forget what we were talking about, and they said something like, "What do you guys think of paired

649
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:56,309
Rym: programming?".

650
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:02,289
Rym: And Scott and I looked at each other over the internet and we were like, "Simultaneously, I got shit to say about

651
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:02,490
Rym: that.".

652
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,754
Scott: So here's the deal, right?

653
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:09,909
Scott: When you work, in the olden days, in Henry Ford's factory, right?

654
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:14,968
Scott: Your work is pretty much do this thing over and over again, right?

655
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:21,650
Scott: And it's just, you know, do a manual labor, just like at Foxconn, you know, hit this nail, screw this screw.

656
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:28,210
Scott: So it's easily quantifiable and it's easily manageable because it's just how many can a guy do in an hour?

657
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,139
Scott: He gets tired.

658
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,290
Scott: He needs this many breaks.

659
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,789
Scott: We need this many people.

660
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,730
Scott: You know, it's an easily quantifiable and easily manageable thing.

661
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:41,730
Scott: And over decades, we have become pretty much experts at managing that sort of labor.

662
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:48,430
Scott: But when it comes to art, right, you know, you don't really manage artists.

663
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:50,170
Scott: You just sort of like, you know, authors.

664
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,607
Scott: It's like, how do you manage an author?

665
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:59,430
Scott: I guess someone out there is probably going to tell me I'm dumb that you do manage authors somehow, you know, but you don't manage Picasso, right?

666
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,310
Scott: You're not going to tell me that he needs a manager, right?

667
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,090
Scott: He just sort of does his arts and he makes the arts.

668
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,330
Rym: He was only able to do that because of reputation and having the income to be able to do it.

669
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,110
Scott: I'm not saying I'm not thinking about the economics of it.

670
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:17,090
Scott: I'm just saying he doesn't need some sort of structure to like, you know, his day or some procedure to follow.

671
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,090
Scott: He's, you know, his muse comes to him and he he makes the paintings.

672
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:21,690
Scott: Right.

673
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:35,469
Scott: But programming is always been, you know, for the past decade or two, this sort of weird in-between place where you're sort of doing a work, you know, but you're also doing an arts.

674
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:53,969
Scott: And, you know, ever since, you know, even before, you know, the Mythical Man month, people have been trying to figure out how to manage and sort of, you know, structure the work of programmers to quantify it and sort of, you know, manage it and structure it in some way.

675
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:57,810
Scott: And there are lots and lots and lots of different ideas.

676
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:03,130
Scott: And we haven't really had a lot of time to test out many of them scientifically.

677
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:10,149
Scott: Some have, some have not, you know, so we only have so much data to go on to, you know, objectively say what works and what doesn't.

678
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:19,090
Scott: So now it's not just there's a lot of people who are trying to do a lot of things that are new and there isn't a whole lot of data to say what's a good idea, what's a bad idea.

679
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,670
Rym: The thing is, I want to expand it a little bit.

680
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,750
Rym: It's not just programming because, you know, I know it's mostly software.

681
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:33,110
Rym: Yeah, but computer stuff in general, there's, you know, management in that field is also kind of a new and strange thing, especially with the advent of, you know, ticketing systems and technology.

682
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,910
Rym: To actually track workflow and actually do metrics on things.

683
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:47,250
Rym: And there's a lot of certifications and a lot of methodologies like Sigma and the Sigma 7, Sigma 6, whatever, or IDLE compliance, ITIL and all this stuff.

684
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,291
Scott: And

685
00:35:49,232 --> 00:36:10,669
Rym: it's actually a very related discussion because I found in general, just to get into my opinion on all this, is that the majority of people who look to any of these to improve their process and follow them per the rules of their own systems, like I'm going to implement Scrum and they follow the rules of Scrum 100 percent, tend not to do that well.

686
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:15,150
Scott: Well, that's the thing is we don't really have any data to know who does well, right?

687
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,489
Scott: It's just people sort of, you know, some people do things and some people like what they came up with.

688
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:30,170
Scott: And so they continue to do it and some people don't like it and they try something else and they just do what they like, but they don't necessarily do what's best or no one really even knows what's best.

689
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:31,669
Scott: In most of the cases.

690
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,230
Scott: But what it comes down to is even an IT guy, right?

691
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:41,790
Scott: A software guy is even harder because in software you're doing something that has never been done before, because if it's been done before, you don't have to do it.

692
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,950
Rym: You can just get it unless you work for a large enterprise company.

693
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:51,610
Scott: So most of the time you're doing something new and someone's asking you even the simplest question, estimate how long this will take.

694
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,270
Scott: And you can sometimes estimate based on a lot of things, but they're basically saying you're about to do something that's never been done before.

695
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,108
Scott: How long is it going to take?

696
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:10,550
Scott: You know, and it's like I can only get so close and there's a chance that it's going to take way longer or maybe even way less than I estimated, even though I made a really good guess based on a lot of information and experience.

697
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:20,210
Rym: Now, there are a ton of, you know, scientific and I'm making quote marks, methodologies for figuring out how long stuff will take, you know, scoping and sizing of projects in software and in everything.

698
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:24,710
Rym: And they usually actually involve a good degree of math and weightings and things.

699
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:32,190
Rym: And I found that they're about as accurate as a relatively experienced person just making a gut guess.

700
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,691
Rym: Yeah.

701
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:40,630
Scott: And, you know, sometimes you're going to be pretty close, you know, but most of the time you're going to be like maybe a month off or something like that, depending on the size of the project.

702
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,512
Scott: Yeah.

703
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:50,170
Scott: And, you know, over the course of a career or at least a job you have at a company for many years, at least once you're going to be way the fuck off by a long time.

704
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:57,850
Scott: You know, there's going to be something that you thought, you know, or estimated would take a few months and takes like a year or half a year or something ridiculous like that.

705
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,277
Scott: It will happen at least once.

706
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:01,450
Scott: you see it happen all the time.

707
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,650
Scott: And worst case, you know, Duke Nukem forever.

708
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:06,470
Scott: Best case, I've never seen a best case.

709
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,230
Scott: Have you ever seen anyone like turn something out overnight?

710
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,181
Scott: They thought would take a year.

711
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:09,809
Scott: I haven't seen that.

712
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:13,209
Rym: Not a year, but I have had programmers surprise me.

713
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,633
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:20,050
Scott: You know, but even in IT, right, in IT, you know, you're not necessarily creating something new.

715
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,890
Scott: You're just sort of setting up a software or installing a thing or configuring a thing.

716
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,210
Rym: You are creating something new, but in a different regard.

717
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,590
Rym: But what you're creating that's new is all the glue between a bunch of other things.

718
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:38,090
Rym: And while those solutions are well known, the actual details of your environment make it such that what you're doing is effectively an entirely new thing.

719
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:53,630
Rym: Because nobody's actually taking like a ticketing system and a software development system and repositories and servers and software and installing them with default configurations and integrating them via UIs or defined APIs.

720
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,231
Rym: Right.

721
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,190
Rym: There's a bunch of cruft in between because you got something that's customized.

722
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:57,891
Scott: Yeah, it's.

723
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:58,172
Scott: it's.

724
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:02,950
Scott: it's a little bit a little bit easier to estimate and work things out with IT, but not much.

725
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,870
Scott: You know, you're always going to have like, well, how long does it take to set up exchange?

726
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,147
Scott: Well, about a couple of hours.

727
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:07,289
Scott: Right.

728
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,850
Scott: Well, you got to migrate our exchange server.

729
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:13,090
Scott: OK, there are specific things in our old exchange server.

730
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,710
Scott: They're going to cause you a lot of fucking trouble.

731
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:16,650
Scott: Well, now I have no fucking clue.

732
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,233
Scott: Here's a big example.

733
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:20,630
Scott: Maybe I'll look up that thing on Google and I'll have it in one hour extra.

734
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,929
Scott: Maybe it'll actually be a nightmare that requires an overnight thingy.

735
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,289
Scott: Maybe it requires even more work.

736
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,270
Rym: IT project I ever had for a real company was when I was working for ITS at RIT.

737
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:33,144
Scott: Oh, not IBM?

738
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:33,308
Scott: OK.

739
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:34,790
Rym: No, this is my first real project.

740
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,590
Rym: I had worked before IBM.

741
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:40,970
Rym: And actually, no, I worked there after I worked at IBM the first time anyway.

742
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,470
Rym: So what we had to do was migrate all the computers on RIT's faculty and administration network to Active Directory.

743
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,549
Rym: They weren't on the domain.

744
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,610
Rym: There were a bunch of like other domains around and it was kind of this hodgepodge.

745
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,890
Rym: Simultaneous to that, we had to migrate all of them to exchange.

746
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:05,070
Rym: Most of them had Outlook connecting to God only knows what.

747
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,027
Scott: Grace or Vex.

748
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:14,610
Rym: And every one of those people could not lose their like 10 years of accumulated emails.

749
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,890
Scott: Yeah, you can import into Exchange, export it to a file.

750
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:18,309
Rym: Oh, yeah, you say that.

751
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:19,648
Rym: OK, that is what to do.

752
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,910
Rym: This is why IT sizing is so difficult.

753
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,429
Rym: There is a pretty straightforward path to doing this.

754
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:32,730
Rym: Try doing it for more than a thousand people, each of whom have a slightly different environment.

755
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:37,250
Rym: And some of whom, in fact, almost all of whom have one thing that throws a monkey wrench into that.

756
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:37,723
Scott: Yep.

757
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:40,890
Rym: And that project took the better part of six months.

758
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,409
Scott: And it was a lot of people working on it.

759
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,250
Scott: There were just one guy, an army of guys.

760
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,290
Rym: I would go to an office and I'd have like 10 people with me and I'd fan them out across all these computers.

761
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:55,070
Rym: And nine of them would come back and say, oh, there's a problem.

762
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:58,710
Rym: And I'd have to do it myself.

763
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:02,990
Rym: And the number of things you would run into, like we set everyone up with these admin accounts.

764
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,391
Rym: Great.

765
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:18,390
Rym: Every one of them would add nine or 10 computers to the domain and then couldn't add them anymore because the accounts that were created happened to have a restriction where you could only add an account to the domain before your account was barred from adding further ones without special approval.

766
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:21,989
Rym: Nobody in the entire organization was prepared for that.

767
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,091
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:23,293
Scott: All right.

769
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:26,230
Scott: So let's talk about a few specific methodology thingies.

770
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,810
Scott: I guess the most popular one is, you know, is one that's pretty, pretty talked about frequently.

771
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:40,069
Scott: Internet is this pair programing, which is an aspect of something that was popularized by some books and some other guys who came up with it, which is extreme programing.

772
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:46,470
Scott: And, you know, basically I haven't looked too much into it because whatever.

773
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,189
Rym: But I have an opinion on it.

774
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:52,750
Scott: But yeah, but pretty much what it comes down to, at least the basic idea of pair programing.

775
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,211
Scott: Right.

776
00:41:53,271 --> 00:42:02,810
Scott: Which is an aspect of extreme programing, which is extreme is that instead of sitting there and coding by yourself, you actually get two people.

777
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,950
Scott: One person is at the keyboard and one person is just sitting there.

778
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:14,490
Scott: And basically the person who's just sitting there says what to code and the other person types it in.

779
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:18,290
Scott: And you can sort of think together and discuss and all this stuff.

780
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,390
Scott: And the idea is that, you know, most of the time you spend coding is time you spend thinking.

781
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,470
Scott: It's not the typing isn't the bottleneck.

782
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:34,170
Scott: So even if you should actually put the slower typing person at the keyboard, you know, that way you have more time to sit and think and look.

783
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,310
Scott: And it's not really slowing you down with the slow typing, the thinking and figuring out what to type is where all your time is.

784
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:44,310
Scott: So if two of you work together, not only will you come up with the correct thing to type faster.

785
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:45,194
Scott: Right.

786
00:42:45,374 --> 00:42:48,930
Scott: You'll both keep each other on task instead of browsing the Internet's all the time.

787
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,330
Scott: But on top of that, you'll have fewer bugs because you have two sets of eyes to recognize them like, aha, you missed a thing there.

788
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,235
Scott: Oh, I missed a thing.

789
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,470
Rym: Now, there's a. there's a great picture of this.

790
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:05,670
Rym: I went to the Wikipedia article on pair programing because there is one and the picture is clearly a fake one.

791
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:09,810
Rym: One of the programmers is pointing at the screen and the other one is looking.

792
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,710
Rym: No one ever does that in the real world.

793
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,369
Scott: That picture you see is a stock photo.

794
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:13,777
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:14,248
Rym: Two.

796
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:15,750
Scott: We got that b-roll.

797
00:43:16,112 --> 00:43:16,970
Rym: Two in the background.

798
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,450
Scott: Guy pointing at a computer, one of the guy looks on, we got that b-roll.

799
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:28,150
Rym: There's actually like a proper looking scrum like clipboard, you know, the kind of like scrum tracking thing people would use.

800
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,389
Rym: I've never seen someone actually use it like that.

801
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:31,233
Rym: Yeah.

802
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:33,489
Rym: And three is on a Mac and he's using the mouse.

803
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,681
Scott: So this is one of those things where it's like, OK, some.

804
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:41,170
Scott: I do know that some people definitely do this.

805
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,610
Scott: I've met people who do this and they say they do it at work.

806
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,049
Scott: I met these people in person, never met anyone who's done it.

807
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,890
Scott: I've met people who say they have done it.

808
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:54,030
Scott: I've never seen a workplace in person that is doing it, but I have met people who say they do it at work every day.

809
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,633
Scott: That's all they do.

810
00:43:55,818 --> 00:43:58,450
Scott: And, you know, they personally like it.

811
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:09,490
Scott: Do they have any evidence, actual studies and, you know, observed cases to, you know, compare it with controls against something to show that it is actually more efficient and produces less bugs?

812
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:10,972
Scott: Not really.

813
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:19,090
Scott: I mean, there's some stuff out there, but not a substantial body of, you know, work to show that this is a good way of doing things.

814
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,030
Rym: I have a guess, though, and I also have an environment where I think it is a very useful thing.

815
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:23,691
Scott: Yeah, but, you know,

816
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:37,610
Rym: I guess is that it only works well if the two people involved are reasonably socialized at a similar seniority and at a similar ability level, because otherwise the guy who knows more is just going to code the whole thing and the other guy is just going to kind of type it all in.

817
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:39,169
Scott: But maybe that guy will learn something.

818
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,910
Rym: Maybe he will, but it's probably going to slow the more senior guy down.

819
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:45,830
Rym: And I thought the whole goal of this was to make better code, not to train.

820
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:50,510
Scott: Well, maybe once in a while that guy who's not as good will notice a bug in the thing the other guy wrote.

821
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,930
Scott: Maybe.

822
00:44:51,231 --> 00:45:04,150
Rym: But I feel like just from experience, when a more junior software engineer or IT guy is working with a senior person, they'll pretty much defer to the senior person even when the senior person is wrong for various social reasons.

823
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:04,671
Rym: Yeah.

824
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,077
Scott: You know, basically, you know, no, we don't.

825
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:12,250
Scott: I've never done pair program in any place, but every place I've ever worked is basically you're sitting there doing your work.

826
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:16,610
Scott: And if you have a real problem, yes, another guy, because you never were completely alone.

827
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:22,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean, my one and suddenly you can have two or maybe even three or four guys all looking at the same thing, trying to figure it out.

828
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:28,050
Scott: And, you know, usually just in the course of explaining what it is to everyone, you'll figure out what's wrong with it.

829
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:35,030
Rym: I mean, one of my senior developers will just get up and go to the other coders, be like, I'm having trouble with this and I'll just kind of huddle for five minutes and they'll go back to work.

830
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,750
Scott: So just because huddling is sometimes effective to solve a problem doesn't mean you should stay in the huddle the whole time.

831
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:41,291
Scott: Right.

832
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:46,450
Scott: You're playing football, you huddle up, you break and you go, you know, you do the play.

833
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,450
Rym: No, we should remake football to be more efficient.

834
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,368
Rym: It's all huddles.

835
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,212
Scott: Actually.

836
00:45:50,597 --> 00:45:51,650
Scott: Yeah, it's all huddles.

837
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,190
Scott: Actually, they're thinking about if they add technology to football, they might be able to eliminate the huddle if everyone has a headset.

838
00:45:57,372 --> 00:45:58,060
Rym: That'd be awesome.

839
00:45:58,182 --> 00:45:58,830
Scott: It would be the awesome.

840
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,897
Rym: I would love to listen to that headset during the game to.

841
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:07,810
Scott: they have headsets now, but they're all encrypted and you can't listen because that means the other team will be able to listen, which ruins the whole thing.

842
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:14,190
Scott: But it does remove an aspect of the game, which is the, you know, they keep changing the number of, you know, who's in the huddles.

843
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,630
Scott: You don't know who's going to be on the play to sort of get the other guy to mess up his substitutions.

844
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:26,250
Scott: You bring you know, you got a slow guy in the huddle, so they let their fast guy take a rest and then you switch, which is why you're not allowed to have more than a certain number of guys.

845
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:35,090
Rym: Imagine if we had a technology, complete aside, where at the line where the ball is, there was an opaque screen.

846
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:42,270
Rym: You could walk through it, but there's no big screen would just appear every time the whistle blew and neither team could see what was going on on the other side.

847
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,610
Rym: And that screen disappeared the moment the hike happened.

848
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:46,670
Scott: That'd be the awesomeness.

849
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,970
Rym: I would I would kill.

850
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,032
Scott: Well, it couldn't.

851
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:54,430
Scott: No, it couldn't be at the point of the snap because then it'd be like you line up and you don't even get to see the defense.

852
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,152
Scott: No, no.

853
00:46:55,312 --> 00:47:02,750
Scott: Part of part of part of football is seeing how the other guys line up and trying to fake the other guys out, you know, that kind of thing.

854
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:07,390
Scott: But it would be cool if it didn't go away until like the center put his hand on the ball.

855
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:11,050
Scott: And then, you know, you got to see what the other how the other team was looking.

856
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:13,050
Scott: That would be that would be a little bit more interesting.

857
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:30,150
Rym: But anyway, one place where I could see this working really well is extremely security sensitive environments like a government place where you're writing software for important spy things, because then then you're getting benefits that you don't even need science to prove that are actually better.

858
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:30,410
Rym: Yes.

859
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:37,830
Rym: For example, in order to put a backdoor in the code, you need an accomplice to simultaneously decide to do it.

860
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:38,312
Scott: Yeah.

861
00:47:38,352 --> 00:47:40,830
Scott: Then dependent of passing code review, you have a special case.

862
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:42,330
Scott: You're getting a guaranteed benefit.

863
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,010
Scott: You don't need science to prove it's a benefit.

864
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:50,250
Scott: And it's worth even if there are other harms, it's worth it because security is so extremely important.

865
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:59,590
Rym: A special case that I don't believe and I have no evidence of this, that there are places where there will have two teams or two people code the same thing simultaneously with no communication.

866
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:04,789
Rym: And then a third person will review both of their code and then write the solution based on those two.

867
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:09,410
Rym: Again, high security, military, possibly never actually done in practice.

868
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,471
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:12,050
Scott: I mean, that's not a bad idea either, right?

870
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,029
Scott: Because then if one guy writes a backdoor, he doesn't know if his back door is actually in the product or not.

871
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:22,109
Scott: And, you know, so it's like, well, you're not even going to try to write a backdoor because someone else looks at your code before it gets in.

872
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:24,769
Scott: And, you know, you don't even know who that guy is.

873
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:31,410
Scott: So you can't be your accomplice and you don't even know if it's actually going to make it in there because someone else is doing it also.

874
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:34,129
Scott: So there's not even a point to do and it's just do your work.

875
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:35,450
Rym: So very popular.

876
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,930
Rym: I want to talk about is Agile, particularly Scrum.

877
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,250
Scott: Well, Agile, it's weird because a lot of these things.

878
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:40,571
Scott: Right.

879
00:48:40,893 --> 00:48:44,890
Scott: A lot of the reason I think a lot of them are such snake oil is because they're so ill-defined.

880
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:47,810
Scott: And like, there's always going to be some guy who says, that's not Agile.

881
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:48,716
Scott: This is Agile.

882
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:50,330
Scott: I'm not Agile expert, blah, blah, blah.

883
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,089
Scott: And maybe, maybe that guy is.

884
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,053
Scott: But you know what?

885
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:58,430
Scott: I've read stuff that's like by the guy who came up with certain things and he says, I came up with it.

886
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,462
Scott: I'm the inventor of this thing.

887
00:48:59,523 --> 00:48:59,868
Scott: And he is.

888
00:49:00,352 --> 00:49:01,769
Scott: And he says, this is what the thing is.

889
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:07,690
Scott: But there'll be some other guy who's the expert on the thing, even though he didn't come up with it, who says, no, no, no, it's something different.

890
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:17,569
Rym: That's why you can't evaluate something so ephemeral or because these words, people instead you have to define like people make very specific systems based on these like Scrum.

891
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,389
Rym: There's some pretty particular rules about how to do Scrum.

892
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:20,991
Rym: Yeah.

893
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:27,630
Scott: It's like people came up with like these sets of rules and instructions and procedures and everyone is actually doing something different.

894
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:30,890
Scott: And a lot of people are calling it the same thing, like, oh, we're an Agile workplace.

895
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:31,834
Scott: We're an Agile workplace.

896
00:49:31,855 --> 00:49:34,450
Rym: But at the same time, you go to the two workplaces and they look completely different.

897
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:40,990
Rym: And there are things like IDIL, I-T-I-L, which are extremely, excruciatingly defined in detail.

898
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:42,036
Scott: Right.

899
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:43,590
Scott: But it's sort of a no true Scotsman.

900
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:43,791
Scott: Right.

901
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:44,657
Scott: It's like we're Agile.

902
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,370
Scott: No, you're not really Agile.

903
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,410
Rym: But Scott, what about things like IDIL where there's kind of a board that decides and that is it?

904
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:52,729
Scott: Yeah, well, that's a different thing.

905
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:53,659
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was saying.

906
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,568
Rym: There are things like that, too.

907
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:04,130
Rym: My problem with all of these is that they all have these big graphics that remind me of what I studied at RIT in classes, unlike project management.

908
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,609
Rym: And they're all completely useless.

909
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:14,590
Rym: They either tell you something obvious like work on stuff, then QA it, then work on stuff.

910
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,629
Rym: Like, do you need a graph to explain that?

911
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,929
Scott: Yeah, no.

912
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:24,850
Rym: Do you need to have the thing that says plan your project before you write it?

913
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,708
Rym: Does someone actually need someone to tell them that?

914
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,129
Rym: The thing is, I kind of worry that that, in fact, is necessary.

915
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,292
Scott: Sometimes.

916
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:36,550
Scott: But and the thing is, a lot of people have these things on paper, but don't actually do them.

917
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:36,831
Scott: Right.

918
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:42,270
Scott: It's like we put such emphasis on like maintenance, documentation or testing or no one's test driven.

919
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,090
Rym: Development is never on the road.

920
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:45,572
Scott: Right.

921
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:47,730
Scott: It's like people have all these things on paper.

922
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:48,032
Scott: Right.

923
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:51,030
Scott: These procedures and stuff, they don't follow them for shit.

924
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:52,370
Scott: I have never been in a place.

925
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:52,633
Scott: Right.

926
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:54,270
Scott: A lot of the test driven development.

927
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:55,389
Scott: That's one that drives me crazy.

928
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:55,751
Scott: Right.

929
00:50:55,771 --> 00:51:00,070
Scott: Because, you know, there's some cases where it's a good idea in some cases where it's a bad idea or whatever.

930
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:03,330
Scott: But it's like how many people actually have tests?

931
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:03,872
Scott: Right.

932
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:08,530
Scott: Like, you know, it's one of those things where you go online and you read articles written by people.

933
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:09,953
Scott: Here's a great example.

934
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:15,970
Scott: It's not actually of a, you know, a software development technique, but it's like, you know, a deployment.

935
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,110
Scott: This is a particular web software deployment technology.

936
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:23,850
Scott: And everyone, if you read articles, is like, oh, you got to be using these tools for deployment.

937
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:24,579
Scott: They're amazing.

938
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,430
Scott: They're amazing tools.

939
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:26,097
Scott: You got to use them.

940
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:26,561
Scott: You got to use them.

941
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:27,107
Scott: You got to use them.

942
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:27,410
Scott: Right.

943
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,610
Scott: So my coworker goes to a conference and everyone is like, you got to use these tools.

944
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,749
Scott: And I had seen a zillion articles about using these tools.

945
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:39,010
Scott: So one guy gets up in front of the thing and says, these tools are the greatest.

946
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:39,754
Scott: Right.

947
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:41,309
Scott: You know, everyone's got to use them.

948
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:42,948
Scott: Who here is using them right now?

949
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,071
Scott: Nobody.

950
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:46,109
Scott: Who here is planning to use them soon?

951
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:47,409
Scott: A whole bunch of people.

952
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:56,630
Scott: OK, so that same guy giving that talk, saying how those tools were great later on gives another thing like how we do it at my company.

953
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,030
Rym: They don't use any of those tools, do they?

954
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,288
Scott: He's not actually using them yet.

955
00:51:59,914 --> 00:52:01,345
Scott: So, yeah, you're right.

956
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:01,890
Rym: That's the thing.

957
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,910
Scott: He's like, yeah, we just had of all these hacks built on the old tools.

958
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,410
Rym: I've dealt with a lot of this stuff.

959
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,290
Rym: I mean, part of my job now is managing a bunch of developers for this stuff.

960
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:15,008
Scott: A lot of people, I bet, who are emphasizing the agile's and the scrums and the test driven developments.

961
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:16,788
Rym: They're not using it.

962
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,990
Rym: They all think that they will be using it someday.

963
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:24,930
Rym: Every one of those people has a plan to use them, plans to do the documentation and a plan to do that.

964
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:35,810
Rym: When you said yet, that's the key, because with all these software development methodologies, everyone I have ever met who spouses them will say we are working toward implementing them.

965
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:38,730
Rym: And I've never met anyone who actually implemented them fully.

966
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:39,990
Scott: Yep, never.

967
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,790
Rym: Some people have gotten close, though.

968
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:54,550
Rym: And I think for some professional advice, the real key is to learn about these things and look for stuff that you think will work in your environment and pick and choose and come up with a methodology that works for your own internal environment.

969
00:52:54,812 --> 00:52:56,730
Rym: And by trial and error, make it better over time.

970
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:08,710
Rym: If you try if you try to implement scrum and religiously follow it to the point that you let the rules actually drive your process and get in the way, then you're probably worse off.

971
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:15,530
Scott: That's the thing that bothers me about them the most over everything else is not necessarily, you know, they're not actually helping you.

972
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,490
Scott: They are actually helping you.

973
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,929
Scott: You don't have evidence to show they're helping you.

974
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:28,990
Scott: That doesn't really bother me as much as the fact that when you do these people concentrate so much on the procedure of work, that actually they end up doing more meta work than work.

975
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:44,130
Scott: They'll spend more time like modifying their tickets and arranging their Kanban board and, you know, having the little meetings and getting with the team and organizing the thingies and distributing the workflows and all that time.

976
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,210
Scott: They spend doing all that nonsense, which is supposedly going to increase the efficiency of their work.

977
00:53:48,794 --> 00:53:49,970
Scott: They're just not working.

978
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:52,689
Scott: They're doing this meta work instead of doing work work.

979
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:59,210
Scott: That's like if we sat around half the day discussing how we're going to do the thing and then only spent half the day doing the thing.

980
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:13,390
Scott: If we wouldn't have had any organization or maybe only had five minutes of organization, even if without any official procedure, and then just spent all day doing the work, even if we were working less efficiently, we would probably still get more work done.

981
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:27,090
Rym: I disagree for one reason that usually it's because it takes a lot of work to set up one of these systems or to set something up in general, set up the internal infrastructure to manage products in a sort of verifiable or controlled way.

982
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:32,850
Rym: But once it's set up, if it's maintained and works, then it probably pays out dividends in the end.

983
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:33,272
Rym: It doesn't.

984
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,830
Rym: It's not like you have to rebuild the process for every new project.

985
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:41,810
Scott: Yeah, a lot of it depends on the size of your project, you know, because when you get more people, you need more meta work.

986
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,490
Scott: There's just no way to get all the people to work in concert without the meta work.

987
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,530
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is, you have to be smart about it and you pick and choose what parts work.

988
00:54:49,850 --> 00:55:08,210
Rym: Like in idle, there's this idea of if you're categorizing the severity of a problem, like a bug comes in and you're tracking it and whatever ticketing system you use, instead of just having a priority like A, B, C, D, E or high, medium, low or whatever, it has the idea that priority is always the two dimensional matrix with two elements.

989
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:12,030
Rym: The severity or the urgency, depending on how you want to call it.

990
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,110
Rym: I believe the technical term is urgency, but whatever.

991
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,370
Rym: And the impact, like what it impacts.

992
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:26,390
Rym: So, for example, the difference between something that impacts revenue and is low priority versus something that doesn't impact revenue, but is high urgency.

993
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:28,330
Rym: The idea of separating impact from urgency.

994
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,222
Scott: Like, oh, my God, it crashes, but we're not actually losing any monies.

995
00:55:31,563 --> 00:55:33,230
Scott: or hey, this isn't really a crash.

996
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:34,749
Scott: It's just like a weird number error.

997
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,409
Scott: And it's only in this tiny thing that's hardly ever used, but it is losing us a tiny amount of monies.

998
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:48,329
Rym: But the idea of separating impact from urgency and then prioritizing based on a combination of the two is a fantastic idea and everyone should do it.

999
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:49,228
Scott: It's a good idea.

1000
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,250
Scott: Going the rest of the way, you don't necessarily need to follow all the idle.

1001
00:55:53,511 --> 00:55:54,930
Rym: Yeah, implementing all of idle.

1002
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,069
Rym: I wouldn't believe that anyone in the world has.

1003
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:02,529
Scott: There's probably some place they got certified and is doing it just because they wanted some bureaucracy nonsense.

1004
00:56:03,112 --> 00:56:07,290
Rym: And I've studied it a lot because I've implemented aspects of it in ticketing systems.

1005
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:12,070
Rym: But spending a lot of time to define workflows and things is very important.

1006
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:27,610
Rym: The problem is people who aren't naturally good at organizing tend to fall back on these systems and tend to put a lot of effort into implementing the systems, probably more so than they should be compared to the time they should be spending on just actually getting the project going.

1007
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:30,580
Scott: Well, also, people who tend to be bad at organizing tend to really just.

1008
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,690
Scott: they can't stick to the system like they really want to in their minds.

1009
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:40,050
Scott: Like they have this idea, like I'm going to get an organizer and they get an organizer and they start using it and they get a to do list and they use it for about a day.

1010
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,829
Scott: And then they forget about it.

1011
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,770
Rym: Yeah, well, that's the analogy.

1012
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:44,230
Rym: I know a lot of people who do this.

1013
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:44,815
Rym: I used to do it.

1014
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:46,370
Rym: You'll need to work on some stuff.

1015
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,410
Rym: You're sitting at home at Saturday like, shit, I got to get some stuff done.

1016
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,247
Rym: So you sit down, you say, I'm going to make a list of all the things I have to do.

1017
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,690
Rym: And the Twilight Sparkle style, you sit there for an hour and make this exhaustive list and prioritize it.

1018
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,070
Rym: And then you feel like you got a bunch of work done.

1019
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,950
Scott: So you take a break and then you at the end of the day, you didn't get any of those things.

1020
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,410
Scott: Go back to the list and you spent an hour making a list.

1021
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:08,441
Scott: Congratulations.

1022
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:09,029
Scott: You made a list.

1023
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:09,494
Scott: Yep.

1024
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,149
Scott: Good job.

1025
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:15,270
Rym: Now, if you want to break yourself of that habit, if you make a list like that, you're not allowed to throw it away.

1026
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:19,469
Rym: You've got to leave it on your desk and look at that fucker every day and feel bad about it.

1027
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:21,410
Rym: That's the only way to break that cycle.

1028
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:25,290
Rym: The moment you say it and you make a new list, you're done.

1029
00:57:25,712 --> 00:57:26,299
Rym: It's over.

1030
00:57:26,482 --> 00:57:27,009
Rym: You've lost.

1031
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,089
Scott: But yeah, that's how these things go.

1032
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:47,110
Scott: So, you know, when someone tries to sell you on like a test driven development or an agile this or whatever, that that just sort of tells me that, you know, not necessarily that they're a bad person or that they're no good, but that they sort of, you know, easily seduced by these these ideas.

1033
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:52,590
Scott: They sort of had this naive attitude that these that these magical systems are kind of awesome.

1034
00:57:52,810 --> 00:58:03,210
Rym: They're seduced by the idea that if they find some instructions on how to do X, like project management or software development, and they follow them, that it'll just work.

1035
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,709
Rym: Kind of like how if I follow the instructions on an Ikea thing, an Ikea thing comes out at the end.

1036
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:14,790
Scott: Yeah, it's like they have this imaginary sort of world where all their projects are managed in this beautiful structure.

1037
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:17,430
Scott: And, you know, you always test driven development.

1038
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,170
Scott: We're going to write before we write any code, we're going to write a test and write the code every time.

1039
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:27,465
Scott: And they believe in this like fantasy universe that they will and everything's perfectly documented.

1040
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,110
Scott: documentation always gets updated in the wiki.

1041
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:31,370
Scott: And they believe that that universe exists.

1042
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,689
Scott: They can imagine it in their minds and how great it would be.

1043
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:41,710
Scott: And they actually believe that they're going to go there and that they are going there instead of recognizing that that is a fantasy land that can never exist.

1044
00:58:42,091 --> 00:58:42,312
Rym: Yup.

1045
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:47,690
Rym: You know, to quote something that gets said often, actually releasing something is a feature.

1046
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:51,149
Rym: And here's a story from my past.

1047
00:58:51,610 --> 00:59:03,990
Rym: When I was a senior production engineer, my old job, I would often be approached by developers or people who would say something to the effect of we need to get this patch, whatever it is, into this production environment.

1048
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:07,150
Rym: We can't wait for a full regression test.

1049
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,119
Rym: It's a small patch.

1050
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,029
Rym: It's not that big a deal.

1051
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:15,350
Rym: And of course, I would say no, because, you know, and then I'd get overruled and I'd always be mad about that.

1052
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,330
Scott: Did you get it in writing?

1053
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:18,170
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I'd always get overruled.

1054
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:23,670
Scott: You just got to say you just got to get it in writing that they overruled you so that then you can have the I told you so stack.

1055
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:28,230
Rym: Let's do a Monday show on the proper means of covering one's ass in the real technical world.

1056
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,281
Scott: Get it in writing.

1057
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:29,810
Scott: End of story.

1058
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,210
Scott: Yeah, someone rang the doorbell.

1059
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:38,790
Rym: Anyway, but I used to always say things to myself like if I was in charge, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't be the one who overrules those things.

1060
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:40,470
Rym: I would follow the process.

1061
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:46,830
Scott: I wouldn't follow the process, but I also, you know, wouldn't do certain things like letting untested grab code.

1062
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,150
Rym: Well, no, it's not a matter of untested.

1063
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:59,430
Rym: Imagine something that was tested by developers and was tested by QA, but the full system was not re-regression tested, even though there was a low chance of a regression anywhere else in the system.

1064
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:08,330
Scott: Well, since I know how the thing works, because I'm actually a technology person and I'm not one of those bosses who's just a boss and doesn't actually know how the shit works, I would look at the specific thing.

1065
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:15,710
Scott: And decide or I would just trust whoever was under me close most closely and not even it was also a discussion.

1066
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:26,370
Rym: But like, for example, a procedure was put in place where when code is ready to go to production, their release notes, they have to be signed by all the approvers and pretty much without fail, there'd be someone who wasn't around to sign.

1067
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:33,829
Rym: You have to roll something out anyway, and someone would overrule them, at which point, why even have the process if you're obviously going to, you know, violate it every time you have to.

1068
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:45,970
Rym: Now that I'm a manager and I deal with this stuff and I'm the boss who has to sign the overruling procedures and everything, I'm pretty much doing everything that I always used to complain about.

1069
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:47,069
Scott: Don't be doing that.

1070
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:52,170
Rym: Now, because I know better and I know that, you know, decisions I'm making are actually pretty safe.

1071
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:53,256
Scott: Yeah.

1072
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:54,169
Scott: Has anything fucked up yet?

1073
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:54,441
Scott: No.

1074
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,590
Scott: But when the bosses you had before made those decisions, did shit get fucked up?

1075
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:58,150
Rym: Occasionally.

1076
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,234
Scott: Yeah.

1077
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:00,550
Scott: So has you fucked up anything ever?

1078
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:05,730
Rym: I once choned an entire production system to be owned by Apache.

1079
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,210
Scott: I meant as the boss, have you, when you overruled, have you fucked it up?

1080
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:12,590
Rym: I have not yet, but I have not worked at this new company that long.

1081
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,993
Scott: All right.

1082
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:14,630
Scott: But you know about the technologies?

1083
01:01:14,892 --> 01:01:15,168
Scott: Yeah.

1084
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,110
Scott: The people that were your boss before, did they know about the technologies?

1085
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,418
Scott: They did.

1086
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:19,223
Scott: Did they?

1087
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:19,810
Scott: They did.

1088
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:20,427
Scott: As much as you?

1089
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:22,590
Rym: Depends on what realms.

1090
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,709
Scott: See, here's the thing, right?

1091
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:30,930
Scott: I noticed this, this is sort of getting off topic, but I've noticed when I look at companies these days, I can sort of tell the good and the bad company.

1092
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:31,213
Scott: Right.

1093
01:01:31,516 --> 01:01:32,729
Scott: Look at the company like HP.

1094
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:33,807
Scott: Who's in charge of HP?

1095
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:35,169
Scott: Just business people.

1096
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,770
Scott: They don't know shit about computers, technology or anything like that.

1097
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:38,133
Scott: Right.

1098
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:39,750
Scott: But look at Marriott Hotel.

1099
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:43,950
Scott: The guy just died recently, which is kind of sad because he's actually a pretty cool guy.

1100
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:48,610
Scott: The Marriott Hotel guy was like the master of hotels.

1101
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:52,870
Scott: Like dude would figure out how to fold the sheets faster and shit like that.

1102
01:01:53,111 --> 01:01:54,986
Scott: You know, like he knew about hotels.

1103
01:01:56,151 --> 01:02:01,510
Scott: And when you have bosses that actually know about the work that's being done, that's when the good shit happens.

1104
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,810
Scott: You know, Steve Jobs actually knew about computers and things.

1105
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:07,470
Scott: That's why they were successful.

1106
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,750
Scott: It's when the companies are run by business people who only know about monies and managing.

1107
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,430
Rym: But at the same time.

1108
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,367
Scott: When you get shit fucked up.

1109
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:20,010
Rym: You have that layer of middle management or management or executives that are pure technologists, but who don't have other skills.

1110
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,230
Rym: Well, obviously, well, obviously.

1111
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:33,950
Scott: But I do believe that anyone who just has normal social skills and intelligence and also, you know, the skills of whatever the job is can become the boss and they can learn to be the boss.

1112
01:02:34,311 --> 01:02:34,512
Rym: Yeah.

1113
01:02:34,552 --> 01:02:37,849
Scott: Couldn't if you were already a boss and that was all you could do.

1114
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:41,370
Scott: You could shit on Deborah's desk, but you couldn't know about it.

1115
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,930
Rym: What is one of the most common complaints about people who become senior technologists or developers?

1116
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:49,250
Rym: They get pushed toward being the boss and they don't want to be the boss.

1117
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,510
Scott: Well, then don't make that guy the boss.

1118
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:58,790
Rym: I'm sure there's a guy who wouldn't mind being the boss, but also I think there is a huge shortage of people who want to be the boss and are technologically skilled.

1119
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:03,150
Scott: Perhaps there's a but there's a shortage of people where technology is skilled, period.

1120
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,173
Scott: Yes.

1121
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:08,450
Scott: But so I'm saying that it doesn't have to be technology in a shoe factory.

1122
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,409
Scott: The boss should know something about shoes.

1123
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:10,650
Scott: Yeah.

1124
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:21,630
Rym: And I'm saying that in general, there's a shortage of people who know about underlying whatevers, not even just technology, who also want to be a boss and have the basic skills to be a boss.

1125
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:22,811
Scott: Yeah.

1126
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:32,390
Scott: But that doesn't mean, you know, but maybe have, you know, just keeping the current boss, whoever it may be, is better than putting in a bad boss who's only a boss and doesn't know about the thing.

1127
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:42,150
Scott: Or at the very least, right, if you're going to bring in someone who's just a boss or someone who went to business school as a manager, make them learn the thing.

1128
01:03:42,411 --> 01:03:46,430
Scott: A lot of times you put that person in without even at least try.

1129
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:51,410
Scott: I mean, they're not going to become a programmer or a shoemaker or a cobbler, whatever it is that the company does.

1130
01:03:51,711 --> 01:03:52,579
Scott: Maybe make towels.

1131
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,849
Scott: They're not going to become a weaver.

1132
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:54,611
Scott: Right.

1133
01:03:54,892 --> 01:04:00,850
Scott: But at least make them learn about weaving as much as they can before making them the boss of the textile mill.

1134
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:02,649
Scott: You know, at least try.

1135
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,951
Rym: Yeah.

1136
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:05,990
Scott: Well, a lot of times you put these people in there who don't know about the thing.

1137
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,450
Rym: They went to like they got a communications degree and an MBA and now they're middle.

1138
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:09,631
Rym: Yeah.

1139
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:10,890
Scott: They're just a professional boss.

1140
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,030
Scott: They don't know about the thing you do and they don't care and they're not even going to try to learn it.

1141
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,929
Scott: They just say, get it done.

1142
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:30,670
Rym: So I guess the final moral professional advice I have, having been in all the different levels of this personally, is that you use you come up with a process that works to get whatever it is you're trying to do done.

1143
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:46,750
Rym: And the moment you start to say things like, let's implement, you know, X methodology, you know, if you can explain to another human being specifically what you think will be better after you implement it and why.

1144
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:47,671
Rym: Go for it.

1145
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:55,330
Rym: If your explanation is it'll make our process better, you're committing logical fallacies and you're not going anywhere.

1146
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:55,852
Scott: Yeah.

1147
01:04:55,912 --> 01:05:00,770
Rym: And you know what about your process is going to get better and why and how it's going to make it better.

1148
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:05,710
Scott: You know, you've got to actually also get the people do it, but like aspects of scrum work really well.

1149
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:10,870
Rym: The idea of having periodic short meetings that are time constrained, where you get out.

1150
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:11,938
Rym: What did I do?

1151
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,010
Rym: What am I doing next?

1152
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,196
Rym: What is in my way?

1153
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:16,330
Rym: That concept is fantastic.

1154
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:17,645
Scott: It's an OK concept.

1155
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:17,889
Scott: Yeah.

1156
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:22,949
Scott: But maybe that, you know, you don't need to make sure everyone knows that everyone else is working on all the time.

1157
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,470
Scott: You're all on the same page, but it doesn't take up too much time out of the day.

1158
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,130
Scott: I mean, it's a common sense kind of thing, you know.

1159
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:33,570
Scott: But it's like, you know, have we done a huge study as to, you know, as opposed to what?

1160
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:39,110
Rym: Maybe you can come up with a better idea when you start worrying about who the pigs are and like actually using the jargon fully.

1161
01:05:40,231 --> 01:05:43,229
Rym: Unless you can articulate how that helps you, then you shouldn't be doing it.

1162
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,230
Rym: Now, you might be able to articulate it.

1163
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,470
Rym: And, you know, those things do work in certain situations.

1164
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:50,410
Rym: But it's kind of like to talk back about skiing.

1165
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,590
Rym: I was looking at skis a long time ago.

1166
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,655
Rym: I wanted to buy some skis.

1167
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,350
Rym: I went to the guy and I said, what's the difference between these two skis?

1168
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:57,529
Rym: One was like double the price.

1169
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,409
Rym: And he was like, that one's blue.

1170
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:02,030
Rym: And I was like, no, really, what's the difference?

1171
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,789
Rym: And he was like, see this thing here?

1172
01:06:04,051 --> 01:06:04,495
Rym: I'm like, yeah.

1173
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:06,010
Rym: He's like, it'll reduce shutter.

1174
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:07,309
Rym: And I'm like, what does that mean?

1175
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,209
Rym: And he said, if you can explain to me what it means, then you should buy that ski.

1176
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,027
Rym: Otherwise, you should buy the cheaper one.

1177
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,033
Rym: And you know what?

1178
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:18,450
Rym: That was the best advice I ever got for pretty much anything I've ever done.

1179
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:19,429
Scott: That guy's a bad salesman.

1180
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,109
Scott: He should have said the more expensive one is clearly superior.

1181
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,600
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1182
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:36,720
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1183
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,120
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

1184
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,040
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1185
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,800
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1186
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,316
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1187
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,600
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1188
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,740
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
