Scott: So in the United States where we stupidly move our clocks around we have smartly moved them back.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,296
Scott: Yep, do the correct position.

8
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:32,090
Rym: There is the incorrect time, which is what people use for most of American history.

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,509
Rym: There is the superior time that we move to only in the summer.

10
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,156
Scott: Anyway, we are back in the correct time.

11
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:40,339
Scott: The Sun is out.

00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,805

Rym: Yep, I'm gonna do that this weekend.

25
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:10,419
Rym: Probably.

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,377
Rym: I think it is gonna get cold again, but it is Freakishly warm for this time of year.

27
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:19,153
Scott: It is nice and warm, but even worse We're not warming up.

28
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:28,347
Rym: Emily and I were planning on doing a few week vacation in Japan, but due to the coronavirus thing I'm basically forbidden by my job from traveling overseas for the foreseeable future.

29
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:31,448
Scott: Good thing I didn't buy tickets cuz we almost also went.

30
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,662
Rym: Yep I got free refunds from every airline like everything was a free refund.

31
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:35,625
Rym: No, that was fine.

32
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:40,890
Rym: I'm out nothing though this is definitely a like rich man problem.

33
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:50,205
Rym: but I bought plane tickets on Air China and Then I had to cancel them for obvious reasons because I was gonna fly through Beijing and like poke around in Beijing and then go on to Tokyo.

34
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:56,062
Rym: so I Wanted to cancel those but they were non-refundable tickets and with their China.

35
00:01:56,123 --> 00:02:00,181
Rym: non-refundable doesn't mean like oh pay a thousand bucks and you Can like get the rest of your money back.

36
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:03,060
Rym: it is fuck you Zero dollars back.

37
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:03,605
Rym: That's right.

38
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,821
Rym: So Thankfully, the Chinese government was like yeah free refunds because there's a problem.

39
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:12,310
Rym: Mmm, but I don't get that refund for six to eight weeks.

40
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:13,293
Rym: I am.

41
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:21,450
Rym: I have to wait it up to seven almost almost seven more weeks to get Several thousand dollars back that are just sitting on my credit card.

42
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:32,030
Rym: So I booked flights on jail instead Not having gotten the refund back and then because the work stuff bad to cancel jail.

43
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:36,970
Rym: They also gave me a full refund, but we'll also not refund my money for several weeks.

44
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,407
Scott: You know if you had done the bought the cheap ticket that I saw.

45
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:44,081
Scott: the cheapest ticket I saw was fly to Montreal then take Air Canada.

46
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,610
Rym: Yeah, I don't think I could have gotten that one canceled for free.

47
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:52,410
Scott: I think you could have gotten the leg from Montreal to Japan canceled which would have then caused everything else to cancel.

48
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,822
Scott: Yeah, but you could have had a vacation in Montreal.

49
00:02:55,324 --> 00:03:00,070
Rym: Ah, yeah, but not too bad I only want to go to Montreal if I'm gonna ski, I'm gonna go to Treblanc.

50
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,545
Scott: I only want to go Montreal if I'm gonna eat poutine.

51
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,590
Scott: second best bagels.

52
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:06,616
Rym: You want to go to Montreal?

53
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,362
Rym: Just take the sleeper car on.

54
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,330
Rym: Amtrak took to over like all the way up there.

55
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,720
Scott: Oh, no, there are buzzes that go there too.

56
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:16,123
Rym: Yeah, there are or There is an airline that flies out of.

57
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:20,581
Rym: it only flies out of Newark here But it goes straight to the mountain up there for skiing.

58
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:21,947
Scott: Yeah, I don't need to go to skiing.

59
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:28,230
Scott: I want to go to Hockey and the second best bagel after the New York bagel and other food.

60
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:31,310
Rym: But because I wanted to I had to cancel this thing.

61
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:35,190
Rym: So I have a lot of vacation days like extra this year now that I hadn't planned on having.

62
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,062
Rym: So I thought oh, I'll do like some other thing.

63
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:41,564
Rym: Maybe I'll do a bunch of skiing Maybe I'll go out to like Colorado and ski for a long weekend or something.

64
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,910
Rym: Like I got all this for vacation time.

65
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:47,290
Rym: No, skiing is basically fucked everywhere right now except of all places.

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,190
Rym: Japan which is having like one of the best March ski seasons in Japanese history right now.

67
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:57,281
Scott: Sure, this skiing somewhere like some some alp or some Andes.

Rym: for the time being.

72
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,737
Scott: I'm sure there's like probably, you know, it's really great.

73
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:11,650

74
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,273

75
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,447
Scott: I don't know what the weather situation is right now on New Hampshire.

76
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:21,890
Scott: No good See degrees at Hunter Mountain, I think we've talked about in GeekNights before about how Iran has amazing skiing.

77
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:26,029
Scott: Yeah, I would love to go skiing in Iran, but I don't know if you can I could go.

78
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:29,816
Scott: No, I'm saying I don't know if The weather is good right now.

79
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,182
Rym: Well also coronavirus right now.

80
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,730
Scott: So is the coronavirus in Iran?

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,839
Rym: Yeah, it's actually a huge problem in Iran.

82
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,105
Rym: a bunch of government officials got it.

83
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,190
Rym: It's a. it's a crisis?

84
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:37,799
Scott: I don't know.

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,205
Scott: It was there.

86
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,240
Scott: Okay, I thought I didn't.

87
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,728
Scott: that's not a place that I'd heard of it being.

88
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:48,136
Rym: uh That was all over the news Like be all over the news.

89
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:52,550
Scott: Anyway, it wasn't like examining the list of countries that are most troubled very closely up.

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,479
Rym: So now I'm relegated to.

91
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,890
Rym: I think I'm gonna use some of those vacation days to go to Cedar Point this summer.

92
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,196
Scott: That's a big downgrade.

93
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:07,474
Rym: Well, I haven't been to Cedar Point at this point in 19 years and I miss it.

94
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,650
Rym: cuz I you know, I've talked about the GeekNights.

95
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:15,288
Rym: I'm like a weirdly obsessive rollercoaster nerd, but I haven't really ridden rollercoasters much in a long time.

96
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:20,213
Rym: Mm-hmm So and you actually have to book like for this summer Around.

97
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:27,161
Rym: now is when you have to book if you want to get like the skip the line passes or stay in the fancy ancient Hotel from the 1800s like all the good stuff.

98
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,170
Rym: So I think I'm just gonna plan that trip instead.

99
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,974
Rym: You wanna go to Cedar Point?

100
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,406
Rym: No, no best rollercoaster park in the world.

101
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:32,727
Rym: Yeah.

102
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:33,210
Scott: No, I'm good.

103
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,979
Rym: All right, you'll miss out on good rollercoasters.

104
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,926
Rym: Oh, no, I think it'll be me Emily and chase.

105
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:38,910
Scott: Okay, have fun.

106
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,235
Scott: Well, I'll do something much more interesting.

107
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:45,994
Rym: I will ride the Millennium Force which is to this day Barely disputed.

108
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:51,598
Rym: like very few people dispute this the best rollercoaster ever crafted Newer than that.

109
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:58,259
Rym: Yeah, and to this day It still tends to rank one or two by the roller coaster Association And I forget the name of that other group that fights with them all the time.

110
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,450
Rym: Okay, it is a triumph for roller coaster design.

111
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,370
Scott: So let's talk about other stuff.

112
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:09,010
Rym: This news is not actually that big a deal, but we got to talk about it because it's Reggie, right?

113
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,850
Scott: So people I think don't understand how not big a deal this is.

114
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,790
Scott: So if you don't know a GameStop for a few years now has been going down.

115
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:21,000
Rym: It stops that store that kids sell the games They stole from their friends to get cash to buy loot boxes on.

116
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,290
Scott: the GameStop has been going down the Turlet for quite a few Years, it's every a con shop as every console adds an online e-shop of some kind.

117
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:31,778
Scott: Right GameStop isn't going down the toilet.

118
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,620
Scott: Everyone knows it.

119
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,590
Scott: It's just taking a really long time to die swirling.

120
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,798
Rym: It's been swirling for a long time.

121
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,790
Scott: So a latest development in GameStops, you know.

122
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,596
Scott: They've had some big layoffs recently.

123
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,359
Scott: that you know, they've been.

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,510
Scott: it's been a more rapid increase in the swirl speed.

125
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:59,404
Scott: So the news is they appointed Reggie Fils-Aime to you know, formerly Nintendo of America, you know bought president Yeah to be on the board not the CEO of GameStop.

126
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,250
Scott: to be on the board of GameStop.

127
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,196
Scott: 10 members.

128
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:03,738
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:06,185
Scott: So first of all a company dying like that.

130
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,630
Scott: Why does it need 10 people on the board?

131
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,210
Scott: There must be some regulation that says it has to be 10 or something.

132
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,393
Rym: No, it will it.

133
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:16,288
Rym: I mean board structures can vary widely and I have never been on a board.

134
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,010
Rym: That was big.

135
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:18,586
Scott: Yeah, no 10 is weird.

136
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:27,002
Scott: Anyway Regardless people have to understand that when you're on a board of directors for company You are simply a representative of shareholder interest.

137
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:35,689
Scott: right and you really you know You vote on some things and like dividends what they're gonna be and who's the CEO gonna be?

138
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,638
Scott: But you don't really run the company.

139
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,985
Scott: You're not an employee.

140
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:43,810
Scott: Yeah, right You're not like, you know, you're not calling any shots, you know directly.

141
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:52,180
Rym: so the really good example and when I worked at my like a company previously the The CEO was also on the board.

142
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:52,842
Scott: Sure.

143
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:53,464
Scott: That's possible.

144
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,270
Rym: the CTO happened to also be on the board.

145
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,055
Rym: There are some other people on the board But the board.

146
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:05,750
Rym: if the board officially got involved in my biz then shit was going down Normally just like the CEO would get involved in my biz, right?

147
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,539
Scott: Yeah, the day-to-day operations you basically ignore.

148
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,301
Scott: do not care.

149
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,485
Scott: Do not say do not look.

150
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,970
Scott: Yeah, right you're on the board.

151
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:12,973
Scott: So why is?

152
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,683
Scott: why would the investors in GameStop right?

153
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,774
Scott: So first of all, if you're an investor in GameStop What is wrong with you?

154
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,560
Scott: Well, it's clearly.

155
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,310
Scott: if everyone has seen this toilet swirling going on, right?

156
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,317
Scott: So you're either a a really dumbass investor.

157
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:25,979
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,785
Scott: Yeah, you believe in the future of GameStop.

159
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:33,496
Scott: We're not giving investment advice saying Yeah, sure or be.

160
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:41,215
Scott: obviously if you're in if you own enough shares of GameStop now you bought them low Right you bottom low.

161
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,567
Scott: you were like, well, look at that swirl swirl swirl swirls going down.

162
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,250
Scott: It's going down.

163
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,476
Scott: Let me buy it.

164
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:49,470
Scott: Hope it goes up a little bit and then sell it, right?

165
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,433
Scott: You're not hoping to.

166
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,055
Scott: actually you're not.

167
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:54,366
Scott: you're thinking GameStop will actually revive fully.

168
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,490
Scott: That's a big gamble.

169
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:58,331
Scott: You got money to buy some 14%.

170
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:01,400
Scott: Sure, that's exactly why I'm mentioning.

171
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,549
Rym: Yeah, why did you're like one day five day?

172
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:16,970
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah Exactly the point is why would the people who are still holding shares of GameStop?

173
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,882
Scott: Why would they vote to put Reggie on the board?

174
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:30,390
Rym: Well, they might be doing some sort of consolidation liquidation plan They might be doing some sort of bankruptcy plan like we don't know but that that is somebody who can inspire confidence.

175
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:39,966
Scott: No So when other people are reading the finance news and they see in the news Reggie and it's like oh, that's a name I know that's a person who is very good at what they did.

176
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:50,440
Scott: positive Social media sentiment will short a bunch of bots for Nintendo, right and people will say oh Maybe Reggie is gonna have some positive influence.

177
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,650
Scott: and maybe not, you know bring GameStop back to life.

178
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,370
Scott: But at least slow that slow that tumble maybe and that might inspire some people to buy some share.

179
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,250
Scott: Not that you know other things influenced it got away.

180
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:05,709
Scott: But like the whole market crashing like I just got a big don't weren't for that?

181
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:15,762
Scott: Right, you know that might have boosted the shares a little bit giving those investors who just voted for Reggie a chance to sell Those people who are now buying because of Reggie.

182
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,910
Rym: now, he might have some good ideas as a good plans.

183
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:28,117
Rym: But remember he is one member of a large board and the two other feet like two other people that are joining at the same time as him are some like Walmart Cadbury Pepsi Nabisco

184
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:32,167
Scott: guy retail people for a retail business and you make sense PetSmart

185
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:34,357
Rym: Sam's Club Another resource

186
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,290
Scott: retail people for a retail business.

187
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,396
Scott: Yeah.

188
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:44,259
Scott: So people who have knowledge relevant to what GameStop does retail people video games people Appointed to the board to inspire confidence.

189
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:55,377
Scott: They don't actually do much work or have that much influence over what's going on but just hopefully to get the shares a little boost so that the shareholders can sell to someone else and get the hell out because That ship going down under

190
00:10:55,638 --> 00:11:03,724
Rym: I mean that ship was swirling and I feel like Coronavirus like retail slowdown is gonna be the poop knife in the gut.

191
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:04,326
Scott: Yeah.

192
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:07,260
Scott: I mean if anyone you know It's you know, do you know about the poop knife?

193
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,146
Rym: Is that a reference?

194
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:08,850
Rym: That is just too old.

195
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,789
Rym: You don't know about the poop not know about knife to the gut.

196
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,081
Rym: There it's an old.

197
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,446
Scott: you poop on a knife and then staff.

198
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,977
Rym: so it's not quite a meme But it's really all I'm gonna say about the poop knife.

199
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:29,170
Rym: is there was an individual who asked the internet a question about a poop Knife and most of the people who responded said the fuck is a poop knife which turned into a. what do you mean?

200
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,797
Rym: I thought every family had a poop knife.

201
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,630
Rym: There are poop knife families and non poop knife families.

202
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:37,336
Scott: Their poop Kinda so that it flushes more easily.

203
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,123
Rym: Some people keep a ruler in the toilet.

204
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:39,886
Scott: I've seen yeah.

205
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:41,533
Scott: Yeah I thought this.

206
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:45,168
Scott: I thought this was cover a knife in poop and then stab someone with it.

207
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,342
Scott: that way They'll be really fucked up.

208
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:53,422
Rym: That is big Bart with the shrimp on the end of the peanut.

209
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:54,286
Rym: was the shrimp or the peanut.

210
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,130
Rym: I think he's allergic to it.

211
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,414
Scott: I'm just.

212
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:59,888
Scott: I'm just saying like, you know If the stab doesn't get him poop will.

213
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,024
Scott: yeah If you get poop like a pussy stick if you get poop into someone's guts, they're in deep shit deep.

214
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,010
Scott: Yo, they're gonna be very ill.

215
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,783
Rym: They're in perhaps shit, right?

216
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,933
Scott: It's like haha.

217
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:18,280
Scott: Not only will I stab you and you'll have blood coming out, but you will also be infected By all kinds of things.

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,164
Scott: Good luck with that.

219
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:19,787
Rym: Good luck.

220
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:20,309
Rym: Have fun.

221
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:23,930
Rym: So yeah, don't like GameStop is just done.

222
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,828
Scott: Yeah, and if you still shop at GameStop ever for any reason why stop?

223
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:33,001
Rym: I still know why the people who shop at GameStop are one.

224
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:35,630
Scott: You're better off going to just like Target.

225
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,130
Rym: Target, well people don't know shopping GameStop.

226
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,121
Rym: They go to GameStop to pawn and sell old games.

227
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,625
Scott: sell on Amazon or eBay.

228
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,450
Rym: These are people are too young to do that legally.

229
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:48,817
Scott: See your school kids.

230
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:51,770
Scott: see your friend trade a game with your friend like I don't know.

231
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,430
Scott: I have a physical game in the first place.

232
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,706
Rym: I almost want to go into a GameStop with with like just like interview people.

233
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,709
Rym: They're like, what do you care for?

234
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,861
Rym: Why did you come into this store?

235
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,750
Rym: I Feel like that'll end with me being kicked out of a GameStop.

236
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,066
Scott: You could buy the GameStop really cheap and then do that.

237
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,036
Scott: No I'm sure I could do.

238
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,823
Rym: I could stand outside the game.

239
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:11,550
Scott: They would love to sell you their franchise license.

240
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:16,250
Rym: I'll just stand outside a GameStop in Manhattan and just be like, why are you going in those doors?

241
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,893
Rym: Just curious.

242
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:19,369
Rym: or when people come out be like, what did you do in there?

243
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,130
Rym: It's not like a funko land where it's just free babysitting.

244
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:26,204
Rym: Anyway, so some other news there are.

245
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:31,508
Rym: there's some good kickstarters going on But the one I want to talk about first Pax Pamir got a second edition.

246
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,030
Rym: Pax Pamir.

247
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,330
Rym: I have not actually played it, but I have read the rules as Scott has played it.

248
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,257
Scott: So there's a bunch of games called Pax games.

249
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:39,401
Scott: They're all Pax something.

250
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,010
Rym: They're cold where the games some of them are not all of them.

251
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:48,856
Scott: But yeah, this Pax Porphyriana, which I played one My favorite one is actually Pax Renaissance But I have not actually played that.

252
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:55,188
Rym: like three or four time X Renaissance is the most approachable Pax game But Pax Pamir might be the best one, but I haven't played it.

253
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:59,890
Rym: But I've read the rules and I've listened to you and Chris talk about it.

254
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:08,490
Scott: Yeah, but basically these are like, you know Historical simulated kind of ish games but not in the way of a grognard war game in a different way.

255
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,664
Scott: It's kind of hard to explain how they work.

256
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:19,658
Scott: Well, yeah In talking wise but regardless they made Pax Pamir 2.0 Which it also.

257
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,707
Scott: they have nothing to do with the past invention whatsoever.

258
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:26,098
Scott: Yeah And Pax Pamir 1 had some issues.

259
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,690
Scott: Pax Pamir 2.0 really streamlined it and made it really sexy.

260
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:33,305
Scott: this is a reprint of Pax Pamir 2.0 because it sold out.

261
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,916
Scott: and So I played Pax Pamir 2.0 First edition first printing.

262
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,890
Scott: I liked it and I'm like, well, you know, I'll own one Pax game.

263
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,277
Scott: I'll let this be the one.

264
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:43,538
Rym: Yep.

265
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:44,743
Scott: So I pre-ordered it.

266
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:45,949
Scott: I mean I kick-started it.

267
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:50,588
Rym: I am waiting to see if there is a Pax Renaissance 2 in which case that'll be the one I get.

268
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:51,533
Scott: Yeah I like.

269
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,337
Scott: that's the one I like.

270
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,570
Rym: Yeah, I want you could use some streamlining.

271
00:14:54,931 --> 00:15:01,830
Rym: It's only the most accessible because I feel like the average nerd knows a little more about the Renaissance than they do about Afghanistan.

272
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:06,030
Rym: Yeah, which says a lot about our culture, but that is mechanically.

273
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:11,090
Scott: Pax Pamir 2 and Pax Pamir and Renaissance are pretty similar.

274
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,536
Scott: Mechanical complexity.

275
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:16,367
Scott: Those are the two that I can actually grok the mechanics of the game.

276
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:22,544
Scott: Yep For And the other I didn't play trans humanity I've now played.

277
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,750
Scott: I did play trans humanity.

278
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,278
Scott: I couldn't understand what the fuck was going on.

279
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:29,517
Rym: I sat down next to a game of trans humanity and Actions were being explained.

280
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:30,721
Scott: trans humanity has the theme.

281
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:31,343
Scott: I like the most.

282
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:33,070
Scott: I couldn't understand what the fuck was going on.

283
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,640
Scott: Yeah, and for furiana the theme I like the least.

284
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,786
Scott: the graphic designer like the least.

285
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:44,448
Scott: I only half understood It was going on but Renaissance and Pamir I 90% understood what was going on.

286
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,975
Rym: Yep So Pax Pamir.

287
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,690
Rym: the second edition is getting a Kickstarter for a reprints.

288
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:59,564
Scott: Yes This is your chance and if you have the first printing of the second edition you can order modified chippies for one component of the game or something.

289
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:08,327
Rym: one thing I do if This sounds at all intriguing I suggest you just back this Kickstarter because these are the kinds of games that get Semi out of print and hard to get pretty quick.

290
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:12,789
Scott: Yep I mean, there's a reason they haven't a kickstart a second printing because the first one was gone and that was it.

291
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:21,521
Rym: I also want to note this game takes between one and five players and Games that have a one as an option.

292
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,969
Rym: that is an official option Even though I tend not to like those ones.

293
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,329
Rym: Often they tend to be really good in engaging games.

294
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:45,655
Scott: Yeah but I mean just to just to sum it up thematically what the game is about is this Afghan warlords fighting and You want to have like, you know control or like influence with the warlords that are dominant at certain times Points and I mean like pecs.

295
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:55,070
Rym: Renaissance is you're just bankers during the Renaissance and you just want to be positioned Right to be able to take advantage of the full-on Renaissance.

296
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,705
Scott: So it's like I played one game and I basically won.

297
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:02,102
Scott: but it's like, you know It's like they'll be different colors competing for your dominance and it's like you want to be.

298
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:02,744
Scott: you can.

299
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,369
Scott: your alignments might change.

300
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:05,935
Scott: You just want to be Allah.

301
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:09,210
Scott: if blue is strong you want to be allied with blue at the scoring time?

302
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:10,787
Scott: And that's how that game works.

303
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:17,190
Scott: anyway Another Kickstarter for some board games going on right now is a company called big cat games if you haven't heard of it.

304
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:22,204
Scott: It is a small video board game publisher and they do a good work so far.

305
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:30,270
Scott: They publish very tiny Mostly Japanese board games in the United States or in English, maybe in other places besides the United States.

306
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:38,902
Scott: They're the ones who publish Nikosu dice in English the hottest game from PAX unplugged 2019 still the hottest game of the year for us, uh, maybe I don't know.

307
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,250
Rym: last year's the hottest game of 2019 for me for sure.

308
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:44,540
Scott: Yeah, anyway So they've got you know, go to their website.

309
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,190
Scott: They're publishing a lot of other cool games.

310
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,105
Scott: There's one that's like Pacific go which is I'm pretty into that.

311
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,130
Rym: Oh, it's almost sold out.

312
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,772
Rym: I think I should buy.

313
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:57,244
Scott: it's like an abstraction of you know, Pacific front World War two with naval battles and There's only three left about it right now.

314
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,236
Scott: Okay I don't know if that's any good.

315
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:03,049
Rym: Let me move my credit card information off of the stream.

316
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,570
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if that game is any good or not, but they have a key only three left.

317
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,971
Scott: I'm getting it.

318
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:10,925
Scott: They have a Kickstarter right now for a for an abstract trio.

319
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:13,793
Scott: So three abstract Japanese board games.

320
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:19,810
Scott: one of them is called quiek, which I guess is the onomatopoeia of the mouse squeaking noise.

321
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:23,512
Scott: yeah, right and It's.

322
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:27,726
Rym: it's the move the thing to the end as far as the kids the video game ice puzzle.

323
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:32,910
Scott: where you're on ice you move In a direction you move that as far as you can until you hit a wall and so you hit the cheese.

324
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,248
Scott: Right kind of thing.

325
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:49,482
Scott: There's another one which is basically put 3d blocks onto the grid And when you look down on top of the game board from you know vertically straight down Which of the two colors is covering the most spaces and then yours.

326
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,127
Scott: you want yours to cover the most you win.

327
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,903
Scott: and the third One is the one act you can actually pick.

328
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:54,790
Scott: you don't have to buy all three.

329
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,650
Scott: You can kick start one of the three or two or three or all three.

330
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:05,902
Scott: The only one I kick-started was fillet which is basically sort of like a versus Splatoon board game where you take turns moving your pawn

331
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:08,031
Rym: with some wits Marrakesh adjacent Yeah,

332
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:16,750
Scott: and your pawn shits out chips and you want to cover the whole board in your chips and cover your opponent's chips and sort Of, you know conquering the board kind of situation.

333
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:19,281
Scott: So that one, you know for big.

334
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:21,270
Scott: the rules for all three games are already up there.

335
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,749
Scott: You can just read them in English completely.

336
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:28,330
Scott: You're basically just deciding if you like those rules enough that you want to own that game and play it frequently.

337
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:35,570
Scott: And I think that fillet game would be played frequently enough to be worth the cost of buying it Just revving setting the rule and it's tiny.

338
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:40,886
Rym: It feels like it'll be hive adjacent for us in terms of like exactly when I would play it.

339
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,612
Rym: why I would play it Exactly.

340
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:44,178
Rym: I wish play hives been a while.

341
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:44,660
Scott: Yeah.

342
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:47,170
Rym: Do you remember the the beetle opening?

343
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,929
Scott: I mean, yes, of course, I remember the below but that was your go-to move.

344
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,597
Scott: Well, what I would do when I played hive is I would do the beetle opening until the opponent figured out how to not lose To the beetle opening.

345
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,090
Scott: Yeah, and then we would play real.

346
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,702
Rym: That's that's a lot how my progression when I was in a.

347
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,650
Scott: I'd be like if I play hive with a brand new person.

348
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,019
Scott: I teach them hive with no expansion bugs.

349
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,130
Scott: Yep, right then I just like I tell them I'm gonna listen.

350
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,930
Scott: We're gonna play a bunch of practice games in every single game.

351
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,523
Scott: I'm gonna do the beetle strategy as soon as you don't lose to the beetle strategy.

352
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,348
Scott: We're gonna play pride for real.

353
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:20,745
Rym: now You are ready.

354
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:25,845
Scott: now Challenge the master and then you teach him how to use the mosquito and then whatever.

355
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:26,629
Scott: Yeah ladybug.

356
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,682
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so, uh.

357
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:32,023
Rym: and last as you know I play a lot of overwatch and I did a live stream.

358
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:33,210
Rym: all I did.

359
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,039
Rym: I I like to do all my ranking matches solo.

360
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,568
Rym: just rando Q solo like fuck it.

361
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:39,190
Rym: See what happens.

362
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,872
Scott: I guess it's maybe more accurate on average if there's enough Matches.

363
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:49,976
Scott: because I guess if I played if you play with the team and you try to get your ranking matches the coordination Artificially inflate your rank.

364
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:50,619
Rym: but thank you.

365
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,810
Rym: So you realize that what the game does is tough call.

366
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,501
Rym: No, so the way the game doesn't know if you're doing it.

367
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:55,923
Scott: Yes.

368
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,068
Scott: So here's just so.

369
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:57,650
Rym: here's the way the game.

370
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,956
Rym: Here's the way overwatch works.

371
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,946
Rym: This is actually really fascinating.

372
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:03,238
Rym: We haven't talked about in the show You don't play so you wouldn't know this.

373
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:11,666
Rym: if I join a game rando It'll it'll put it'll make a team of six with me in it I'll make another team of six and we'll fight six on six.

374
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:13,674
Scott: right if Two?

375
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:20,326
Rym: if there's two groups of five out there It'll pull them in to face each other and fill in the ones with two randos No.

376
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,089
Rym: or it'll make the teams of like two groups three groups of two.

377
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:27,407
Rym: It'll try to make sure that if one team has a big group the other team also has a big group.

378
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,840
Scott: if one team's a Bunch of randos would never put a six against like two threes.

379
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:35,595
Rym: only if it has to try to avoid There's enough players you would never have to.

380
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:43,820
Rym: uh, well because it all it does this within the ranking bands and the elo adjacent stuff And also I assume there's also a time constraint.

381
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,910
Scott: You don't want to leave someone waiting for a game for five minutes.

382
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:55,190
Rym: yep, but if you're skilled enough like depending on where you are in the ranking like Sometimes it'll take a while to find a match because it's not gonna ruin a match or ruin things.

383
00:21:55,511 --> 00:22:03,883
Rym: It also does the elo type thing where if you if your team is rated lower than the team you're up against and you beat Them they're fucked and you rank up a lot.

384
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:05,509
Rym: Yeah, like it does everything, right?

385
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:13,229
Rym: yeah, so one of the problems with a game like this or one of the but also one of the Benefits of it is that unlike say League of Legends with what?

386
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:19,156
Rym: 4,000 heroes or whatever and all that nonsense Overwatch has got like 31 heroes.

387
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,521
Rym: They're all radically different.

388
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,170
Scott: It's about as many as like super Street Fighter something like that.

389
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,990
Rym: It's something it's like a good number and I like that.

390
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,781
Rym: They're not just like adding a ton more.

391
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:28,270
Rym: they're keep like every time they add one.

392
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,039
Rym: It fills a very specific unique part of the game.

393
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,230
Rym: Like there's no heroes are similar to each other in any meaningful way.

394
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:38,599
Rym: so The problem is because it's a competitive game.

395
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,284
Rym: there's gonna always be a meta.

396
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,310
Rym: you make torb a little bit stronger.

397
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,718
Rym: Everyone uses torb in every competitive game.

398
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,303
Rym: You make torb a little weaker.

399
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:47,507
Rym: torb gets used 0% of the time.

400
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,179
Rym: There's a character who's good on one map.

401
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,546
Rym: They're always used in that map.

402
00:22:52,089 --> 00:23:03,087
Rym: So over the people who design overwatch one thing they've been very good about is being willing to change the game to continue to make it interesting and to make sure like if there's a problem whatever.

403
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:07,050
Rym: the most common problem with The game is they try to fix it and they just always move on to the next most common.

404
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,960
Scott: They weren't willing to do that.

405
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:08,770
Scott: the game be dead already.

406
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:15,849
Rym: Yeah, and there's a reason why overwatch is actually it's been pretty it's been hanging on pretty well And the league's doing well and everything's going well there.

407
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:20,482
Rym: So what they've added now is the idea of hero pools and it's really simple.

408
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:23,349
Rym: They will take like four heroes every week.

409
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,838
Rym: So four out of thirty one thirty one so that leaves twenty seven twenty eight Yep, and they'll just remove that.

410
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:29,958
Rym: like.

411
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:34,297
Rym: you can't use them that week in competitive play just fuck you Oh, but you could in non-competitive.

412
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:35,784
Rym: Yeah, yeah non-competitive, you know, whatever you want.

413
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:36,206
Rym: They don't care.

414
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,590
Rym: Okay, like whatever There's some non-competitive modes.

415
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,521
Scott: They're like basically any of the competitive modes regardless of which competitive mode it is.

416
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:47,436
Scott: just randomly each week four heroes are not allowed Yep, like right now Orisa.

417
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,105
Scott: Those are low tier heroes that no one uses doesn't matter.

418
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:52,784
Scott: I think so can't be random It has to be manually.

419
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,155
Scott: Oh, yeah They'd have to choose.

420
00:23:54,195 --> 00:24:04,212
Rym: they seem to pick because they picked Orisa and may along with two other people in the current lockout and so they picking them better Removing the meta choices.

421
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:05,194
Rym: Yep, they're missing.

422
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:06,876
Rym: or they're or they're fucking with the meta.

423
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:16,150
Rym: like some there are some characters that like Snipers aren't always that viable especially in like silver gold because like people just aren't that good at clicking on heads.

424
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:17,796
Scott: Yeah, okay, but.

425
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:18,298
Rym: or.

426
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:25,190
Rym: and also they're vulnerable to flankers if you take the monkey out Suddenly in that air tier like it's a lot easier to be a sniper.

427
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:29,650
Scott: Okay, so they make others stronger that are still in by removing their counter play.

428
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,758
Rym: Okay, but the cool part is because they're gonna.

429
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:34,383
Scott: nobody's picking this hero ever.

430
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,550
Scott: it's tier one because this other hero exists.

431
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,119
Scott: Oh, we'll take that one out this week.

432
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,890
Scott: Oh shit this bottom to your hero.

433
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,285
Rym: So top tier and holy shit with Orisa not in the game.

434
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:45,108
Rym: There's one map.

435
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,095
Scott: Oh my god They banned scissors this week.

436
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:47,939
Scott: Everybody rock.

437
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:49,485
Rym: Yeah rock rock rock rock rock.

438
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:50,710
Rym: Orisa is real good at sucking.

439
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,619
Rym: I mean paper, but also the map.

440
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,024
Scott: Oh, no, there's got it wrong.

441
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:55,405
Scott: Oh my god.

442
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:56,970
Scott: They're only three choices and I got it wrong.

443
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:01,329
Rym: There's a lot of maps and the maps are all radically different but different maps have different metas, too.

444
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,750
Rym: All right, so the combination of the map meta and the player meta and the hero pools.

445
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:11,249
Rym: I've seen some really interesting games and the seasons only been going for two weeks.

446
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,195
Scott: point Is that they remove.

447
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:14,329
Scott: if they remove scissor do paper don't do rock.

448
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:19,828
Rym: Yeah, but what if you're on the map where there's a bunch of water and paper gets weaker now.

449
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:25,620
Rym: Oh, I Played diva competitively and everyone was like yeah divas real good on that map.

450
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:29,024
Rym: and that does not happen normally on that map because Orisa is so good.

451
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:44,024
Rym: So I urge all of you to play overwatch with me because I need to reform a team that is primarily US timezone because as much as I enjoy playing complete rando queue I want to go back to having a team and actually practicing with like a team.

452
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:45,570
Scott: join the New York Excelsior.

453
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,409
Rym: Yeah, I'm I am right now like upper silver low gold like I am NOT a platinum tier anymore.

454
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:52,509
Scott: axis.

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,258
Scott: You love this game so much just get better.

456
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,289
Rym: Yeah, but you gotta get good at the team to get that good.

457
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:57,015
Scott: Yeah Good.

458
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:58,170
Rym: Yeah, so I gotta find a team.

459
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,208
Rym: I'm looking for a team of like three at least that regularly instead of looking for a team.

460
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:03,730
Scott: Why don't you?

461
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,500
Scott: Join a team that is looking for people.

462
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:07,546
Rym: Yeah, I've poked around.

463
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,270
Rym: I'm thinking about that.

464
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:09,075
Rym: I'm making more.

465
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,209
Rym: I'm talking to a lot of people while I play games.

466
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,610
Rym: I've got some shortlist actually found some groups the scrim that I'm gonna start playing with.

467
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:19,764
Scott: Maybe you could find some like Enforcers, but overwatch is great.

468
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:20,910
Rym: I still don't know why Scott plays it.

469
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,965
Rym: It's basically action quake X weapons factory 2 with modern sensibilities.

470
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,430
Scott: I got another shit going like why?

471
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:28,913
Scott: Lot of shit.

472
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,479
Rym: I like Luigi's Mansion.

473
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,045
Scott: Yeah, I haven't played that in months.

474
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,020
Rym: Yeah, I got I got a beat it So we can review it.

475
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:34,588
Rym: But anyway.

476
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,240
Scott: so Things of the day.

477
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:49,043
Scott: I have a thing of the day So strong that Rym cannot possibly compete with this amazing thing of.

478
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:51,890
Rym: you have brought a terrible power to this podcast.

479
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:55,723
Scott: Yes, so there is a person I'm trying to find their name right now.

480
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:56,425
Scott: What is their name?

481
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:57,729
Rym: Ah art of envy?

482
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:01,905
Scott: Somewhere in their Twitter account.

483
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:02,430
Scott: regardless.

484
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:08,951
Scott: This person is a collector and usually I'm like meh Collectors.

485
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:21,683
Scott: right all these people collecting comic books or action figures or it's like, you know I understood the collecting mentality when I was a kid and then I realized wait a minute There's no point in wasting a bunch of money just to collect stuff.

486
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,593
Scott: You're just having stuff It's.

487
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:27,010
Scott: if it's not stuff that does anything it just wasting money in space.

488
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:36,398
Scott: It's not like, you know, if you're a museum that's a collection Yeah, but if you're just like a person collecting things you could buy at the store Yeah, it's kind of lame.

489
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,583
Rym: I mean I'm not gonna lie.

490
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:50,982
Rym: but uh, oh In 40 years give or take there are gonna be a lot of kids Trying to figure out what to do with grandma's Funko Pops the same way that Kids are trying to figure out what to do with grandma's precious moments pins.

491
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,910
Rym: people buying I'll go pops are just nerdy precious moments guys.

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,852
Scott: Yeah anyway so.

493
00:27:56,872 --> 00:28:04,823
Scott: but here is a person who recently came on to the Twitter scene with a Incredible and amazing collection the likes of which I have never seen.

00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:11,594
Scott: this person collects original Nintendo power Magazine artwork.

518
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:53,870
Scott: the artifacts of video game history that this person possesses are Truly incredible.

519
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:56,870
Scott: This is like, you know hard again.

520
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:58,809
Scott: It's gonna be hard to beat this thing of the day.

521
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,182
Scott: I can't rest of 2020 ahead of us.

522
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,523
Rym: So I had some good things of the day, but I had to respond to Scott's powers.

523
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:05,586
Rym: I could not respond.

524
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:06,470
Scott: I'm playing with power.

525
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:08,094
Scott: You can't know.

526
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,104
Scott: there's no company competing with this thing of the day.

527
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,190
Scott: It's so bad.

528
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:18,687
Rym: I feel like instead of linking to an individual thing of the day I also have to link to someone's entire profile to even have a chance.

529
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:19,390
Scott: You got no chance.

530
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:25,530
Rym: So I've been following this channel for a while, but in the last like three weeks, I've been watching the shit out of it.

531
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,236
Rym: It's called to set violin.

532
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,850
Rym: Okay, it's these two dudes who play violin professionally.

533
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:31,954
Rym: No good at it.

534
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,037
Scott: Like are they in?

535
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,061
Scott: like a symphony or something?

536
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,526
Rym: Yeah, like they're professional violinists.

537
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:55,910
Rym: All right, they Do this amazing YouTube channel that feels a lot like Asian television like the way it's structured Mm-hmm, and it's just them knowing like a lot about violins being awesome and doing stuff and it's so wholesome and So fun and so good and the content is so varied.

538
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,916
Rym: I cannot recommend this channel enough.

539
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:04,814
Rym: like some of the things they do instead of linking to one individual video is they pick a bunch Of new violin pieces.

540
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:07,923
Rym: They've never played before and just try to sight-read them all on a live stream.

541
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:22,813
Rym: Okay, they will watch a Popular and I'm making finger quotes right now videos of famous Violinists who actually kind of suck and people just don't know better like a famous violinist who performs on Jenny Fallon But isn't actually that good.

542
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:26,063
Rym: but people don't know better and they talk about that in detail.

543
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:32,165
Rym: They're just wholesome and funny and You I cannot recommend this channel enough.

544
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:35,638
Rym: Okay In the moment the GeekNights book club book.

545
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,404
Rym: Tale of Genji still reading it.

546
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:43,127
Rym: Not the Genji from Overwatch The actual original Hanjo to show up at some point.

547
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:50,350
Scott: first Novel ever created by human beings is the tale of Genji and we are reading it.

548
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:53,150
Scott: I read a chapter on the bus this morning train this morning.

549
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,346
Rym: I'm moving a lot faster reading it now that I gave up trying to catch every nuance.

550
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:58,470
Rym: cuz good fucking God.

551
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,981
Rym: Yeah, it's actually I gave up on romantic.

552
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:10,384
Rym: if a character eat like interacts in a scene I don't even try to figure out who they are anymore unless They keep reappearing or I see them again in another chapter.

553
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:10,584
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:12,270
Scott: I mean, I know we're slow to read this one.

555
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,697
Scott: It's not because it's ultra long.

556
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,782
Scott: It's only regular long.

557
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:19,741
Scott: It's because it's Translated from ancient jet not me not ancient.

558
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:22,550
Scott: Yeah, you know old style Japanese.

559
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:27,009
Scott: I imagine that even a modern Japanese speaker would have some trouble with it.

560
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,799
Scott: You're reading it in the old Japanese the same way.

561
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:40,090
Scott: I guess not as bad as us trying to read old English But you know less bad than that but not as easy as reading regular English sort of like reading Shakespeare.

562
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:48,510
Rym: well, the problem the problem I have is that and it's partly just due to the culture of the era it depicts that Oh Characters are very rarely referred to by a consistent name.

563
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,326
Rym: It explains that in the beginning characters are often even just referenced obliquely to the point to where.

564
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:58,889
Rym: unless you're really reading carefully You won't be aware that another person is now in the room.

565
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:06,735
Scott: Like that is the level of and once I just saw that one they're referring to a person not by name But by like their job.

566
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:09,265
Scott: Yeah, and then later they're referring to a person.

567
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:10,330
Scott: It was the same person.

568
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:22,310
Rym: They're referring to them differently now or they refer to someone as being like the leaf of a something Because they had called someone else as something earlier and that is actually that person's son, but fuck if I'm gonna catch that.

569
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:24,597
Scott: Anyway, that's the book club book.

570
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,246
Scott: Yeah in metamoment PAX East is over.

571
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:27,868
Scott: We did it.

572
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:28,410
Scott: We did it.

573
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,017
Scott: We didn't do any panel at it.

574
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:30,781
Scott: That was new.

575
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,650
Scott: So there's no video to show you from it.

576
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:39,179
Scott: But if you saw us again at PAX West in Labor Day probably up if it happens.

577
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,086
Rym: Well, hopefully it will happen.

578
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,898
Rym: Yep, but Yep, we did.

579
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,669
Rym: you might notice usually around this time I'm talking about how I'll be doing like four or five panels of zinc icon, but actually not going to zinc icon this year.

580
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:57,950
Rym: Yeah, cuz I'm actually forbidden from work for good from going to any conferences for the foreseeable future.

581
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,450
Scott: Okay.

582
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:06,342
Scott: So also in the meta moment, I want to point out that You know streaming wise right?

583
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:12,663
Scott: We got a twitch that we use Rarely, yeah, we got YouTube that we use for streaming this right now.

584
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:15,389
Rym: Yep, which happens to also be my personal YouTube.

585
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,801
Rym: So sometimes this channel will just have me like playing overwatch.

586
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,206
Scott: I got my personal YouTube.

587
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:31,134
Scott: I stream sometimes Rarely, right, but I found out that discord has a feature Right where you can stream in Discord right?

588
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,125
Scott: So like you're in discord, you know twitch no OBS.

589
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:35,148
Scott: No YouTube.

590
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:36,193
Scott: No nothing Right.

591
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:51,369
Scott: you open up a video game and you literally push one button in discord And now that video game is being streamed to people who are on that discord server in that room can now voice chat and Watch you play the game at the same time.

592
00:34:52,013 --> 00:35:07,109
Scott: I'm planning to do something with that and you know Not too many people are watching when I do that because the half semi official GeekNights discord server is Not that crowded but maybe one or two people watch when I do that.

593
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:12,450
Rym: But a high engagement low audience stream right pretty fun compared to a low engagement high audience That's true.

594
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,607
Scott: But really what it comes down to is that the effort to turn on that stream is so low.

595
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:21,866
Scott: if I do a stream on Twitch YouTube mixer, I got to set up OBS.

596
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:28,708
Scott: I got to do lights I got to do all kinds of stuff microphones checks and all its effort to set those up to stream.

597
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:34,988
Scott: on discord I literally I'm playing a game on my computer and discords like hey literally push one button just one fucking button.

598
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:39,442
Scott: you push it Boom, you'll be streaming and it's like might as well push that one button.

599
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:42,688
Scott: if I don't mind right right now I'll push the one button.

600
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:45,138
Rym: Yeah, so and then you're not doing a show like.

601
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:51,440
Scott: I'm gonna talk about advance for I don't have to worry about like, you know People randos coming in the chat.

602
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,910
Scott: I don't got to worry about trying to engage the audience.

603
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,538
Scott: I don't got to worry about and not that anyone not that I have enough viewers on Twitch to have subscribers But I don't have to do any of that.

604
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,088
Scott: It just I'm playing the video game.

605
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:07,710
Scott: So You should join the unofficial GeekNights discord.

606
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,618
Scott: There are links on our.

607
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:12,510
Scott: very come and find us on the internet and you'll be able to find links to it.

608
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,082
Rym: So I'll post a link because I'm trying to hang out in that discord.

609
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:16,428
Rym: more and more discord seems to.

610
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:22,670
Rym: Sadly it's the only thing we got for this level of like IRC style community in the modern era.

611
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:23,030
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:28,320
Scott: So maybe if you get in that server You'll see a little notification that I've gone or other.

613
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,525
Scott: I saw a listener doing it too.

614
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:33,184
Scott: Yeah listener was playing DDR but only with their fingers.

615
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:37,161
Scott: I So when I that was kind of sad.

616
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:37,926
Scott: so I didn't watch that.

617
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:43,330
Rym: so I'm curious Would any of you be interested in watching me just like say something in the comments of the forum?

618
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,227
Rym: I might just live stream myself playing DDR.

619
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:48,890
Rym: Yeah, like I might just start doing DDR live streams for the fuck of it.

620
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,718
Scott: I mean that you can't do that discord though easily.

621
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,181
Rym: No.

622
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:52,989
Scott: Well, that's an OBS it.

623
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,270
Rym: Yeah, that's that's gonna be a full-on OBS situation because my PC is starting to get near its last legs So I got to build a new one.

624
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,290
Scott: Anyway, I just want to say come to the discord and you might get a notification and you might see me play some video games.

625
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,176
Scott: Yeah, because it's so low effort.

626
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:06,678
Scott: I'll just do it.

627
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,227
Rym: All right, so we played this game.

628
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,090
Rym: It's not that new.

629
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,118
Rym: It's relatively news from 2018.

630
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:11,441
Rym: It's new to us.

631
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:17,489
Rym: Our friends Chris and Anthony busted out and we played it two times at PAX East.

632
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:26,317
Rym: now For those of you who might not be super familiar with us if we play a game at PAX more than once that is already A huge glowing endorsement.

633
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:34,104
Scott: Yeah, that means there was something in that first play that made us want to take a second Look, yeah, it's just spend precious packs minutes playing a game.

634
00:37:34,124 --> 00:37:35,790
Rym: We've already played is a big deal.

635
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:39,979
Rym: Mm-hmm first contact is real fun And basically it is.

636
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,310
Rym: it's a Russian board game designers a dumber.

637
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:45,859
Rym: Cuz not enough or coups not enough side.

638
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:50,797
Rym: I'm not great with Russian pronunciations not Dean of cuz nothing off I'm sure who knows.

639
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:51,621
Rym: cuz not enough.

640
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:58,850
Scott: Anyway, Russian game designer It's very code names adjacent, but it's not a very very code names adjacent.

641
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,034
Scott: I like code names.

642
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,338
Scott: first contact is a very.

643
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:06,377
Scott: it even has a grid of cards that you randomly lay out And communicate through.

644
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,270
Rym: if you like code names by this if you like this by code names.

645
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:11,682
Rym: But I've never played a game like this.

646
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:13,210
Rym: That was good before right?

647
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,835
Scott: so what first contact is about?

648
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:15,537
Scott: that makes it so.

649
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:29,590
Scott: code names is a game where there's teams and you're trying to Sort of in use inferences to get your teammates to pick the correct cards from the grid Yeah, right and not pick the wrong ones and you're up against a team.

650
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,373
Scott: That's also trying to do the same thing right in first contact.

651
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:45,489
Scott: what's happening is this is a team of aliens and a team of humans and the Aliens have a language a written language that looks somewhat adjacent to Egyptian hieroglyphs.

652
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,221
Rym: Right bunch of rune looking thing.

653
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,470
Scott: a bunch of rune looking things.

654
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,603
Scott: It has an Egyptian theme sort of like a Stargate alien kind of.

655
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:53,250
Scott: you know idea, right?

656
00:38:54,457 --> 00:39:01,128
Scott: and the humans Are looking at this grid of 25 cards and those 25 cards are items and you know

657
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:04,585
Rym: and it's like papyrus cow a whip

658
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:09,541
Scott: Pharaoh Right stuff that would be in an ancient Egyptian bird

659
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,423
Rym: a fly like

660
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:23,573
Scott: whatever and you know Since they can't talk to the aliens with English All they can sort of do is point and gesture at objects and the aliens have a written language that they can show To the humans.

661
00:39:24,035 --> 00:39:30,761
Scott: so what the humans are trying to do is to give the aliens the Objects that they desire.

662
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:32,329
Scott: Let me give you you're right.

663
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:34,830
Scott: They're offering gifts to the aliens.

664
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:41,275
Rym: They're trying to give the aliens what the aliens want and they're trying to learn the alien language to better Figure out what to give.

665
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:56,056
Scott: and the aliens are trying to get the humans to learn the alien language Because that way the alien can get the gifts that they want if the humans understand them And the aliens will be able to ask for what they want and get what they want and not ask for like an unk and Get a cow.

666
00:39:56,137 --> 00:40:04,670
Rym: now the brilliant part of this game Like I think what makes it like magic is that the alien team and the human team are not competing against each other.

667
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:07,140
Scott: Oh, no, no, no, no, no among the aliens.

668
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,008
Rym: There is a winner among the humans.

669
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:15,470
Scott: There is a winner Yes, the alien who receives all the things that they want because all the different alien players want something different, right?

670
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,854
Scott: Different set of things.

671
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:19,802
Scott: Yep, the alien who gets all the things they want is the winner.

672
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,750
Scott: the on the alien team the human winner.

673
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,873
Scott: So they'll always be two winners.

674
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:29,250
Scott: The human winner is the human who gives the most correct things to aliens.

675
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:29,973
Scott: Oh, right.

676
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:33,890
Scott: So let's say it's three on three, which is how we played it most of the time, right?

677
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,683
Scott: One of the aliens gets all five things they wanted.

678
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,833
Scott: they win game over Another.

679
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:45,490
Scott: one of the humans gave three correct things to each of the three aliens the two losing ones and the winning ones.

680
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,344
Scott: That's nine correct gifts and no other human had nine correct gifts.

681
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,410
Scott: They win amongst the humans.

682
00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:00,257
Rym: Yep, so every player on the human side behind their little shield They have a big grid of the words.

683
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:07,120
Rym: It's always the same 25 words like weapon English Beautiful fly valuable power.

684
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,270
Scott: They're trying to figure out which of those 25 words corresponds to each of the Egyptian runes.

685
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,698
Scott: Yeah, this is not a glyphs.

686
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:16,059
Scott: glyphs is.

687
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,229
Rym: this is not one glyph per object like this is literally.

688
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:22,510
Rym: uh, Well, I'll explain the human turn first and this will make sense.

689
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,740
Rym: So on the human turn all these human does one by one.

690
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,010
Rym: is you touch or tap or flip or point at?

691
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:35,290
Rym: Between one and five objects and the aliens have to tell you the symbol the glyph.

692
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:38,690
Rym: Yeah, the glyph that represents whatever you selected, right?

693
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,939
Scott: So maybe I'll tap, you know all of the animals.

694
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,129
Scott: and then right the the aliens will all talk to each other and hold up a glyph in the air.

695
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,678
Scott: Like I look at that glyph and I'll say to myself Well that glyph must mean animal.

696
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,570
Scott: Yeah, cuz we communicated by pointing at things.

697
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,662
Scott: I pointed at a bunch of animals and the aliens go Mmm, and they hold up the symbol for what?

698
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,470
Rym: Yep, but they could want a symbol.

699
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,097
Rym: You can't write a sentence in this case, right?

700
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:08,492
Scott: But it might be that might be the symbol for alive or Pointy.

701
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:13,790
Scott: it may be there's only a bull and a ram where the only animals and they consider that to be pointy even better.

702
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,915
Rym: The aliens might disagree Yeah on what the answer is.

703
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:25,171
Rym: and if that happens the majority aliens first are like here's the glyph for that and then the idiot Aliens like no, no, no, it's this glyph Right.

704
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,555
Scott: So then on the aliens turn.

705
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:28,622
Scott: the aliens don't write will write.

706
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:41,026
Scott: each will each in turn one at a time Will hold up a full sentence or you know one or more glyphs Right or phrase written in alien language and the pro move is saw a lot of times.

707
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:44,719
Rym: the aliens will write a sentence that uses Some glyphs that they're pretty sure the humans understand.

708
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:47,530
Rym: I won that way and some glyphs the humans don't understand.

709
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,334
Scott: That's how I won.

710
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:53,810
Scott: I taught the the humans a glyph that they did not learn on their turn Yeah, and was able to use it to then win.

711
00:42:54,031 --> 00:43:09,759
Scott: But anyway, the yeah the H alien in turn will write in multiple one or more glyphs the name of the you know Objects that they want as gifts and then each human will give one gift To that alien.

712
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,889
Scott: and if they give the right gift they get a point.

713
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:15,409
Scott: Yeah, and if the alien gets the gifts they want they get points.

714
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:27,890
Scott: If you give the say, you know, say read me and Rimmer both aliens Rym once I'll keep using cow and I want a whip and you give me a cow that doesn't do anything for him.

715
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,520
Scott: Yep, we're using code names.

716
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:30,827
Scott: That would be great for it.

717
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:41,549
Rym: Yeah Uh, the other interesting thing that makes this really fun and like really makes an interesting game Is that you can negate any glyph by drawing a line over the top of it?

718
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:52,287
Rym: so I could say that the like this glyph means alive or I could say like I could ask for something that is Not alive and powerful.

719
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:56,250
Rym: Yep But like the moment where the aliens disagree that was funny.

720
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:02,871
Rym: That made this game fun was I think it was a Pharaoh and a whip and a rod Like.

721
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,597
Rym: those are the three things the humans asked for.

722
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,303
Rym: so two of the aliens were like.

723
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:09,599
Rym: that represents power And the other alien was like.

724
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,069
Rym: that represents danger.

725
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:16,727
Rym: And that interaction and that give-and-take just makes this game really fun and engaging.

726
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:22,530
Scott: Yeah So the thing about this game is that I think it's it's very codenames adjacent.

727
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:29,161
Scott: I think you want to play it with the same crowd the same niches codenames Right the same same social scenario.

728
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,870
Scott: You're gonna whip out first contact as you would codenames, right?

729
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:38,190
Scott: So having both is somewhat redundant, but I think that I like first contact more.

730
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:49,630
Scott: I think it's a more fun game than code names at least for me because the deciphering of glyphs and communicating in the alien language is more fun than simply Choosing the right cards from a from a board.

731
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:58,637
Scott: But I think that first contact has less replay value than codenames as Designed and presented in this box though.

732
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:02,770
Rym: Well partly because there's the same number of words every time that's exactly it.

733
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,513
Scott: There's the.

734
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:10,410
Rym: the number of cards doesn't matter too much right because there are a lot of cards Which I think does give this a lot more replay value does otherwise.

735
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:17,570
Scott: But you're always playing first contact with the same 25 words warm defense knowledge fast power valuable fly.

736
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:20,599
Rym: I was saying a bunch of them to give you a sense of scale.

737
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:22,425
Scott: It's always the same 25 words.

738
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,730
Scott: We're using code names.

739
00:45:24,252 --> 00:45:25,879
Scott: It's just the cards are it?

740
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,827
Scott: so it's completely different every time.

741
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:30,056
Scott: so code names I think is less fun.

742
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:32,646
Scott: You get more plays first contact.

743
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:33,529
Scott: I think more fun.

744
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:36,038
Scott: You're gonna get less plays before you're like.

745
00:45:36,058 --> 00:45:43,090
Rym: I don't need to play first contact ever again unless you just make a custom board That's like one row bigger and has more clip more words.

746
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:47,570
Scott: I think another problem with first contact that we did not play anywhere near enough time.

747
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:52,730
Scott: Yeah a problem, but let's say you do keep playing it and keep playing it and keep playing it a whole bunch, right?

748
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,469
Scott: There were only so many answer keys in that box.

749
00:45:55,697 --> 00:45:58,289
Scott: Yeah You could reach the point where you've memorized.

750
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:08,761
Scott: Aha If that Glyph is that word then I've memorized the rest of the key and I because I've played this so many times Yeah, there's only one answer key where that glyph is that word.

751
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:10,810
Scott: I know the whole language now.

752
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,010
Scott: I can just win if I'm the alien.

753
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:16,369
Scott: I guess if you're the person it wouldn't help you if you were the alien.

754
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:21,950
Scott: But I think the idea is that there's a limited stuff in there and it can run out and it needs.

755
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,296
Rym: I think it could only run out though.

756
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:28,710
Rym: If you play this the way we play like heavy cardboard Yes, I'm doing a lot with the same group of people.

757
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,510
Scott: The point is it could and will run out with enough plays unless it gets expansion.

758
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:39,590
Scott: If you got some expansion or some modification you can stretch this out in which case I would never want to play codename.

759
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,378
Scott: But I think once this runs out then it's like.

760
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:45,969
Scott: well codename is still fun not as fun but still fun.

761
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:49,201
Rym: But I feel like where I play like the value.

762
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:54,346
Rym: one thing I liked about this was that we played it Late at night on Sunday after PAX and even though everyone was tired.

763
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:55,110
Rym: It still totally worked.

764
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,278
Rym: This is a great like.

765
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,647
Scott: we played it late at night.

766
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:02,390
Scott: both times We played when we arrived at PAX late and we played it right before we left PAX late.

767
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:05,562
Rym: It's a good wind down game that has just like.

768
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:11,161
Rym: it'll keep people awake and keep people engaged But doesn't require you to be like a hundred percent on point to play.

769
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:11,662
Scott: effective, right?

770
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:19,632
Scott: And it doesn't feel as sort of shallow and you know thin as Codenames.

771
00:47:19,692 --> 00:47:23,724
Scott: it has a little bit more brain noodling deciphering the language going on.

772
00:47:23,765 --> 00:47:23,985
Scott: Yep.

773
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:25,510
Rym: I like this game a lot.

774
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,427
Rym: I actually bought a copy of it and also the theme is ancient Egyptians like specifically aliens.

775
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:36,459
Rym: yeah, the aliens are the Egyptian gods yes, and The art is really funny.

776
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:41,624
Rym: like it one of them is just like an Egyptian God Just like looking at an onc like lay in there like it's a cell phone.

777
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:49,465
Rym: Yep But yeah, if If you need like party games that aren't just like crap.

778
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,550
Rym: This is like a must-buy.

779
00:47:50,690 --> 00:48:06,143
Scott: Yeah, if you're playing codenames and you want something that's a little bit meatier a little bit You know something to wrap your brain around a little bit more than codenames is but still fills that same niche of Low effort kind of game.

780
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:07,190
Scott: You can just bust it out.

781
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,646
Scott: Yep then this is the way to go and the pro the most fun is you.

782
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,777
Rym: you can get a like if you get Esoteric about it.

783
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:14,361
Rym: like it.

784
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:18,923
Rym: like sometimes players they'll pick a combination of objects where there is no fucking answer to that.

785
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,448
Rym: just to see what the aliens do mm-hmm.

786
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:25,983
Rym: and Also, you could mod this game pretty heavily if you got bored with it like really easily.

787
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:28,170
Rym: just make new answer keys make new anything.

788
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:30,908
Rym: This game has got a lot of potential.

789
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:32,716
Scott: Yep The only thing is like.

790
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:35,649
Scott: I said you you wrap your noodle around it a little more.

791
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:39,150
Scott: Yeah, but I think it might be a little less accessible.

792
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:40,976
Scott: Do you say children's?

793
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:41,960
Scott: I feel like kids.

794
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:42,603
Rym: I don't.

795
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:44,370
Scott: I feel like almost anyone.

796
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,407
Rym: I feel like you've got to be at least 14 or smart like really like.

797
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:49,130
Scott: I don't know 14.

798
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,790
Scott: But the point is I feel like I can't imagine like a ten-year-old playing.

799
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:52,951
Scott: Minimally.

800
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:58,730
Scott: minimum age for first contact is a little bit higher than codenames because codenames is super accessible to just about anyone.

801
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,076
Scott: You even have Disney codenames like.

802
00:49:00,096 --> 00:49:01,000
Scott: yeah, one can play it.

803
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:08,410
Scott: you have to you know Understand the concept of matching glyphs to words and deciphering language.

804
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,741
Scott: Yeah to be able to play first contact.

805
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,670
Scott: so the barrier to entry is higher.

806
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:14,136
Scott: But we're a code.

807
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:17,530
Scott: names especially codenames pictures is super accessible to anyone.

808
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:25,509
Rym: First contact is but this game will work very well with mixed company like if you have a few it a few like capable players and a few kids.

809
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:29,847
Rym: It'll be fine because a poor player will not significantly disrupt the game.

810
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:34,327
Scott: and also It's so even if you it's super not really competitive.

811
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:37,462
Scott: that much Right because you're only the other aliens.

812
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:42,610
Scott: the aliens are competing with each other But not directly and most of the time they're cooperating to choose a glyph.

813
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:43,292
Rym: And it's just.

814
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:49,012
Rym: it's more it's fun like Chris at one point asked for like this giant fucking sentence for the humans just to see What happens.

815
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:51,420
Rym: yeah, and someone got it like it works.

816
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:54,090
Scott: Yeah, I intentionally taught the humans a word.

817
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:04,010
Scott: I needed them to know that they didn't ask for and then I used that word To get the things I wanted and the humans understood what I was saying and gave me the thing I wanted and I won.

818
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:05,582
Scott: So that was fun.

819
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:09,078
Rym: Yep So this game is pretty good.

820
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:10,884
Rym: add to your collection all things considered.

821
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:14,441
Rym: It also does not take long Not very short half hour.

822
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:15,850
Rym: You can knock this game out.

823
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,996
Rym: Yep, maybe 45 minutes.

824
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:22,730
Rym: if people are really slow and you're teaching and some people have problems like it's it's pretty good.

825
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,360
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

826
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,200
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

827
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,448
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

828
00:50:36,488 --> 00:50:39,480
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

829
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:47,160
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

831
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:55,054
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

832
00:50:55,234 --> 00:51:08,715
Rym: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Grenier, just like a dude guy, Shartavish, and Link Egee.

833
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:10,220
Rym: You hold the key to my heart.

834
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,648
Rym: I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

835
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:29,620
Rym: Clinton Walton, Jay Bantz, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Dropen Lander, Nicholas Brandow, Chris Midkiff, Mack, the thirst for hydrated Gannon, Dread Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Finn, Sean Klein, Thomas Hine, Shervin Von Harl, and a whole bunch of other people who don't want me to say their name.

836
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:39,518
Rym: I had to pause there because the patron manager right now will not actually show the entire names unless I hover and see a tool Tip, which is annoying, but I guess I gotta live with that.

837
00:51:40,482 --> 00:51:45,394
Rym: GeekNights has resumed with its regular schedule and we will see you in all our streams.

838
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:50,567
Rym: And now I leave you with Bart, your word is imply.

839
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:51,529
Rym: Imply.

840
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:53,434
Rym: I-M-P.

841
00:51:53,634 --> 00:51:54,897
Rym: Bart said I-M-P.

842
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:55,719
Rym: He's made it B!

843
00:51:58,024 --> 00:51:58,691
Rym: I got my laugh.

844
00:51:58,772 --> 00:51:59,359
Rym: I'm out of here.

845
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,968
Scott: Well, we're down to our last two students.

846
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,073
Scott: Milhouse, your word is choke.

847
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:08,858
Rym: Oh, I know this one.

848
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:14,728
Rym: It's so easy Stop laughing.

849
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:15,850
Rym: It will scar him for life.
