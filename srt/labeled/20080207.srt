00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:27,867
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:38,653
Rym: So for the last several years Scott has often had I mean not often But he's had some crazy stories of things that have happened on the train in the morning.

7
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:42,049
Scott: and son happened on your train this Morning for the first time.

8
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:46,595
Scott: I had something crazy happen on my train But you had something crazy like the old guy who wouldn't get off.

9
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,862
Rym: He wasn't crazy That was just.

10
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:48,767
Rym: that was funny.

11
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:53,780
Rym: and there was another equally funny one actually yesterday Where this guy was on the phone, right?

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,239
Rym: You know normally when someone's loud on the phone on the train everyone's like shut up or the conductor says shut up.

13
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:08,240
Rym: the guy was so funny and and just the way what he was saying that Basically the whole it was just a comedy routine for everyone on the car including the conductor.

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,029
Rym: Basically his conversation was like this man.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,536
Rym: No ma listen to me ma ma ma ma.

16
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,038

Rym: Shut the fuck up ma Just listen to me.

18
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:22,608
Rym: All right, he had no business it ma ma ma Just just just be quiet now.

00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,394
Rym: I'm not don't say that ma.

20
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:31,556
Rym: Come on mom ma ma in that exact voice for the for like took 20 minutes.

21
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,344
Rym: it was When he stopped.

22
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:47,760
Rym: everyone in the crowd like everyone sat there for a while and then one guy started clapping and The guy got really embarrassed and he kind of looked around like her and then he got on another car And I didn't see him for the rest of the ride.

23
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:51,825
Scott: But today it wasn't.

24
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:55,360
Scott: this is why they tell you when you're on the cell phone you should go in the vestibule.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,407
Scott: That's did Alex and vestibule.

26
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:10,021
Rym: I do too, you know what a vestibule is very much like a Boy a how about a Macadamia Gazebo.

27
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:10,363
Scott: All right.

28
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:15,160
Rym: All right, but no today I had something one of those kind of bad interesting things happen.

29
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,272
Rym: So I get on the train and you know, there's a there's a girl.

30
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,420
Scott: I just had two things in the same day.

31
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:21,566
Rym: Well, this was today.

32
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:22,451
Rym: The other thing was yesterday.

33
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:22,893
Scott: Okay.

34
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:23,980
Rym: So today I get on the train.

35
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:30,746
Rym: I'm I walked and there's a girl kind of laying in one of the seats and I think all right the conductor who's going to Make her move?

36
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,540
Rym: because this trains always crazy crowded.

37
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,791
Scott: She was unconscious or something.

38
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:45,029
Rym: No, she seems she was sitting there just Alright, so I put my earplugs in and I'm just kind of half asleep and then I hear moaning Uh-huh, and is she pregnant or something?

39
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,394
Rym: Well, yes, but I'll get to that.

40
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:50,286
Rym: Oh, so I'm thinking alright And I look around.

41
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,175
Rym: I see other people kind of look into my direction.

42
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,320
Scott: I already figured this one out.

43
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:53,946
Rym: So I take the.

44
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,420
Rym: now you didn't alright.

45
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:02,626
Rym: so I take the earplugs out and I hear moans of pain and whimpering and all sorts of trouble from Behind me where that girl was.

46
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:03,309
Rym: Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,447
Rym: So I turn around and I look and Ask her if she's okay, and she doesn't respond.

48
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,691
Rym: She just keeps moaning.

49
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,360
Scott: and then where did she get on Poughkeepsie?

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,968
Rym: I guess so.

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:30,391
Rym: then I'm thinking like alright I'm gonna get the conductor and do something and then the guy sitting across like in across the aisle in the same row looks at me and says you got a problem boss and I'm like, uh, this woman seems like she needs help.

52
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:30,872
Rym: She's like he's.

53
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:41,729
Rym: and then he says mind your business uh-huh, uh-huh, and That that is the moment when all the other people sitting on the train start saying Oh, this woman is clearly in pain and needs help.

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,280
Rym: Who are you - and he's like mind your business you people.

55
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,752
Rym: He's getting really agitated.

56
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:51,172
Scott: Uh-oh Obviously, there's a daytime talk show situation happening here.

57
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,779
Rym: It's a it gets far worse than this.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,760
Scott: So, yeah, I see a need for police and ambulance involvement already, so I've got my cell phone out.

59
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,900
Rym: I'm ready to call the police just in case the situation escalates quick.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,939
Scott: I would have called 9-1-1 as soon as that guy said mind your business.

61
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:14,520
Rym: Well the reason I didn't because we were in between Stops and the conductor was in the next car about to get there and the conductor can get police much more quickly.

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,660
Rym: I would have I would have gone to get the conductor and you know immediately Yeah, but he was right there and it looked like someone else was already talking to him pointing in our direction.

63
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:29,507
Rym: So things were things were going in the right direction All right, and pretty much this dude had the whole train car already ready to jump him if anything was going on You know.

64
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:34,997
Rym: So, uh, the conductor gets there and he asked what's going on and everyone kind of starts to explain.

65
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,505
Rym: and he asked the woman Are you okay, and she won't answer him.

66
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:38,970
Rym: You need paramedics.

67
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:39,793
Rym: You won't answer him.

68
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,299
Rym: She just won't say a word to him.

69
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,068
Scott: So you turn pregnant, right?

70
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,075
Rym: I found that out later.

71
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,640
Scott: So do I did she look pregnant?

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,592
Scott: She wasn't very pregnant.

73
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:53,986
Rym: she looked like a mid-20s woman, okay She wasn't going into labor.

74
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,592
Rym: that I did the story is not.

75
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,460
Rym: Rym delivered a baby on the way to work.

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,340
Scott: No, no, no, but I was saying, you know, I asked if she was pregnant.

77
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,662
Scott: So I sort of assumed that you know, you said yes, so I assumed that oh, it's she must have been very, you know large

78
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:11,859
Rym: well that I guess that that's just because you asked a question that had a somewhat unanticipated answer

79
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,336
Scott: Because I that was you know, sort of an obvious guess there.

80
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,040
Scott: what was going on?

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,895
Rym: Yeah, so the conductor is asking her and she really won't say anything.

82
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,139
Scott: No, it's like it powers call Randy I got a million dollars.

83
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,290
Rym: so then the conductor turns to the guy and says is she alright?

84
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,075
Rym: and he says I don't know.

85
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,945
Rym: uh-huh, so the conductor says Well, isn't she with you?

86
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,280
Rym: and he says she ain't with me.

87
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,140
Scott: Then why would you say in mind your business?

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,703
Rym: So, uh, he said.

89
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:45,711
Rym: so the conductor who obviously had already known about this situation and was just waiting for the opportunity to deal with Says well you gave me your ticket.

90
00:05:46,514 --> 00:06:02,078
Rym: and he says he says well She's apparently with all these other people because these all these other people care about my business And they should mind their business To which the conductor says Sir what's going on?

91
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:07,497
Rym: And then he proceeds to balk and deny and refuse to answer anything.

92
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:10,869
Rym: and then conductor is Obviously getting very close to calling the police.

93
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,899
Scott: if he's not already I would have had the police already called.

94
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:23,319
Scott: Plus the conductor is very see unlike, you know me right where you know, if I'm on a train I can sort of try to deal with a situation like that.

95
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:28,900
Scott: But the conductor has special law protections that allow him to be an asshole.

96
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:38,760
Rym: I'll say this if you don't know if you're in New York State And you'd do anything to a transit official if you a bus driver, I don't know if it applies to cab drivers.

97
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,473
Scott: I think this is different laws for cab drivers like mass transit.

98
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:48,124
Scott: anyone a subway Employee a bus driver any a train conductor They're protected.

99
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:51,160
Scott: you even touch them you go to jail for like seven years.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,996
Rym: Basically touching one of them is the same as touching a police officer with the exact same penalties.

101
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,080
Scott: It's almost as bad.

102
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,627
Scott: It's pretty bad, yeah, but I mean it's it's.

103
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,900
Scott: it's almost as bad not quite the same but there's a minimum sentences.

104
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:16,600
Scott: Yes, there are very large ones I mean like if I if I'm walking down New York City Street, right and there's a cop standing there and I punch Rym in The face right I would get like, you know assault battery something, you know night in jail something like that.

105
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,420
Scott: Right if Rym happened to be a train conductor I would be like a felony and seven years something ridiculous like that.

106
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,553
Scott: Maybe I think there's like tens of thousands of dollars in fines.

107
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,020
Scott: You don't fuck with those people.

108
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,753
Rym: so anyway, the conductor eventually gets out the story and the work.

109
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:32,857
Rym: the girl starts talking.

110
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:40,580
Rym: finally and Basically, the two of them were at a hospital in Poughkeepsie and she is pregnant and there are complications.

111
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:53,746
Rym: So they were told to go to a specialty hospital in Harlem Mm-hmm, so they had gotten on the train and they were told that you know just get on the train get to that hospital and they'll take care of you there and The situation like.

112
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,500
Rym: they verified everything and it was totally normal.

113
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:02,818
Rym: The only problem was that the dude was just a complete jackass for absolutely no reason.

114
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,504
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's like.

115
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,360
Scott: did he want to create suspicion into thinking that something was going on?

116
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,900
Rym: I mean, it's one thing to you know, tell people to mind their own business.

117
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,960
Rym: It's in even though I think it was a stupid thing to do.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,253
Rym: It's an entirely other thing to lie to the conductor.

119
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,367
Rym: when he comes and asks you if everything's all right It is obviously trying to help.

120
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,739
Rym: Yeah, I mean and why wouldn't the woman say anything?

121
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:31,560
Scott: You know, I can understand not wanting to you know, share your situation with the world and have you know Some sort of privacy or something, but I mean, it's obvious that people didn't mean poorly.

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:43,818
Scott: The people were concerned and if you you know, honestly did care you just you know, sort of say, you know You don't give all the details, but you would say, you know We're on our way to a hospital in Harlem the hospital in Poughkeepsie.

123
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:47,694
Scott: He told us to go on the train and we'd be fine and that's what we're doing.

124
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,923
Rym: if the guy had said it's okay She's with me.

125
00:08:49,943 --> 00:09:01,180
Rym: Yeah, that would have been enough as long as she wasn't, you know, I don't know tied up or something I know right, but that And then you know, basically I just I was woken up by that.

126
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:18,340
Rym: so I spent the rest of the train ride reading and playing advanced wars, but I got to overhear the conversations that went on throughout the train ride between the man and this woman and Neither one of them is the brightest Star in the sky the brightest bulb in the candelabra, shall we say?

127
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,380
Rym: Yeah I Don't think their lives are going in a good direction.

128
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:25,909
Scott: No, no, not really.

129
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,518
Scott: Yeah now that is you'd like that.

130
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:34,160
Scott: With an attitude like that, you know things that you might try to do you're going to fail at because people will you know?

131
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,020
Scott: Your interactions with people will fail.

132
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:42,923
Rym: Yeah I didn't get the end of the story because I moved out of the car to another car around Croton Harmon when she started vomiting All over the place.

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,067
Scott: Oh, that's fantastic.

134
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:45,954
Rym: Yeah, but the conductor took care of the rest of it.

135
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,680
Rym: And yeah, yeah.

136
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:49,460
Rym: So that was my morning.

137
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,031
Scott: Yeah on the way into work.

138
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,399
Scott: I played some dwarf fortress, right?

139
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,947
Scott: I was doing the best your fortress ever.

140
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:56,509
Rym: Wait a minute.

141
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,051
Rym: Is this II?

142
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,316
Rym: but then the story.

143
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:04,119
Scott: but then a Giant cave swallow ate three of my doors.

144
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,189
Rym: So you were in that chasm weren't you?

145
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,052
Scott: it just flew out.

146
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,800
Rym: I'm excited about that chasm.

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,185
Rym: I remember you're like I got a chasm.

148
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:14,880
Scott: it actually happened when I got to work and I upgraded to a newer version of dwarf.

149
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,180
Scott: I think that newer version had more monsters coming out of the chasm.

150
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:19,587
Scott: I would think that was a mistake.

151
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,109
Scott: to upgrade.

152
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,583
Rym: you can see you build the hallway to the chasm Right.

153
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,480
Rym: put some door on the end of that shit.

154
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:25,222
Scott: No It did it.

155
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:28,474
Scott: the guy was going because the platinum was in like next to the chasm.

156
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,823
Scott: like you couldn't get the platinum without Exposing yourself.

157
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,032
Rym: I guess you got to put some Rangers.

158
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:33,634
Rym: just stand.

159
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:35,180
Scott: the Ranger got eaten by wolves.

160
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,040
Rym: Maybe you shouldn't send him out to kill the wolves.

161
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,707
Scott: Killed so many wolves by himself.

162
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,414
Scott: like I have a refuse pile full of wolf carcasses.

163
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,119
Scott: yet somehow one wolf got him.

164
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,211
Rym: Are you sure he wasn't bleeding continuously from all the fights with?

165
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,480
Scott: if he was it didn't say it anywhere.

166
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,729
Scott: It didn't say watch out your Rangers bleeding.

167
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,315
Scott: tell him to come home and it's not like.

168
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,640
Scott: I could even tell him not to go hunt.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,004
Scott: Well, he did it on his own.

170
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,526
Scott: Yeah.

171
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,148
Rym: Yeah, I'm just.

172
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,211
Rym: I'm saying you got it.

173
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,258
Rym: The dwarves aren't the brightest.

174
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:08,968
Rym: No shit All right, no, but I mean I was reading a story on the wiki about a dwarf who basically locked himself in his room and Starved to death.

175
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:14,259
Scott: Yeah, it's happened And I tried to start a new game on the way home.

176
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,100
Scott: But because I didn't have the wiki I couldn't get it the starting loadout, right?

177
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,467
Scott: The game is very difficult to play or at least I can play it without the wiki But I can't start a new game without the wiki.

178
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:24,430
Scott: That's very difficult.

179
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:35,527
Rym: Yeah, I've yet to actually play a game of this though I'm kind of thinking I'm not going to join this succession game because I'm awful but I could foresee a Parallel universe.

180
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,439
Rym: What if Rym the dwarf took over?

181
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:43,997
Rym: Because I imagine Rym the dwarfs responses to everything are what the fuck do these dwarves want?

182
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:44,780
Rym: they're out of food.

183
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,947
Rym: I don't know what's going on.

184
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,073
Rym: And now one of them's dead.

185
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,993
Scott: once things are set up They will largely sort of work on their own.

186
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,000
Scott: if things are set up, right?

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,642
Scott: But it's it.

188
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:55,677
Scott: the part is getting it to that point and then not having any problems.

189
00:11:55,758 --> 00:12:03,911
Rym: I'll be honest I feel like I mean it was really cool interviewing the the lead developer for dwarf fortress But I feel like unless he open-sources this thing.

190
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:13,096
Scott: It's never really gonna get much further than it is now I feel like it'll make progress But I think there are a lot that it basically won't achieve anywhere near its full potential.

191
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:17,992
Rym: unless he does something different I think the game would be ten times better within a year pretty much from the day.

192
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:19,337
Rym: It was open source pretty much.

193
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:22,584
Scott: Yeah anyway On Amazon.

194
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,432
Scott: I finally ordered a Leatherman cuz.

195
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,280
Scott: I you know, I've always wanted one of those multi-tools.

196
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,780
Rym: But yeah, I mean I had I had a wood man and an Iron Man and they didn't quite cut it now.

197
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,258
Scott: And they had so many different choices, you know, and like I was I don't know which one I wanted.

198
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,815
Scott: Right the Leatherman wave is the most popular but I mean that thing is a fucking saw in it.

199
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:38,758
Scott: I don't need a saw.

200
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,843
Rym: What if you're?

201
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:43,860
Rym: what if you get a saw something, you know, watch watch we're gonna get to Katsu Kan, right?

202
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Scott: You'll have your brand new Leatherman and there'll be a tiny piece of wood and we will just need to cut it really bad.

203
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,840
Rym: We'll be about to get the rampart cartridges into the room, right?

204
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:09,614
Rym: but there's a little piece of wood stuck in the door and the door is just too small to get it in as a result and The con chair is gonna come in and say But no Katsu Kan is canceled go home right that might happen they could.

205
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,740
Rym: then we'll play some tiny poker right now.

206
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,963
Scott: So I finally figured I looked at all the options and I weighed them against each other and I figured out one that has Most of the tools I need and not so many tools I don't need.

207
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:32,400
Scott: and I realize these things are real expensive like they're 50 bucks at the store 60/70 on Amazon 30 30 bucks, you know I noticed this today when I was thinking like I need all this stuff.

208
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,070
Rym: I was thinking and I sat down it.

209
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,683
Rym: All right, what's everything I need Other than you know?

210
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,852
Rym: large capital purchases like houses and a new car?

211
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,299
Rym: and I looked at everything I needed and I thought huh?

212
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,278
Rym: I wonder how much of this I can get on Amazon right now.

213
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,514
Rym: Went to Amazon everything.

214
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,983
Rym: I got everything I even could.

215
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:56,566
Rym: I was sitting there and I was like I was trying to think of anything else I could need cuz I could Just order it right then.

216
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,499
Rym: I don't go to stores anymore Yep.

217
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,858
Scott: So anyway, the one I ended up getting is the leatherman fuse.

218
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,418
Scott: Yeah, but it has a nice ruler and stuff and scissor and a what.

219
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:19,840
Scott: now anyway I ordered it and it sort of didn't show up, but I checked the tracking information and it I basically said, you know Check that, you know Accepted for delivery.

220
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:28,339
Scott: But that was it and it said that for a very long time and usually, you know They estimate a delivery date and things, you know show up way before that date.

221
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,632
Scott: Well, it got to that date and it didn't show up.

222
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,940
Scott: So the next day I emailed Amazon.

223
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,582
Scott: I was like, what do I do?

224
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,088
Scott: They're like wait until February 6th.

225
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:35,653
Scott: There is six was yesterday.

226
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,480
Scott: the tracking information hasn't changed.

227
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:39,046
Scott: I said, I'm pretty confident.

228
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,031
Scott: This is lost in the mail.

229
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,240
Scott: So they said, okay, you want us to send you another one?

230
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:49,840
Scott: I said yes No, so they just sent me another one for free with better shipping than before for free and we'll see if it shows up.

231
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:53,557
Scott: Yeah, that's that's a Amazon lost in the mail.

232
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,220
Scott: No worries.

233
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,340
Rym: So, um in the news I have to talk about this a little bit.

234
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:06,104
Rym: It's kind of it's related nominally to the important events of American politics that Scott doesn't care about but They do not call.

235
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:10,120
Rym: a registry in the United States is not something I personally care about because I have a cell phone.

236
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:17,198
Rym: they can't call me anyway, but Lot of people who haven't made the leap into the current century still have landlines.

237
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:23,889
Rym: as a result They care about, you know being bothered every day by telemarketers And I would do if I had a landline.

238
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,886
Rym: and we have the do not call registry Which basically is a list you can sign up for.

239
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:32,000
Rym: that says all right telemarketers can't call you or they get fined out the ass.

240
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,946
Rym: And it was a temporary bill.

241
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:38,600
Rym: The news is that it has been made permanent by the Senate.

242
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:41,755
Rym: So the do not call registry is here to stay.

243
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:49,218
Rym: and even better they added something because a lot of people got calls from politicians, but they weren't actually the politicians.

244
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,620
Rym: they were robots robots disguised as politicians.

245
00:15:54,443 --> 00:16:00,484
Rym: It is now against the law to call people with political message with robot Huh?

246
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,400
Scott: Well, isn't that most of the calls you got there that was indeed.

247
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,978
Rym: However, those calls were illegal anyway, because they went to my cell phone.

248
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:13,544
Rym: But they were also from fairly untraceable numbers and there's a good chance that they weren't actually from the candidates They claim to be from.

249
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:15,513
Rym: but uh, don't get me started on that.

250
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:21,996
Scott: Yeah, there's a Real still a big problem in this country in the fact that everyone has cell phones yet.

251
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:29,060
Scott: They haven't really Updated the country to deal with the fact that people have cell phones only and it's like they got to work on that.

252
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:29,760
Rym: Well, I don't know.

253
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:39,040
Rym: I mean other than when there's an election and I get a whole bunch of calls to my cell phone for like the two days before the election The country accommodates my cell phone usage a hundred percent.

254
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,354
Rym: Yeah, I mean, how are we not?

255
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:42,060
Rym: what's missing?

256
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,282
Scott: I know a lot.

257
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,520
Scott: it like a lot of places you'll go and it'd be like home phone cell phone.

258
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,303
Scott: It's like alright.

259
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,991
Scott: Listen, I fill in just cell phone.

260
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:49,573
Scott: It doesn't work.

261
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,060
Scott: You know people gotta well, you know what I do.

262
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,980
Rym: I just fill in the home phone because my cell phone is my own right but then they'll spam that one because you know No, and then when one I've never had anyone spam it cable vision keeps calling me.

263
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,606
Rym: Well tell him not to call you.

264
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,718
Rym: I know but have you actually told him not to call you?

265
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:17,916
Rym: Yeah Well, have you sent send them a certified postal letter and in its state that you do not want them to ever call you Unless it's a direct matter pertaining to your continuation of service and or billing.

266
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:18,640
Scott: Yeah, that's what I mean.

267
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,419
Scott: What that's what I want.

268
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:30,380
Rym: well do that send them a certified letter and State in the letter that if they don't comply and they continue to call you after such and such period that you'll be forced to Bring legal action against them, but I don't want to bring legal action the pen.

269
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,826
Rym: You know how fun that would be.

270
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:36,438
Scott: I had to take a day off work to go to small claims court to get less money than I make in a day of work.

271
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,574
Rym: Yeah, cuz you can only get like a thousand bucks from small claims course, right?

272
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,684
Rym: It's silly fun though They can imagine.

273
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,487
Rym: it's kind of like paint.

274
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,000
Rym: you pay some money right and you get to have fun.

275
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:49,499
Scott: I would love to go to court if I had more if I had a bunch of vacation days.

276
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,004
Rym: sure I have never been able to.

277
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:57,650
Rym: every time I've been summoned to a court for something the charges have always been dismissed and I've never Gotten a chance to actually state a case.

278
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,474
Scott: All right.

279
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:08,873
Scott: So anyway You're gonna hear a lot of newses and things of the day from this blog which I was itself my thing of the day a while ago Science based medicine org.

280
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:09,820
Scott: It's like the greatest blog.

281
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,320
Scott: Oh my god, like every single thing they post here is awesome, and they post often like every day.

282
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,819
Scott: There's something new here some amazing essay or something and the latest one is pretty interesting now.

283
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:24,733
Scott: It's called the Iraqi civilian war dead scandal right now.

284
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,137
Scott: Don't take this.

285
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:26,478
Scott: Wait.

286
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:26,619
Rym: Wait.

287
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,020
Rym: Wait a minute.

288
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:34,124
Rym: I'm just curious is the direction of this a lot more people are dying than we think or is the direction of this not as Many people are dying as we think?

289
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:39,847
Scott: the direction of this is a lot less people a lot less Iraqi civilians died than according To this one study.

290
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:53,214
Scott: There's a study That was hard I'm not you know, of course a lot of people have died in Iraq on all sides and it's terrible and you know No, even if the statistic was 10, it's horrible, right?

291
00:18:53,254 --> 00:19:15,558
Scott: So I'm not downplaying the horribleness I don't want anyone to think that right but this article the reason it's so quality is because it shows you you know how someone can conduct a Scientific study not you know Randy or bullshit or anything and publish it in a somewhat trusted You know source and that you know published study will spread.

292
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:19,478
Scott: and the idea You know the general idea of that published study will spread within.

293
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,770
Scott: you know The the mindshare of the people and people will quote that study often and you know It'll basically create a fact.

294
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:36,544
Scott: yet if the actual study was not Conducted according to strict scientific controls and and it just wasn't done properly I just I cut.

295
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:50,019
Rym: I imagine I had a cut to you know, Family Guy style the statistician sitting at his computer and thinking how many people died in Iraq and Then he just pipes dev random into some sort of program.

296
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:58,772
Scott: Well, you can read the story of actually how they got the numbers so incredibly wrong here, right But let me let me find this little part here that I can quote.

297
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,522
Scott: Oh I lost it.

298
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,709
Rym: Oh, well regardless.

299
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,675
Scott: There was a one part.

300
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:06,177
Scott: Oh, here it is.

301
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:10,209
Scott: Uh, uh, uh Scrolling go go go go go.

302
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:10,831
Scott: 100 animals an hour.

303
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,493
Rym: I'm not editing.

304
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,159
Rym: Nothing's coming out of this show.

305
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,293
Rym: They're here in the dark side of GeekNights that the continuity is broken.

306
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:18,955
Scott: Okay.

307
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:23,114
Scott: Okay ears He talks about some of the different figures that people came up with.

308
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:24,460
Scott: right and here's one of them.

309
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:34,190
Scott: He says critics found yet another figure that I thought of also after deciding to write this the u.s Battlefield ratio of wounded individuals to deaths is eight.

310
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:37,540
Scott: is that is somewhere between eight and ten to one right?

311
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,339
Scott: Assuming a ten to one ratio, right?

312
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,620
Scott: There would have been six million wounded Iraqi civilians seeking medical care over three years or ten thousand wounded per day.

313
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:52,800
Scott: No hospital or other source of data could reasonably have confirmed such figures.

314
00:20:54,226 --> 00:21:06,298
Scott: you see so It's it's just a lot of people come up with these numbers and the numbers get published in some way and people believe the numbers And you got to really go and look and find out where the fuck those numbers came from.

315
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,681
Scott: and you know Not I'm not commenting on the Iraq situation here I'm just.

316
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:14,717
Scott: it's a really great example of how numbers can get just way out of control.

317
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:23,740
Scott: and you know People are saying, you know 600,000 people died 600,000 civilians died in Iraq and that's probably a huge overestimation.

318
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,579
Scott: It's probably much much less is is much closer to the truth.

319
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:37,983
Rym: So since my news was kind of lame because the only commentary I have other than that it happened was basically Advertisers suck it.

320
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:43,140
Rym: I don't care about you, but I got a bit of a geek bite here real quick.

321
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,164
Rym: I almost said geek backs.

322
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:47,095
Scott: I Scott says the main bits gonna be like long here.

323
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:49,567
Scott: You got a won't be that long I don't know could be long.

324
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,654
Rym: We didn't do a show yesterday.

325
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:51,579
Rym: I thought that about that.

326
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,210
Scott: Yeah, I know but we couldn't come up with anything to do.

327
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:57,584
Scott: actually that we did a news in a main bit And they sucked ass.

328
00:21:57,624 --> 00:22:01,420
Rym: the story of yesterday's show is thus Scott and I are sitting here tired.

329
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,227
Scott: We're looking at me so tired.

330
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,140
Rym: Well tired as in I want to get about my real business.

331
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:10,940
Rym: You want to make the show and get done and eat some dinner and we're looking at anime news Network.

332
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:12,388
Rym: Nothing happened.

333
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,523
Rym: there was no news and we're like, alright Let's just do the show.

334
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:20,920
Rym: and what we recorded was probably worse than even some of the beta episodes of GeekNights.

335
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:22,107
Rym: Halfway through my news.

336
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,060
Rym: I was like, oh god fuck this.

337
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,052
Scott: It was a pretty terrible on my news.

338
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,340
Scott: and then rims news was even worse.

339
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,019
Rym: My news was like the most epic fail I've ever had.

340
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:36,780
Rym: I basically stated the news and then realized that I didn't have a single thing to say.

341
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:37,763
Rym: Nothing.

342
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,516
Scott: not even I was trying to sort of start something up on his news and all he was just.

343
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:42,339
Scott: he was just going in.

344
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:45,094
Rym: I was like and I was flailing.

345
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:48,224
Rym: I was flailing Jerry But I want.

346
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:51,700
Rym: I want because I'm reading this again and I think it's important and I talk about on Monday.

347
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,599
Rym: But I'm pretty sure anyone who listens to Monday dedicatedly has already read this book.

348
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,356
Rym: Cosmos by Carl Sagan is one of the most brilliant nonfiction works ever written.

349
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,017
Scott: Oh, it's not.

350
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:03,940
Scott: I thought it was a fiction.

351
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:05,670
Scott: No, I don't know anything about.

352
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,641
Scott: I just know who Carl Sagan is and that's a book He wrote.

353
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:13,660
Rym: I was about to say you cannot be considered an erudite and well-read human being unless you have read Carl Sagan's cosmos.

354
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,990
Scott: I haven't read any Carl Sagan ever in my whole life.

355
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:17,356
Scott: I know who is though.

356
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:20,433
Rym: Let me put it this way I read a large portions of.

357
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:21,580
Scott: I know generally who he is.

358
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,835
Rym: I know the about the author that cosmos When I was young on the recommendation of my family and teachers and all sorts of people.

359
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:31,538
Rym: now when I say teachers I mean teachers after I got out of Catholic school.

360
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:42,053
Rym: but Basically Carl Sagan's cosmos is a book that does nothing more than point out How absolutely amazing science is.

361
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:47,954
Rym: now absolutely amazing it is the things we know about the universe and how staggering it is that we know these things.

362
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:53,055
Rym: and even more staggering is the degree of certainty we can say we have about these things.

363
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,071
Rym: and Unlike Richard Dawkins books.

364
00:23:57,091 --> 00:24:01,519
Rym: I mean, I really like Richard Dawkins But he's he is a little abrasive when he writes about religion and that sort of thing.

365
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:05,060
Rym: Carl Sagan this lives is pie.

366
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,910
Rym: The way he writes is mellifluous.

367
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,893
Rym: It's brilliant.

368
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,860
Rym: He's such a good author.

369
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,756
Rym: I cannot stress to you enough how great it is to read anything.

370
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:14,400
Rym: He's ever read.

371
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:19,860
Rym: I'm a Carl Sagan fanboy good God and I randomly started reading cosmos again.

372
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:24,497
Scott: And I just want even when you have all these other things you to read here.

373
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,979
Rym: see that's how you know Something's good like in the anime world.

374
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,797
Rym: We know that cowboy bebop evangelicalian eska flown a try gun.

375
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:39,230
Rym: these shows Utena are like the great shows because people will watch them Multiple times in lieu of watching new things.

376
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,775
Rym: It's the same way with books.

377
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:42,480
Rym: I'll read the prince of nothing again.

378
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,359
Rym: I'll read Carl Sagan's cosmos again.

379
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:50,060
Rym: Considering how many books I want to read that I haven't I can't think of a more glowing recommendation for me personally.

380
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,518
Rym: If you have not read Carl Sagan's cosmos get it now.

381
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,900
Rym: You can get it for like a dollar at every used bookstore in this country.

382
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:58,929
Rym: It's been translated into every language.

383
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:00,174
Rym: I can think of good.

384
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,299
Rym: God should you read this book?

385
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,189
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,936
Rym: I don't know why I was reminded of this But I was looking at John's gonna be real happy.

387
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,665
Rym: yes He is but I was.

388
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:23,660
Rym: I was looking for a thing of the day yesterday in the show that we totally bailed on and I Was kind of I was coming up dry like I was with everything else.

389
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,779
Rym: I kept beating that horse and pumping that well and no blood came out of that stone.

390
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:42,306
Rym: So Suddenly I was looking around and I checked to see if my new episode of some anime was downloaded and I noticed in my incoming directory a Torrent I had downloaded and forgotten about.

391
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:52,050
Rym: this torrent was every single song ever made including almost every remix I think exists from a band that I had forgotten.

392
00:25:52,071 --> 00:26:02,739
Rym: I really freaking liked a lot and Then I realized that a lot of people probably don't know this band exists Or you may have heard their music and not realized who they are or realize the extents of what they do.

393
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:11,494
Scott: so uh Erotic E capital E hyphen capital R. O T I C erotic.

394
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,324
Rym: do not Search for that on YouTube.

395
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,430
Rym: YouTube does not handle the hyphen intelligently.

396
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:19,458
Rym: you will not find erotic music videos.

397
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:25,203
Rym: you will find erotic music videos yes, and Don't do it at work.

398
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,708
Rym: Let me tell you this about.

399
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:34,460
Rym: I was surprised at the number of music videos and Anime music videos set to horrible things.

400
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:39,476
Scott: There is a big crossover between fans of Dance Dance Revolution and fans of anime.

401
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:48,552
Scott: you see so Erotic was like the second most licensed music in If you take all the songs in DDR ever right.

402
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:50,900
Scott: in any DDR mix and you group them by artist.

403
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:54,792
Scott: Captain Jack is the number one most appearing far away.

404
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:57,260
Scott: erotic is the number two most appearing yes?

405
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,571
Rym: I learned about erotic from DDR.

406
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:03,285
Rym: third mix yes, and Their songs?

407
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:03,686
Rym: well here.

Rym: I'll I'll play an example and see if you can.

409
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:07,817
Rym: you can get the gist.

410
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:13,500
Rym: see if this is an exercise From the following what is this song about?

411
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:24,894
Scott: So ring my bell and just entice me.

00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,965
Scott: I need to love it much.

Rym: when he aims he hits.

415
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:49,050
Rym: Oh, please I Know Now how about this song.

Rym: I need your love.

419
00:27:57,914 --> 00:28:00,449
Scott: Say I need a gig and you're so big.

420
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:20,734
Rym: That's right.

421
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:25,070
Rym: their songs are not just you know full of sexual innuendo.

422
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,410
Rym: It's full of outright.

423
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:39,110
Rym: It's a little bit of innuendo, but mostly just straight up like yeah, all right Yeah, and the best part is if you listen to all of their songs They pretty much actually tell a story.

424
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,624
Scott: I mean all the songs that are on the same album in order.

425
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:42,810
Scott: they tell this little story.

426
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,453
Rym: I mean max shouldn't have sex with an egg with his eggs But he did so.

427

00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:50,347
Rym: Dick is out saving people.

429
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:56,850
Rym: It's Now my thing of the day is pretty much just erotic the band in case you didn't know about them.

430
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,221
Rym: So I'm going to link to some of their music videos.

431
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:02,053
Rym: The music videos are not great, though I think the dr.

432
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,279
Rym: Dick one is hilarious.

433
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,203
Scott: They're pretty funny.

434
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:13,646
Rym: Don't watch them at work Yeah or don't watch them if you're offended by a multitude of boobs not attached to women bouncing around and being ridden by like beanbags.

435
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:19,377
Scott: if you think You know Sir makes a lot times ten.

436
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,390
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of like the the music video in the Beavis and Butthead movie.

437
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,318
Rym: It's it's the similar to that style of music video.

438
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:30,270
Rym: All right, and pretty much every music video they ever did is almost the same.

439
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:34,643
Scott: So my thing of the day cuz we're main bit is sports related.

440
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,770
Scott: So my thing of the day is also sports related.

441
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,535
Scott: Here is some hockey's right.

442
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,460
Scott: This guy's taking a penalty shot.

443
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,282
Scott: He's going in.

444
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:47,198
Scott: He's gonna try to score right but He's not looking where he's supposed to be looking.

445
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:50,229
Scott: usually, you know, if you think about when you're playing basketball, right?

446
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:51,973
Scott: You dribble the ball.

447
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:55,825
Scott: you have to but if you are always looking at the ball,

448
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,550
Rym: which I do because I suck at basketball

449
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:05,589
Scott: I don't have to look at the ball But if you can't dribble without looking at the ball while you're dribbling Someone's gonna take the ball away from you because you won't see them coming.

450
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,138
Scott: Apply that to hockey you get the picture.

451
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean imagine someone played soccer looking at their feet the whole time.

452
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,790
Rym: Well, I've seen a lot of videos of football players who are looking at a ball and not looking at what's next to them.

453
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:24,870
Scott: Yeah, yeah No, but the greatest thing about this video is add the goalie does this little victory dance.

454
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,581
Scott: I have seen a lot of hockey victory dances in my time.

455
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:32,333
Scott: that is in the top three for sure No doubt.

456
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,719
Rym: I think that is one of the.

457
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,310
Rym: I think that's in the top ten of victory dances ever.

458
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:44,570
Rym: Oh Like in that to the the premature victory dance the Hannibal took after he took over the Roman countryside.

459
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:53,146
Scott: All right, I'll but I be in the lower half of the top ten Yeah, but somewhere between seven and ten, but it might it might make it.

460
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:57,330
Rym: I'd have to actually compile So intense and it involves multiple stages of action.

461
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:57,731
Rym: It was.

462
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:02,907
Rym: it's definitely a step up from the typical football spike the ball and run in midair.

463
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,316
Scott: Whoo Yeah, it didn't.

464
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,850
Scott: what it lacked though is the cleverness that many victory dances.

465
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:13,970
Rym: I think it made up for the lack of cleverness almost entirely by the sheer guts that it

466
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:29,077
Scott: yes, all right, so Basically, you know we do the GeekNights here and I think we've said a thousand times that you can be a geek about anything Even though our show is about technology anime manga comics video games And everything.

467
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:38,884
Scott: you can be a car you can be a geek about cars You meet geek about sports - yeah I mean, they're the traditional like geeky things like most of the things we talk about.

468
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:43,980
Rym: but remember here at GeekNights We decided and a lot of people use this definition though.

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,290
Rym: I did hear that overseas in yonder Albion.

470
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,977
Rym: They're kind of reversed in Australia.

471
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,444
Rym: I heard it's that way too, but whatever.

472
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,693
Scott: Yeah a geek to us They speak a different language.

473
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:57,088
Rym: They say lift instead of elevated and they when they say pants they don't mean pants.

474
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,308
Scott: That's right It's a different different.

475
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,990
Rym: They don't go on vacation they go on holiday and then they get their zeds anyway.

476
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,976
Scott: So our vocabulary does not apply.

477
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:17,390
Rym: the the American Heritage Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary do not refer to the same thing But to us a geek, you know, well, first of all, there's a normal and a person just a person default state.

478
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,143
Rym: You know like nerds geeks dwarfs what all the different things you can call people.

479
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:28,350
Rym: there's a person a little Venn diagram action And then all these things are subsets of person and one subset of person I would say is geek and another one is nerd.

480
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,538
Rym: And I don't want to get into all the well.

481
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,650
Rym: a dweeb is this but a dork is this but blah blah blah.

482
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:47,574
Rym: but a geek is a normal person who just happens to have a a somewhat wider area of interest than an average person and independently of that has a couple or Maybe more.

483
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:52,370
Rym: but I like if it's more than their Renaissance man, but a few extremely deep areas of interest.

484
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,013
Rym: I mean look at us.

485
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,530
Rym: we're super into podcasting and we're super into German board games.

486
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,903
Rym: We're super into anime and we're kind of into sports and all these other things.

487
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:00,345
Rym: We're geeks.

488
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:01,710
Scott: Yeah, you see a lot of people.

489
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,110
Scott: They're not really super into anything.

490
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:13,067
Scott: You know like you can always tell because like you see like a retired person right like rims retired grandpa Right made it was super carpenter man, right?

491
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:19,806
Scott: Yep Is a carpenter geek and my grandpa he was a mechanic his whole life, but when he retired.

492
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:33,335
Rym: he was super Carpenter not Mechanic-ing but also with the golfing and other things, you know, yep So like the normal person has the sphere of influence the geek has these slightly water sphere of influence with some spikes Just shooting out of it.

493
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,586
Scott: Yeah, as long as you got a spike somewhere you're geek.

494
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,389
Rym: now the nerd.

495
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:37,774
Scott: No, we're done.

496
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:41,035
Rym: But I just want to say a nerd is Instead of a sphere.

497
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:44,949
Rym: It's kind of like a line going in one direction with nothing else.

498
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:52,715
Scott: Alright, but anyway, so many geeky people who are usually interested in you know technology anime Board games and such.

499
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:56,307
Scott: they often look down on sports, especially like spectating sports.

500
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,035
Scott: Like you see people Spectating NASCAR and you go.

501
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:00,660
Scott: I don't like those people.

502
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:07,830
Scott: or you see people like, you know sitting on their couch going Watching footballs with some beer you go and I like those people.

503
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,958
Scott: Yeah Sort of a a cultural conflict of sorts.

504
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,623
Rym: like you see that I think a good real.

505
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:16,016
Rym: the best example of it is in high School and even in a lot of workplaces.

506
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:20,237
Rym: you see that there's three kinds of people when it comes to say the Super Bowl Giants won.

507
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,529
Rym: it's a pretty good example here.

508
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,208
Rym: So you've got the normal people who just don't care like they they like it or they don't.

509
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,630
Rym: they don't care.

510
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,469
Rym: What other people think Super Bowl happened great?

511
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,850
Rym: There's the people who care about the Super Bowl the sports geeks and the sports nerds and they care about it.

512
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,373
Rym: That's their thing.

513
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,330
Rym: and they're like, yeah the Super Bowl and they talk about it.

514
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,774
Rym: You talk about things you're interested in.

515
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:41,969
Rym: and then there's those people who make a point of saying Super Bowl is stupid.

516
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:43,304
Rym: I hate the Super Bowl.

517
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:50,429
Rym: It's a You stupid woo solo cup wave and beer drinking jock bastards and your stupid Super Bowl.

518
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:55,170
Rym: That affects my life in ways that you can't even understand because they're not real and I'm just lonely.

519
00:34:56,292 --> 00:35:05,430
Scott: Yeah, now see the thing is when it comes to the Super Bowl itself Like I'm not a big fan of like the you know beer and pretzels commercial watching Super Bowl culture.

520
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:11,910
Scott: But the football itself, you know, it's a quality sport and it's worth paying attention to.

521
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,697
Scott: you Might be.

522
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,656
Scott: you know, a lot of people say Spectating sports is stupid.

523
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,792
Scott: Just play them as if there's somehow, you know two Things.

524
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:21,377
Scott: you can't both do both at once.

525
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:24,728
Rym: It's kind of like saying watching movies is stupid.

526
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,289
Rym: Just make them.

527
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,761
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can make and watch.

528
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,570
Scott: there's no reason you can't do both.

529
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:34,724
Scott: You know, there there is merit to playing sports and there is merit to watching sports.

530
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,830
Scott: They are not mutually exclusive in any way.

531
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,598
Rym: Yeah, no, we're not saying you have to like it.

532
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,868
Rym: It's not like you have to like everything in the world.

533
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:44,400
Rym: I mean I Don't particularly like watching curling.

534
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,750
Rym: Yeah me or do I like doing curling?

535
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,572
Scott: However, if someone says I don't like particularly like watching certain TV shows that are not sports, you know It's like you.

536
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:55,283
Scott: people like some things and don't like other things.

537
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,170
Rym: Yeah now I have my opinions about things.

538
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,069
Rym: I mean for example World of Warcraft, I think everyone knows my opinion on.

539
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:03,269
Rym: But at the same time people are free to do whatever they want.

540
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,007
Rym: Yeah, and I think it's stupid, but I think it's stupid.

541
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:06,329
Rym: I don't go.

542
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:08,369
Rym: well I guess I do go around telling people it's stupid.

543
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,617
Rym: So that shoots that out of the water.

544
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,744
Rym: but I digress do as I say not as I do

545
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:30,660
Scott: but it basically I want to Try to you know cuz I actually you know some sports I care about and sometimes I don't and my level of caring sort of goes up and Down and I want to sort of try to explain it to people who may be anti sport Why there is merit to sports spectating or

546
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,208
Rym: at least what the appeal is to people who care about it.

547
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:36,139
Rym: I mean You all you geeks and nerds out there.

548
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,919
Rym: you've been in this situation before where you meet someone you're like Yeah, anime and they're like what anime is stupid.

549
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,964
Rym: No one should like anime.

550
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,350
Rym: and then you try to explain No, anime is not stupid.

551
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:50,955
Rym: You just got to watch cowboy Viva and and they give you all the reasons you should like anime or you give them all the Reasons that they should like anime.

552
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,410
Rym: we're gonna do the same thing to you from the sports perspective, right?

553
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,655
Rym: No, it's a taste your own medicine.

554
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:58,850
Scott: All right, so people they like to be entertained, right?

555
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,530
Scott: And what is the oldest way of entertaining people?

556
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:02,613
Rym: Sex.

557
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,964
Scott: Okay, the second oldest way of entertaining masturbation.

558
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:11,177
Scott: That's the same as number one For some people right.

559
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:17,279
Scott: the old the oldest way of entertaining people right is Hearing or telling stories, right?

560
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,750
Scott: It's all about a good story right now Stories you read, you know, like you read your novels, right?

561
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:36,863
Scott: It's a fictional story and you know because of human feelings in the way You know brains work you when you hear a story or you experience a story through some medium You are entertained in some way it can.

562
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:43,750
Scott: it can affect your emotions Depending on how attached you are to the story and the quality of the story and how you relate to the story, etc.

563
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:51,110
Scott: etc, right so Sports themselves, you know from a playing perspective is a is a physical competition.

564
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:51,311
Scott: It's.

565
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:53,143
Scott: it's no different than like playing a game, right?

566
00:37:53,163 --> 00:38:07,604
Scott: You're trying to win a game But from a spectators perspective a sport or you know, especially like a professional sporting league is Sort of this space in which stories emerge almost like a role-playing game.

567
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:14,830
Scott: in many ways you create this system and People work within that system trying to achieve various goals.

568
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:28,178
Scott: But anyone looking at that system from the outside or even in the you know, if you are on the inside But you take a meta view These stories emerge and those stories can often be Epic and amazing in many many ways.

569
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:36,950
Scott: and the thing is not only can it generate these amazing stories But the stories are real the real people doing real things.

570
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,890
Scott: It's not like a role-playing game where you pretend to create a crazy story.

571
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,419
Scott: It's a real story.

572
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,692
Scott: and the story, you know It.

573
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,703
Scott: it the way it turns out.

574
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:51,244
Scott: you're watching these games Live and the story you don't know what's gonna happen.

575
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:52,490
Scott: No one knows what's gonna happen.

576
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:58,030
Scott: It's up to real people to do something real that'll actually happens before your eyes.

577
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:01,690
Rym: Live now that there are a lot of other aspects to this.

578
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,092
Rym: I mean we.

579
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:07,115
Rym: there was a Ted that Scott talked about on Friday night party line a while ago about Synthesized happiness.

580
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:10,709
Rym: now mention rivalries and the drama and you know the things unfolding.

581
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:19,235
Rym: Here's a real examples because talking about it in the kind of academic terms of well people want stories and people To care about this and that is good.

582
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,106
Rym: But the visceral examples I think are what really it's like.

583
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,089
Rym: drive the point home.

584
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,248
Rym: So the old r.i.t I'm the r.i.t.

585
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:29,035
Rym: Hockey Now well one there's also.

586
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:39,086
Rym: I want to point out that for all you geeks who don't live in the northern or north eastern But also northwestern United States or Canada or the Nordic lands or Russia Russia.

587
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:42,221
Rym: Well, sorry, I'm a pockner I don't know what this Russia thing I was talking about.

588
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:54,629
Rym: But uh hockey is Extremely popular in many many many tech schools I mean RIT MIT Caltech even if they didn't always have the best hockey teams RIT being the exception having an awesome hockey team.

589
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:58,750
Rym: Nerds like hockey a lot and they always have in the north.

590
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,856
Rym: so there are sports that nerds like.

591
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,943
Rym: but aside from all that it's RIT.

592
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:16,490
Rym: hockey is fun and we enjoy it, but there was a rivalry at RIT until recently when we basically Ascended and transcended the old ways and moved into the real like full-on division of the NCAA Division one.

593
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,450
Rym: But we had a rivalry with the school Elmira.

594
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:21,757
Rym: Elmira was some like crap.

595
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:29,999
Rym: Oh school in the middle of nowhere like one of those little colleges as a backwater middle of the nowhere school Hicks, I Mean, I wouldn't malign it too much, but it's a school.

596
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,325
Scott: I can malign it plenty.

597
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:34,676
Rym: Well, well, all right I gotta put my hockey hat back on.

598
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:43,766
Rym: Elmira was a hell basically where devil's incarnate rose Periodically to attempt to defeat the valiant tigers and epic copycock at combat.

599
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:44,830
Rym: Yeah, okay.

600
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:51,490
Rym: So games against Elmira weren't really that special because all myrias hockey team was pretty good, but they weren't that great.

601
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:56,890
Scott: Yeah, I guess preview, you know before we got there It was sort of like RIT and Elmira.

602
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:04,570
Scott: But Elmira sort of got worse as the years went on and RIT got better and some other teams got better and other teams Like Newman were always terrible.

603
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:25,550
Rym: Yeah, so as a result Normally if I just gone to a hockey game against Elmira It would have been an average hockey name would have been anything special and it would have been the same for the Elmira people when RIT went to play there, but just through the years this Rivalry kind of sprung up where both schools would think about the other school to two entities that have nothing to do with each other.

604
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,483
Rym: There was no reason anyone from Elmira would even know anyone from RIT.

605
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,530
Rym: most likely they're just they're so far apart.

606
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,072
Rym: No one cared.

607
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:46,372
Rym: No, but because of this rivalry the two schools would really get into it and whenever there's a game at RIT pretty much everyone from Elmira would come to RIT fill the other half of the arena and all hell would break loose and Vice versa.

608
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:51,830
Rym: every time the game was at Elmira and it became like this huge deal and it was super fun.

609
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,328
Rym: It was like having a tiny little.

610
00:41:53,851 --> 00:42:00,630
Rym: Imagine if you had an anime convention where half the people love cowboy bebop and half the people hated cowboy bebop and everyone knew that.

611
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:06,907
Scott: No, oh Yeah, it's just people attach these these feelings to something.

612
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:09,557
Scott: it's sort of like You know you have.

613
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:17,190
Scott: if you go to let's say you go to see The Roman Colosseum right and there's two gladiators right and they fight each other.

614
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:20,550
Scott: Well, okay, you're seeing two guys fight each other's pretty barbaric.

615
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:27,824
Scott: It could even be like, you know unpleasant right, but you know Let's say one of those gladiators was your gladiator.

616
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:39,430
Scott: you you paid for them Or gladiator gladiator, you know, that was your guy, you know Like just like when you play World of Warcraft and it's your avatar in there except the gladiator is your guy.

617
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,386
Scott: It's the same thing.

618
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:46,326
Scott: So now suddenly you have a real investment in the results and you start to care about it.

619
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:53,230
Scott: and when you care about something The what happens to that something now has the power to affect you in an emotional way.

620
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:57,344
Scott: So the rivalry between RIT and Elmira isn't a physical thing.

621
00:42:57,384 --> 00:42:58,970
Scott: It's a law of the universe or anything.

622
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,797
Rym: It's not like they're fighting over territory.

623
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,070
Rym: It's not like there's a cat point in between RIT and Elmira.

624
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:12,549
Scott: Yeah, and we got some fat dude standing there, but because people attach this emotional, you know We don't like Elmira, but we do like RIT.

625
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,006
Scott: Why is just the way it is?

626
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:26,358
Scott: Because it makes it more fun and it creates this fun around watching what happens and when you score and you beat them With two seconds left on the clock You scream like crazy.

627
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:41,350
Rym: I mean, it's very analogous to the soccer people or the football people in Europe where you could almost say that soccer has replaced warfare in Terms of like the expression of national pride and nationalism in Europe.

628
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:47,120
Scott: Yeah, pretty much at least between the European countries, you know Yeah, and many other countries around the world as well.

629
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,482
Rym: Just not the US and also beyond that It's I mean, you know go to an anime con right?

630
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,010
Rym: I guess anime is easy example.

631
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,342
Rym: But all right, you go to some sort of event.

632
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,930
Rym: We've we've seen this a lot.

633
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,278
Rym: we should do a show in the anime day on exactly how to do this, but you're you're.

634
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:06,890
Rym: you see an event and The person up on the front will yell or say something and the whole like it's not anything special.

635
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:09,657
Rym: they said Final Fantasy or was it?

636
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:10,018
Rym: was it?

637
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:11,984
Rym: or whatever thing it is that will trigger people.

638
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:18,323
Rym: and if it was just one person there Like someone walked up to you and said hey Final Fantasy you'd probably go.

639
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:19,489
Rym: Yeah, what about it?

640
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:26,783
Rym: but if you're in a crowd and there's meaning you like, you know You're in a crowd of people who love Final Fantasy and some guy on stage yells.

641
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,710
Rym: So how about that Final Fantasy?

642
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,928
Rym: You're gonna get the crowd screaming back and making a big deal about it and having fun.

643
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,174
Rym: Well Sports are the same thing.

644
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:48,470
Rym: you get a bunch of people who you know are all there for one purpose and they're of a like Mind or of the exact opposite mind and it creates this kind of group experience much like watching a movie with a group of people And making fun of it and almost getting kicked out of the theater.

645
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:55,681
Scott: Now the other good the great thing about sports is that you know, it's a physical thing It's the feats of strength.

646
00:44:55,782 --> 00:45:02,269
Scott: It could be fast paced It could be slow paced right but in in as people on the field or they're trying to win a lot.

647
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:12,370
Scott: You know they and you know Hopefully at least and in there trying to win they might do some crazy things or due to randomness crazy things can happen.

648
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,199
Scott: I mean ice hockey is on ice.

649
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,822
Scott: think about that, you know, you look at other sports like, you know They have the basketball with the trampolines and everyone looks at that like a gimmick.

650
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:24,156
Scott: ice hockey is on ice People are on ice.

651
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:29,469
Rym: It doesn't get more gimmicky than that, you know, I just keep imagining baseball on ice and I think I'd enjoy it.

652
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,778
Scott: Yeah, right.

653
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,270
Scott: It's like what's gimmicky?

654
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,370
Scott: Everyone has to stand on something super slippery and they can fall down and hurt themselves with blades on their feet wielding spears.

655
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:48,419
Rym: Yeah Most gimmicky sport there is yeah, and if you spare someone all that happens is you get two or four minutes in a little box Right.

656
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:58,250
Scott: I Mean during the course of most sporting events, you know Crazy things might happen like just watch the Super Bowl and watch that Eli Manning play.

657
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:58,751
Scott: Look at that.

658
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,617
Scott: Look at look in slow motion.

659
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:01,599
Scott: What happened there?

660
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,485
Scott: They tried to grab a guy.

661
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:07,336
Scott: he somehow crazily Inexplicably got away.

662
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:08,723
Scott: He threw the ball.

663
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:13,105
Scott: some guy caught it crazily in a crazy way, but he ended up with it.

664
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:21,923
Scott: and It's just like wow, that's a physical thing that oh my god I'm not editing that out.

665
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:22,549
Rym: We're live.

666
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:24,119
Rym: Prepare for katsukan.

667
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,206
Scott: Well, that's I fell on my face.

668
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:25,709
Scott: That's great.

669
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,980
Scott: You know crazy things happened and it's amazing.

670
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,168
Scott: you watch these feats of strength that people achieve in while they are Striving towards a goal and you know you watch, you know, like owned videos on YouTube.

671
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:45,469
Scott: or you watch You know videos on YouTube like rims thing of the day yesterday doing pull-ups off of a you know, a crane or or?

672
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,820
Rym: Sasuke aka ninja warrior.

673
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,544
Scott: ninja warrior.

674
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,047
Scott: Awesome.

675
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:49,550
Scott: Awesome.

676
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:55,094
Rym: Actually one of my favorite things and the only reason I don't do it anymore is that I have in fact seen I think every Episode of it.

677
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:57,810
Rym: but the old American gladiators, I love that show.

678
00:46:57,971 --> 00:47:00,404
Scott: Yeah, I wonder if the new one's any good, but I heard some are.

679
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,590
Scott: I doubt I'm gonna be watching.

680
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:03,901
Rym: I heard that some RIT alum was on it either.

681
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:04,947
Rym: I think it's a contestant.

682
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:05,550
Rym: I heard he won.

683
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,500
Scott: I gotta look into that like to look into that.

684
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:30,033
Scott: but yeah, it is fun You know in a sports context or not to watch other humans achieve physical greatness or even non-physical greatness, so In watching a live sport there is always that excitement of you know They're in a tough situation or something needs to happen and then something crazy happens and you go Holy shit.

685
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:34,190
Scott: that just not only does that make a great story, right?

686
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,924
Scott: But you see live the human achieving something.

687
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:39,887
Scott: it oh, it's amazing.

688
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:40,930
Scott: It can be amazing.

689
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,397
Scott: Anyway, it's not always amazing.

690
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,270
Rym: and also I mean and a lot of the other hate is people.

691
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:46,499
Rym: Oh people always look at.

692
00:47:46,519 --> 00:48:04,550
Rym: there's almost the stereotype that jocks are into sports and nerds are into dungeons and dragons, but Hi, you know, I think that a lot of geeks and nerds out there really kind of Overestimate the difference between the football watching football nerd and and the D&D playing D&D nerd.

693
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:08,329
Rym: Because if you look if you talk to a person who's really into football, right?

694
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:22,781
Rym: now first talk to someone's really into Dungeons and Dragons and they're gonna tell you about the character who has a 17 strength and they're gonna debate the did the like the different finer points of controlling an orb of annihilation and Whether or not stone skin is an unbalanced spell.

695
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,950
Rym: and well like that goes something something.

696
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:32,850
Rym: Talk to some football nerds and they're gonna talk about the statistics of last year's team versus this year And this guy got traded to this guy.

697
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,660
Rym: So I think the offense is gonna turn on this.

698
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:42,690
Scott: turn on your local sports radio AM station right and listen to the people calling in and talking to the radio hosts and what these people are saying.

699
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:49,190
Rym: Those are where all the sports nerds are and then go listen to like Wow radio or one of those podcasts about World of Warcraft.

700
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:49,812
Rym: You know what?

701
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:52,221
Rym: They're talking the exact same way.

702
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,148
Rym: They're just talking about Wow instead of football.

703
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:54,630
Rym: Yep

704
00:48:55,191 --> 00:49:13,375
Scott: I mean another thing is that you know, a lot of people right they I really believe that there are a lot of people in the world who are sort of built to like certain things and But they don't end up actually liking all the things that they would like simply because they don't.

705
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:22,050
Scott: you know, either the it's too hard for them to get the Information necessary to realize they like it or they have some sort of prejudice against it, right?

706
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:26,528
Rym: I think a good example is we've had some friends who swore up and down robot shows.

707
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:28,556
Rym: suck I don't want to watch some stupid robot show.

708
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:38,934
Rym: They're all stupid and then eventually we were able to convince them that hey Eska flown a and Evangeline arguably two of the greatest anime ever made Involve robots.

709
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:40,881
Rym: you might say they are robot shows.

710
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:42,467
Rym: However, they're good.

711
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:43,330
Rym: You will like them.

712
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:44,991
Rym: I guarantee you will like them you're.

713
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:53,373
Rym: the only reason you think you won't like them is because you have this preconceived notion that all robot shows are like Ghekhi Ganga Mazinger Nothing.

714
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:54,378
Rym: Yep, granted.

715
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,630
Rym: You're allowed to like those shows too, but for an entirely different reason.

716
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:03,493
Scott: Yes, and you know a lot of people like they watch NASCAR right and they say oh, it's driving around a circle It sucks now.

717
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,522
Scott: I'm not a big NASCAR fan.

718
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:05,863
Scott: I'm not.

719
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:07,289
Scott: I'm not gonna defend it, you know.

720
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:13,937
Scott: But what I will say is that net there is a lot more to NASCAR than people give it credit for.

721
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:25,150
Scott: and the reason they just don't know is because they turn it on the TV and they see cars Driving around a circle and it really you have to be a geek about it or look into it to find out.

722
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:27,204
Scott: Because the drama is not in.

723
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:31,610
Scott: in many sports At least the drama is not in the obviously visible things.

724
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,310
Scott: The drama is in the behind or slightly behind the scenes information.

725
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:42,487
Scott: And if you don't follow the sport at least a little bit if you don't you know Listen to what the story is.

726
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:51,647
Scott: You're just watching the physical events without the story behind it and you're not going to enjoy that no matter how great the sport is because the enjoyment is all about the story.

727
00:50:51,667 --> 00:51:05,659
Scott: and like if you don't know who the racers are or what the relationship between them is or You know who has more points than who or how this points work or how the sport works or the rules of the game The drama is lost on you.

728
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:14,850
Scott: I mean if you're watching a football game and You know, it's it's fourth and goal, you know And is like two seconds left in the game, right?

729
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:21,470
Scott: If you don't realize what that means you're not gonna be in a suspenseful, you're not gonna be in suspense.

730
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:26,104
Scott: You have to know a lot about sports to understand the same way.

731
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:26,546
Scott: people.

732
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:38,618
Scott: if someone's you know Comes over to your D&D game or your game of Puerto Rico or any of your you know Your World of Warcraft and you're running some you know Crazy thing fighting some giant boss or something right.

733
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:46,530
Scott: somebody comes up and knows nothing about it is just gonna see the barest Visual, you know obvious things about what are going on.

734
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,660
Scott: Oh, so you're clicking repeatedly on a box and your guys swinging.

735
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,174
Scott: you think back and forth and there's a dragon moving around and you're Like no, don't you get.

736
00:51:54,775 --> 00:52:05,170
Scott: but because they don't know the drama is lost and I think a lot of people who are looked out On sports don't you know bother because of maybe prejudice or other reasons to at least?

737
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:10,075
Scott: Listen to the story or try to get information about the story So that the drama.

738
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:15,797
Scott: this is no chance for them to like it because they don't even put the slightest effort into Discovering the story in the drama.

739
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:16,580
Rym: now at the same time.

740
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,830
Rym: We're not saying you have to like it.

741
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,435
Scott: I don't like anything.

742
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:21,519
Rym: baseball is a good example.

743
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,864
Rym: I understand baseball.

744
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:24,730
Rym: I know about a lot of the drama going on.

745
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,957
Rym: I understand the rules fully.

746
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:31,801
Rym: I can look at a baseball game and watch it and think all right Well this and this and this and I see where other people could get their drama from.

747
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:36,953
Rym: I however find no drama in it and find it Incredibly boring.

748
00:52:36,973 --> 00:52:40,103
Rym: then I cannot enjoy baseball unless I'm playing it.

749
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:43,537
Rym: Yeah, and I think another important thing It's not really related to mean like.

750
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:49,410
Scott: I don't like basketball, you know because you know Even though I understand basketball used to play basketball, right?

751
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:56,390
Scott: It's the fact they're scoring so often that I find, you know, very little, you know, incredibly exciting situations.

752
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,390
Scott: That's why a lot of people say, you know, basketball is only exciting in the last few seconds.

753
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:07,689
Scott: Well, even then it's only exciting last few seconds If the game is really close and I really think that basketball would be better served by being just a five-minute game.

754
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:12,366
Scott: Just play for five minutes and that's it and you know because you're scoring so often.

755
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:17,465
Rym: or just uh Make the court twice as long and put the baskets ten feet higher.

756
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,650
Scott: Yeah, that would be cool, too.

757
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:19,627
Scott: I have no problem with that.

758
00:53:20,091 --> 00:53:26,691
Rym: But at the same time I guess there's also the idea that if you're gonna really decide you don't like something you're gonna hate on It.

759
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:30,550
Rym: you at least learn enough about it to explain your hate.

760
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:33,361
Rym: I mean Scott and I don't like World of Warcraft at all.

761
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:37,365
Rym: And if you ask us well, Rym and Scott What don't you like about World of Warcraft?

762
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:37,829
Rym: I have a book.

763
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:40,629
Rym: I have a book ready to go just sitting on my tongue to come out.

764
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:43,510
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of people they'll say oh, why do you hate NASCAR?

765
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,970
Scott: They say it's cars driving around a circle or even Wow, and that's all they can say.

766
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:47,472
Rym: There's been.

767
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:54,960
Rym: there's been a lot of people in conversations I've had who have agreed with me that yeah World of Warcraft is crap But they agree, but they don't have anything.

768
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,124
Rym: they can't back that up.

769
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:58,130
Scott: They'll just say yeah people get addicted to it.

770
00:53:58,431 --> 00:53:59,093
Scott: It's not good.

771
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:00,558
Scott: It's a waste of time and money.

772
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:03,267
Scott: and I'm like, is that the best argument you've got?

773
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:10,321
Scott: because if so I don't want you on my team, even though you agree with me It's kind of like getting the endorsement from the KKK when you're running for president.

774
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:11,224
Rym: You're like, yeah.

775
00:54:11,304 --> 00:54:11,766
Rym: Thanks.

776
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:12,890
Rym: Yeah, that's great.

777
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:14,014
Scott: It's like great you.

778
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:23,950
Scott: that means you agree with me about something, you know, and even if I got to figure out what that is Even if it's something like states rights, which I'll say, okay, you know, but I don't watch you.

779
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:26,830
Scott: Yeah, cuz your reasons for agreeing with me are not good.

780
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,801
Rym: but there's another very important factor here and I see this a lot in.

781
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:33,820
Rym: I actually saw many of our younger listeners and a lot of younger geeks and nerds out there.

782
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:40,090
Rym: you're in school and The cool thing for smart kids to do is to be all down on gym class and to hate on sports.

783
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,113
Rym: You know what?

784
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:44,443
Rym: I'm gonna tell you right now as an uber geek.

785
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:49,242
Scott: See and my high school is weird cuz Smart people were also letting.

786
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:50,690
Rym: my high school was also weird.

787
00:54:50,951 --> 00:55:04,324
Rym: The band was much more popular than the football team and our band was popular But pretty much everyone on the football team and everyone in the band were all in the AP classes, too And like all the the so-called popular clique were all like that.

788
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:05,950
Rym: honors valedictorian kids.

789
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:07,256
Scott: Yeah, there was no see in.

790
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:10,370
Scott: my class is basically people who did shit and people who didn't do anything.

791
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:13,429
Scott: It wasn't people doing this versus people doing something different.

792
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:18,350
Scott: Is that the people who are doing things were usually smart and people were dumb usually didn't do anything?

793
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,224
Rym: Yeah, and it seemed like the same people were doing everything.

794
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:26,270
Rym: the kid who was the valedictorian Was also in the football team and also in the band and also the head.

795
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:29,310
Scott: So he played a bunch of football then got any unit switch uniform.

796
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,149
Scott: Oh, you realize you're on the field and switch uniforms again when we marched at home games, right?

797
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:49,929
Rym: We there would be like six people in the in the marching band lineup who marched in their football uniform and then as soon as we broke at the end of the show if Like the opening show and the the anthem and everything they ran over to the football team and then at halftime They ran back over to the band and marched in the show.

798
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:52,726
Scott: Didn't they get a little tired?

799
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,837
Scott: Yes Did your football team lose as a result?

800
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:57,527
Rym: our football team lost because no one gave a shit about it.

801
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:58,170
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

802
00:55:58,312 --> 00:55:58,990
Rym: I mean look at this way.

803
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,648
Rym: We had a football games right the curve because we had a full like stadium in our high school and this crowd.

804
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:11,850
Rym: the stands would be packed Halftime would come and after the band show pretty much everyone left and that no one was there to watch the rest of the game.

805
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,905
Scott: That's one more thing about sports.

806
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:25,890
Scott: Is that You know when you're an anime fan or a nerd right and you go to a convention or something and you go to the convention Because you know, it's it's a chance to be together with people of your same culture.

807
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:30,890
Scott: It's like ah, I feel at home with these complete strangers who who I share something with.

808
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,630
Scott: We have a common interest to come and bond.

809
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:43,530
Rym: I mean as we've said geeks are kind of a global entity in that all of you listening to the show Probably have more in common with some geek in Norway and some geek in Japan and some geek in Hong Kong.

810
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:50,417
Rym: Then you do with a lot of the people who live in very close proximity to you physically Right and sports are very similar.

811
00:56:50,457 --> 00:57:02,762
Scott: when I go to like giant Stadium right to go see a game You're like high-five and all the people near you and you're all cheering and you're striking up Conversations about whether they should trade this player that player.

812
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,227
Scott: you're walking through the.

813
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:05,715
Scott: you know The parking lot.

814
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:08,030
Scott: people are you know all tailgating sharing?

815
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,858
Rym: Here's another benefit of liking sports.

816
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:21,256
Rym: if you got you like anime cons, right Basically, every sporting event is like an anime con for sports geeks and there's live me depending on the sport There's a lot of them mean.

817
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:23,126
Scott: Yeah, you get season tickets to baseball.

818
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:27,130
Scott: That's expensive But you're going to a lot of games a whole lot of games.

819
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:34,944
Rym: But the point I was gonna make before about the kid the younger kids is that there's a lot of this hate on Sports and as a result a lot of kids don't like.

820
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:41,347
Rym: they try to get out of gym classes They don't want to join sports teams and they say oh, well, I only care about the academics.

821
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:42,110
Rym: I don't need sports.

822
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:48,830
Rym: I'm of the mind very strongly that everyone who has the ability to should receive a well-rounded education.

823
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:55,470
Scott: There is a lot of evidence a whole lot of evidence that suggests that you know kids who are there.

824
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,702
Scott: Well, I think it's a strong correlation pot and most likely causation.

825
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:08,250
Scott: people doing extra things like, you know Sports and or music and such do much better in the you know academic parts of the school.

826
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:08,831
Scott: Yeah,

827
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,296
Rym: but I think it's many

828
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:11,439
Scott: studies supporting that

829
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:23,710
Rym: peep and not just for sports, but with everything I think early schooling I mean up right up until the point where you have to decide What direction you're going in your life and what you're gonna specialize in or at least right up to the level of your raw?

830
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,221
Rym: Physical mental ability and physical physical ability.

831
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:41,665
Rym: I think everyone should learn a lot of Shallow depth about as much as possible in order to give them a more well-rounded Life and a more well-rounded ability to exist in the world make intelligent decisions and live.

832
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:44,714
Rym: people who specialize too much in any direction Too early.

833
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:47,649
Rym: I think have a lot of problems in their lives later on.

834
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,661
Rym: Exceptions to be made for savants and crazy geniuses.

835
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:52,323
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:58:52,503 --> 00:58:58,325
Rym: Yeah, but if you're a normal dude, you're thinking I don't need to know any of that math or any of that that they're sports.

837
00:58:58,626 --> 00:58:59,490
Rym: I'm gonna be a writer.

838
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:03,606
Rym: You're probably not gonna be a good writer as a result unless you're some prodigy.

839
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:12,550
Scott: Yeah, the classic Stereotyped nerd jock war I think is something that only exists in the minds of people who perpetrated like a second-order simulacra.

840
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:18,069
Rym: Yeah, exactly That's been on my mind lately with this whole anonymous thing.

841
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:21,269
Scott: Yeah, so do you wanna join to say anything else about this?

842
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:26,490
Rym: Yeah, okay.

843
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:35,909
Rym: Yeah, one other thing if you uh, if you live anywhere near Rochester, New York, all right, you're a geek and You want to see what we're talking about?

844
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,157
Rym: Go to figure out the schedule.

845
00:59:38,177 --> 00:59:42,979
Rym: good like RIT athletics calm look at these schedule for Yes, unless they changed it.

846
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:48,569
Rym: All right, and you can check it while I'm talking and Go see when what these schedule is for RIT hockey games.

847
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:55,964
Rym: Go to an RIT home hockey game and when you walk into the hockey arena You walk into the front doors.

848
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:56,650
Rym: you paid your tickets.

849
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,569
Rym: There's a press box in the luxury box above you.

850
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:07,410
Scott: Go to your left go all the way above you as in on top of your heads Like you have to walk around to be able to see them and go back to the back left corner.

851
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:10,990
Rym: There will be a bunch of people there many of them wearing orange shirts.

852
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,597
Rym: some of them are loud and scary.

853
01:00:13,058 --> 01:00:19,703
Rym: sit near them, but not among them and Just see what happens throughout the course of this hockey game.

854
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:24,707
Rym: You'll there's a good chance You'll become a hockey fan or at least an RIT hockey fan.

855
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:27,746
Scott: Wow I see hockey plays a lot more games than he used to notice in d1.

856
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:30,965
Rym: Yeah Oh, that's the other thing RIT hockey, but they're not doing that.

857
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:31,649
Scott: Well this year.

858
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,055
Rym: Well that that's the thing.

859
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:36,728
Rym: RIT hockey was a little different when we were there because we've told the story before.

860
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:41,295
Rym: but briefly There used to be three divisions of college hockey One two and three.

861
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:49,830
Rym: the lower the number the higher the skill the higher the stakes and like closer to real sports Or professional sports or people who will go on to be sports players.

862
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,282
Rym: RIT was in division two and they were near the top of division two.

863
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:55,030
Rym: They're one of the best teams in division two.

864
01:00:56,132 --> 01:01:04,050
Rym: division two disappeared and Teams were a long time ago into either division one or division three based on certain criteria.

865
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:10,829
Rym: The criteria did not involve how good they were necessarily but other things and the NCAA is crazy And you know what?

866
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:20,143
Rym: there's a lot of stories and drama surrounding how the NCAA is crazy due to a fluke and The fact that RIT does not have a football team and probably never will again.

867
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:36,470
Rym: after something that happened, I think in the late 60s RIT did not have enough sports teams to qualify for division one due to an obscure rule that is designed to prevent a school From putting all their money into one sport becoming the best in that and ignoring everything else.

868
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:37,455
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of.

869
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:40,189
Scott: there's a lot of sports NCAA craziness like that.

870
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,215
Rym: So RIT was put in division three.

871
01:01:42,676 --> 01:01:50,646
Rym: now when one of the best teams in division two now basically has to play against people who I'm better at hockey than a lot of these people.

872
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,010
Rym: All right Personally, and that's not much of an exaggeration.

873
01:01:54,717 --> 01:02:00,600
Rym: so as a result RIT kicked the ever-living crap out of people every game.

874
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,467
Rym: They once beat a team a team known as Newman.

875
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:09,957
Rym: Hello Newman to zero In hockey.

876
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,445
Scott: that that's like a that's a crazy.

877
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:12,450
Scott: that's like a football score.

878
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:20,109
Rym: It's like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where someone hits the ball in the baseball game and they just keep like cha-cha up and hitting a home run and cha-cha.

879
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,326
Rym: The game was like that.

880
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:26,433
Scott: that was That was some game.

881
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:40,556
Rym: So basically going to RIT hockey games was an exercise in well sadism counting And Elementary arithmetic and also just the ritual and the thing and like, you know Here's another good thing.

882
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:43,470
Rym: a lot of geeks and nerds are into the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

883
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:55,786
Rym: You know that ritualized thing where everyone goes and they watch the movie and people act out and yell things at certain times And there's like this this half performance half ritual event that people do it.

884
01:02:56,288 --> 01:02:57,030
Rym: It's super awesome.

885
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,270
Rym: We should do a show about that sometime because I really dig that Rocky Horror action.

886
01:03:00,672 --> 01:03:05,210
Rym: Sorry, but we should have someone on for that though Yeah, we should have someone who's more into that cultures.

887
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:07,001
Scott: I've only ever I like seen part of.

888
01:03:07,102 --> 01:03:11,990
Scott: you know, I know they do this thing But I really you know, it's not my thing and I don't know all the things about it.

889
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:13,324
Rym: I've been to it a few times.

890
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:13,890
Rym: I enjoy it.

891
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,629
Rym: I do not know enough about the subculture to speak as an authority, but I enjoy what it is.

892
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:30,460
Rym: I couldn't do a whole show on it, but The hockey games in colleges, especially at RIT, but MIT at a similar tradition are ritualized in that exact same way and It's it's incredibly fun.

893
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:31,949
Rym: I cannot stress this enough.

894
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:41,604
Rym: We have so many friends who hated loud things and hated sports and hockey and we convinced him to go to RIT hockey games And they became hockey fans within about 15 minutes.

895
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:48,399
Scott: There's one more thing I got to say that I think we'll end it right is that you know the the primary Entertainment and sports spectating.

896
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:49,404
Scott: is the story right?

897
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:53,261
Scott: and you know You can get a lot of the story from the sports pages and whatever.

898
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:57,195
Scott: but really a lot of the story Isn't something you can see.

899
01:03:57,495 --> 01:04:02,088
Scott: watching the game itself watching the game itself is sort of like watching only the combat in D&D.

900
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:03,653
Rym: Oh god.

901
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:05,923
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it's quite that bad.

902
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:09,814
Scott: Well, it's like watching only the fights in Naruto So watching Naruto.

903
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:22,490
Scott: Yes, a lot of the story in sports is like it is semi fictional or Dramaticized and there are people who make a living as sports writers and they basically create this story.

904
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:26,848
Scott: They make up new drama, you know on the sports pages in the paper and on.

905
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:28,693
Scott: you know ESPN and other shows.

906
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:41,750
Scott: and if you don't you know, at least slightly dip into you know, what sports writers are Creating their their art, you know, then you're gonna miss out on a lot of what's going on and then you know.
