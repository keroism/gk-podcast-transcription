00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:18,219
Rym: It's Thursday April 11th 2011 I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights Tonight SNMP and how nobody knows how to freakin use it.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,597
Rym: Let's do this.

3
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:27,388
Rym: So as I walk into work.

4
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:32,448
Rym: There's a there's blue tape Covering the lock to the door to my suite.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,880
Rym: It's one of our many sweets, and there's just blue tape over it.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,578
Scott: I guess you're fired, so it's just open.

7
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:39,589
Rym: It's holding it open.

8
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,880
Rym: it prevented the door from locking.

9
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,959
Scott: So I'm like hmm somebody forgot their key.

10
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:52,560
Rym: So I look around and there's nobody around because it's you know the butt crack of dawn And I'm not really worried about thieves or anything because it's not your shit.

11
00:00:53,001 --> 00:01:03,253
Rym: Well no more because we have door men and it's actually a relatively secure building and very few people even have access to that floor Let alone you know anyway, so I go to my office.

12
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,316
Rym: lights are off and I look around.

13
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:07,605
Rym: There's nothing and Then I see an email.

14
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:12,352
Rym: you know I go to complain to email the building and be like what the fuck dude Who left our door open?

15
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,098
Rym: What are they doing?

16
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:13,179
Rym: and?

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,811
Rym: There's an email from the building, and they're like hey.

18
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:28,316
Rym: We're uh busting into everyone's sweets to do surveys to Install sprinkler systems for fire suppression as has been mandated by New York City.

19
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,139
Rym: all right.

20
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:36,100
Rym: The fail there is that I now know that my building does not in fact have active fire suppression of any kind.

21
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,309
Scott: All right, so that sucks.

22
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:39,655
Scott: my apartment does.

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,740
Rym: my apartment does too.

24
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,265
Scott: So does the building I work in?

25
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,112
Rym: the building I work in apparently does not.

26
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,543
Rym: I didn't think that pre-war meant pre-world War One.

27
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,958
Scott: no pre-war does mean pre-war.

28
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:53,260
Scott: They're not talking about you know Persian Gulf.

29
00:01:55,923 --> 00:02:01,632
Rym: Well the joke I always make and I'll make it now is people always say like oh yeah The building's pre-war and I interject and say yes civil.

30
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,039
Scott: Yeah, it means don't live there.

31
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:14,400
Rym: Well, it was a double joke because until recently the building was named the Lincoln building mm-hmm But now it's named one grand Central Plaza because Lincoln had a bad connotation.

32
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,391
Rym: Okay, yeah, I really don't like my building.

33
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:20,380
Scott: sure I mean it's not like it was.

34
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,874
Rym: What I do like is that it's like 70 degrees today.

35
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,710
Scott: Yeah, except you know why could it?

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,559
Scott: why is it gotta be trolling being like yeah?

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Rym: I get up in the morning shining the birds are singing.

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,088
Rym: I'm like shit son ride my bike to work.

00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:34,813
Scott: no in the morning you wake up.

Scott: It's like fucking fog.

41
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,024
Scott: Look at the weather.

Scott: It's gonna rain.

00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:40,656
Scott: It's gonna rain.

45
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:41,620
Rym: Yeah, I didn't look at the weather.

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,524
Rym: You know what I looked at though.

47
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:44,253
Rym: It was like 60 degrees.

48
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:50,040
Rym: Yeah I can bike in the rain, but I'm not rollerblading in the rain.

49
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:55,160
Scott: I can bike in tiny rain see like a couple because my building sucks ass.

50
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,199
Rym: I can't ride my real bike cuz I have to leave it outside.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,155
Rym: I'm not leaving a multi-thousand dollar bike out on the street in Manhattan mm-hmm, so I'm getting my old.

52
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:02,596

55
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:15,679
Rym: the fact that I even have it is amazing mm-hmm And it can handle the rain pretty well because it's a goddamn mountain bike.

Rym: It's like seven dollars for three or four dumplings.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,447
Scott: Yeah, there's actually a dumpling truck.

68
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:02,471
Scott: the charges more than that.

69

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,386
Scott: Yeah, but anyway the dumplings are pretty good.

73
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:12,800
Scott: They had so you know dispense your own dumpling sauce whatever.

74
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,307
Scott: But the chicken was also quite good.

75
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,620
Scott: It was you know high quality fried chicken leg all right?

76
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,613
Rym: I'm curious if it's going anywhere other than I ate it.

77
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,440
Rym: a really good food truck.

78
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,031
Scott: No But they not the best part of it right?

79
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:25,457
Scott: was it the way they had prepared this?

80
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:25,940
Scott: somehow?

81
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:28,548
Scott: Alright with the chicken on top of the rice?

82
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,740
Scott: is that the rice ended up absorbing all of this fried chicken grease?

83
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,673
Scott: So it was like it wasn't sticky rice.

84
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,180
Scott: right because it wasn't sticky.

85
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,466
Scott: It was you know as sticky as rice is it was.

86
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:45,120
Scott: it was so key rice, but the the the intense absorbed grease flavor.

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,940
Scott: It tasted like sticky rice times two powers even though its stickiness was not at that level.

88
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:56,474
Rym: I really suddenly want sticky rice, so it's like I ate some dumplings.

89
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:57,498
Scott: I was like good dumplings.

90
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:58,220
Scott: I ate some chicken.

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,305
Scott: I was like all right good fried.

92
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,155

Scott: I was like all right.

94
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,823
Scott: It's not good.

95
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:08,768
Rym: It's like when I was in that atomic trivia show and row was like yeah, Dave Riley Just said that he's eating chicken chicken.

96
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,615
Rym: sure yeah, he's like chicken euros.

Rym: He's like you all want them right now Don't you?

98
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,470
Rym: chicken euros with tzatziki sauce?

99
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,980
Scott: I had a falafel with everything last night, huh?

100
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:22,400
Rym: Yeah, I ate at five napkin last night, huh, I really needed some burgers.

101
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:28,151
Scott: They don't actually require five napkins now, but they require Talk about your false advertising.

102
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,437
Rym: They really require 1.5 napkins.

103
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,731
Scott: I can say that it would require Less than one napkin if they would just give you a bun that didn't suck.

104
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,139
Rym: how come nobody can make buns that don't suck.

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,860
Scott: even The burger truck that I go to has the excellent buns excellent really excellent, or just really good like the best.

106
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,967
Rym: I don't know if it's the best.

107
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,919
Rym: It's like oh, I don't know best.

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,020
Rym: I mean best is when you're getting into the territory of like custom Kaiser roll situation.

109
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,732
Scott: I'll tell you what the truck is gonna be at 50-something Park.

110
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,536
Scott: You can go over to it.

111
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,460
Rym: I will go over to it.

112
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,050
Scott: I'll tell you what you go follow it on Twitter, and you'll go over there.

113
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,175
Rym: so not that long ago.

114
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:09,263
Rym: I bought up Adobe CS4 well with Emily because I needed premiere as shitty as it is and I bought audition separately because Adobe was I knew better.

115
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,949
Scott: I never pay for any Adobe product.

116
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,280
Rym: Yeah, I needed audition, and I actually really did need Photoshop.

117
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,040
Scott: It's gonna run the pirated shit inside of a virtual machine.

118
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,360
Rym: I use Photoshop enough to where I kind of wanted it legit on my computer.

119
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,785
Rym: I'm gonna pirate it inside a virtual machine mainly because the gimp Really actually sucks.

120
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,310
Rym: You could use you use paint dotnet.

121
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,160
Rym: Yeah, because that also actually really sucks.

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,802
Scott: Yeah, it can.

123
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,188
Scott: yeah, it can make funny Photoshop.

124
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:33,995
Rym: Yeah, it's not gonna make that impact font.

125
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,160
Scott: It's all good.

126
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:44,203
Rym: See I realized that the the line between professional like needing real software and not for drawing for me at least came down to CMYK.

127
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:51,107
Rym: if I actually have to interface with printers anyone who's print stuff I really can't get away with anything open source because it just can't do it.

128
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:52,529
Scott: only only send them PDFs.

129
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:57,579
Rym: It'll always work And most people good printers won't accept anything like that.

130
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,410
Rym: Yeah, and if they do and what you're burning?

131
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:00,315
Rym: uh no.

132
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:07,714
Rym: and even if they do Usually they'll require the PDF to be in very specific Formats with Pantone colors and all this stuff that you just can't do with open source.

133
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:13,000
Rym: pay someone else to do all your photoshopping Yeah, or and you know what places like that cost four to ten times as much.

134
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:22,984
Rym: There's a reason I can buy like a thousand to five thousand full-color two-sided glossy postcards for like 30 bucks Because I do all the work Except the printing.

135
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,795
Rym: Mm-hmm, but they announced there's gonna be.

136
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,099
Rym: see creative suite.

137
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,266
Scott: 5 0.5 is wait.

138
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:31,029
Scott: So you have four.

139
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:31,812
Rym: I have full.

140
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,735
Scott: five is already out.

141
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:33,920
Rym: So five came out recently.

142
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,679
Rym: I bought four near the end of its fucking life.

143
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:41,400
Rym: Good job, which is fine because apparently there's some sort of amnesty thing where I can get an upgrade for cheap or whatever.

144
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,102
Rym: I look into that.

145
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:48,718
Rym: but so 5.5 introduces the subscription model, which is basically does that mean you?

146
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:49,560
Scott: it's actually affordable.

147
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:57,791
Scott: It's like 70 to 100 something a month forever a month forever Yeah, but that you for that amount of money you could just get it.

148
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,240
Scott: What's the actual price per month?

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,340
Rym: Fuck, uh, it depends on which one you get, you know, they have like a million different packages.

150
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:09,698
Rym: Okay, Jesus Christ, I mean I have production can use this I needed like audition.

151
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,722
Scott: and for me What if you?

152
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:11,808
Scott: what if I just want?

153
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:13,435
Scott: Photoshop is like five bucks a month.

154
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:17,127
Rym: It's like 30 30 for 30.

155
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,820
Scott: I can get like three $10 games on Steam forever.

156
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:23,890
Rym: Yeah, but the subscription model is not.

157
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,200
Rym: I'll give them $30 a year prices ignore what they're actually charging.

158
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:37,260
Rym: Because of the fact the subscription model I think is a great idea for this kind of software because They're in a situation where you would like to make improvements.

159
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:43,140
Rym: But the software is already good enough for the majority of its users to where they'll never buy it again

160
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:43,903
Scott: Mmm,

161
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:52,364
Rym: and they have a model currently where if you buy it again And you don't buy every iteration along the way you have to buy the whole thing again And it's a lot of money.

162
00:08:52,405 --> 00:09:06,820
Rym: So a lot of people I know we're still on cs2 or cs3 Mmm, so a subscription model would make sense because then you're basically paying Adobe Adobe to continually improve the product forever even if they don't make like these monumental improvements anymore.

163
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,720
Rym: And you know you get support even though their support is kind of useless.

164
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:16,600
Scott: Yeah, but if you don't actually need those improvements You could just buy a version and use it for 10 years and you'll actually save a lot of money.

165
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:21,880
Rym: So occasionally you might need the improvements because like if you look at premiere from several versions, right?

166
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,173
Rym: But you think it's like sucks more which is amazing.

167
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,160
Rym: that that is possible, right?

168
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,068
Scott: But do you really need the improvements?

169
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:31,439
Scott: like obviously any improvement if you're actually doing real work We'll make things easier on you.

170
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Rym: Well, here's my thing.

171
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,668
Scott: How do you get the job done without that improvement?

172
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,580
Scott: and would that improvement help you enough to be worth the exorbitant price?

173
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,102
Scott: You have to pay.

174
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:39,504
Rym: here's the thing.

175
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,529
Rym: one for enterprise.

176
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,862
Scott: It's like yeah, this will save you a half hour for $300 Scott One.

177
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:50,000
Rym: you're forgetting that if you're a company if you're large if you're a company, of course just pay for everything.

178
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,880
Rym: Who gives a shit even for individuals if you have money or you're like self-employed and generating revenue?

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,563
Rym: It's really nice.

180
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,572
Scott: if you're rich just buy everything duh.

181
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,179
Scott: We're talking about people who aren't rich.

182
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:05,380
Rym: Yeah, and it's all I'm saying is that you upgrade when there's a feature you need or you upgrade a lot.

183
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,024
Rym: I learned this.

184
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,840
Rym: a lot of people when I was tweeting were responding to me and emailing me.

185
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:13,860
Rym: The main reason they keep upgrading is that they do design work for clients who themselves?

186
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:22,671
Rym: Always always upgrade to the newest version immediately and then have backwards compatibility problems Mmm and forward compatibility for that on purpose.

187
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:23,876
Scott: Yeah, they do.

188
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:26,343
Rym: So basically Jackasses upgrade.

189
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:38,680
Rym: so the people the designers who have to support the jackasses then have to upgrade even though neither one of them needed Anything in the upgrade Adobe made them made it purposefully incompatible with the previous versions that forced those cross upgrades.

190
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,671
Rym: Yeah office is slightly better at that than Adobe.

191
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,995
Rym: They're less evil though.

192
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,340
Rym: I still disagree with anyway.

193
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:52,948
Rym: What at least is good is that I had to buy audition separately about audition a long time ago because you know cool edit didn't So well anymore.

194
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:56,986
Rym: on modern computers an audition is 90% the same as cool edit.

195
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,531
Rym: I'm not really getting anything for my money.

196
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,297
Rym: It costs a lot more than cool that it did.

197
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:12,840
Rym: but They thought they had sound booth, which was basically if you're an idiot and know nothing about audio But you were required to interact with audio in order to make video or some other thing work.

198
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,333
Rym: It was like the baby version of audition.

199
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:20,106
Scott: You're better off using audacity Worse than audacity, but it cost.

200
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,952
Rym: how much money like 70 bucks.

201
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:30,268
Rym: Okay, Jesus wasn't that much money But for somebody $70 more than audacity They included it with all the sweets like.

202
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:36,288
Rym: premier premium came with sound booth and audition was completely separate and didn't integrate at all Mm-hmm, which was stupid.

203
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,700
Rym: and I remember reading on Adobe forums.

204
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,999
Rym: A lot of people were like, yeah audition is gonna be end of life sound booth is so much better.

205
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:47,532
Rym: Well, no actually sound booth is now end of life and gone because it was stupid.

206
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:52,586
Rym: and now audition is the only audios software in Adobe land which is good.

207
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:58,205
Rym: and for the first time in fuck ever they seem to have added a real feature Which I'm kind of amazed.

208
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,193
Scott: what real feature could they possibly add?

209
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:01,800
Rym: surround sound support, right?

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Scott: So they finally added a real feature something that they should have added ten years ago.

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,948
Rym: So you say they should have added it.

212
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:14,832
Rym: name any audio editing software That has surround sound support like real like.

213
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:16,880
Rym: I can just do 5.1 and DTS and whatever.

214
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,692
Scott: Some of the open source ones theoretically have it.

215
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,260
Scott: if you're a god, you can make it work.

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,157
Rym: Yeah, it's in there somewhere in the same way that latex is a 100% replacement for word.

217
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:34,703
Rym: That's right Technically, correct the best kind of correct but they added a feature and For a second.

218
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:36,107
Rym: I was like, oh surround sound.

219
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:40,000
Scott: and then you know, no one has surround sound working properly except Scott Rubin.

220
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,406
Rym: It doesn't buy you that much.

221
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,898
Scott: he actually buys you a lot when it when you get something that's that, you know, correct.

222
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:46,320
Rym: like what?

223
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,527
Scott: You put a DVD with actual surround sound in my in the Xbox versus you know Watching something on Netflix streaming.

224
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:55,672
Scott: big difference.

225
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:57,620
Rym: Yeah, but I watch everything on Netflix streaming.

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,880
Scott: Yeah, but it's like when you're in the movie theater and you know, the star is sure it comes from behind it works.

227
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:02,977
Scott: It's pretty cool.

228
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,978
Rym: Of course you could do this.

229
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,064
Scott: It's not the thing.

230
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,188
Scott: is the thing with surround sound?

231
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,878
Scott: you say there is a difference that how big is the difference?

232
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:09,400
Scott: kind of big?

233
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,590
Scott: It's not enormously big right, but it's big.

234
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,680
Scott: The thing is it's just so cheap.

235
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,975
Scott: It's not like, you know a 3d TV with the glasses.

236
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,000
Scott: that'll cost you thousands.

237
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:21,059
Scott: You can get surround sound working properly for like a couple hundreds.

238
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:22,004
Scott: Yeah, that's.

239
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,960
Scott: and if you don't have a sound system already, why the fuck not?

240
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,380
Scott: Honestly, the only reason the main problem is that a lot of people actually do have surround sound But they don't actually know how it works and they hook it up wrong.

241
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,860
Rym: Usually they have center channel coming out of all their speak or they don't set it up properly and it's it's actually this.

242
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,674
Scott: You know, it takes knowing and doing to actually get it to work, right?

243
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:49,400
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, it's supported Which is interesting because that super HD camera that I have that we've been doing our videos with and actually records five audio tracks.

244
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:52,390
Scott: Yeah, but how does it record five audio tracks from one microphone up?

245
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,336
Rym: It has five microphones really?

246
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,520
Rym: Yeah directional now.

247
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
Scott: But the thing is you would need five microphones two behind you and three in front of you.

248
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,729
Rym: Uh, they just point in different directions.

249
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,019
Rym: That's usually how you record surround sound.

250
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,631
Rym: In fact, I can do stereo Scott stereo miking.

251
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:08,113
Rym: What do I do?

252
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,759
Rym: I take two mics and I put them in like an X.

253
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,327
Scott: Yeah, but that's stereo.

254
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:12,232
Scott: They were talking about surround.

255
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,640
Scott: You got to get the front and the back.

256
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,966
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

257
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:18,220
Scott: I point to what part of the camera is behind the thing that you're filming.

258
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:31,151
Rym: Uh, Scott usually surround sound is relative to where the camera is But in the soundscape, but you know, the idea is that surround right you yes, so you'd it knows What was the audio coming to the front?

259
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,300
Rym: What was the other coming from the back?

260
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,840
Rym: If you master it, right, it's almost indistinguishable from having point sources in all those places.

261
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,994
Scott: Yeah, so you'll hear what's going on behind the camera where no one can see.

262
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,539
Scott: the thing is you want the things that you know Are behind what you're looking at, but oh

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:15:03,246
Rym: You're saying that what you want to do is make a pseudo Realistic acoustic environment to make the scene feel more realistic without doing actual Surround of what the real scene was like kind of like Foley where you make the fake sounds that sound more real than the Real sounds in a movie.

264
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:15,536
Scott: That's what you can do with audition now Yeah, but I'm saying you can't do it with your camera, uh, if all the microphones are in the camera Scott because it doesn't matter It does man because you don't do that for movies or anything.

265
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,224
Rym: you do that in the audio software.

266
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:24,420
Rym: after the fact if I want to record surround sound with my camera What it does is it gets a surround picture that will translate into surround sound.

267
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,087
Rym: So if I play it through a surround system I hear audio coming from behind me.

268
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,516
Rym: that became from behind the camera and from in front of me.

269
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:36,380
Rym: that came from in front of the And because of the amplitude of all these different things ain't all the different mics?

270
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,320
Rym: It's as though I'm standing where the camera was right.

271
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,613
Scott: But you don't want it to be as though you're standing where the camera was.

272
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:46,233
Scott: you want it to sound like Where the character in the film is standing not where you.

273
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,662
Rym: not always it depends on what you're doing It's true.

274
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:52,700
Scott: But I mean for example though, right you're seeing the star destroyer come from up above?

275
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,500
Scott: Yeah, so Scott, but you don't want the sound.

276
00:15:54,661 --> 00:16:00,458
Rym: I'm not understanding what you're trying to argue because if I'm making a movie I'm just gonna do all the audio after the fact.

277
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:09,834
Rym: anyway Cuz there isn't a real star destroyer coming over for me to have a microphone to pick up if you're pointing the video camera I don't need a microphone on Han Solo's butt because the Star Destroyer is not coming.

278
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,160
Rym: There's no real Star Destroyer Scott.

279
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,104
Rym: It's not real.

280
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:16,000
Scott: if you say if you had you're pointing your video camera at a helicopter, right?

281
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:23,371
Scott: You want sound from the helicopter to sound like, you know to come from behind and also the front but since the can't Helicopter is completely in front of Scott.

282
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:29,559
Rym: Well, it's only hearing it from the front Usually if I'm pointing the camera at a helicopter it's because I'm showing a scene of a helicopter, right?

283
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,959
Rym: Usually you want the audio coming from perspective perspective of the camera unless you're doing it.

284
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,110
Scott: Anyway, you wanted to come from where the person is standing, but there's no person There's a helicopter.

285
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,898
Scott: the person in the house.

286
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,004
Rym: Scott Have you ever watched a movie?

287
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:45,260
Rym: if a helicopter flies by you hear the audio go left to right?

288
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,189
Rym: Yeah in front of you not behind you.

289
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,858
Rym: No, it would be straight on top of you But it's not straight on top of you.

290
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:57,319
Scott: No, because even though you're looking at it on the screen it's whatever Scott you don't get it.

291
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:58,548
Rym: No, I do get high.

292
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:00,080
Scott: fighter comes over the top, right?

293
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,575
Scott: You see the TIE fighter but it still sounds like it's behind you because it's still at the top of the movie screen.

294
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:09,478
Scott: and then when it gets to the Bottom of the movie screen and it's all the way forward then it sounds like it's in front of you.

295
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,179
Rym: Oh, yeah, so high fighter is still on screen.

296
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:16,400
Scott: I'm sorry you but it still sounds like it's behind you because it's still on its way forward.

297
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,041
Rym: yeah,

298
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:28,828
Scott: and if you're all the if all the microphones are in the camera and the tie fighter comes over the top the TIE fighters already in front of you when that by the time it's at the top of your shot and that it already sounds like It's in front of you when it should still sound like it's behind you

299
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,300
Rym: because that's fake effects as opposed to recording the action.

300
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,040
Scott: That's why you surround sound for when you're awake in a movie.

301
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:42,540
Rym: No Because this most consumer cameras are starting to have surround sound support because people record the actual immersive environment of the camera.

302
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:43,384
Scott: Yeah, you don't want that.

303
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,373
Rym: I just let you make a nature film.

304
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,720
Rym: I'm not sure what you're trying to argue.

305
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,859
Scott: So anyway, you don't want all the cameras in the microphone.

306
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:55,820
Rym: Actually in most cases that anyone using a hand camera has I mean all the microphones in the camera now, yeah you do.

307
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,422
Scott: No, you don't.

308
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:57,264
Rym: Okay.

309
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:58,207
Rym: So do you have any news?

310
00:17:58,268 --> 00:17:59,472
Scott: I do have this excellent news.

311
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:00,896
Scott: You ready for this is actually fascinating.

312
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:07,810
Scott: All right, so 323 years ago This guy named William Molyneux.

313
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,440
Scott: I don't know if he's related to Peter Molyneux, but doesn't matter, right?

314
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,236
Scott: He wrote a letter to someone, you know, John Locke and he said hey John Locke.

315
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:15,617
Scott: What's up?

316
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,320
Scott: And John Locke was a good.

317
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,766
Scott: What's going on?

318
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:31,060
Scott: And he says hey Imagine there was a blind person right and this blind person Had a cube and a sphere and the blind person felt up the sphere real good with their hands and they felt up the cube Real good with their hands, right?

319
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,393
Scott: so the blind person knows that his fear looks like and they know what a Sphere feels like and they know what a cube feels like.

320
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,040
Scott: but they obviously don't know what they look like.

321
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,127
Scott: They've been blind since birth.

322
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:42,074
Scott: They'd never seen a sphere.

323
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:42,960
Scott: They've never seen a cube.

324
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,740
Scott: Yeah, right now imagine this blind person knows what a sphere looks like feels like and can identify a sphere.

325
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,543
Scott: All right, they could.

326
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:56,486
Scott: you could hand them an object and say what's this sphere or cube and they could say sphere by feeling You know, but not by looking because they're blind.

327
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:57,409
Scott: They've always been blind.

328
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,151
Scott: They've never seen one.

329
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,740
Scott: then you give them their sight back.

330
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,597
Scott: Okay, so now they can see again and you show them a sphere and a cube.

331
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:12,240
Scott: you don't let them touch Right and you say which one is the sphere and which one is the cube they can see for the first time.

332
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,347
Rym: Well, we know in modern times what happens.

333
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,900
Scott: they've they felt a sphere and they felt a cube, but they've never seen them.

334
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,179
Scott: Yeah, right But now they got their sight back and you show them a sphere in a cube.

335
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:25,940
Scott: Can they identify which one is the sphere and which one is the cube without touching?

336
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,622
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

337
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:36,380
Rym: no because every study I've seen shows that people who regain sight who never had it before Really can't parse what they're seeing if they experience something that doesn't make any sense.

338
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:40,380
Scott: Well, basically they no one actually had any idea.

339
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:48,889
Scott: There was basically arguings of nature versus nurture and all sorts of night and nobody knew until Actually just now this study that just came out.

340
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:54,940
Scott: and what they did is they they had a hard time finding Because it is possible to cure some kinds of blindness.

341
00:19:55,582 --> 00:20:03,620
Scott: But the problem is that a lot of the kinds of blindness that are from birth in the Western world Especially we cure them immediately, right?

342
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,705
Scott: You know you when you're like a little baby so you can see at you know day two if you can paraphrase arguments We had all weekend.

343
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,293
Rym: Skinner box is the answer, right?

344
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:19,839
Scott: So what they did though is they actually went to poor places like in India and such and they found some people who are blind since birth but curable.

345
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:25,115
Scott: and They did this and it turns out that no, they can't tell the sphere from the cube

346
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,139
Rym: as expected

347
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:33,243
Scott: but After like a very short amount of time like weeks, maybe a couple months They can tell huh,

348
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:34,787
Rym: that makes sense even

349
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:39,640
Scott: at even if they're actually pretty pretty old like eight to 17 years old, whatever

350
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:40,882
Rym: Ancient.

351
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,195
Scott: Yeah, but you know, I mean that's that's a long time to be blind 17 years, right?

352
00:20:47,681 --> 00:21:02,383
Scott: They can figure they can you know, they can reconnect they're seeing to their feeling senses after just regaining their seeing senses after never having them ever and Then they can feel and see the cube and the sphere, you know at the same time Not bad.

353
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,760
Rym: Now the question is can they walk in a straight line?

354
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,764
Scott: No that the point.

355
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,777
Scott: no, but the point is right.

356
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:20,943
Scott: The reason it's so fascinating is because you know, there there are lots, you know for the longest time people kept thinking You know the brain stops developing, you know, it develops a whole bunch when you're young and then it doesn't you know It slows down.

357
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:27,428
Scott: but more and more all the evidence is showing that like now the brain really doesn't stop It's it's going all the time.

358
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:28,593
Rym: I read so far.

359
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,320
Scott: You can learn stuff when you're old.

360
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:43,778
Rym: Not that long ago that was talking about the fact that there's a strong correlation between how much sleep you feel that you need not so necessarily how much you get but how much you need and how much you're continuing to learn things.

361
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:50,344
Rym: because generally people sleep a lot when they're young and it kind of peters off when they get older and old.

362
00:21:50,484 --> 00:22:00,590
Rym: like really old people often only sleep five six hours a night and There's a possibility that they need less sleep because they're learning less and the brain needs to do less at night.

363
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,370
Scott: Hmm.

364
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:02,718
Rym: It was just a neat thing.

365
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:04,608
Rym: I don't remember even where I read it.

366
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,500
Scott: Yeah, but you know This is like a lot of people.

367
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,942
Scott: the other thing the article talks about is how you know A lot of people think that this is idea of when you're a child.

368
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,410
Scott: There's these critical periods.

369
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:15,369
Scott: So like if your brain is fucked up, it's like oh, that's it.

370
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,423
Scott: You know We had this one chance where you had all this potential and you were.

371
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:21,550
Scott: you were like clay and then you get hard.

372
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,660
Scott: Well, that's really not nearly as true as it is.

373
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,152
Scott: We thought it was, you know, your your brain is clay It doesn't.

374
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:28,614
Scott: it's not like.

375
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:29,959
Scott: there's no like period where up.

376
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,505
Scott: It's in the kiln the game over.

377
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:31,886
Scott: Yep.

378
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:32,790
Scott: That does not happen.

379
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,533
Rym: Well, I mean let me know.

380
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:37,227
Rym: I mean your brain is clearly wood as opposed to my magnificent marble brain.

381
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:37,709
Rym: I'm sure.

382
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:49,944
Scott: So I do want to talk about yes My wood brain that will continue to grow and get sunlight and water and your marble brain that is already Perfect and hard and will and small and smooth.

383
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:56,500
Scott: Hey, no wrinkles in it and impenetrable and stubborn and non-growing and not adapting.

384
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:09,050
Rym: so Google's algorithms lost a defamation lawsuit in the EU and this is Actually really disturbing and bad news for technology around the world and free speech.

385
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:14,950
Rym: Basically what happened is that in the US we have libel and slander laws, but they're pretty weak.

386
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,034
Rym: Well, they're.

387
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:19,430
Rym: I think they're actually fairly strong, but then there were their weak relative.

388
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:38,203
Rym: They're very strong in that they're well constructed because at its core libel and slander a primary solid defense against being accused of any of these in the courts is Truth, it's not liable if you're right and you can demonstrate it.

389
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:40,710
Rym: It's not slander if the thing you said is true.

390
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,130
Rym: I mean Scott has a tiny penis.

391
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,198
Scott: It's a slander right there.

392
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,230
Scott: now clearly if I go have measured.

393
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:52,610
Rym: So if we go to court right and I've said Scott's penis is tiny and he says no, that's not true.

394
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,085
Rym: It's slanderous when I demonstrate to the court that in fact it is tiny I get off.

395
00:23:57,526 --> 00:24:03,090
Scott: Yeah You get off on tiny penises we not getting off on mine.

396
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:18,551
Rym: So in the EU especially in Britain this is not the case and I'm not a lawyer but everything I read indicates that libel and slander laws in most of Europe are just the worst there They're.

397
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:28,281
Scott: I can't even describe how outrageous they are, but they balance off because they also have like, you know, the a lot more They balance out judicial discussion.

398
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:33,605
Scott: Yeah, if you're litigious over there You're just gonna get fucked because you know, they got stuff like loser pays and stuff like that.

399
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:37,164
Scott: Whereas over here You know, we don't have.

400
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,862
Scott: if we have Trade we got a trade.

401
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:46,210
Rym: Anyway, the EU has you know safe harbor provisions where if I'm say a search engine and you find something slander is through me.

402
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:48,077
Rym: It's not slander on my part.

403
00:24:48,237 --> 00:25:03,749
Rym: Yeah, it's obviously the but Google had autocomplete autocomplete autocompleted someone's name with if you kept typing words like con man and fraud and as far as I can tell the person because a bunch of people Research is a con.

404
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:15,890
Rym: Yes, there's no doubt so Google was sued under the grounds that because Google created that content as opposed to simply reporting it that they were liable for libel.

405
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,483
Scott: Yeah lawyer doesn't know computers.

406
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:20,636
Rym: Uh Well, the lawyer did know the law.

407
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:35,484
Rym: judge didn't know computers as did the judge because the laws are stupid and because autocomplete was Supposedly information created by Google that did not exist on the internet itself That they are in fact guilty and they already lost the lawsuit.

408
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,006
Scott: Yeah.

409
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:39,739
Scott: Well, they got an appeal or something And this is what I mean, it bothers me.

410
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,767
Scott: the EU's just refuse to pay.

411
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:42,249
Scott: What are they gonna do?

412
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,710
Rym: Google has a corporate presence in the EU and a several that would be very difficult to shut down.

413
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,195
Scott: Yeah, so what are they gonna do?

414
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,785
Rym: Uh, they're gonna have to pay giant fine.

415
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,090
Scott: No, I mean, what if you just don't pay?

416
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,719
Scott: What are they gonna do?

417
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:59,664
Rym: Uh The same thing they do to anyone who doesn't pay which is uh, it's lost.

418
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:03,616
Rym: these assets arrest people whatever Law, who can you arrest?

419
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:04,258
Scott: It's a company.

420
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,764
Scott: You got a wrestler page.

421
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:11,043
Rym: They could shut down the company in Spain For example, they could issue an injunction against Google.

422
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,950
Scott: So the thing is they don't actually need to be in Spain.

423
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,849
Scott: They just have computers.

424
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:18,330
Rym: They have people in Spain - you realize they just have all the people leave Spain.

425
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,450
Rym: Yeah, they could try to pull out all that, you know, shut down all of their presences in Europe.

426
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,202
Rym: That's a stupid and laughable idea.

427
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,250
Scott: No, you can keep the presence.

428
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:34,187
Rym: Just keep move the computers out and the people out and then people in Europe still Google Yeah, but then you don't have a presence in the country for a lot of other useful reasons.

429
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:37,282
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it's a terrible idea.

430
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:38,230
Rym: Scott is he follows Google.

431
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,809
Scott: I would buy an island and just be like no one could touch me with any law.

432
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,422
Rym: Yeah, what island are you going to buy and make an island?

433
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:43,865
Scott: Uh-huh?

434
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:54,049
Rym: So use the water for the trouble is the EU has been doing this a lot lately and there are tons of antitrust Lawsuits coming out of Europe against people like Google and Microsoft.

435
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,237
Rym: that They're laughable.

436
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:57,950
Rym: There's no other way to describe them.

437
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:04,110
Rym: It's like Europe is collectively trying to stop any technological company for doing anything cool on the internet.

438
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,798
Scott: Well, the thing is right is look at what's going on, right?

439
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:10,730
Scott: All the big tech companies are in the US Japan, right?

440
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,040
Scott: Europe had what Nokia.

441
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:12,827
Scott: it was just going to.

442
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,297
Rym: We also despite the problems.

443
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:23,382
Rym: We always complain about with the US increasingly becoming kind of draconian about the internet We have the freest internet of most of the world because we have

444
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:24,105
Scott: any free internet

445
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:32,330
Rym: because we have some of the strongest protections for free speech of any place in the world and Yet at the same time much of the rest of the world does not have these protections

446
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:33,978
Scott: And their Internet's way faster.

447
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:38,115
Rym: and because the internet is primarily a US thing We're starting to.

448
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:47,430
Scott: our companies are starting to butt heads with you know, Europe and Australia Basically, I think they're basically just trying to tax US companies, you know, it's like they can't really.

449
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:50,160
Scott: You know, it's like all these companies in the US.

450
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,589
Scott: so, you know, Google Facebook everyone's over here.

451
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:59,930
Scott: So we're making out and they're not making out so well, and we're kicking their asses, you know Apple destroying Nokia and everything.

452
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:12,419
Rym: so anyway, this particular case is actually Italian though there was the Spanish one that was very similar recently and Technologically my take on is pretty simple Autocomplete is no different than doing a survey of people.

453
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,297
Rym: if I was in Spain or Italy or the EU somewhere and I did a survey is Scott Does Scott have a tiny penis?

454
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,490
Rym: and you know say 80% of respondents said yes.

455
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:29,487
Rym: That's not really libelous of me who has done a scientific study or a poll.

456
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,470
Rym: That's libelous.

457
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:36,550
Scott: I should be able to sue all of you because they're all libelous the individual people who said yes Maybe all the people at once in a class action.

458
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:41,850
Rym: There is no way you can convince me that Google's autocomplete is any different than a survey.

459
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:49,533
Scott: No, the survey takers is off scot-free But I all the people who wrote the wrong thing on the survey knowing it was the results will be published Which now?

460
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:59,790
Rym: this is why I love technology because alright the law should be that which is great because Individual people out there trying to shut them down would be like whack-a-mole Streisand effect and we win in the end.

461
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,753
Scott: Anyway, well, how about this?

462
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,038
Scott: Here's a good question, right?

463
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:05,690
Scott: What if you you someone asks you, right?

464
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:12,107
Scott: How much you know is something worth and you have no idea and you just guess and you guess wrong?

465
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,050
Scott: is that libel?

466
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:20,309
Rym: Well libel it would remember libel at least in the u.s Or slander requires malice and harm.

467
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:21,203
Scott: Mm-hmm.

468
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,118
Rym: No in Europe, it's basically right.

469
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,611
Scott: so in Europe what if you don't, you know lie, but you just guess wrong I don't know.

470
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:29,113
Rym: I'm not a lawyer.

471
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:32,003
Scott: Yeah, because it's like that's basically what Google did.

472
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:32,405
Scott: is they just?

473
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:33,168
Scott: they just guess?

474
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:33,770
Scott: they guessed, right?

475
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:38,810
Scott: But it's like if you guess right or wrong, you know, it's like you're just guessing.

476
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,208
Scott: can you be held liable for slander or libel?

477
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:48,308
Scott: if you You know just guess as opposed to knowingly lie with intent to harm and such and such.

478
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,114
Rym: I guess There is that EU.

479
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:51,858
Rym: you're on notice.

480
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,902
Rym: I'm watching you.

481
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,530
Rym: I I tire of this bullshit.

482
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:59,070
Rym: I like the EU in general and it has many benefits over say the United States.

483
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:07,720
Scott: But when it comes to law as fucked up as our laws often are why isn't there just one at least one fucking country in The world where the shit is not fucked up, Scandinavia.

484
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:13,021
Rym: It's still fucked up there this part of the EU Yeah, but I feel like it's less fucked up overall.

485
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:18,450
Scott: I mean there are places that are less however, however But I'm saying why isn't there a single place that has no fuck-ups?

486
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,376
Rym: Well Scott, here's my worst problem.

487
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:25,514
Rym: The places with the least fuck-ups are also the coldest fucking places I know right.

488
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:27,884
Scott: We need a tropical place with no fuck-up.

489
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,069
Rym: I just need Manhattan in.

490
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:34,161
Scott: I don't know the Bahamas and Manhattan should be its own country.

491
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,284
Rym: Yes with internet.

492
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,370
Rym: Yes, the internet in fact is in Manhattan.

493
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:47,140
Rym: Yeah, so things of the day we had friends out this weekend.

494
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:56,735
Rym: Phil and she a were hanging out playing games and go to the mocha and everything but Phil showed us a video of Douglas Adams giving a speech and I had never seen this speech.

495
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:57,740
Rym: I didn't know much about it.

496
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:58,905
Scott: I'd never seen it either.

497
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:02,100
Rym: it was a talk and it was also about one of his books that I'd never read.

498
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,143
Scott: I'd never heard of.

499
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:11,277
Rym: most people have only known of Douglas Adams because of the hitchhiker's guide And all the questions at the end of the video are horrible.

500
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:11,900
Rym: I'll get to that.

501
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,192
Rym: Parrots the universe and everything.

502
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:24,065
Rym: This is just a fantastic talk by Douglas Adams about parrots the universe komodo dragons and Everything.

503
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:28,309
Rym: trying to buy rubber rovers in China lemurs Hi eyes.

504
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,060
Rym: Yeah, it's just it's great.

505
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,400
Rym: And the thing is I used to always say that Douglas Adams was a really good writer and I have to take that back.

506
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:35,499
Rym: He is not a great writer.

507
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:41,740
Rym: What he is is a great orator and his books are just writing down the things that he would have said.

508
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,998
Rym: Yep, he is an amazing order.

509
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:46,044
Rym: It's a very rarely.

510
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:55,300
Rym: we try to watch TED talks often with the crew and we have people over and usually a Subset of the crew get bored pretty readily or don't want to watch something that's longer than 30 seconds.

511
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:58,439
Rym: But uh, this held everyone's attention for a full hour.

512
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,087
Scott: Well, there was nobody there.

513
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:03,000
Scott: who was the the kind of person who would lose their attention?

514
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,410
Scott: It wasn't like all those other people were there who are like.

515
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:13,034
Scott: we can only watch things that are 10 minutes or are just really Lame and full of jokes every two seconds because our attention span.

516
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,704
Rym: this is not a TED talk But it is effect.

517
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:17,530
Scott: It is effect on the TED website.

518
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,673
Rym: It's been like honored.

519
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:20,640
Rym: It is now like an honorary TED talk.

520
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:26,739
Rym: they're basically doing this best of the web like this is Basically as good as a TED talk if not better.

521
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:32,048
Scott: It's better than any TED talks we have available and ready to post for you right now So we'll post that instead.

522
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:36,592
Rym: when he stops talking Some questions happen and they're all retarded.

523
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:51,549
Rym: if I were you I would watch the first two people who ask questions and listen to their questions because they nothing has changed in the last I don't know several decades because The questions are basically along the lines of.

524
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,480
Rym: so you gave this talk and I didn't care about it at all.

525
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:59,518
Rym: but what I really want to ask about is Some lame joke about the hitchhiker's guide towel towel towel.

526
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:02,364
Scott: He It's like I'm.

527
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:05,880
Scott: I give him props for not just being like shut up cuz that's what I do.

528
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,020
Scott: I'm just like dude your question sucks goes nobody can ask questions like it amazes me.

529
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,272
Rym: I'm gonna tell you all a secret.

530
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:17,419
Rym: at every packs We have or any con where we have actually decided to take questions all of them suck.

531
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:22,520
Rym: Oh, no, no, okay, we get good ones, but most of the time I can't hear you.

532
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:37,740
Rym: Anyway, so I literally just listen until I hear a proper mumble mumble mumble proper now And then I give an answer that is vaguely related to the proper noun Mm-hmm, and if you've heard me answering questions or Scott answering questions on stage, that'll probably explain a lot.

533
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:47,574
Rym: Yeah, but really this is amazing and the questions that are asked at the end are typical amazing me bad Alright, so yeah, so check this out.

534
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:54,322
Scott: I don't know You know, I'm not really that OCD but you know, there are some times you get a little bit like, you know Some like.

535
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:56,232
Scott: sometimes I'll step on cracks on the sidewalk.

536
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:56,675
Scott: No problem.

537
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:57,600
Scott: And sometimes I'll be like up.

538
00:33:58,322 --> 00:34:03,360
Rym: Yeah, what do you what do you do if you're at someone's house and they put the toilet paper on the wrong way?

539
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,346
Rym: Like it's just under?

540
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,780
Scott: oh, you know, I don't know why people have this problem with the under over.

541
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,808
Scott: I don't even notice whether it's under over really.

542
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,960
Rym: we debated about that for about 40 minutes the other night.

543
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,014
Rym: I don't even notice whether it's under over at all because here's the thing the vast majority of Americans do it over I know and it's mostly women who do it under uh-huh.

544
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:20,900
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

545
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,089
Scott: Anyway, I don't even like.

546
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:29,471
Scott: when I put a new roll on there I just grab a roll put the thing through it and snap it on without even looking and when I grab for the toilet paper I don't even look at the.

547
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:40,414
Scott: you know anyway, so if you're OCD or even just tiny bit OCD or really OCD here is Very reasonably priced $25 wooden cutting board.

548
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:41,880
Scott: It looks to be a high-quality cutting board.

549
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,922
Scott: it is 9 by 12, which is a good size for cutting board and It had.

550
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:49,317
Scott: it is ruled very precisely with.

551
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:56,520
Scott: you know Vertical and horizontal lines and measurements so you can cut your carrots or celery to exact specifications.

552
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:59,289
Scott: If your knife is sharp, it's pretty great.

553
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,540
Scott: It's pretty cool reasonably priced and also a cutting board.

554
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:07,345
Scott: So if you need a cutting board Why not get this one?

555
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:11,300
Rym: it's fun and nerdy and of course the meta moment.

556
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,177
Rym: We will be at anime Boston April 22nd 23rd and 24th in fourth in Boston.

557
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:18,159
Scott: That's coming up real soon.

558
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,809
Rym: Yep, we're doing a bunch of panels all that stuff.

559
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,636
Rym: Darryl Strad anime world order Gerald.

560
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:30,615
Rym: I assume Clarissa I didn't actually ask them who's coming Like tools gonna beat their every nerd.

561
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:31,720
Scott: it'll be nerd paradise.

562
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,771
Rym: So if you are there aside from our panels if you want to just play board games We're gonna be doing a lot of that.

563
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,120
Scott: Ah, we're gonna be anime.

564
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,329
Scott: Boston does have a tabletop room.

565
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,740
Scott: it is kind of small and usually kind of quiet.

566
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,840
Scott: We will either be mostly kids playing Magic the Gathering and munchkin.

567
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,140
Rym: We'll either be there or we'll get a posse and we'll go to the hotel like right in the area.

568
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,828
Rym: Well, it's it's in the hotel.

569
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:57,088
Rym: Yeah the tabletop, but we'll go to like the lobby of the Sheraton Yeah, and we'll play some games there.

570
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,460
Scott: I think I think the tabletop room itself will be fine.

571
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,024
Rym: It depends.

572
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,716
Rym: it depends on how much of a posse we get.

573
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,869
Rym: anyway The book club book was Michio Kaku cyberspace.

574

592
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:49,933
Rym: We have an awesome rockin forum.

593
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:51,100
Rym: A lot of people have been joining lately.

594
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,811
Rym: It's kind of an ivory tower of the internet.

595
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,834
Rym: got to be very assertive like Fluttershy.

596
00:37:02,951 --> 00:37:29,100
Rym: So we did that show a little while ago on reading logs and the response as in the questions people emailed me and the questions people post in the forum made me realize that When we did a couple of shows on like system administration and the system administrators toolkit and like the things you need to know Like, you know grep or VI or you know reading logs var log Linux I think we have a lot more ground that needs to be covered.

597
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:32,379
Rym: I don't think people actually know how to administer systems.

598
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:36,520
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, but I mean how we could talk about that for years and years and years.

599
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,059
Scott: But I think be kind of boring if you just be like, okay So this is how to use this command and this is how to use this command.

600
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,048
Scott: But something is how to use this tool.

601
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:47,421
Rym: what really bothered me what got me was someone in the forum and they had a good Question.

602
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,531
Rym: they were like, yeah, I totally use logs to save the day.

603
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:59,420
Rym: I'm paraphrasing and I'm not making fun of you dude because Most big companies in the world even tech companies don't even get to the point that you got of checking the logs.

604
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:04,319
Rym: so, you know servers having trouble and they could like tech guy like couldn't figure it out.

605
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:14,507
Rym: and finally someone thinks to look in the windows event log and they see that like one of the arrays like the raid had a disc that had failed and there was Fragmentation and a big problem.

606
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:15,451
Rym: and oh shit.

607
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:16,777
Rym: and they replaced it and fixed everything.

608
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:17,440
Rym: and they're the heroes.

609
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,373
Rym: but this of course raises the question that Why wouldn't you have known about this ahead of time?

610
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:31,940
Rym: and I realized that Almost everyone I have ever met hardware guys software guys software engineers computer science versus IT.

611
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,379
Rym: Nobody knows what SNMP is let alone how to use it.

612
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:39,919
Scott: Well, I mean a lot of people have monitoring systems in place, right?

613
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:49,340
Scott: But some of the monitoring systems are like, you know Most of them actually are prepackaged things that might use SNMP without exposing the user to the fact that it's being used.

614
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:58,800
Scott: Oh and some of them actually use really stupid methods or you know Not completely useless but much dumber methods than SNMP like to make sure the server is up.

615
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,060
Scott: Just ping it once every few seconds or make sure the website's up.

616
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:04,740
Scott: So try to load the home page once every minute, you know.

617
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:07,799
Scott: And then send an email if it doesn't load or if there's a server error.

618
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:14,467
Rym: Yep Now the worst part is that most of the monitoring that people use out of the box like you buy a Dell server you get Dell OpenManage or Windows.

619
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:15,692
Rym: it's I think RDM.

620
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:20,900
Rym: I forget even because I only work with Dell stuff now So I forgot all the other proper nouns for all the other types of servers.

621
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:24,500
Rym: But there's software that you install that can monitor everything.

622
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:33,080
Rym: so like if there's a problem you log into the console through the web and you can see like oh the array has failed or That fan has died or say there's a lot of them IBM servers.

623
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,665
Rym: I don't have this.

624
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:41,040
Rym: they have an amber light on the front of the box That turns on if there's trouble and then you log into a management console to see what the trouble was.

625
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,636
Rym: the lights kind of like the check engine light.

626
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:51,320
Rym: and Even prepackaged software like that is almost always reactive or passive monitoring and that it doesn't tell you there's a problem.

627
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:54,518
Rym: it's just there after you recognize there's a problem.

628
00:39:54,538 --> 00:40:11,340
Rym: and I want to talk very specifically about SNMP because unlike a lot of other things where There's a lot of theory I could cover and there's a lot of kind of very complex ground I can tell you in a few minutes how to use SNMP to trivially monitor anything in Linux.

629
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:26,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know we have some monitoring stuff but like usually like for example if use Amazon You know Amazon Web Services, you can pay for CloudWatch Which is monitoring and it monitors your CPU usage and your memory usage and disk activity.

630
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,100
Scott: So does it money just but from your perspective all it is is a bunch of graphs and you can set it with like.

631
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,080
Scott: You know email me of CPU usage goes over 80% for more than a minute and stuff like that.

632
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,014
Scott: And that's that's like the extent of the kind of monitoring most people have.

633
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:41,600
Rym: maybe they're a little more advanced.

634
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,844
Rym: They use like MRTG.

635
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:43,607
Rym: they install that.

636
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:43,808
Scott: well.

637
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:47,040
Scott: MRTG is basically, you know, make your own graphs on your own server.

638
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,110
Rym: Yeah, but you can set thresholds on that.

639
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,718
Rym: Like if the number of CRC errors goes.

640
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:52,364
Rym: Oh wait It doesn't even do that by default.

641
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:59,084
Scott: Anyway, so a lot of these things like Monet and nagios, right you basically That you run this.

642
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:02,360
Rym: the nagio system is actually pretty pretty good.

643
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,620
Scott: But you run these systems and then you have to go out and get scripts or you know modules that monitor different things.

644
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,300
Scott: It's like I need the MySQL database monitoring module.

645
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:15,658
Scott: So you go get it and configure it and say you know what those things actually work.

646
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:16,060
Rym: really well.

647
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,795
Rym: And that's all SNMP under the hood.

648
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:18,320
Rym: Mm-hmm.

649
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Rym: So if you just get nagios and install it and use it you're using SNMP and you're already half the battle.

650
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,128
Scott: Yeah, the thing with SNMP.

651
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:27,460
Scott: It's like they're basically they're people.

652
00:41:27,922 --> 00:41:31,999
Scott: It seems like very very few places use it and know that they're using it.

653
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,883
Scott: Oh even worse.

654
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:36,556
Rym: so get this whenever I talk to vendors, right like ticketing systems.

655
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:41,071
Rym: I was looking at ticketing systems I want to buy like a server that does something or anything.

656
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,100
Rym: I always ask them questions like, you know, how does it install?

657
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,448
Rym: What's the back-end database?

658
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,300
Rym: Can I use it on a different database?

659
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,927
Rym: do I have to use fucking Oracle or can I put it on postgres?

660
00:41:49,987 --> 00:42:00,720
Rym: and all these questions and by and large No vendor I have ever talked to for any product I've ever interacted with can answer any question I've ever asked them.

661
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:04,760
Rym: Yeah, but one of the questions I always ask is now first I throw him a bone.

662
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,348
Rym: I will ask so how do we monitor this?

663
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:20,599
Rym: just to give them you know, maybe they have some bullshit proprietary thing Maybe they've got something I give them the chance to say Oh, well, if you want to make sure it's up and they give me some stupid procedure Usually their response is okay.

664
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:22,383
Rym: What do you mean?

665
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:26,720
Rym: monitor it's up it's running I mean if it stops working they just have no idea.

666
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,900
Scott: I need an email when it goes down if I'm not there and I'm not using it.

667
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,519
Rym: My follow-up question is usually is there a MIB?

668
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:40,536
Rym: And to this day only one company has ever responded with the words.

669
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:45,748
Scott: Why yes, I Mean, you know and the thing is right.

670
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:48,560
Scott: so people don't even know that this is a thing, right?

671
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:54,668
Scott: But then there are some other people like me where it's like, you know SNMP exists, you know It's the simple network management protocol.

672
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:55,371
Rym: That's very good.

673
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:57,158
Rym: You're but it'll more than 99% of humans, right?

674
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,939
Scott: But beyond that it's like it's this thing.

675
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:05,600
Scott: It's I don't really know how it works or how to see it or use it.

676
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:11,488
Scott: It's like you're coming sort of like how your computer has an I squared C bus And it's like what is that bus used for?

677
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,793
Scott: people know about the USB.

678
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:14,680
Scott: they know about the serial buses.

679
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,008
Scott: They don't know anything about the I2C bus.

680
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:23,273
Scott: your computer has one and it's there and there's some stuff on it But you have no idea and nor do you know how to read it.

681
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:24,880
Scott: Yep, nor could you know?

682
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:39,456
Rym: The thing is I wouldn't expect like a computer scientist a coder even a software engineer I would not expect you to really know the ins and out of SNMP unless you were writing Software that was big enough to where you wanted to make your own MIB to where it could be monitored directly

683
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:42,427
Scott: or software That was actually doing monitoring.

684
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,840
Rym: true like say for example you were going to write.

685
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:53,824
Rym: I don't know a demon that does Like something for our forum like it does some cool real-time thing on our forum and you wanted to get stats out of it Directly.

686
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:59,656
Rym: now a lot of developers would like write CSVs or XML to a place or have counters.

687
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:00,580
Rym: you can get your database.

688
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:09,359
Rym: There's a lot of different ways you could do that, but you could just provide a MIB and just extend it out through SNMP And then people can hit SNMP and get the data out of your program.

689
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,648
Rym: That doesn't interest you at all does it?

690
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,124
Scott: no not really because you know I mean Monitoring.

691
00:44:16,144 --> 00:44:18,799
Scott: you know I would use it if it was for data like you know.

692
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:23,292
Scott: How much memory is the program currently using up and that sort of thing?

693
00:44:23,353 --> 00:44:25,780
Rym: how many calls are being addressed per hour?

694
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,777
Scott: Yeah, stuff like that, but I never need that kind of information.

695
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:33,770
Scott: the kind of information I need is actually usually the applications actual information right.

696
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,779
Scott: I'm not gonna write for example a content API.

697
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:42,684
Scott: You know I'm gonna do that with HTTP and JSON, I'm not gonna do that with You know.

698
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,371
Rym: this is why SNMP is important.

699
00:44:44,411 --> 00:44:46,419
Scott: with SNMP and at the same time right?

700
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,328
Scott: HTTP and JSON I could also.

701
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:52,880
Scott: it's so much easier to do than SNMP which would require learning.

702
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:53,783
Rym: See now this.

703
00:44:53,884 --> 00:45:00,707
Rym: this is the beauty of it SNMP as its primary so much more accessible is basically Hardware and software agnostic.

704
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:02,311
Rym: it runs it like like.

705
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:11,340
Rym: technically it's a layer 7. you know in the OSI model application It is at the top, so it can't monitor anything below itself, so this is really it monitors things below really.

706
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:24,300
Scott: So if there's a problem with Mac address Because it doesn't monitor anything SNMP is nothing more than a framework right, but that's exactly I'm saying is so you have something That's monitoring problems that you know level 3 and it finds a problem.

707
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,100
Scott: And then it sends out SNMP the but SNMP doesn't get through because level 3 is broken.

708
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,191
Rym: Uh so Scott think about your hierarchy of monitoring.

709
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:43,012
Rym: if your server doesn't have any communication at all with the outside world if SNMP stops responding or TCP stops responding you set up monitoring such that if it doesn't respond.

710
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,820
Rym: That's the most critical alarm the server is gone.

711
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:47,969
Rym: Yeah, we have lost contact with it.

712
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,034
Rym: so at that point.

713
00:45:49,194 --> 00:45:50,379
Rym: That's the primary alarm.

714
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:52,124
Rym: say There's 10 problems at the same time.

715
00:45:52,585 --> 00:46:03,595
Rym: say you're using 80% of your swap space when you don't expect above a threshold right and The motherboard caught fire and the server stopped running.

716
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:07,696
Rym: uh-huh One of those problems is more important than the other one.

717
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:08,380
Rym: it takes precedence?

718
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:09,344
Scott: Yes, of course.

719
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:13,881
Scott: so if there's a problem fires preventing you from finding out about the CPU Yes, there's a.

720
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:27,720
Rym: but if there's no more about the CPU if there's a more fundamental problem that you would have caught and sent over SNMP But because some thing is broken on the way you can't even send that then your system is proper fucked right.

721
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,563
Scott: But here's the thing right.

722
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:35,940
Scott: what if the problem is between for example the monitoring server the one doing the monitoring and The machine that was going to email you the alert?

723
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:43,729
Scott: it's like now there's alerts, but you don't know what they are and it could be more severe than the fact that you're Monitoring server can't email anybody Scott.

724
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:46,100
Rym: That's just a trivial operational concern.

725
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:47,003
Rym: That's just.

726
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,095
Rym: I mean if you're smart you set up a secondary network.

727
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:51,480
Rym: That's just for monitoring and backups.

728
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:54,650
Scott: What if that network you know loses access?

729
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:56,014
Scott: then it'll be like oh my god.

730
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:57,820
Scott: Everything is down and really everything else is working.

731
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,387
Scott: It's just the monitoring network is busted.

732
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,395
Rym: Yeah, and you know what if you're not an idiot?

733
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:03,725
Rym: if that would be obvious It can happen.

734
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,110
Rym: Yeah, it can happen.

735
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,313
Scott: It's really irrelevant, but the point is is that you know monitoring You know can't always be trusted completely.

736
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:11,500
Scott: a lot of people they see monitoring.

737
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,425
Scott: You're like that.

738
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:13,189
Scott: you know they get an email.

739
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:14,677
Scott: They're like oh, no everything's down.

740
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:15,160
Scott: Oh my god.

741
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,785
Scott: But really you gotta be intelligent.

742
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:21,100
Rym: it actually can be trusted completely if it's set up in a intelligent reasonable matter.

743
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:35,384
Rym: For example say a server goes down I get an alarm a critical red alarm immediately in all the consoles of all the productions of our people that basically says This server is no longer contactable via ICMP Meaning it is dead.

744
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:39,397
Rym: it cannot be reached through anything ICMP or other protocols.

745
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:42,426
Rym: so assumed Is that SNMP is also not responding.

746
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:47,238
Rym: assumed is that no demon can respond now at the same time if?

747
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,868
Rym: Every server on the network simultaneously has that problem.

748
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:53,194
Rym: it collapses all those into one alarm.

749
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:56,822
Rym: that entire network segment stopped responding Mm-hmm.

750
00:47:57,184 --> 00:48:01,700
Rym: so if a network segment goes down I get a network segment alarm saying that whole segment is down.

751
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,919
Rym: Every alarm that is subordinate to that alarm is suppressed.

752
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:07,066
Rym: So I won't alarm on.

753
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:13,631
Rym: I can't contact the postgres server on server a or server B or server C. I also can't ping server a or server.

754
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:15,220
Rym: it collapses them all into one alarm.

755
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:17,340
Rym: That's just kind of the semantic design of monitoring.

756
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,238
Scott: I don't think anyone probably nowhere in the world except your company has the monitoring setup.

757
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:29,046
Scott: so yes I can safely say I don't even know if Google and Facebook and big-time data centers have the most The path I've taken through IT.

758
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:37,869
Rym: the hospital had shit for monitoring, but that aside IBM and the company I work for now Probably had what I would consider best-of-breed monitoring.

759
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:38,150
Rym: as in.

760
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:48,340
Rym: I do legitimately believe that the way I currently monitor my servers Which I think would be improved greatly is better than the vast majority of companies in the entire world monitor anything.

761
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:49,865
Rym: I'm talking ours.

762
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:50,928
Rym: I'm talking hospitals.

763
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:52,633
Rym: I'm talking the financial sector.

764
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:54,840
Rym: I'm talking technology Google Apple everyone.

765
00:48:55,463 --> 00:48:58,780
Scott: Yeah, I've never seen monitoring that level of sophistication.

766
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,775
Scott: I just sort of assume that the big data centers and important places have it.

767
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:05,154
Scott: they don't you know They know they don't Scott.

768
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:06,200
Rym: Here's the example.

769
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:10,260
Scott: I mean why node and play even like big hosting companies were really smart people work.

770
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,850
Scott: They just have like the CPU alarm to not name any names.

771
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:22,040
Rym: at some point in the last seven years I was at a data center Where I happen to have some stuff in a cage and a lot of other companies have stuff in other cages.

772
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:24,952
Rym: I can't get into their cages, but I can see their racks.

773
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:27,943
Rym: I can see their servers Point.

774
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:34,430
Rym: the first nobody has fucking labels on anything except you know me - nobody really does cable management.

775
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,159
Rym: very well by and large three.

776
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:41,436
Rym: Almost every cage that I would walk past in data centers was a rat's nest.

777
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:45,309
Rym: the servers have Lights like red lights like warning.

778
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,280
Rym: this server has a problem on almost all the servers.

779
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:54,020
Rym: Yeah It's the equivalent of walking through a yard where there's a bunch of cars running and they're all brand new powerful cars.

780
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:57,579
Rym: And if you look in the windows of any of them checking all have the check engine light on.

781
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:03,765
Rym: Some of them are blinking and maybe one of them is just smokes coming out of the exhaust When it's off.

782
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:06,420
Rym: so yeah, nobody does what I do.

783
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,280
Rym: But you know what you all want to and it is so trivial to set this stuff up.

784
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:12,627
Rym: You wouldn't even believe it.

785
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,090
Scott: and it's all.

786
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,940
Scott: that's the funny stuff is like some of these things.

787
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,020
Scott: They want to charge you monies for like but to see you can get the same thing for open source and free.

788
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,404
Scott: That's just as good if not better.

789
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:24,315
Rym: so very briefly an overview of SNMP the simple network management protocol.

790
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:26,807
Rym: all it is is a hierarchy.

791
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:31,691
Rym: a tree of Numbered notation is kind of like an IP address that point to data.

792
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:35,605
Rym: so route like one dot three dot six dot one dot Oh dot one.

793
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,439
Rym: that's kind of like the base route for sisutil.

794
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:40,921
Rym: That's like where almost everything you ever do will be one three six one Oh one.

795
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:43,630
Rym: now the MIB itself is not actually the number.

796
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,881
Rym: the number is the OID which points at like a part place of the MIB.

797
00:50:47,282 --> 00:51:00,070
Rym: so think of it as like a giant IP address where if I if I query on a server this one Number all the way down it ends up pointing to like the amount of virtual memory that this Particular process is using at this time.

798
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,435
Scott: So you got to ask for the number.

799
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:04,139
Scott: you get like hey you server Yeah, what give me this number?

800
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:05,585
Rym: Well, there's two ways to do it.

801
00:51:05,987 --> 00:51:09,660
Rym: now a MIB before I get into how you do that is kind of a directory.

802
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,860
Rym: So it basically translates those numbers into names like DNS.

803
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:18,460
Rym: So it'll be basically you'll do something like, you know, sisutil dot something dot something dot CPU.

804
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:26,614
Rym: Give me this is like so it's like newsgroups Yep, and for monitoring software Usually you load a MIB and then if you tell it monitor that device.

805
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:32,482
Rym: it knows which particular OID values in this giant hierarchy are relevant to that device Mm-hmm.

806
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:34,630
Rym: So a lot of the underlying.

807
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:37,620
Scott: Oh, so it's so for example, you have a router, right?

808
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,820
Scott: Well, there's a zillion numbers, but you don't need to know for example a router how much hard drive space is left.

809
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:43,499
Scott: Nope, right.

810
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,779
Scott: So you don't you ignore those numbers on the router and there's a list of numbers that are the only numbers you care.

811
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,452
Rym: what you Do on the router is you go to Cisco and you get the MIB.

812
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:51,960
Rym: they have MIBs for just all their devices.

813
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:56,140
Rym: And then you do an SNMP walk or use a MIB viewer to look at it.

814
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,780
Rym: It shows you here are all the things you can monitor and here's the current values and all your servers Mm-hmm or all your routers or what?

815
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,821
Scott: Here are the numbers you care about on this router and we have removed all the numbers that you might will never care about on This machine.

816
00:52:06,841 --> 00:52:08,307
Rym: and there's cool stuff like some of them.

817
00:52:08,588 --> 00:52:17,440
Rym: a lot of really complex systems and Cisco devices do this pretty well Will give you multiple counts like say for like number of I don't know CRC errors like errors on packets.

818
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:22,296
Rym: One value gives you the current number, you know, like every five seconds like how many.

819
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:23,540
Scott: there's only so much memory.

820
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:24,223
Scott: So it's not good.

821
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:25,407
Scott: You can't remember this number forever.

822
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,880
Rym: Actually Cisco routers very specifically always remember things forever.

823
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,586
Rym: They have counters that never get reset.

824
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,168
Rym: Uh-huh.

825
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:32,373
Scott: What if they overflow though?

826
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:33,416
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

827
00:52:33,757 --> 00:52:34,440
Rym: They're really big.

828
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:35,384
Rym: I've never run into that.

829
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:40,307
Rym: I'm just saying yeah, some people reset them whenever whenever there's a typical Cisco thing Is every here someone.

830
00:52:40,348 --> 00:52:41,760
Rym: this is IT tip of the day.

831
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,340
Rym: Someone ever says yeah reset your counters and call me back if it keeps happening.

832
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:52,200
Rym: What they mean is reset the error count on a device and then the next day see if there's a nonzero number in that counter.

833
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:58,659
Scott: Because it's like if you haven't looked at the number in a while You don't know if that number went up today or a year ago.

834
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:03,380
Rym: But like some will return the deltas and they'll reset every time you pull them.

835
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,185
Rym: So I pulled it.

836
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:06,519
Rym: it tells me how many since the last time I pulled it.

837
00:53:06,982 --> 00:53:09,051
Scott: So you got to know what which kind your device is.

838
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:10,618
Scott: or can you change the mode or both?

839
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,988
Rym: It depends on the device.

840
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:13,943
Rym: SNMP is just a framework It's just so.

841
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:14,907
Scott: this is the stance of.

842
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:17,900
Scott: the standards are all kind of flaky and is it's not very consistent.

843
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,643
Scott: You got to know.

844
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:20,991
Rym: well, no because the MIB is kind of the contract.

845
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:27,705
Rym: it tells you this is what is at this value Mm-hmm in excruciating detail oftentimes Mm-hmm.

846
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:29,679
Rym: So there's two ways to do it.

847
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:31,926
Rym: You can do polls or traps.

848
00:53:32,227 --> 00:53:36,300
Rym: a poll is I've got a server like Nagios that hits a no ID on a server.

849
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:42,560
Rym: Say I have a thing that returns a one if postgres is running and a zero if postgres is not running.

850
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:43,080
Rym: All right.

851
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:50,099
Rym: So I have a watch that every you know five minutes or 30 seconds or whatever just hits that value and makes an alarm for me or sends me an email or whatever.

852
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,980
Rym: if Anything other than a one is returned or a zero or whatever, you know exit codes.

853
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,908
Rym: You can really have it do just about anything.

854
00:53:56,928 --> 00:53:58,374
Scott: So the SNMP doesn't broadcast.

855
00:53:58,394 --> 00:53:59,277
Scott: you have to keep pulling it.

856
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,249
Rym: Yes Now that's poll based monitoring.

857
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:04,793
Rym: There's also trap based.

858
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:10,751
Rym: an SNMP trap is when a UDP packet is sent to a receiver.

859
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:13,823
Rym: you could there's ways to do this with broadcast and everything But that sucks.

860
00:54:13,863 --> 00:54:14,587
Rym: basically device.

861
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:15,854
Scott: you got a program on the device.

862
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:16,960
Scott: Tell it where the receiver is.

863
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:29,140
Rym: Yes, almost any device will have this if it's an old device any like a server hardware you buy like Dell boxes like the racks The open manages you can just type in like this IP address or this name and the community string.

864
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:29,999
Rym: We'll get to that in a second.

865
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:34,673
Rym: So you tell it send your traps here and then anytime it has a problem.

866
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,743
Rym: or sometimes devices will send traps that are just Updates.

867
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:44,010
Rym: like order came in order came in or I use the CPU You can pretty much do anything.

868
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:45,740
Rym: So that's kind of more.

869
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,988
Rym: It's still active monitoring but is active from the client.

870
00:54:49,008 --> 00:54:52,297
Rym: So obviously if the trap gets lost on the network, you don't get it.

871
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:56,234
Rym: if The device fails before it can send a trap.

872
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:57,380
Rym: You don't get the trap.

873
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,532
Rym: So you trap monitoring would be more for event based things.

874
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:05,839
Rym: Like you might want to get a trap if say You exceed a threshold of CPU usage.

875
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:08,627
Rym: But you'd want to have a poll monitoring.

876
00:55:08,668 --> 00:55:11,556
Rym: say your database that tells you the database is now down.

877
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,248
Rym: if you have the database server Send a trap before it goes down.

878
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,797
Rym: Well, maybe it's egg faults and doesn't send a trap.

879
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:24,860
Scott: No Or maybe it doesn't send the trap until after it's down in which case it went down and now it can't send the trap.

880
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,443
Scott: Cuz it's down.

881
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:26,507
Rym: Yep, and now you're fucked.

882
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:27,090
Scott: No, you're fucked.

883
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:27,693
Scott: So you got up both.

884
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,300
Rym: so community string.

885
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,333
Rym: There are three versions of SNMP as far as anyone would care.

886
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:33,518
Rym: one two, and three.

887
00:55:34,702 --> 00:55:37,330
Rym: Everybody uses one Nobody uses to.

888
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,579
Scott: wouldn't you use the newer one?

889
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:42,354
Rym: Three is the best and nobody fucking uses or two supports it by and large.

890
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:43,820
Scott: That's the way the world.

891
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,725
Rym: Here's the main difference.

892
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:49,849
Rym: one has basically no Authentication or security whatsoever.

893
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:57,480
Scott: So you can just if you find a device in the world You can probably just pull all its SNMPs and get all kinds of information without any whatever.

894
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,704
Rym: So you've got that.

895
00:55:58,764 --> 00:55:59,848
Rym: this is an operational concern.

896
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:08,939
Scott: You've got to control that with firewalls with the community string Let me guess that's actually good that SNMPs at the high level so you can actually firewall it pretty easily.

897
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:18,435
Rym: Yes It's very easy to firewall, but the community string in version one the way except, you know The SNMP of your firewall itself the way you do this by default.

898
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:19,640
Rym: It's public on every device.

899
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:31,620
Rym: Yeah you send a plain text string in your trap or Your server and then if you pull someone you give them this plain text string and if it matches what's on the server it responds.

900
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:38,089
Scott: So that would prevent people from polling because they basically need to know the password Unless they can sniff other SNMPs.

901
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:41,300
Scott: Yeah, if they sniff the SNMP traffic then they can see the community string.

902
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:52,580
Rym: Funnily enough because plain text which is kind of awesome because networks have become more and more switched and segregated It's actually made SNMP version one much more secure because it's actually more difficult to sniff.

903
00:56:52,660 --> 00:57:03,740
Rym: Yeah, if it's completely switched and you can't get past the switch and it's not wireless But if you're not stupid you're monitoring the switch and if the switch goes down then you know all the devices behind the switch.

904
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:04,502
Scott: That's right.

905
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:06,268
Rym: Yeah, but think about this.

906
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,194
Rym: notice how every concern you've raised.

907
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:10,300
Rym: There's not a technological solution.

908
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,813
Rym: There's just a logic solution a how do I want to monitor to my system?

909
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:14,495
Rym: What's where?

910
00:57:14,836 --> 00:57:18,572
Rym: it's actually a very Non-technical problem to solve in terms of monitoring.

911
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:20,098
Rym: the technical part is very small.

912
00:57:21,162 --> 00:57:23,631
Rym: So version 3 has real authentication, but no one uses it.

913
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:24,373
Rym: No one supports it.

914
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,902
Rym: Don't worry about it or Fucking.

915
00:57:26,922 --> 00:57:28,185
Scott: why people upgrade.

916
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:32,256
Rym: come on even because SNMP you realize is one of those ass old protocols.

917
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:35,046
Rym: you go to the net SNMP Website for Linux.

918
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:36,131
Scott: Is there anyone even on?

919
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:38,080
Scott: it's like even a community of people who even bother?

920
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,844
Scott: You're the only one left in the world.

921
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:42,453
Rym: It's very similar to the community around NTP.

922
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:44,180
Scott: You're like the only people left.

923
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:45,659
Scott: Yeah, three people who care.

924
00:57:46,820 --> 00:58:08,378
Rym: So if you want to get this going quick if you want to monitor a Linux server Make sure you have net SNMP installed and it'll give you a bunch of simple utilities like SNMP gets which you type SNMP get space and OID and an IP and In a community string and an SNMP version, you know, whatever data and you'll get back the value with that OID.

925
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:10,657
Rym: It's just a command-line protocol.

926
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:15,656
Rym: now You can do an SNMP walk which will walk down the MIB in an intelligent way.

927
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:16,760
Rym: So you give it a no ID.

928
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:23,608
Rym: It'll walk down everything under that OID every sub branch and it'll figure out all the sub branches based on the answers It gets along the way.

929
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:28,479
Rym: Mm-hmm It'll give you SNMP D and this is what you want to run.

930
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:58,427
Rym: SNMP D is a demon that responds to SNMP queries and if you run it, there's Etsy SNMP D dot-com and Basically you can put lines in there where you say OID Script and a couple other parameters and all it'll do is if you hit that OID from the outside It'll run that script with the privileges of root effectively through SNMPs demon and Return whatever you want.

931
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,440
Scott: that script to return sounds like gaping security hole to me.

932
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:07,580
Scott: If one of those scripts has any problems in it whatsoever, I could hit you on that number with and run his route.

933
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:11,480
Rym: Yes, that's why you have to not be an idiot.

934
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,268
Rym: Now there are ways SNMP has a get.

935
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:19,240
Rym: it also has a whole set system where you can change values like NTP.

936
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:24,880
Rym: There's this whole mechanism for sending SNMP traps or polls to change values on your server.

937
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:26,328
Rym: Do not use this.

938
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,289
Rym: it is insecure and it sucks Hey computer.

939
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:41,960
Scott: Yeah change the value of this parameter to slash temp slash exact whatever whatever, you know my root kit dot the.

940
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:51,678
Rym: So if you want to monitor processes like say you run Apache Tomcat Which is a very common thing or my SQL Apache Tomcat.

941
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:55,320
Rym: in my SQL That combination is probably run by more people out there than just about anything.

942
00:59:56,341 --> 01:00:04,495
Rym: so what you do is you install SNMP D and all that stuff and you run the demon and you edit the Etsy SNMP D Dot-com and you'll figure out this file.

943
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:05,280
Rym: read the man page.

944
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:05,561
Rym: You're not.

945
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:18,619
Rym: you guys I assume are fairly intelligent and you'll just write a little script that does a PS and make sure That Apache is running and that also makes sure that my SQL is running and then extend that through the MIT.

946
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:31,614
Rym: You know pick an OID that makes sense and just say, you know this OID corresponds to the script and then install nagios or something and point it at that OID and Then what it'll do is it'll pull that every 30 seconds every whatever.

947
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:38,560
Rym: every time you pull it It'll run that script which does the PS figures out of the processes are running and it'll return all these sub OIDs.

948
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,571
Rym: It'll return the string that the script returned.

949
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,260
Rym: It'll return the exit code of the script.

950
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:46,979
Rym: It'll return the system uptime and a million other things.

951
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:49,547
Rym: So you just have your monitoring.

952
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:55,671
Rym: say if that script ever returns a value that per the script I wrote indicates that my SQL and or Apache isn't running.

953
01:00:56,413 --> 01:00:57,116
Rym: That's an alarm.

954
01:00:57,698 --> 01:00:58,200
Scott: That's pretty good.

955
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,789
Scott: That's actually kind of easy, but she's in.

956
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:00,312
Scott: I thought it was.

957
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:00,694
Rym: it's.

958
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:01,640
Rym: it's really easy.

959
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,896
Rym: It's SNMP D dot-com in Etsy and SNMP D.

960
01:01:05,956 --> 01:01:09,427
Scott: but you got to write a lot of scripts Now or download them from the internet.

961
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:13,726
Rym: nagios and things like that basically come with a million scripts You can just put on don't?

962
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:15,214
Scott: they come with scripts for nagios.

963
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,140
Scott: Do they don't you know?

964
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,670
Scott: So they also come with scripts for SNMP D whatever.

965
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:21,316
Rym: They're basically the same thing.

966
01:01:21,336 --> 01:01:25,780
Rym: Okay, I Mean I could go into more details and whatever but you guys are smart.

967
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,468
Rym: You can figure it out and I think I have equipped you with the tools to Start to figure out how to monitor Linux.

968
01:01:31,628 --> 01:01:34,720
Scott: Can you bind SNMP D to just one of your ether?

969
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,520
Scott: Interfaces trivially, okay, because a lot of times it's like you got the external interface.

970
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,304
Scott: You don't want it to.

971
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:42,716
Scott: you want anyone accessing your SNMP from the externally.

972
01:01:42,736 --> 01:01:43,580
Rym: actually, you know what Scott?

973
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,290
Scott: I want it only on the internal interface.

974
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,099
Rym: I feel like at some point down the road We don't want to do boring, you know.

975
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,232
Rym: Actually teaching you stuff shows on a regular basis because people get bored.

976
01:01:51,874 --> 01:02:00,382
Rym: I feel like we might have to talk about how Networking works in Linux because I don't think many of our listeners know how to use IP tables or IP chains or any of That stuff.

977
01:02:00,522 --> 01:02:04,013
Rym: you read the instructions man, man IP tables.

978
01:02:04,294 --> 01:02:06,240
Scott: Well, you just go to Google type in IP tables.

979
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,605
Scott: Yeah, how to IP tables?

980
01:02:07,665 --> 01:02:08,026
Rym: feck.

981
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:21,537
Rym: Yeah, but seriously SNMP is really easy to use and if You learn it if you learn it enough to where you can on a Linux server Monitor an arbitrary process and whether or not is running just that nothing more.

982
01:02:21,577 --> 01:02:22,260
Scott: I could do that already.

983
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:25,760
Rym: You will be likened unto a wizard.

984
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:30,413
Rym: You will be a god-among-men of IT because nobody fucking knows this stuff.

985
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:31,998
Rym: I I'm amazed.

986
01:02:32,118 --> 01:02:33,285
Scott: I'm a CS guy I know it.

987
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:34,779
Scott: Yeah, just cuz I know Unix.

988
01:02:34,903 --> 01:02:38,400
Scott: Yeah And you just told me that there's a script and I just got to figure out what number to you.

989
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,050
Rym: In fact SNPD is included by default in most most distros.

990
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:42,932
Rym: look in your Ubuntu.

991
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:45,640
Rym: I'll bet Etsy SNPD.com is already there.

992
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,089
Scott: I don't know.

993
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,950
Rym: I don't know to be either honest either Are you do you have one open right now?

994
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:51,493
Rym: We could check.

995
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:51,835
Scott: No, I've.

996
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:52,700
Scott: no I don't either.

997
01:02:53,322 --> 01:02:57,196
Rym: I'm actually using sent OS and scientific Linux more and more just a civic Linux.

998
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:58,320
Scott: Yeah, what's what's in that?

999
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,147
Rym: You should look into that.

1000
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:01,704
Scott: All right How scientific could it be?

1001
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:08,429
Scott: It's used by sciency people by and large, but does it come with like no No, MATLAB already installed.

1002
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,246
Rym: I wish I think we're done Unlike other episodes.

1003
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,340
Rym: actually if you guys have questions, I would recommend sending them to us.

1004
01:03:16,581 --> 01:03:20,800
Rym: I could do a follow-up show like a special where I answer all your SNMP questions.

1005
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:22,891
Rym: I'll head one off at the pass.

1006
01:03:22,911 --> 01:03:31,020
Rym: if you want to monitor windows Sucks, and basically you're gonna have to buy an agent and run it on the server and that will send the SNMP.

1007
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:40,330
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1008
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:45,129
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1009
01:03:45,431 --> 01:03:47,398
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

1010
01:03:47,438 --> 01:03:50,450
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

1011
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:58,182
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows Sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1012
01:03:58,503 --> 01:04:02,493
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

1013
01:04:02,934 --> 01:04:06,022
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1014
01:04:06,203 --> 01:04:07,666
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

1015
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:09,090
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
