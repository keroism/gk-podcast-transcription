1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,528
Rym: It's Thursday, April 14th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:10,909
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:16,780
Scott: I am Scott.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,726
Rym: And this is Geek Nides.

5
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:22,420
Rym: Tonight, we're recording this in the future because Rym's off somewhere doing something.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,398
Scott: You mean the past.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:23,881
Rym: Yep.

8
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,369
Rym: Boat times.

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,440
Rym: Times on boats.

10
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:28,519
Scott: I'm on a boat.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,779
Scott: Let's do this.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,240
Rym: I actually watched that video again randomly recently because I had YouTube playing music.

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,405
Rym: All these remixes.

14
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:38,529
Rym: I can just let it go.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,020
Rym: YouTube was just playing its videos.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,386
Rym: Just video, video, video.

17
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:43,312
Rym: But I wasn't watching them.

18
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,780
Rym: I was just listening to them while I was working on something.

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,794
Rym: And suddenly, I'm on a boat came in and I was like,

20
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:47,955
Rym: "Alright."

21
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:52,760
Rym: And then I just basically listened to their entire discography after that.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,619
Rym: I think my favorite song they've ever done is actually that Michael Bolton one.

23
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,358
Scott: How did I know you'd pick that one?

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,584
Rym: How could I not?

25
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,957
Rym: When it gets to the Scarface stuff at the end, I can't help it.

26
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:04,700
Rym: It's just too good.

27
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,137
Scott: I think my favorite one is, "Throws you on the

28
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:08,680
Scott: ground.".

29
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,262
Rym: Yeah.

30
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,095
Rym: Well, that's the most useful one in my day-to-day life.

31
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:14,320
Rym: That one gets quoted the most.

32
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,278
Scott: You can't trust the system.

33
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:19,772
Rym: So, yeah.

34
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:21,920
Scott: Then it's not a phone.

35
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:29,319
Rym: I guess I'm at a financial conference today, so I'm not actually here right now.

36
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:34,740
Rym: So that's my opening vid, and we're recording extra shows in the past for the future.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,719
Rym: So you got any news?

38
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,528
Scott: No, because it's two days in the past.

39
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,775
Scott: I don't know what's happening on Thursday.

40
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:39,760
Scott: I can't do news about you.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,611
Rym: Not at all, but our news isn't supposed to be breaking news.

42
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:43,080
Rym: You're not supposed to get your news from GeekNights.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,104
Scott: Nothing has happened.

44
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,210
Scott: It's been so boring.

45
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,276
Scott: It's cold still.

46
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,080
Scott: There's your news.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,174
Rym: It's warm now in the past, like warmer than it was.

48
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,460
Rym: I wore sandals to work today.

49
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:52,246
Scott: Uh-huh.

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,040
Scott: It's not warm enough.

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,699
Rym: I wore sandals and white jeans.

52
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,678
Scott: It's too cold.

53
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,513
Rym: Maybe I'll bike to work tomorrow.

54
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:58,180
Rym: Just getting up there.

55
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:58,679
Scott: It's too cold.

56
00:01:58,966 --> 00:01:59,660
Rym: It's not that cold.

57
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,140
Rym: It's too cold.

58
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,170
Rym: Not like last weekend.

59
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,020
Rym: Fuck that.

60
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:03,750
Scott: Fuck all this cold.

61
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,039
Scott: It needs to be 80 at least.

62
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:12,800
Rym: So for those of you who don't know, it got cold enough to snow last weekend in New York City, and this whole swatch.

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:24,460
Rym: So I was at work on Thursday, and I saw someone tweet at me, and they tweeted at me this weather forecast that showed snow in New York days in the future, and I assumed they were joking.

64
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:30,342
Rym: I did not believe them until later when I got a New York City advisory saying, "Yo, dawg.

65
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,875
Rym: It's gonna freeze, so take your plants

66
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:33,056
Rym: in.".

67
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,679
Scott: It's too cold.

68
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,381
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,485
Rym: So I got news.

70
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,780
Rym: This is something Scott and I talked about a bunch in our lives, but we didn't talk about it on GeekNights.

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,386
Scott: It's not news.

72
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,659
Scott: It's the oldest story in the book.

73
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,325
Rym: March 20th, 2016 is not that long ago.

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,521
Scott: Yeah.

75
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,091
Scott: It's a specific instance of a thing.

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,940
Rym: Name another instance where this happened in this manner.

77
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:55,863
Scott: Uh...

78
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,260
Rym: I can name an instance where the opposite happened.

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,320
Scott: That would give away a prank that I have been pulling on you for a very long amount of time, and I would rather not give that away.

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:05,962
Rym: Ah.

81
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,500
Scott: So just keep it going.

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,327
Scott: Alright.

83
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:09,340
Rym: Alright.

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,380
Rym: So Kraft reveals revamped mac and cheese 50 million boxes later.

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,880
Rym: The story is that Kraft, for various reasons, changed the ingredients in their mac and cheese.

86
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:23,700
Scott: Yeah.

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:35,080
Rym: The new formula removed artificial preservatives, swapped out artificial dyes for a combination of paprika, annatto, and turmeric under development for three years, blah, blah, blah.

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,380
Rym: So basically, they changed the ingredients, and this probably didn't change the flavor.

89
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:43,119
Rym: They just made the ingredients better.

90
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:54,260
Rym: So it's telling that they used paprika and all this, not necessarily because of their flavor profile, but to make it look like cheese, as opposed to what I guess it would look like without those things.

91
00:03:54,841 --> 00:04:00,000
Rym: I imagine Kraft mac and cheese looks hellish and inedible without food coloring in it.

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,960
Scott: It looks, I mean, the way it looks when you make it is golden, right?

93
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,588
Rym: If you make real mac and cheese, it doesn't look golden.

94
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:11,960
Rym: It looks kind of whitish, but then it has the baking sort of like browning around the edges.

95
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:12,360
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,980
Rym: But they did this, and they had a big problem in the company, and apparently they debated this for a while, about whether or not to tell anyone that they were going to do it.

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,942
Scott: All right, so let me tell you.

98
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:31,240
Scott: So I used, for many moons, right, from like when I was very young until college, or no, until Beacon days, I drank this pineapple orange juice.

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,811
Scott: It was Dole brand, right?

100
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:36,608
Scott: The one with the sun for the... Dole brand, pineapple orange juice specifically.

101
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:50,220
Scott: And if you looked at the ingredients of pineapple orange juice back in the day when I drank it, the ingredients were like pineapple juice, orange juice, lemon squirt, and then a bunch of other crap like, you know, water and maybe sodium benzoate.

102
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:54,060
Rym: You drank this stuff like it was of religious libation.

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:05,820
Scott: This show was so good because it basically had all the power of orangey, but the pineapple cut off the sort of, you know, super orange flavor and sweetened it up.

104
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:10,900
Scott: But then this lemon squirt brought back the, you know, the citrus sting that you need.

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,065
Scott: And it's like, it would clear your throat out of any gunk.

106
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:21,880
Scott: and, you know, refreshing morning feelings came in like, ah, way better than Tropicana orangey.

107
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,757
Rym: That drove people to drink and prescribe vinegar if they were out of lime juice to prevent scurvy.

108
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:28,118
Rym: And guess what?

109
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:28,620
Rym: That doesn't work.

110
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,264
Scott: That doesn't work, but it tastes great.

111
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:34,535
Scott: And one cup, eight ounces of it gave you 200 percent of your daily intake, which is unnecessary.

112
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,779
Rym: But it still tasted good.

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,108
Rym: In old GeekNights, we used to talk about orange juice a lot.

114
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:44,160
Rym: Like, I don't think you guys understand how important orange juice was to our day to day lives.

115
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:52,300
Scott: So anyway, at some point when we were in Beacon, they changed the formula and it said on the carton like new, improved formula, whatever.

116
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:58,960
Scott: And the difference here is that not only was it new, improved formula, but they drastically changed the flavor.

117
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,774
Scott: The ingredient, number one ingredient, if you buy the stuff today, is apple juice.

118
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,420
Scott: And it tastes mostly like apple juice.

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,828
Scott: That squirt of lemon isn't even in there anymore.

120
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,520
Scott: I don't know how much pineapple and orange there is, but not much.

121
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:13,360
Scott: So at that point, I pretty much abandoned it and drank other juices.

122
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:22,380
Scott: And I've tried to replicate that juice, you know, like just by taking oranges, pineapples, and lemon and combining them and it doesn't quite taste the same.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Scott: Now, it tastes better sometimes because it's mad fresh, but it doesn't taste the same.

124
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,740
Scott: So, but the thing is they, A, actually changed the flavor and B, told you.

125
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,885
Scott: Here, they didn't change the flavor.

126
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,150
Scott: They just changed the ingredients and they didn't tell you.

127
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:43,439
Scott: because if they told you, but they didn't, you know, actually change the flavor, you'd still believe that it tasted different when it didn't.

128
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,320
Rym: See, there's a third element to this, a third direction.

129
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,840
Scott: And sales might go down and people start buying bunny brand instead.

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:59,340
Rym: When this, I mean, it's interesting how this is something that's largely forgotten among young people, but we, you know, Coke, Coca-Cola changed and became New Coke.

131
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,840
Rym: And they changed the flavor and they told everyone about it.

132
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:10,700
Rym: Now, in that case, all the research they had done showed that people overwhelmingly preferred the new flavor.

133
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,460
Scott: In a blind test, people preferred the new flavor.

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,840
Rym: They would always say the new flavor was abjectly superior.

135
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:24,959
Rym: And yet, when they told the public, "Hey, you all, we proved scientifically that you all love this new flavor, so this is the new flavor of

136
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:25,240
Rym: Coke.".

137
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,209
Rym: And people went crazy, boycotted it, disaster.

138
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:34,380
Rym: This was, like, one of the biggest corporate disasters in, like, consumer product history.

139
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,150
Rym: To the point that they actually went back to classic Coke.

140
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,300
Rym: That's why Coca-Cola today will be like classic Coca-Cola.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,192
Scott: Every time you ask a question, like, "Why does company do something so stupidly?

142
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:46,516
Scott: They could do it so much better.

143
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,539
Scott: Why don't they do it so much

144
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:47,820
Scott: better?".

145
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,380
Scott: It's because most people on Earth are morons.

146
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,320
Rym: Living in the dark, blindly feeling their way through things.

147
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,146
Scott: And they just, they hate change.

148
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,737
Scott: No matter what the change is, change is the enemy, right?

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,169
Scott: The status quo is the friend.

150
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,320
Scott: So, you can't change anything.

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,379
Scott: So, Kraft did the smart thing, which is, "Yes, change it for the better, and don't tell anyone, because then the morons will stop buying

152
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:12,480
Scott: it.".

153
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:19,218
Scott: If they would have just started putting that better Coke in the Coke cans without saying anything, even then- People would have been like, "Whoa, this Coke feels really good, ah,

154
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:19,379
Scott: ugh.".

155
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,862
Scott: Yeah.

156
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:24,640
Scott: I don't know why they don't do that now, especially, you know, but whatever.

157
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:38,700
Rym: So, basically, if you read this article, because I'm not, you know, you can read the article, I'm not just going to summarize it all for you, but what Kraft did is they changed it, they changed it, and they kept it a desperate secret for a long time.

158
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,099
Rym: Until they were confident that people had been eating the new one for a long time.

159
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:51,520
Rym: No one noticed at all, and then they announced, "Hey, we've got a new Kraft whatever, and guess what?

160
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:55,120
Rym: We already sold over 50 million boxes, and you've been eating it-".

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,908
Scott: But they didn't make, like, a huge announcement.

162
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,375
Scott: I don't know if they're TV commercials.

163
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,799
Scott: I think the announcement was just like- They did a new ad campaign.

164
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,459
Scott: Oh, okay.

165
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:08,280
Rym: After it was out there for a long time, saying, "It changed, but it hasn't, because none of you noticed.

166
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:13,195
Rym: It's the same thing you've always had, but we did change it, so eat a

167
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:13,496
Rym: dick.".

168
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:19,240
Scott: They didn't have to say anything ever, they could have just kept doing what they were doing.

169
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:43,980
Rym: Yeah, so the story is just an interesting sort of, even if you know there is a smart, right thing to do, or you know an answer to a question, if you interact with the mass market, you sometimes have to do very counterintuitive things, or hide information from people that is not relevant to them, because otherwise they will make very poor, ill-informed decisions based on things that they literally made up.

170
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,963
Scott: You don't need to know that.

171
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:51,907
Scott: What you need to know is that if you're the kind of moron who opposes something simply because it's changed, you're the problem in this world, fuck you.

172
00:09:51,927 --> 00:10:01,820
Scott: If you're the kind of person who, when you hear that something is now changed and improved, and that makes you excited, and you want to go seek it out, you are the good person who is the savior of this world.

173
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:14,680
Rym: Now I wonder if the fact that you had such difficulty in those early days, because you guys don't understand, Scott was like experimenting with different mixes of the three juices for weeks when he lost his recipe, like trying to recreate it.

174
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,639
Scott: If they hadn't said anything- I sent them a letter and they didn't help me out.

175
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:23,080
Rym: If they hadn't said anything, would you have noticed?

176
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,093
Scott: Would I have noticed, right?

177
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:29,606
Scott: Well it is- Because maybe the reason- It is a very significantly different flavor, right?

178
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:38,400
Scott: It's like I actually, if I recall correctly, I bought it and drank it and then said, "This tastes different," and then noticed the thing on the carton afterwards.

179
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,120
Rym: But is it possible that the reason, because there's only three ingredients, like there's not that many options for your dosage here.

180
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:53,140
Rym: Is it possible that the reason you can't recreate that flavor is that that flavor existed solely in the nostalgia post-change?

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Rym: Your brain created an ideal that cannot be attained.

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,391
Scott: The only thing I have to reference the flavor now is my memory.

183
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,520
Scott: I don't even have a sample, so I can't know.

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,480
Rym: So you might have mythologized the memory of that flavor.

185
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:12,680
Scott: But the original change happened at a period where I had a container of the old stuff and a container of the new stuff in the fridge at the same time.

186
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,579
Scott: I polished off the old one and the next day I went for the new one, and I said, "Whoa, what's going on

187
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:17,740
Scott: here?".

188
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:25,260
Scott: There are times where, for example, one time I went to Grand Central to the Hot N' Crusty, which is closed by the way.

189
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:27,889
Rym: I'm real sad about that.

190
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:28,895
Rym: I haven't fully grokked it yet.

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,331
Scott: I bought the one serving orange juice and I started to drink it and I went, "Ah!

192
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,818
Scott: What is wrong with this one serving orange juice?

193
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:36,059
Scott: Is it

194
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:36,380
Scott: bad?".

195
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:41,994
Scott: And I looked at it and I had accidentally purchased grapefruit orangy, and I can't take grapefruit.

196
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,500
Scott: It's too acid-y and it's no good.

197
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:52,340
Scott: And so even though my brain was thinking the whole time, "This is orangey," and didn't suspect any, you know, I just thought it was orangey.

198
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,207
Scott: I didn't, you know, but my tongue did not lie.

199
00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:03,360
Scott: So there is an extent to which you can change something to where the senses will still detect change regardless of psychology.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,035
Rym: True, true.

201
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,579
Scott: You can't put battery acid in the milk container to have someone drink it and go,

202
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:08,780
Scott: "Ah!"

203
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,043
Scott: Milk!

204
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:10,039
Rym: Not with Benjamin R!

205
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:10,960
Scott: Right.

206
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,237
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

207
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:20,720
Rym: What do you got?

208
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,479
Scott: It was another link that I sent you.

209
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,418
Rym: You don't remember this too?

210
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,260
Scott: I have to click on it to remember it.

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,599
Rym: Alright, so I can do mine first.

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:38,180
Rym: So, as you know, one of the things that I hate and am displeased by more than anything else in the world is bike thieves.

213
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,545
Rym: I've had my bike stolen multiple times.

214
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,491
Rym: I know a lot of people have their bikes stolen.

215
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,780
Rym: New York City is the bike stealingest place in America.

216
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,939
Rym: It's a problem for a lot of reasons.

217
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:59,519
Rym: And this is a video, purportedly, now I do not, I mean, it looks pretty legit, and I was going through this guy's channel, and I am not making a claim that everything in this channel is 100% legit.

218
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:10,780
Rym: But, "Stun gun in bike seat, prank in the hood, electric bait bike prank, karma, social experiment" is the video.

219
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:20,420
Rym: And the video is basically, he has a stun gun rigged with a cell phone hidden in a bike, and the stun gun is right where your balls are in a bike seat.

220
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,060
Rym: So, he can call a number, and the stun gun just starts going.

221
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,798
Scott: What the fuck is going on?

222
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:38,120
Rym: And then the video is just leaving the bike unlocked in bad neighborhoods, waiting for someone to eventually steal it, and then calling the number and watching them get their balls shot.

223
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Rym: It is extremely cathartic to watch this video, and while I'm not necessarily a fan of vigilante justice, I'm not that opposed to this level of entrapment.

224
00:13:51,260 --> 00:14:03,860
Rym: The level of, here is an easy crime that would harm a person if it was a real crime, but it's actually a trap that will not kill them, it's not like there's a shotgun in the bike seat, but will cause them significant discomfort.

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:12,439
Rym: So, while I enjoyed this, there's another video in the channel that I saw right after that, that I have to call attention to.

226
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:20,860
Rym: Car Bomb Bait Car Prank in the Hood, Public Bomb Scare Prank, Instant Karma, Best Pranks.

227
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:33,080
Rym: This guy has this fucking rigged up, fake looking, like a bomb, like three sticks of dynamite, and a really long set of, you know those fuses you buy if you make your own fireworks?

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:58,141
Rym: Like the ones that go real slow and real big like pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss ssss.

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,978
Rym: car and driving it around at people which is funny in its own.

230
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:09,857
Rym: I mean obviously a little mean but just the idea of that is kind of funny to me.

231
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,002
Scott: use it in a crowd.

232
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,353
Scott: let me get on the roller coaster next.

233
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:16,657
Scott: swerve gentlemen.

234
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:25,208
Rym: but basically the what the gist of this video is purportedly and the video is pretty funny is he Lee.

235
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:50,656
Rym: he parks a beater car in a bad neighborhood with the window down in the door and locked and there's some valuables laying around in the car and in the backseat is just this fake fucking bomb to sit in there and he waits for someone to sit down in the car because a car thief will just steal the car but it's a thief of opportunity will not like stand around outside the car like people who regularly steal from unlocked cars.

236
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:51,682
Rym: they know what they're doing.

237
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:55,726
Rym: if you see an unlocked car you open the door and you sit down in it and close the door.

238
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,279
Rym: that way you're in the car.

239
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,175
Rym: unless someone walks up to the car is the owner of the car.

240
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,678
Rym: they're not going to think anything wrong with someone sitting in a car.

241
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,040
Scott: so now I think this person knows a lot about bike stealing and cars.

242
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,818
Scott: yeah it's not a high quality prison.

243
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,990
Rym: well they're all they're they're they're.

244
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,860
Rym: they're regular modern-day Batman.

245
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:13,583
Rym: yeah.

246
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:23,339
Rym: so the way this works is that after they sit in the car and there's cameras like rigged up in the car everywhere wait a few minutes or a few seconds and then trigger this.

247
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:31,719
Rym: so the person turns around and usually some variation of what the fuck holy fuck followed by like running out of the car screaming dropping stuff.

248
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,402
Rym: it's pretty great.

249
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,791
Rym: but he went one step further.

250
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:39,178
Rym: the car is rigged so that the handle on the inside of the car will not work.

251
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,939
Rym: hmm so they have to jump out the window.

252
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,647
Rym: so I invite you to enjoy these videos.

253
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:52,394
Scott: so this guy someone I guess who follows this YouTube channel this is big Clive dot-com.

254
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,359
Scott: what's up big Clive?

255
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,169
Scott: somebody found a USB charger similar to the ones we get from anchor that let you charge five USB devices.

256
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,417
Rym: I'm holding one of my hands right now.

257
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,313
Rym: this one charges six.

258
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,383
Scott: whoa daddy.

259
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,390
Scott: yeah anyway I want to work.

260
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:11,265
Scott: that is 10. so but this is like some off-brand crappy one.

261
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:19,134
Scott: and someone bought this somewhere and when they went to use it they noticed like huh this shocked me when I tried to use it.

262
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:19,476
Scott: it's like.

263
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,160
Scott: well that can happen.

264
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,537
Scott: no it shocked me like my muscles were like contracting whoa.

265
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,550
Scott: this shocked me like when I put the wire near something.

266
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,757
Scott: there were sparks like when Rym was in that cage.

267
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:41,770
Rym: oh yeah when I tell when I touch when I grabbed the door to the server cage to open it and then I stopped because I thought an earthquake was happening and it took me a while to realize that I was being shocked.

268
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:44,223
Rym: with one phase of a 220 line.

269
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,753
Scott: so big Clive knows about electronics.

270
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:49,893
Scott: so they sent this to big Clive and he made this video examining this USB charger.

271
00:17:49,913 --> 00:18:01,163
Scott: and apparently you know when you make an electronic device that say plugs into the wall you know you have AC power coming from the wall right yep and mains love power deadly power deadly power.

272
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:05,302
Scott: but on the other side you've got USB which is like a handful of volts.

273
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:09,320
Rym: but if you make a shitty device I mean it's just wires right the wire.

274
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,131
Rym: from all searches the wire that's on the USB

275
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:37,759
Scott: on the circuit board they'll always be sort of this divide between the part that uses the PI powered electricity and the part that uses like the low power DC with the transformer in between in a big gap so that there isn't any short circuits of electricity jumping across and apparently in this USB charger that gap was not sufficient you know and big Clive goes to investigate exactly what's wrong here.

276
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,339
Rym: the moral is don't buy dodgy imported like Chinese nonsense USB chargers.

277
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,305
Rym: they might actually kill you.

278
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:48,956
Scott: yeah this video though the problem with it is is like 28 minutes and 20 seconds long my kind of video fast forward.

279
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:53,499
Scott: most of this because it's mostly him trying to like break the case open for like five minutes.

280
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,736
Rym: so there's a channel I follow that isn't like I didn't live editing.

281
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:06,914
Rym: there's a channel I follow that's edited better than that but it's basically just this guy tearing apart shitty imported Chinese electronics and showing how dangerous it is and they're really long videos.

282
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,383
Rym: but he really goes into that detail.

283
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,497
Rym: that's the guy who showed me about those shower heads.

284
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:11,944
Rym: that will shock you if you get close to them.

285
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:24,822
Rym: but yeah there was a story actually a few months ago of a woman I think was in the UK who was killed by an iPhone charger because she had headphones plugged in and this thing just mains line and killed her straight up.

286
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:31,884
Rym: hmm so uh yeah don't buy cheap USB chargers guys by it when it comes to electricity.

287
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,360
Rym: at least anchor anchors the minimum for a USB charger.

288
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:37,608
Scott: get the name-brand biz.

289
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:44,458
Rym: yeah Sorni magnet box mmm asinonic if you can't tell I've been watching a lot of Simpsons lately.

290
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,085
Rym: yeah in the minute moment.

291
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:51,794
Rym: next weekend we're gonna be at PAX East 2016. we're doing a panel on Sunday at 3 30 Atari game design.

292
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,528
Rym: we're gonna be there Thursday playing games in the awesome tabletop area.

293
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,035
Rym: their megathon is off the hook.

294
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,785
Rym: the book of the book is Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood pretty much done with Wheel of Time temporarily.

295
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,594
Rym: so I'll actually read that book.

296
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:09,414
Rym: probably start it like right around packs times mm-hmm.

297
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,701
Rym: otherwise the patreon hit its first goal the gig.

298
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:12,465
Rym: nice patreon.

299
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,595
Scott: so I am you can all stop giving.

300
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:15,660
Scott: now you hit your stupid goal.

301
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,787
Scott: I know there's another girl.

302
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:17,653
Scott: you don't need that goal.

303
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:22,263
Rym: if you hit the next goal I'm gonna make videos detailing the full gig nights process like all the filters I use.

304
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:25,618
Rym: go back to zero all the all the everything no one.

305
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,482
Rym: you get the next goal.

306
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,659
Rym: after that we're gonna live stream every episode of gig night.

307
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,610
Rym: you don't need to just go back to zero.

308
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,334
Rym: let me fun stuff.

309
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,420
Scott: you can go back to zero now.

310
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,286
Scott: you got your beta episode.

311
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:35,898
Rym: we're also stepping up the rimily review.

312
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:38,978
Rym: so Emily and I are gonna be reviewing a few things in the coming weeks.

313
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:48,668
Rym: you don't need that either and I'm re-releasing all eight or possibly nine pre publication beta episodes of geek guides with commentary remastered in the patreon over the next few weeks.

314
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:50,379
Scott: you got what you wanted so you can cancel that.

315
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,390
Rym: nope now there's gonna be so much more.

316
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:56,796
Rym: the more the higher it goes the more I'm ramping up the shit and you don't need any that guy gonna be amazing.

317
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:59,669
Scott: no your life will be much better off without that stuff in fact.

318
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:05,038
Rym: so I've never been on like a Princess cruise or a Carnival cruise or anything like that.

319
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:14,992
Rym: and while several people in our lives have tried to convince me that they're worthwhile I am highly dubious of that kind of boat time.

320
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,575
Rym: hmm I mean it.

321
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:24,963
Scott: as far as I can tell those cruises are pretty much just hotels turned sideways that you can't leave easily.

322
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:30,320
Rym: yeah with that move with buffets and norovirus and you can't.

323
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:34,538
Scott: but they provide you with much food and you know you go to a hotel.

324
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:37,717
Scott: usually you don't like go in the pool but when you go to that hotel you can't.

325
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:39,969
Scott: you can't leave and go to attractions near the hotel.

326
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,487
Scott: you do all the in hotel stuff like spas and pools and shit.

327
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:53,974
Rym: now my suspicions were concerts and parties and whatever by other people I know who work on cruises who were like yeah it's mostly just old and or fat people but it was double can.

328
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:59,491
Rym: he's in there the last time I was in Sydney and I think I talked about the same geek guys I was the basic folk I was running.

329
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:08,312
Rym: I was doing a long run like all around like the opera house area and a big cruise ship was getting ready to depart so the people who were going on the cruise were all showing up.

330
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:11,404
Scott: let me guess you're gonna talk about how old and fat they were.

331
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,671
Rym: they were so old.

332
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:14,815
Scott: how how were they?

333
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:19,515
Rym: it was like I would say the people who were cuz it was weird.

334
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,480
Rym: the staging area one.

335
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:28,340
Rym: there was a giant line of people who were I guess standing in line to use the elevator to go up because they didn't want to walk up the stairs and up there.

336
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,169
Rym: there was like a restaurant.

337
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,320
Rym: there was a little like you could check your bags.

338
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,430
Rym: there was a lounge and a bunch of bars.

339
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:39,918
Rym: I think there was a hotel even like people were staying there for a few days before they even got on the cruise ship

340
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,300
Scott: regaven

341
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,108
Rym: and 95% of the people appeared to be either or both these are not mutually exclusive over the age of 70 maybe 65 maybe 65 and over 300 pounds.

342
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:57,426
Rym: it was amazing to behold.

343
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:14,103
Rym: and while the argument that has been made to me by many people is that the beauty of a cruise is that if you go with like a lot of your friends like 20 or 30 for like really close friends then it's like those college days where you're basically in this hotel floating with pools and all the nonsense.

344
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:22,645
Rym: other people are taking care of everything for you and you basically just hang out with your friends on a pleasure cruise and ignore all the other people.

345
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,865
Scott: but couldn't you do that in a place that doesn't have all those other people to begin with?

346
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,597
Rym: or couldn't you just do that in say Vegas?

347
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:38,765
Rym: I decided that if because I went to Vegas with Emily not that long ago for a wedding if you're gonna do that just go to fucking Disney World or Vegas and you get all those.

348
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,544
Rym: say all the things that people say you can get from a cruise like that.

349
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:43,387
Scott: Vegas is warm.

350
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:44,691
Rym: yeah Vegas is warm.

351
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:48,044
Rym: if shit sucks you can just go to a different hotel.

352
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:51,620
Rym: it's not like you're stuck on one hotel in Vegas the whole time.

353
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,577
Scott: You can get a flight to anywhere on earth yep and it's otherwise.

354
00:23:56,598 --> 00:24:01,965
Rym: it's like it's all the accoutrement of a cruise without having to be stuck on a boat full of norovirus mm-hmm.

355
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:04,635
Rym: so have you ever had a boat time you ever been on a boat?

356
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,873
Scott: I've never been on a biggest boat like that.

357
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,361
Rym: I've never been on a cruise ship like that.

358
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:10,686
Scott: I've been on all right.

359
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:11,971
Rym: what's the biggest boat you've ever been on?

360
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,646
Scott: I went on like this tiny cruise.

361
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,376
Scott: it was like we were in high school.

362
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:25,000
Scott: we went on a trip to DC and then part of the trip to DC was at one night we had dinner on this boat.

363
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,195
Scott: so we got on the boat and we ate dinner and so it had.

364
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:37,856
Scott: it basically was like a boat that you would get like you know to have like a wedding on or something only you know right and in like the main area is like a ballroom.

365
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:42,701
Scott: yep yep and then it goes out and then you and then you go up on deck and it basically went up and down.

366
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:45,197
Scott: you know this the river that's outside the National Harbor right?

367
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,476
Scott: yeah yeah basically went up and down that river and then we got.

368
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:49,849
Rym: well didn't we do the same that you came with when we saw was joco.

369
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,085
Scott: this was bigger than that boat but same kind of.

370
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:53,830
Rym: but yeah we did that.

371
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:01,675
Rym: the mini joco crews were basically we just got on a boat with a bunch of cool people and there was a concert and drinks and hanging out on a boat going up and down the yeah

372
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:08,321
Scott: imagine like that same exact deal only all high school kids and boat was two or three times as big.

373
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:14,897
Rym: I actually did stuff like that a lot when I was younger but I grew up in Michigan where there actually is a significant boat culture.

374
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,996
Rym: like there's a lot of canals and places where people to zone boats like.

375
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:30,478
Rym: they'll have a boat in their backyard and the canal just like goes behind all the houses in the subdivision and everyone has a boat parked in their boat parking lot behind their house and they can take the canals and get out to the lakes and stuff.

376
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,623
Scott: I mean it's summer camp.

377
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:34,735
Scott: I did a lot of rowboat canoe kayak.

378
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:38,872
Scott: I never did anything with a sail on it cuz I no one taught me how.

379
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:49,659
Rym: but I guess it's interesting that like here and I've been on really big boats that were just docked like you know oh like in South Street seaport like the pirate ship kind of things.

380
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,051
Scott: well I mean like like in Groton Connecticut like I went on.

381
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:53,880
Scott: you know giant submarine.

382
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,145
Scott: it was just there right.

383
00:25:55,206 --> 00:26:00,977
Rym: but living here like the only boats I'll go on in New York City are like that joco thing where they're like there's a lot.

384
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:02,465
Rym: there's a common event.

385
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:05,056
Scott: people will do wherever you go in the circle line.

386
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:06,000
Scott: yeah it's also.

387
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,976
Scott: there's also some restaurants that are just docked boats that don't move.

388
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:13,180
Rym: but like people will rent a boat and do an event and you pay money to do that event.

389
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,873
Rym: or you're a rich person and you own a boat.

390
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:20,254
Scott: I think I've been on like a slow riverboat that might have been Disney World or was it somewhere else.

391
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,181
Scott: you know the kind with the thing in the back that goes chicka chicka chicka like a paddle boat.

392
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,408
Rym: no a paddle boat.

393
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,997
Scott: no like the Mississippi River style.

394
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:28,921
Rym: yeah a paddle boat.

395
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:31,071
Scott: you're not paddling like you know.

396
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,683
Rym: Oh Scott that's called a paddle boat paddle wheel.

397
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:34,688
Scott: they called a riverboat.

398
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,859
Scott: it's just like a giant mill in the back.

399
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,873
Rym: pedal boats have the pedal wheels on the back.

400
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:40,878
Scott: oh not like that.

401
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:41,561
Rym: yeah not like that.

402
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,055
Rym: you're thinking the one with the one giant wheel like a maverick.

403
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,482
Scott: yes yeah like that one.

404
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:56,988
Rym: so but what I was getting at is that here probably like boats are a rich person thing or a bunch of people get together and basically rent a boat and charge admission to cover the rental of the boat.

405
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:03,191
Rym: but where I grew up boats were like a lower middle class middle class thing.

406
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:07,692
Rym: like a lot of people I knew own boats well I use them regularly.

407
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:08,959
Scott: well see it's all Japan right.

408
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:14,686
Scott: so if you live in a place where there's a lot of bodies of water it's cheaper to live near the body of water.

409
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:18,004
Scott: you can get all kinds of you know getting an actual boat is kind of cheap.

410
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:28,763
Rym: maintaining a boat is what's really expensive yeah but if your house only cost a hundred grand and it has five bedrooms and it happens to be on the water like you can afford to buy a boat and spend all that like your boat money and mate.

411
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:29,085
Scott: right.

412
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:37,750
Scott: but if you less than guys in a suburb that's not near any kind of lake or anything or any large body of water having a boat is only you know something a rich person you do.

413
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:42,852
Rym: yep but if you live in New York you can't afford to live here and have a boat.

414
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,670
Scott: unless you're so rich you can afford to live here and have a boat.

415
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:59,442
Rym: so it's interesting that perspective because where I grew up like so many of my friends had boats that a common thing I would do in high school is one of my friends be like hey we're gonna have a party on the boat and a bunch of us teenagers would just get on a pretty big boat.

416
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:08,044
Rym: and the one slightly wealthier friend who either had permission from his parents or scammed like 30 bucks out of all of us so he could afford to like refill the tanks.

417
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,054
Rym: they wouldn't notice that we took the boat out.

418
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:19,036
Rym: then we just take the boat out to like the mid like we go way out into one of the Great Lakes and just hang out on a boat in the middle of the night on a boat.

419
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:21,851
Rym: yeah and those are some of my best high school times.

420
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,139
Rym: there's something about like.

421
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:33,506
Rym: I've always enjoyed that sitting in a boat in the middle of the water way out at night where there's all black around you you see like cargo ships way off in the distance and you see the shore.

422
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:37,662
Rym: they come and smash in you but don't go into the shipping lane.

423
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,446
Rym: the fuck's wrong with you.

424
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,530
Rym: at least everyone who took the boats out knew what they were doing with the boats.

425
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:45,339
Rym: I never went out with the people who.

426
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,687
Scott: that's the thing with a car?

427
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:54,296
Scott: you know even though you look around this country right and people are driving everywhere in the world people are driving everywhere and they can't drive for shit but they do it anyway.

428
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,728
Scott: yeah it's they manage to get by even though they suck.

429
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,600
Scott: with a boat you can't get by if you suck.

430
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:14,022
Scott: also there's a lot more to know than there is to know like if the boats already out out of the docks you can get by knowing nothing pretty easily unless there's any unless there's even some even the slightest thing out of the ordinary.

431
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:18,933
Scott: if you just have to make the boat go and change its direction and it has a steering wheel you can get by.

432
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,876
Rym: yeah because you'll turn the steering wheel and fuck it up and you'll go way off course but there's nothing to hit.

433
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:23,480
Scott: right.

434
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:32,236
Scott: but as soon as you get into a situation of any kind like there's something not exactly 100% right with the boat dead you're just dead right.

435
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:33,221
Scott: yeah everyone's dead.

436
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:38,604
Scott: you know the boat is having a trouble or you know the boat is leaning one way.

437
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:40,774
Scott: you know there's someone coming near you.

438
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:44,775
Rym: it's like well I'll put it this way like we talked about how everyone's a shitty drive there's a fish.

439
00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:48,917
Rym: most people who drive cars cannot parallel park at all like they can't do it.

440
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,375
Scott: well most places you don't have to do it so they don't learn how.

441
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,080
Scott: they don't make anyone.

442
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:59,998
Rym: so actually taking a moderate sized boat and getting it back into the dock without fucking everything up is about like parallel parking.

443
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:02,752
Rym: you got to know what you're doing and if you like use boats at all.

444
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:03,817
Rym: it's real easy.

445
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,447
Scott: you don't want to crash into the dock.

446
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:08,847
Scott: yeah you don't want to miss the dock and be too far away to tie up to it.

447
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:16,304
Rym: mostly there's not a lot of space in there and there's a lot of other boats around to navigate and also the steering of a boat out in the middle of the water.

448
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:19,885
Rym: it's real easy because if you're way off it doesn't really matter that much.

449
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:23,628
Scott: but when you have to maneuver it the precision needs to be so tight it's so you've got.

450
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:25,659
Scott: the water is also affecting your boat.

451
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,932
Scott: it's not like a car where nothing affects its movement.

452
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:28,898
Scott: it's just sitting still.

453
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:34,329
Scott: the boat will move on its own if you just don't do anything yeah and also things like you're going forward in a pretty good clip.

454
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,743
Rym: right there's no break on the boat it's not like.

455
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,238
Rym: well I'm gonna stop now folks gonna keep going forward.

456
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:44,263
Rym: you start to turn to the left you're gonna start spinning while you're still moving forward.

457
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:54,354
Rym: yep and I've watched a lot of people fuck their small boats up because they don't actually know how to maneuver it in close quarters or they vastly underestimate their speed and just don't know about boats.

458
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:54,957
Rym: mm-hmm.

459
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,743
Rym: so but it was.

460
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:59,919
Rym: but again I grew up in a place where everyone knew about boats.

461
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:02,895
Scott: so we're boat people and you hang out on boats and some lakes there.

462
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:11,667
Rym: I actually do wish that boating was more accessible financially in the New York area because there's a lot of water here.

463
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,046
Scott: I would really I don't touch the water but I wouldn't mind being in a boat.

464
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,320
Rym: I don't really enjoy taking a boat out with like.

465
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:22,166
Scott: say like you me Emily I see some boats going down the river and man those are some fancy fucking boats.

466
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:26,993
Scott: I saw a boat that was basically like evil Bondville in the boat and I'm like damn I should just hijack that motherfucker.

467
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:35,523
Rym: like imagine on a nice night with the fireworks right we go out and we just like do a long leisurely circle out like seeing New York in the distance the fireworks in the distance.

468
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,559
Scott: I don't think they'll let you boat when the fireworks are there.

469
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,296
Rym: well not right where the barges are but you go off a ways and you can but imagine like that like hanging out like I'm driving the boat.

470
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:47,066
Scott: you guys are all rent a boat then big money man.

471
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:49,152
Rym: no that much money.

472
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:54,110
Rym: a one-night rental one-night rental of a big boat is actually not that cheap.

473
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:00,925
Rym: and I am NOT going to say that my boating skills are adequate to this area because I mean first of all we know people's boating skills.

474
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,101
Scott: and two you can always rent someone to go with the boat.

475
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:06,898
Rym: yeah the right way to go is to rent the kind of boat that did.

476
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,487
Rym: like that Hall & Oates thing we went to on Judith's bachelor party.

477
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:14,946
Rym: mm-hmm you it was a real funny boat time.

478
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:23,054
Rym: so it was the same kind of boat as the joke of thing and it was a Hall & Oates tribute band okay which I'm into.

479
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:31,073
Rym: okay there was another boat that was bigger that was filling up next to us and there was something else going on that looked way better on that boat.

480
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,024
Rym: but there was a weird sort of aside.

481
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:36,121
Rym: there was a stark dichotomy between the people getting on the boat.

482
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:42,564
Rym: the Hall & Oates tribute band boat was basically all yuppie hipster looking white people.

483
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,872
Rym: the other boat was all cool people.

484
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:51,705
Rym: hmm that other boat like whatever party was happening on that boat looked amazing and that boat went off into the sunset.

485
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,675
Rym: I heard the music coming from that boat.

486
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:55,142
Rym: that's the boat I should have been on.

487
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:56,426
Scott: why didn't you get on the cool boat?

488
00:32:56,446 --> 00:33:01,894
Rym: I would had to jump and swim for it and I don't know if they would let me up.

489
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,242
Scott: you couldn't do good weren't close enough.

490
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,125
Scott: you couldn't jump and grab.

491
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:04,768
Scott: it was too late.

492
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:13,356
Rym: the boat was action but the Hall & Oates boat went up and down the East River and no one went to see the Hall & Oates.

493
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:14,603
Rym: we all just hung out on the deck.

494
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:23,631
Rym: because that feeling of being on a boat with the shore in the distance looking up at the sky the fresh breeze drinking something hanging out with friends good times smells like water.

495
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,762
Scott: yep I really enjoy smells like East River.

496
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:29,572
Rym: it smelled okay actually for some reason.

497
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:41,123
Rym: wind blowing the right direction yeah something blowing the wrong direction you know in that Jersey air coming back across yeah what all little boats yeah ever go like kayaking.

498
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:42,469
Scott: I talked about summer camp.

499
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:47,409
Scott: you know every summer camp has a tiny lake and that always has you know like a kayak.

500
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,242
Rym: yeah a rowboat you know what I always enjoy.

501
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,910
Rym: a lot of kids we talk about skill.

502
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,761
Rym: kids fucking don't know how to use canoes.

503
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,471
Scott: windsurfing I know how to use a canoe.

504
00:33:55,511 --> 00:34:01,204
Rym: yeah most kids don't seem to know how to use canoes and rafts are way harder than canoes for people who don't know how to use them.

505
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,351
Scott: well I mean a raft sucks.

506
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:10,251
Scott: it's a big rectangle just like it sucks right and you can get your raft you just spin around in a circle way worse than a canoe does at least you know.

507
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,498
Scott: at least a canoe has a point.

508
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,411
Scott: so you know which direction is forward or backward.

509
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:21,753
Rym: actually I think the hardest thing that the kids have the most trouble with an actual like traditional rowboat like the slightly wide we have two people.

510
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:23,822
Scott: a rowboat I think is just less efficient.

511
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,833
Scott: so you need more muscles to move it.

512
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:27,922
Scott: yeah and it's heavier and right.

513
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:28,364
Scott: it's less.

514
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,757
Scott: you know dynamic they're also really unstable.

515
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:32,178
Scott: it takes.

516
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,344
Scott: yeah it takes a lot more like you know power to move the rowboat like we had a race you know you could lose.

517
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:43,853
Scott: it's a strong person in the rowboat could lose to a somewhat weaker person in the canoe just because the canoe is better.

518
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:49,635
Scott: it's like yeah you know someone's got a Ferrari and you got a not Ferrari.

519
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:54,212
Rym: yeah I do really enjoy kayaking but I don't like tandem kayaking that much.

520
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:55,438
Rym: I like my own kayak.

521
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,987
Scott: yeah I don't I don't understand.

522
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:04,219
Scott: the two-person kayak is the whole point of the kayak is like ah finally the one-person boat not a stupid two-person canoe action.

523
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,437
Rym: the two-person canoe is good well canoe but the two-person kayak is good.

524
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:13,632
Rym: if you're doing distance kayaking like what if you're kayaking like all the way up the river to Yonkers or like beacon or something?

525
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:13,914
Scott: well that's.

526
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,788
Scott: the other thing with the kayak is that it's so tiny.

527
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:19,669
Scott: you can just like throw a rope and just like you know binge off someone else's kayak.

528
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,968
Scott: yeah right it's like I'll just tie myself to your kayak and take a nap.

529
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,799
Rym: but I really enjoy kayaking.

530
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,108
Rym: actually it's a sport I kind of miss that.

531
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:28,656
Rym: I feel like I should get into again.

532
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,923
Scott: I like kayaking.

533
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,961
Scott: I just have no arm strength so I can't really do anything except let the water push me.

534
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,189
Rym: yeah you know you need to do.

535
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,197
Rym: you know you're biking so much.

536
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:35,944
Rym: you got strong legs.

537
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:43,444
Rym: you got to do that to your arms then you can kayak because if you're strong or I could just not do that but if you're strong kayaks can go real fucking fast.

538
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,332
Scott: yeah what kind of hurry am I in?

539
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,866
Rym: it's just really fun to go really fast in the water like that.

540
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:48,731
Scott: yeah I like some.

541
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,238
Scott: I like some lazy river action.

542
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,624
Rym: I'm thinking about fast.

543
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:57,076
Rym: I think I want to go out to Jamaica Bay and rent a kayak and go poking around and all those like marshes and everything.

544
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:57,963
Scott: are you allowed to go in?

545
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:58,285
Scott: there isn't.

546
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,273
Scott: there isn't a reserve.

547
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:00,080
Scott: you're not allowed to go in there.

548
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:08,245
Rym: some areas you know some you can't but there's a lot of kayaking out that way like you can just go out and buy a kayak and tie it to the roof of your car like a yuppie whatever.

549
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:13,336
Rym: no you'd you'd fucking like go out there and rent a kayak and use it there and then leave the kayak when you go home.

550
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:15,287
Scott: I've never seen her kayak rental over there.

551
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:16,495
Rym: there's a lot of kayak rentals.

552
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:16,817
Rym: New York.

553
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,045
Rym: actually there's places here.

554
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:19,935
Rym: you can get kayaks and go up and down the river.

555
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:22,305
Rym: hmm I mean you're not gonna get that.

556
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:22,666
Scott: I've seen.

557
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:26,228
Scott: I've seen kayak in the Hudson River like you can next to the intrepid.

558
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,158
Scott: there's like free there's like kayaking you can just do.

559
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:42,563
Rym: as far as I can tell there's an old thing that they set up where there are campgrounds that are accessible to kayaks and canoes and things all the way along the river from New York City like way up almost all the way to Albany mm-hmm.

560
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:50,997
Rym: so you're then there space such that if you have are a reasonably proficient goer you will get to one every day and be able to camp.

561
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,508
Scott: so you're gonna bike up the Hudson River.

562
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:58,927
Rym: well the Hudson River changes direction so just time it with the tides mm-hmm.

563
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:00,395
Scott: good luck with that.

564
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:01,462
Rym: yeah people do it all the time.

565
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,690
Rym: actually it's a really common hobby.

566
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,532
Scott: they're mad strong.

567
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:12,380
Scott: yeah biking that also no matter which direction the water is moving you're gonna touch Hudson River water.

568
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:16,499
Rym: yeah so I was really learned about that unrelatedly recently.

569
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:24,641
Scott: there are different standards for how dangerous water is based on whether or not yeah it's not the fucking Ganges alright it's not gonna kill you but you don't want to touch it anyway.

570
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:39,366
Rym: Hudson River water is in a category where you do not want to immerse your body in it but occasional contact like in kayaks and canoes totally fine like negligible danger of anything yeah but you'd still be better off not touching it.

571
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:39,929
Rym: I think you're.

572
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,308
Rym: there's more danger eating bacon on a regular basis than there is in that.

573
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:47,830
Rym: so I might take I might do the kayaking trip but don't you eat bacon on a regular basis?

574
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:54,475
Rym: I'm gonna mortise those dangers because I do.

575
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:03,086
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: Christian you can guess what bullies called me in high school cunts.

584
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:01,977
Rym: just my state.

585
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:02,459
Rym: e.com.

586
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,946
Rym: Sean Hayworth mechanical mind.

587
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:05,975
Rym: William Eisen rose Jeremy minor Spartacus.

588
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:06,718
Rym: Spartacus.

589
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,273
Rym: Spartacus Kimberly bachelor kachar Tava Shan.

590
00:39:10,654 --> 00:39:19,536
Rym: Jonathan shout out to dick Kunstman Romer Joshiro Joe star Tyler Eller Sean Yeager Clinton Walton Ren from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan pair and drew open lender.

591
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:24,404
Rym: Ray Lavelle Brian should said Roni Rochelle Montanota Finn Eric silver on can't melt steel beams.

592
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:26,775
Rym: kinetic man Aaron series Chris mid give Chris Knox.

593
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,885
Rym: I expected the Spanish Inquisition.

594
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:33,866
Rym: Sam Cordery Daniel Redmond Chris had Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

595
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:35,733
Rym: as you know we hit the goal.

596
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,210
Rym: I am literally remastering all those beta episodes of GeekNights.

597
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:52,255
Rym: it was actually somewhat difficult because they were recorded on incredibly bad hardware with incredibly bad processes a long long time ago but I remastered the first one.

598
00:39:52,275 --> 00:40:05,193
Rym: I am listening to it probably on my way to work tomorrow as a podcast and then I will be able to record some commentary on what it was like listening to us do literally the first GeekNights thing we ever tried to do.

599
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:19,133
Rym: some of its funny some of it is haltingly horrific to listen to but it is very interesting to hear what we sounded like because it wasn't most of the time it doesn't sound like I was having a natural conversation like we did in that era.

600
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:29,813
Rym: we actually sound more natural now even though that natural sounding conversation and banter we have is actually sort of an act and kind of synthetic.

601
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:40,283
Rym: so it's weird that when we were more natural on the show it ended up being halting and over time we sort of rediscovered the way to do what we would do in our normal lives but in a performance setting.

602
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:43,444
Rym: and you'll when you listen to the episode you'll see what I mean once.

603
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:46,843
Rym: I actually read some commentary and say it in front of a microphone.

604
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,435
Rym: but that's neither here nor there will be a PAX.

605
00:40:49,535 --> 00:41:01,412
Rym: East next week might not do a full set of shows next week because of that but I will release at least that first beta episode of GeekNights to all of you who are backing us on patreon very soon hopefully over the course of the weekend.

606
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,922
Rym: and now I leave you with something odd about.

607
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:15,437
Rym: so we got two new DS games just because then you're saying we it's like but it's like there's a third person here.

608
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,924
Rym: they're part of the conversation that I'm not addressing them directly but yeah but even all right.

609
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,806
Scott: even then if your selection of words whatever but there's no other way to bring that up.

610
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,599
Scott: it's not the tone of the way you're saying it.

611
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,451
Rym: I say that way anyway it doesn't sound right.

612
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:32,654
Scott: that's how I talk.

613
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:37,528
Scott: no it's a bleeding radio guy talking.

614
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:38,150
Rym: oh it's not.

615
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,679
Rym: I think you're hung up too much on this radio guy thing.

616
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:43,870
Scott: it just feels awkward.

617
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:45,757
Rym: that's the way I talk.

618
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:49,834
Scott: it feels awkward when to say something like that and it kind of throws it.

619
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,859
Rym: we're sitting here right now.

620
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:54,193
Rym: I'd be like so we got two new video games this week.

621
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,397
Rym: no you'd be like.

622
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:58,827
Scott: so I got the the Castlevania.

623
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:03,026
Rym: no I'd probably say like so we got trauma center in Castlevania.

624
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:03,609
Rym: there you go.

625
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,876
Rym: he got one I got the other one.

626
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,285
Rym: that way we don't have to buy a boat.

627
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,150
Scott: that's better.

628
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:14,193
Scott: the way you said that the only difference I didn't say we and the tone of the saying.

629
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:19,652
Rym: it was a little different because you're actually talking to me because I actively talk.

630
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:22,154
Rym: weird that's not the way I talk.

631
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:28,983
Rym: I think you're too hung up on this.

632
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:30,668
Scott: it's just.

633
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,093
Scott: it's just that like.

634
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:33,999
Scott: it's not really a hang up like.

635
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,267
Scott: I think it hurts the podcast.

636
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:39,799
Scott: it just makes it the the talking awkward.

637
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:41,787
Scott: they're like doesn't mean it does to me.

638
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,194
Rym: well you're not used to this.

639
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:55,282
Rym: I guess I'm really used to speaking in public because you'd like when you speak on a panel or something.

640
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,790
Rym: that's the kind of language you always have to use.

641
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:01,967
Rym: and yeah while you're speaking to each other.

642
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:04,800
Rym: not only this is like it's it's like a recording.

643
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,771
Rym: how it's a no because a recorded conversation in and of itself is kind of yeah but that's what all the big.

644
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:16,589
Scott: that's what the podcasting is about because you know people don't like the radio.

645
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:17,757
Rym: that's why they're listening to fun.

646
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:22,813
Rym: no they don't like the radio because there's nothing they want to hear on the radio and that's what the ads on the radio right but the.

647
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,858
Scott: that's one reason.

648
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:33,235
Scott: but the other thing is that if you notice the podcast that are stuck in the Brady like this still the normal radio format or don't listen to.

649
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:35,378
Rym: so I don't think we need to worry about that.
