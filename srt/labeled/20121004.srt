1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,466
Rym: It's Thursday, October 4th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,007
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:13,668
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:19,419
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight in the GeekNights Book Club, The Man Who Was Thursday by G.K.

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,060
Rym: Chesterton.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,782
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:27,309
Scott: Do you remember?

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:28,291
Scott: Mr.

9
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:28,672
Scott: Bubble.

10
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,094
Rym: Mr.

11
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:30,475
Rym: Bubble?

12
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:31,797
Rym: I remember Mr.

13
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:32,077
Rym: Bubble.

14
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:32,258
Rym: Mr.

15
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:32,919
Scott: Bubble's the shit.

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,620
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

17
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,746
Rym: So you want to have a bubble bath?

18
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,470
Scott: That's what you're saying.

19
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:41,160
Rym: I have not had a bubble bath since my age was single digits.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,041
Scott: Check it out.

21
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,043
Scott: They still make this shit.

22
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:43,925
Scott: Of course they do.

23
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:47,414
Scott: But the thing is I think now it's all non-toxic, ultra safe.

24
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,100
Scott: I don't know what it was in our day if it was a different formulation.

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,242
Rym: It's just soap.

26
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,206
Scott: No, it doesn't clean you.

27
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,692
Rym: It doesn't have to clean you to be soap.

28
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,800
Rym: There's no definition of soap that says cleans you.

29
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:01,626
Scott: But they actually do make Mr.

30
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,394
Scott: Bubble shampoo and body wash, brand stuff.

31
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:06,556
Rym: You only want the bubble bath.

32
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,931
Rym: I, as a kid, never understood the appeal of bubble baths.

33
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,878
Scott: When I was extremely small it was like, "Oh fuck yeah,

34
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,239
Scott: bubbles.".

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,300
Rym: See, I didn't care about the bubbles because I had this little thing that hung over the tub on the side and it was like this play school boathouse.

36
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,162
Scott: I had boats.

37
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:31,279
Rym: No, it was a boathouse that hung over the side of the tub and had a little landing for the boats to go into and little people could live in it.

38
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,244
Rym: So basically I'd hang out with that.

39
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,750
Rym: If it was bubble bath, then that ruins my fun.

40
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,820
Rym: Because now it's not like happy boat town, it's horrible foam town.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,857
Scott: My trains and boats, they were the kind that stuck to the wall of the tub.

42
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:46,800
Scott: Oh, mine floated.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,188
Scott: Oh, so I could play on the wall of the tub.

44
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,879
Scott: And then I also had a floaty boat and some other things.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,288
Rym: I also had the Lego cargo ship.

46
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,997
Scott: I had this book that you could read in the tub.

47
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,860
Scott: I had one of those.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,260
Scott: And it was about this penguin and you would take the penguin out of the book and insert him into the waterproof pages.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:13,118
Rym: The two things related to Lego in my life, three things that I wanted that actually were those kind of unattainable dreams of childhood were one, the monorail.

50
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:13,900
Rym: Of course.

51
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,742
Scott: No one has it.

52
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,490
Rym: I knew a kid who had it.

53
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:17,775
Scott: Kid's spoiled.

54
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:18,780
Rym: He wouldn't let me play with it.

55
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,523
Scott: He's rich.

56
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:20,448
Scott: He's spoiled.

57
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:21,855
Scott: And he probably went nowhere in life.

58
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,800
Scott: Probably hipster.

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,172
Rym: I wanted the space shuttle.

60
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:25,615
Rym: And you know what?

61
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,339
Rym: I got that one.

62
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:33,760
Rym: And three, I wanted the motor that went on the back of the cargo ship boat.

63
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:34,649
Scott: Yeah, we had the boat.

64
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,540
Scott: We did not have the motor.

65
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,629
Rym: I never saw that motor in person.

66
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,980
Scott: I didn't even see the motor in the Lego catalog.

67
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,479
Rym: I only knew it existed because the instruction book had instructions for connecting it to the boat.

68
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:49,838
Scott: I looked in that Lego catalog for that boat and I didn't fucking see it, but I mostly bought Castle Lego.

69
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,540
Scott: That's what I wanted.

70
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,200
Rym: I was mostly the Space Lego.

71
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:53,610
Scott: My brother got Space Lego.

72
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:54,660
Scott: I was all about Castle Lego.

73
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,340
Rym: In fact, when Ice Planet came out, you know what we used to do?

74
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,134
Scott: I had one Ice Planet.

75
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:58,800
Scott: He had the orange chainsaw.

76
00:02:59,381 --> 00:02:59,979
Rym: I had the base.

77
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,231
Scott: But yeah, no, the best is friggin' Castle.

78
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,280
Scott: I mean, how could you not want Kniggetts and Robin Hoods?

79
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:11,171
Scott: The Robin Hood forest men were even better than the Castle ones.

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,180
Scott: They'd be like, with their bow and arrows.

81
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,647
Rym: Yeah, the bow and arrow's okay.

82
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,600
Rym: That whip that every kid used to make a makeshift gallows.

83
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:24,280
Scott: I had so many whips and those little leafy green things and drawbridges and trees.

84
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,264
Rym: I didn't have any of the bridges.

85
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,052
Rym: I only had one Castle and it wasn't Lego.

86
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,000
Rym: It was like this knockoff Lego.

87
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,654
Scott: Yeah, the only thing I couldn't get, though, is I wanted the big fucking Castle.

88
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:33,316
Scott: I didn't get that.

89
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:33,597
Scott: The $100 Castle.

90
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,854
Scott: Nowadays, the $300 Castle.

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,264
Rym: Not a normal show.

92
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,790
Rym: Book club show.

93
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,397
Rym: You might have forgotten about the book club.

94
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,060
Rym: It's been a while.

95
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,506
Rym: It's also a pretty short book.

96
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,394
Rym: I have a feeling many of you didn't read it.

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:45,820
Rym: You should've.

98
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,758
Scott: So I have a funny story also.

99
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,637
Rym: If this story begins with, "So I didn't read the

100
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:51,859
Rym: book.".

101
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,026
Scott: No, I read the fucking book.

102
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,736
Scott: So on Reddit, some girl, and this is a New York City Reddit, right?

103
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,539
Rym: Some girl posted- Oh wait, so you're doing a thing of the day.

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,162
Scott: No.

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,055
Scott: Oh, okay.

106
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,927
Scott: She posted this story.

107
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,253
Scott: She's an Asian foreign student.

108
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,720
Scott: She's engaged to a lovely boyfriend who is white.

109
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:16,899
Scott: Her loving and protective Korean mother does not know any of this and she has been lying to her for over a year.

110
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,382
Scott: She basically made up this elaborate ruse to tell her family- Wait a minute.

111
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,460
Rym: So far, this is the plot of Summer Wars.

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,320
Scott: Right.

113
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,469
Scott: So she lives in New York.

114
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,638
Scott: She's engaged to this white dude.

115
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,120
Rym: Does she need a stand-in Asian dude to be a fake boyfriend?

116
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:42,473
Scott: She has been telling this elaborate ruse for a long time and she basically needs an apartment and people to keep this lie alive when people come to-.

117
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:48,900
Rym: So, you know, it'd be great.

118
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:57,674
Rym: If we got someone to respond to this and be all legit and set it all up and when the family arrives, don't reveal the truth.

119
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,140
Rym: Just make everything really weird.

120
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:08,060
Scott: She was offering $100 or more for help and various people replied on Reddit.

121
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,299
Scott: Her mom found it?

122
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,560
Scott: No, and then the Gothamist posted a story about her post, so it is spreading her ridiculous lie.

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,339
Rym: This might be right up there with Captain Buttshugger.

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,089
Scott: It's like, why would you even?

125
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,760
Rym: It's like, these are the kind of people- So Scott, remember, remember what ruined the plot of 99% of books and movies anyone could ever write from this point forward in time?

126
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,200
Rym: The existence of the cell phone and the internet.

127
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,440
Rym: These sorts of plots are perfectly viable in a world where there is no way for mom to find out that Reddit exists.

128
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:47,512
Scott: I doubt mom will find out, but this is still, why don't you just come clean?

129
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:48,033
Scott: What the fuck?

130
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,600
Scott: It's so much easier than maintaining this incredibly elaborate ruse.

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:02,240
Rym: Yes, Scott, it is so much easier if you are in fact someone like you or me, but for an average person, you would rather die than let that secret be revealed than deal with your mom dealing with that.

132
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,317
Rym: I'm not that way.

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,300
Scott: Yeah, then I don't want to have nothing to do with you.

134
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,139
Rym: No, see, here's what we do.

135
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,760
Scott: If you're a crazy person who will create drama, stay away from me.

136
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,248
Rym: We respond, get one of our Asian friends and do the whole thing like super legit.

137
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:22,960
Rym: And then when the mom shows up, the Asian friend is there, but he acts like he's not the actual boyfriend.

138
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:29,220
Scott: And we have like, I don't know- Oh, we just tell the truth for them because they can't do it themselves?

139
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:37,210
Rym: So we get like a black Russian dude to then act like he's the boyfriend and just make everything double weird.

140
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:44,700
Rym: So now the girl has two options, come clean herself or deal with this doubly ridiculous double trick.

141
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,072
Rym: That is what I would do if I were an enterprising young asshole.

142
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:53,300
Scott: Luckily for this person- I would have nothing to do with dramatic people.

143
00:06:54,201 --> 00:07:00,176
Scott: I just think it was really- I will laugh at them from afar across the Internet.

144
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,360
Scott: That is what I'm doing right now.

145
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,320
Rym: A younger Rym would engage in elaborate hoax, but I'm old enough now to merely plan the hoax and plant the seed.

146
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,800
Scott: Maybe her mom listened to GeekNights.

147
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,459
Rym: You know, we should try to track down the mom and interview her.

148
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,000
Scott: Well, I'm sure there will be at least one more post about this on the Internet.

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,421
Scott: Of course.

150
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,664
Rym: Fark has one of the-.

151
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:20,706
Rym: you know, this is very important.

152
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:27,260
Rym: Very few websites on the Internet do this and Fark does it and I feel like it's worth noting because it's related to this.

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,429
Rym: Fark has many tags like S9 or boobies or whatever the story is.

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,340
Rym: Florida, if it happens in Florida, there's one tag, follow up.

155
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,767
Rym: Follow up is the best tag on Fark.

156
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:46,340
Rym: That is when you find out what happened to crazy dude who got arrested for chugging wine up his butt.

157
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,290
Scott: But aren't half of those things going to be lame?

158
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,597
Scott: Like, oh, guy just went to jail.

159
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:50,280
Scott: They don't want long.

160
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,700
Rym: No, they only follow up if it's interesting or if people cared how it turned out.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,082
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

162
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,685
Rym: I think it's time for things of the day.

163
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:07,198
Rym: So I'm going to cue up that little music there and Mr.

164
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,339
Rym: Bubble or Mr.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,680
Rym: Bucket.

166
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,421
Scott: Mr.

167
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,082
Scott: Bucket sucks.

168
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,083
Scott: Fark Mr.

169
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:11,924
Scott: Bucket up the ass.

170
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:13,206
Scott: Mr.

171
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,068
Scott: Bubble versus Mr.

172
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:14,368
Scott: Bucket.

173
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:14,969
Scott: You know, Mr.

174
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,832
Scott: Bubble just walk in me like, boom, Mr.

175
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,393
Scott: Bucket's out.

176
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:17,913
Scott: Mr.

177
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:22,180
Scott: Bucket will be full of bubbles and then he'll choke to death on the bubbles and balls will come out of his mouth.

178
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,647
Rym: I wonder if people have seen that, actually.

179
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,099
Scott: His balls will come right out of his mouth and that's the end.

180
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,963
Rym: I'm going to do two things today.

181
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,385
Rym: I'm going to cheat here.

182
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:39,320
Rym: So if you haven't seen it, our good pseudo internet friend, and I talk to him occasionally via email, but we've never talked in person ever.

183
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,269
Rym: The angry video game nerd.

184
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,499
Scott: He doesn't know who we are.

185
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,580
Rym: Did a video that is a dramatic sort of ghost story.

186
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,362
Rym: It's a review.

187
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,606
Rym: Centered around Mr.

188
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:49,987
Rym: Bucket.

189
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,019
Rym: And it is actually one of the greatest pieces of cinema posted to the internet.

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,705
Scott: I'm pretty sure you've mentioned this in the show before.

191
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,652
Rym: But in case we haven't, I make it my thing of the day.

192
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:58,454
Scott: But my real thing of the day.

193
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,899
Scott: I think I've also told the story of how I got Mr.

194
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,120
Scott: Bucket.

195
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:01,663
Rym: Yes, you have.

196
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:02,164
Rym: I remember that.

197
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,589
Scott: Oh, speaking of Angry Video Game Nerd, you know what month it is.

198
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:05,952
Rym: Oh.

199
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:06,713
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,317
Rym: So I've already missed, what, four of them?

201
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,800
Scott: No, he's doing them every other day.

202
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,944
Rym: Ah, come on.

203
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:12,845
Scott: Thirty one.

204
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,550
Rym: It's all 80s themed.

205
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,473
Scott: They're all 80s themed all month.

206
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:21,160
Rym: Wait, so that means that means are we going to get Halloween three?

207
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,121
Scott: No.

208
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:29,820
Scott: Do you remember that movie we watched with Amber about like the ghost, the monster that came out of the TV with the satellite dish in the backyard?

209
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,835
Scott: Oh, oh, I don't know what it's called, but that one was in the trailer.

210
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,500
Scott: So he's going to do it some point during the month.

211
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,081
Rym: Oh, my God.

212
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,805
Rym: That movie is right up there with the stuff.

213
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,968
Rym: Anyway, that was an error.

214
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:43,369
Rym: We'd watch.

215
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,771
Rym: In fact, you were not there.

216
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,992
Scott: Do your real thing.

217
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:51,060
Rym: Of all the bad movies that Amber showed us, the worst is the one you were not there to see.

218
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,322
Scott: Do your thing of the day.

219
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:52,983
Scott: That's the real thing.

220
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:53,665
Rym: It is called.

221
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:54,647
Rym: I'm going to put this out here.

222
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,551
Rym: This movie is called Boxing Helena.

223
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,355
Rym: Good God.

224
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,780
Rym: So anyway, my real thing of the day.

225
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:02,902
Rym: Watch the movie.

226
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,288
Rym: carbonated apple slices.

227
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:07,930
Rym: This dude made a bunch of videos.

228
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,653
Scott: Basically, he's kind of like those.

229
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:10,495
Scott: How does that even work?

230
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,576
Rym: Table of videos.

231
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,760
Rym: guys who make like the awesome chemistry videos.

232
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:23,000
Rym: This guy has a whole bunch of carbon dioxide in various forms and a pressure vessel and just does stuff with carbon dioxide.

233
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:36,700
Scott: So I guess if you put an apple into a chamber that was sealed and the chamber was full of carbon dioxide and the pressure was high, the carbon dioxide would be forced into the apple where it would go into the apple juice and that is in the apple and fizz it up.

234
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,924
Scott: So now you have a sparkling apple.

235
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:40,647
Rym: So basically, this guy did a bunch of stuff.

236
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:44,816
Rym: Like, for example, he makes supercritical CO2 and just shows you how fucking awesome that is.

237
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,580
Rym: It's used in dry cleaning and stuff.

238
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,364
Rym: And anyway, this video, yes, he just carbonate some apple slices and then he eats them.

239
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:50,845
Rym: And you know what?

240
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,108
Rym: Apparently they are goddamn delicious.

241
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,310
Scott: Yeah, they probably just hurt.

242
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:56,852
Rym: Yeah, I forget.

243
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,814
Rym: You can't deal with carbonation.

244
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,156
Scott: It's one of those.

245
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,177
Scott: It is not a good thing.

246
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,198
Rym: I can't imagine.

247
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,680
Scott: It's also not good for you.

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,341
Rym: Cite that.

249
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,403
Rym: Cite a source on that.

250
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:07,524
Scott: I've read stuff.

251
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:12,411
Rym: Yeah, I think you read about how cold water hydrates you faster.

252
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,835
Rym: No, that is what you said.

253
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,958
Rym: I have chat logs, Captain Fuckwit.

254
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,500
Rym: I need to pull this out.

255
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,083
Scott: You're the one who is so insistent for many years.

256
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,405
Scott: You didn't even have anything.

257
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:26,351
Scott: But you were insistent that warm water hydrated you faster.

258
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,653
Scott: But you didn't even have one.

259
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:28,855
Rym: I had one link.

260
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:32,640
Scott: What I said, you did say that it is exactly what you said.

261
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,047
Rym: I said that I think warm water hydrates you better, but I don't know.

262
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,830
Scott: No, you are editing history.

263
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,193
Scott: That is a rebase.

264
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:44,420
Scott: If I check the GetReRef log, we can see what really happened.

265
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,562
Rym: Okay, anyway, what you think of the day, Captain?

266
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:47,143
Scott: Avoiding.

267
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:52,269
Scott: Okay, so this is another New York City person, right?

268
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,255
Scott: This girl does a website called TenderNuggets.com and she's got cute.

269
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,960
Scott: She basically writes blog posts and illustrates them with really cute, awesome illustrations.

270
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:08,369
Scott: So she went on this odyssey across New York, trying to get home late at night on the subway.

271
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,220
Scott: And if you're a New Yorker, you will a hundred times appreciate this entire story with all the pictures that go with it.

272
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,125
Scott: It is super, super true.

273
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,653
Rym: The weird thing, though, is if I had never lived in New York City, you wouldn't get it at all.

274
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:24,654
Rym: No, I would get it.

275
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,960
Rym: You can understand the odyssey, but you would not grok it.

276
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,712
Rym: Yeah, you and in fact, what's interesting is people who don't live in New York or have never lived in New York read this and go, Oh, my God, what a shitty place to live.

277
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:36,674
Rym: I read it.

278
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:40,540
Rym: And while I can relate, all I can think is I fucking love this city.

279
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,605
Scott: Yeah, it's like them feels.

280
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,988
Scott: I have all of them.

281
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:49,360
Rym: I have bonded more with this girl who made this comic than I have with the majority of human beings I've ever met.

282
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,163
Scott: And we don't even know who this person is.

283
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,971
Rym: That picture we just have a lot up against the window in the hobo car.

284
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,780
Scott: We just have so many shared experiences with this person that we do not know.

285
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,686
Rym: It's interesting how this is like the smell is not of this earth.

286
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,874
Rym: The city has so many more people and so many more things.

287
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:12,500
Rym: Yet I feel like I have more shared experiences here than I did in like Beacon.

288
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,021
Scott: Yeah.

289
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:14,102
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,945
Rym: So, yeah, I remember you're up.

291
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:17,507
Rym: I pushed you on this.

292
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,810
Rym: I was like, give me a citation on your water bullshit.

293
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:26,800
Rym: And you hemmed and hawed for seven minutes and then finally came back with one link on the Camelback.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,962
Scott: How many links did you have?

295
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,884
Rym: I didn't posit anything.

296
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:30,225
Rym: You.

297
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:31,327
Rym: Well, here we go.

298
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:39,960
Rym: And your link said cold water, psychologically speaking, and had no other evidence other than talking about placebos and psychosomatism.

299
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,141
Scott: Hold on.

300
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,603
Scott: Let me search here.

301
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,530
Rym: And at no point in this chat do I make any claim.

302
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,276
Rym: In fact, all I do is question your claims.

303
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,760
Rym: I have never typed in the history of the FRC.

304
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:16,760
Scott: You know, OK, so you are in this case lucky and that your claims were not made in a log chat, but were instead made in a verbal and oral fashion for these cannot be cited for the last five or six years.

305
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,749
Rym: I have never, ever typed the phrase type water types into type any email.

306
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,550
Scott: That is correct.

307
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,900
Scott: Chad, you have not typed, but you have over the course of many years since college orally stated.

308
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,766
Rym: It's got the body.

309
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:39,338
Scott: human body absorbs warm water faster than cold water.

310
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:39,780
Rym: Prove it.

311
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:41,902
Scott: I don't have to prove it.

312
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:46,789
Scott: It's just known to you for now on.

313
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:54,580
Scott: I'm not chatting with you online ever because apparently, you know, whatever is logged, you know, is what counts.

314
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,318
Scott: But even though you said something one hundred times and everybody knows it.

315
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,017
Rym: Room temperature, water is best.

316
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,282
Scott: Metafilter.

317
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:03,885
Scott: Yeah, that doesn't count.

318
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:06,351
Rym: posted by Campbell in Space on December 26.

319
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,440
Rym: So are you now this dude at nine thirty at night?

320
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,620
Scott: Are you saying Metafilter is a better source than the Camelback Web site, which you would presume the Camelback would hire water experts?

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,080
Rym: The Camelback Web site said only psychologically placebo effect.

322
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,404
Scott: It said the cold water is.

323
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,507
Scott: it said which absorbs.

324
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:31,340
Scott: it had a quiz and it said which temperature is absorbed faster and cold was the correct answer.

325
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,768
Scott: And the other answers were not correct.

326
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,554
Rym: So here's why you're.

327
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:37,480
Scott: my link is as good as your vote.

328
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,680
Rym: What you said seeing the Camelback thing again, it says and then this is a link is a copy paste from the link.

329
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,640
Rym: At which water temperature does your body hydrate most effectively?

330
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,469
Rym: Now, here's the efficiently.

331
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:50,618
Scott: you didn't even read it properly.

332
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:50,880
Rym: Yes.

333
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Rym: Here is the exact and full text of the response cold.

334
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,222
Rym: Yes.

335
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:03,880
Rym: Psychologically speaking, people perceive this to be true, making it true, making it true.

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,058
Rym: Therefore, it is amazing how our mind works, isn't it?

337
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:08,384
Scott: Yep.

338
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,460
Scott: So it because you perceive it is true, it becomes true.

339
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,202
Scott: It is true.

340
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:18,320
Rym: They are saying in that sentence that it is true, that alcohol is good for me.

341
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,209
Rym: Therefore, it is true.

342
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,139
Scott: Camelback says so.

343
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,227
Scott: With water absorption.

344
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:25,549
Rym: Yep.

345
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,100
Rym: So I've got my beer absorption going on here.

346
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,834
Scott: Camelback, I trust more than Metafilter guy.

347
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,940
Rym: I trust Sapper.

348
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,280
Scott: And when we actually looked up scientific studies, I found out the truth.

349
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,143
Scott: The truth is that it doesn't matter.

350
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:45,800
Scott: And you have still always said orally that you have insisted that warm water is better with no sources for years and years and years.

351
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,336
Rym: Now, while I disagree with that, I have said I'm pretty sure or I think.

352
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,260
Scott: No, you have not.

353
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:56,220
Scott: You are editing history because you have the luxury of it not being logged, which is what you do often.

354
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,263
Rym: The odds are.

355
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,996
Rym: So I'm just saying that how come in like six years?

356
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,080
Rym: I've never typed that?

357
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:07,980
Rym: You know, you think that I put that much effort into this ridiculous ruse, this facade?

358
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,584
Scott: No, you didn't put effort into it.

359
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:10,627
Scott: You just said a thing.

360
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:14,800
Scott: And then when you found out you were wrong and you just got lucky that there was no evidence of it.

361
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,529
Scott: So you just denied it and rewrote history.

362
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,440
Rym: So, Scott, even were that true?

363
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:23,020
Scott: You know, ever since I was one, I've always known calculus proved that I got.

364
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,244
Rym: I know you didn't in the end.

365
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:27,099
Rym: And the reason I can prove that is you failed calculus three twice.

366
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,147
Scott: I knew calculus one since I was zero.

367
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,050
Rym: Prove I didn't.

368
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,146
Scott: Otherwise, it's true.

369
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:34,711
Scott: No, no, no.

370
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,597
Scott: It's true.

371
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:35,920
Scott: Right.

372
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,904
Scott: You see how this goes.

373
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:40,340
Rym: I'm just pointing out that you have no proof.

374
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,103
Rym: I'm all.

375
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,560
Rym: I have a counter evidence and evidence that I'm not a genius.

376
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,747
Rym: Here's my evidence of character.

377
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,659
Scott: You know, evidence of character.

378
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,672
Scott: The biggest lying does this all the time.

379
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:52,396
Scott: Hundred times.

380
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,080
Scott: Everybody knows.

381
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,740
Rym: So what you have found in many of the times where you've accused me of lying is that upon review or upon discussion with other that you edited history.

382
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,826
Rym: It's not that I ever lie.

383
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,760
Rym: It's that I speak with an extreme precision.

384
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:12,160
Rym: And when I am vague on points, I am vague to a very precise point to leave ambiguity.

385
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,569
Scott: On this point, you were not vague.

386
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,800
Scott: You are merely saying what you said.

387
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,219
Scott: Now you are post hoc editing what you have said.

388
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Scott: If I could have a time machine, you know that the only way to prove otherwise without any doubt is to go with a time machine, which is not possible.

389
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:30,659
Scott: Therefore, you are taking full advantage of that fact, as you often do.

390
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,440
Scott: So I implore to make an argument that, you know, I implore all of our listeners.

391
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,310
Scott: I will just prove that you did not say what I say.

392
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,740
Scott: You said you can't because you don't have a time machine either.

393
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,925
Rym: Listeners, I implore you.

394
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,374
Rym: You know me.

395
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,079
Scott: You do know him.

396
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,691
Rym: You've heard me speak many times.

397
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:46,540
Scott: That's why you know that I'm right.

398
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,469
Scott: And I'm the person who does not lie ever.

399
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,540
Scott: And Rym is the person who lies often.

400
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,081
Scott: Do I not?

401
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:51,883
Scott: This is well known.

402
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:59,480
Rym: Do I not, by instinct, by second nature, qualify my statement such that no one can ever actually find specific fault with them?

403
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:07,700
Rym: Is it not a common thing for me to say things such as, "Well, I believe, I think, I posit, I've heard...".

404
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,039
Scott: In this case, you did not do that.

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,140
Rym: But yet, I've done that for almost every assertion I've ever made in my life, except this one.

406
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:15,704
Scott: Have you?

407
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,880
Scott: Do we have a time machine to prove that as well?

408
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,255
Rym: So listeners, think back upon previous GeekNights episodes.

409
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,700
Rym: Go find arguments we've had.

410
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,660
Scott: And go see who is the person who is always truth-telling and who is the person who is always lying.

411
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,457
Scott: Especially in the board game department, Mr.

412
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:30,880
Scott: Character.

413
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:31,798
Rym: Why?

414
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,860
Scott: Readily admitting to lying in the board game department and behaving that way and using the same strategies in everyday parlance.

415
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,162
Rym: Is it, in fact, not the opposite?

416
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:50,838
Rym: For is it not my shtick, if you will, if I may, in both small world and mafia to never lie ever?

417
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,479
Scott: It is not your shtick, no.

418
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,540
Rym: Have I ever lied in a game of mafia?

419
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:57,217
Rym: You have.

420
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:57,877
Rym: When?

421
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,819
Scott: Do we also need the time machine for this one?

422
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:02,444
Scott: You know what?

423
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,756
Scott: I've always lied in every game of mafia.

424
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,439
Scott: When?

425
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:09,200
Rym: You didn't play at PAX, so that was the last time we played.

426
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,462
Rym: Right?

427
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:09,945
Scott: When was it?

428
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:10,207
Scott: Right?

429
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:10,710
Scott: Okay.

430
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,120
Scott: Anyway.

431
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,340
Rym: So I'm glad we're clear.

432
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
Scott: Do we have any meta moments available?

433
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,522
Rym: That I'm right.

434
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:20,280
Rym: The GeekNights Book Club, the next book will be announced if Scott's picked this up.

435
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,378
Scott: It'll be announced right now.

436
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:21,957
Rym: Okay.

437
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,915
Scott: So I gotta tell the story of this book club.

438
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,420
Scott: It'll take a minute.

439
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,080
Scott: So I was reading the Penny Arcade print editions, which I highly recommend because they contain additional commentaries.

440
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:31,737
Scott: That they do.

441
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:32,859
Scott: And many other goodies.

442
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,840
Scott: You should buy them for cheap on Amazon.

443
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:42,120
Scott: And the introduction to one of the later volumes was written by a man named Patrick Rothfuss.

444
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,138
Scott: And I was like, who the hell is this guy?

445
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:47,200
Scott: And he basically talked all about how he was writing some fantasy novel.

446
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:48,420
Scott: And I'm like, oh, whatever.

447
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,860
Scott: Some guy wrote fantasy novels right in the forward for some Penny Arcade volume.

448
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:53,377
Scott: All right.

449
00:20:54,201 --> 00:21:00,280
Scott: And then I look into this guy and apparently he's the hot new fantasy guy on the block, relatively speaking.

450
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,777
Scott: That means, you know, a year or two.

451
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,337
Scott: Right.

452
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,094
Scott: As opposed to 10, 20 years.

453
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:08,720
Scott: And a lot of people are reading his book all over the place.

454
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,780
Scott: So I bought it, but I didn't read it yet.

455
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,360
Scott: It's just been sitting there on the shelf and my new policy for book club is pick the book that's on the shelf that I haven't read yet.

456
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,598
Scott: So I don't have to buy new books.

457
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:21,900
Scott: Therefore, the next.

458
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,820
Scott: And also, I heard some people commentate on this book saying that it ends in sort of an air place.

459
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,580
Scott: But the sequel, I believe, is now available.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,239
Scott: So if you were only going to do this first book.

461
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:37,860
Scott: But, you know, if you feel you're hanging at the end of it, you are no longer stuck waiting for a book to be published.

462
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:40,119
Scott: You can go buy another one or download another one.

463
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:42,810
Scott: So the book is.

464
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,400
Scott: I forget the exact title.

465
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:49,439
Scott: I think is it the name of the wind or in the name of the wind?

466
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,440
Rym: It is Children Who Chase Lost Wind Through Voices Deep Below.

467
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,960
Scott: Yeah, something along those lines.

468
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,720
Scott: It is the name of the wind.

469
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,300
Scott: King Killer Chronicles Day one by Patrick Rothfuss.

470
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,640
Scott: And it is eleven dollars and fifty six cents in paper version.

471
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:13,940
Scott: And the sequel is The Wise Man's Fear, which is King Killer Chronicles Day two.

472
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:16,219
Scott: I suppose it's about a guy who kills the king.

473
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,020
Scott: And in fact, the paperback of the second volume is cheaper than the paperback of the first one.

474
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:24,879
Rym: One, two, three syllabolism of that.

475
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,860
Rym: Just I find it ridiculously hilarious.

476
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,180
Rym: King Killer Chronicles.

477
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,601
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:36,720
Scott: So, yeah, the name of the wind, a book that I do not know if is good or bad, but I have it.

479
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,839
Scott: So I don't want to have my money wasted.

480
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:40,479
Scott: So that's going to be the booklet.

481
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:40,941
Scott: All right.

482
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:44,660
Rym: The next one after that will probably be The Great Gatsby because I want to read it before the movie happens.

483
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,580
Scott: Yeah, I'm definitely in favor of the class.

484
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,560
Scott: That's what I'm going to do when I run out of books on my bookshelf that are physical.

485
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,240
Scott: I almost want to make because I'm probably not going to buy too many more of those.

486
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Scott: I'm going to move over to the classics I haven't read.

487
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,980
Rym: The trouble is I every time I would rather do a work of nonfiction, but I know that none of you assholes will read it.

488
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,441
Rym: That's right.

489
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:12,499
Rym: But I almost for the sake of the fact that it's so important to gaming, I feel like I should almost make the book club book that Richard Garfield book anyway.

490
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:21,200
Scott: But yeah, I figured, you know, this time I also want to concentrate more on the fact that, you know, it is the book club, but it's the GeekNights' book club.

491
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,819
Scott: We should leans at least slightly more towards the fantasy sci fi.

492
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,808
Scott: Now why is the GeekNights' book club?

493
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,380
Rym: as in we are geeks, not nerds.

494
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:33,640
Rym: I am just as geeky about rock climbing and mountain biking as I am about video gaming.

495
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,920
Scott: I'm just saying I'm going to, you know, at least my the shelf of unread.

496
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,911
Rym: Besides, you want to go geeky?

497
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,540
Rym: All right, fine.

498
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Rym: That Byzantine bullshit I've been reading is going to be the next book club.

499
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,479
Rym: That's eight hundred pages of the driest history you've ever read.

500
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,500
Scott: If it's your pick, you can pick whatever you want.

501
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,079
Scott: Why don't you pick that Peter the Great book that no one will be able to get a copy of?

502
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,474
Rym: I've read almost that entire book.

503
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:56,200
Rym: You know what?

504
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,692
Rym: The wars between Sweden and Russia.

505
00:23:58,712 --> 00:23:59,779
Rym: Hilarious.

506
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,482
Scott: Not really.

507
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:06,500
Rym: They're hilarious from the perspective of if you treat those wars like advanced wars.

508
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,939
Scott: So we have to remember to actually update all the book club section on the website.

509
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:10,890
Rym: Yeah.

510
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:11,054
Rym: Yeah.

511
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,340
Rym: So, so the man who was Thursday.

512
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,534
Scott: So this is your selection.

513
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:17,615
Scott: Yup.

514
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,840
Scott: Explain why it was chosen and what you heard about it.

515
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,780
Rym: So I had chosen literally I was going to choose between the Great Gatsby because the movie's coming.

516
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,924
Rym: That looks actually really good.

517
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,680
Rym: And I've never read the Great Gatsby and the man who was Thursday.

518
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,245
Rym: And I don't recall.

519
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:35,500
Rym: I might have said when I announced it why I noticed the man who was Thursday.

520
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:37,900
Rym: But it was called to my attention by something.

521
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,040
Rym: And upon it being called my intention, I remembered in Deus Ex something that sounded similar.

522
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,639
Rym: And sure enough, this book is quoted in Deus Ex.

523
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,646
Rym: So there's a little bit of a nerdy tie.

524
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:57,679
Rym: And one of our listeners said something to the effect of, my dad says this is a great book and he's always tried to get me to read it.

525
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,379
Rym: And the dad, as I've met him, is pretty nerdy.

526
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,080
Rym: So all these things together, I decided, you know what?

527
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,300
Rym: Maybe I'll check this book out and make it the book club book.

528
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:14,110
Rym: And when I looked at what it was about, obviously spoilers if you get from this point forward, if you guys haven't read the book, but at the same time, it's fucking book club.

529
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,219
Scott: I mean, what the fuck, guys?

530
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:22,440
Rym: If you didn't read this book, it'd probably be okay to listen to this episode because it'll spoil everything.

531
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,845
Rym: But you know what?

532
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:27,660
Rym: This is not about to be spoiled because the premise is the only big spoiler.

533
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:29,343
Rym: And I read the premise.

534
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:35,580
Rym: The premise was, as you know, that you've got a bunch of anarchists out there trying to ruin the world.

535
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:36,739
Rym: And you've got a cop.

536
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,739
Scott: Well, if you believe that anarchy is ruining the world.

537
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,700
Scott: You might like an anarchist world.

538
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:40,880
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,702
Rym: And the book gets into that.

540
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:48,880
Rym: So you've got a cop and the cop infiltrates the anarchists and gets elected to the anarchist council because he's a better proponent of anarchism than the real anarchists.

541
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,807
Scott: How could anarchists have a council?

542
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:54,200
Scott: Isn't the very mere existence of a council contrary to anarchy?

543
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:55,738
Rym: So I realized.

544
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,479
Scott: And in fact, they bring that up in the book.

545
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,580
Rym: This book that it is, in fact, a comedy.

546
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:02,406
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,077
Scott: No kidding.

548
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:06,780
Rym: And that I actually really enjoyed it from that perspective.

549
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:08,839
Scott: But there were funny parts.

550
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:12,073
Rym: But yeah, now the funniest part in the entire book is Dr.

551
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,540
Rym: Bull is my favorite character.

552
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Rym: It's pretty good because he is the one whenever everything goes to shit.

553
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,576
Rym: He is always the one who was like, fuck it.

554
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,027
Rym: It's over.

555
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:21,899
Rym: I don't give a shit.

556
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,670
Rym: You guys suck.

557
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,119
Rym: It's done.

558
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:25,040
Rym: Or he'll laugh or do something funny.

559
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,879
Rym: And there's one scene that really stuck out in my mind.

560
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,220
Rym: Remember when they think that the anarchists are chasing them down to murder them because the entire world is broken.

561
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,439
Scott: And there's like two or three.

562
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,419
Scott: There's two or three chapters of chase scene.

563
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,119
Rym: Oh, my God.

564
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,319
Rym: There's the longest chase ever.

565
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:38,881
Scott: Right.

566
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:44,920
Rym: Well, no, I think the the the the chase after that with the hot air balloon is probably the best.

567
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:48,680
Scott: It is basically the same chase, as far as I'm concerned, with a slight intermission.

568
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,880
Rym: So the or an intermezzo, the fake anarchists are chasing them and they're trying to get away.

569
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,100
Rym: And then they finally are going to fight and whatever.

570
00:26:55,621 --> 00:27:00,080
Rym: And they run up and he hits the guy with that lantern and he pulls out the sword and all the bullshit.

571
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:00,423
Rym: Dr.

572
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:01,599
Rym: Bull's standing there with the sword.

573
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:03,498
Rym: And then the guy's like, I'm a cop.

574
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,148
Rym: And as soon as he says that, Dr.

575
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:10,380
Rym: Bull, there's it's just there's a part like there's a break.

576
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,540
Rym: And the next paragraph is one sentence.

577
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,986
Rym: And all it says is Dr.

578
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,819
Rym: Bull threw his sword into the sea.

579
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:21,740
Rym: And I just picture him being like, oh, fuck, throwing it like everything.

580
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:27,394
Rym: And that I actually laughed out loud at that scene because Dr.

581
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,079
Rym: Bull reacts to everything like that.

582
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,718
Rym: Just I picture him thinking is that for the love of God.

583
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,671
Scott: Do you remember which day the week he was?

584
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:35,920
Rym: I do not.

585
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,728
Scott: Not or neither.

586
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:37,720
Scott: I hardly remember.

587
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:42,397
Scott: I also don't really remember much of the days of the week, guys, other than Dr.

588
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:42,498
Rym: Bull.

589
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,985
Scott: Well, this Dr.

590
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,520
Scott: Bull is the first guy.

591
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,400
Rym: I remember more about the colonel, the French guy, Delacroix or whatever.

592
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,023
Scott: All right.

593
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,320
Scott: And that's the guy he duels with, right?

594
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,960
Scott: The French guy, because he has to go doesn't he go to France for the duel?

595
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,299
Rym: But he also has his two French friends who are helping him.

596
00:27:59,481 --> 00:27:59,989
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

597
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,780
Rym: And all that business.

598
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,840
Rym: Anyway, so, yeah, they're all cops.

599
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,604
Rym: Everyone's a cop.

600
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:07,239
Rym: Everyone in this whole thing's a cop, except Sunday, who I think is God.

601
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:10,560
Rym: So what do you think of this book?

602
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,100
Scott: I mean, on the one hand, right.

603
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,800
Scott: You know, the premise was actually, you know, considering how long ago this is written and considering that, you know, I was surprised.

604
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,300
Scott: I'm like, huh, I can't think of anything recent that sort of stole this really clever premise.

605
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,941
Rym: Yeah, I mean, this book is written in 1908.

606
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,060
Scott: Right, you would think, you know, something like this would have been stolen and redone a hundred times.

607
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:40,878
Scott: So the fact that it wasn't sort of made that, you know, that idea that, you know, this guy's undercover, but actually everyone else is also undercover and on his side, but they don't, no one knows it.

608
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,345
Scott: It's like, that's so clever.

609
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:44,780
Scott: How come nobody's reused that or stolen it?

610
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,360
Scott: And it's like, man, that, you know, just that fact alone sort of is what really makes the book kind of cool.

611
00:28:53,082 --> 00:29:05,180
Scott: But there was also, I kind of liked, you know, a lot of the, you know, symbolic things that were going on in the book, especially the sort of trippy stuff like towards the end, where they've all got the costumes on and the different days of the week.

612
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:07,156
Rym: So two interesting points.

613
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:07,440
Rym: One.

614
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Scott: Because I like trippy shit like that.

615
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:12,680
Rym: I did the sort of like middle school level literary analysis through.

616
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,160
Rym: I didn't really engage too deeply because I didn't care that much.

617
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:17,884
Rym: But obviously this is a book.

618
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:24,460
Rym: if like I could picture any like mid, like eighth grader being assigned this book and having to write papers on the symbolism within it.

619
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:42,780
Rym: But I literally completely did not in any way pick up on the seven days of creation Christian symbolism until the very end when they were like, when one of the characters, like, he's like this costume, how does this match Thursday?

620
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,603
Rym: This is stupid.

621
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:48,660
Rym: And the guy's like, uh, Thursday's when X and Y were created in the seven days.

622
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,612
Rym: The main characters like, oh, I also.

623
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,420
Scott: I also did not pick up on that.

624
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,860
Scott: I was thinking more during the whole book up until that point.

625
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,777
Scott: I was thinking along the lines of, well, it's Thor's day.

626
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,280
Scott: Right.

627
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,257
Scott: And the origins of the name, you know, the it since it didn't fit.

628
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:04,940
Scott: Right.

629
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,520
Scott: I was like, well, I was, you know, where the names of the days come from is the kind of thing I was trying to match.

630
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,718
Rym: Do you know where all the days come from?

631
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,720
Scott: I looked up some of them that I didn't know.

632
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,608
Rym: You know what Tuesday is?

633
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,960
Rym: I won a fucking quiz ball competition with that shit.

634
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,564
Scott: All right.

635
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,940
Scott: Well, what is it, quiz ball man?

636
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,008
Scott: Okay, so Thursday is Thor's day.

637
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,194
Rym: Tuesday is Tyr's day.

638
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:23,560
Rym: Tyr is a different Norse god.

639
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,331
Rym: So you know how I won this quiz ball?

640
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:27,679
Rym: This was a...

641
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:29,938
Scott: Tyr, you kind of mumbled it.

642
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,306
Rym: No, it wasn't the name.

643
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,052
Rym: three elements that begin with H thing.

644
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:34,693
Scott: Okay.

645
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,660
Rym: Helium, hydrogen and...

646
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:38,617
Scott: Helium.

647
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,840
Rym: So basically it was like, nor it was like Norse mythology.

648
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:46,604
Rym: It wasn't.

649
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,380
Rym: the topic was something like week, like days and months.

650
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:56,380
Rym: And it was like the, it was me alone against this other guy, like a one-on-one, like one guy from each team went up and did like these 20 questions.

651
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:57,582
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:02,780
Rym: So it was all like, they would name a month or a day or something.

653
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:06,339
Rym: And you have to buzz in and say what it like, what the etymological origin of that was.

654
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,329
Rym: And it was like Thursday, I was like Thor.

655
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:08,992
Rym: And that was like, yes.

656
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,460
Rym: And you know, I'm going through just fine.

657
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:11,566
Rym: This is Tuesday.

658
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,211
Rym: And I didn't know.

659
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,299
Rym: the other guy didn't know shit.

660
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:18,600
Rym: So I'm just sitting there and I'm like, ah, and I just figured I'd buzzing because I didn't matter as I buzzed in.

661
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:22,500
Rym: And I said, Tyr, because Tyr is Norse god.

662
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,619
Rym: Also, you know why I knew Tyr?

663
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,443
Scott: Begins with T?

664
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:28,860
Rym: No, Tyr is in Forgotten Realms.

665
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,344
Scott: I was going to say D&D.

666
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:36,940
Rym: He is one of the Norse gods who fled when that pantheon, like pantheon fell apart to live in Forgotten Realms gods.

667
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,319
Scott: That's T-Y-R-E-T.

668
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,110
Scott: No, just T-Y-R.

669
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:40,359
Scott: Oh, okay.

670
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:43,700
Rym: So I just said that and it was right.

671
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:44,335
Scott: Yeah.

672
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,430
Rym: And I, and everyone was like, how'd you know that?

673
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,200
Rym: And I was like, cause I'm a genius, of course.

674
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:48,878
Scott: Nerd, anyway.

675
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Scott: I know everything about Norse mythology.

676
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,621
Scott: Right.

677
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:56,400
Scott: And anyway, the Norse gods did not match up in any meaningful way with the different dudes and their, their personalities or anything.

678
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,178
Scott: So I was just like, oh.

679
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,839
Rym: But what, what's interesting is what this does.

680
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:09,280
Rym: It really illustrates that the place and time that a work is written can often be very fixed, not just in terms of understanding the story, but in terms of one's interpretation.

681
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,939
Rym: Anyone in 1908 reading this would have been very Bible-y.

682
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,040
Rym: Would have just, even if they weren't religious, they at least knew the Bible and would think about the Bible.

683
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,459
Scott: If you're a literate book reading person at that time.

684
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,699
Rym: So works from that era, you would just assume that seven days, all right, there's probably a Bible metaphor going on.

685
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,820
Rym: But note how in the book, none of the characters picked up on that.

686
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,899
Rym: And they were surprised when it was pointed out to them.

687
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:38,600
Rym: But it is referenced several times throughout the book that none of them know what's in the Bible.

688
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,740
Rym: None of them are religious.

689
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:40,198
Scott: Yep.

690
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:48,640
Rym: Even though Syme beats the guy over the head with that religious lantern and talks about how important that cross is.

691
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
Rym: But he's never actually read the Bible.

692
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,687
Scott: So, uh, what you read?

693
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,640
Scott: the free edition from the internet project Gutenberg.

694
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,004
Rym: Yep.

695
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:55,417
Rym: It was okay.

696
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:55,841
Scott: All right.

697
00:32:55,881 --> 00:33:01,900
Scott: Did that have a, an introduction that was written by, who is the introduction written by?

698
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,600
Rym: No, no introduction.

699
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,101
Scott: Okay.

700
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:06,680
Scott: Did that have footnotes in the back?

701
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,660
Scott: See, I bought, I purchased the Penguin Classics edition for a handful of reasons.

702
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,118
Scott: Reason number one, smells so good.

703
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,560
Scott: Reason number two, the cover is amazing.

704
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,080
Scott: And there's all these police just all over the place beating up on people in this pretty good art style.

705
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:32,660
Scott: And reason number three, which I didn't know until I got it is as this awesome appendix and footnotes and things like that, which were incredibly helpful because there's things that you wouldn't know.

706
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,362
Scott: Have basically there's no chance.

707
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:42,816
Scott: even a super educated, well-read person, unless you were kind of like a literary person, you know, with this kind of expertise, you would not know any of this shit.

708
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,120
Scott: that was, you know, only relevant at the time.

709
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,860
Scott: Um, and it, you know, it tells you like what certain words mean and things like that.

710
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,260
Scott: And it was super helpful while reading the book, but some of the things that they were trying to explain were just kind of weird.

711
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,705
Scott: Like, it's like, really?

712
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:01,371
Scott: It's like Strasburg pie.

713
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:02,033
Scott: It's a pie.

714
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:04,120
Scott: It's a pate made with fatty goose livers.

715
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:12,760
Scott: For example, it was reported the young man in the diplomatic service at Pumpernickel pick crawl used to bring home dispatches consisting of Strasburg pie to the foreign minister of the day.

716
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,739
Scott: And it's like, what?

717
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:21,060
Scott: What the fuck does that have to do with, you know, I'm sure they mentioned like Strasburg pie in some sentence somewhere.

718
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,080
Scott: And it's like, well, why is Strasburg pie, you know, relevant at all?

719
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Scott: But the one thing that was relevant was the thing about the the the a subs fable about the pig.

720
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,920
Rym: And here that was a good part because that tactic of debate was brought.

721
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,540
Rym: I took an argumentation class at RIT was literally argumentation and debate.

722
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:42,319
Rym: And we talked about that technique at length.

723
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,545
Scott: So let me let me find this.

724
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:48,280
Scott: I just want to find the relevant passage in the actual book that it was referencing.

725
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,928
Scott: Page sixty five.

726
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,320
Scott: Footnote number eight.

727
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,220
Scott: I should have done this before the show started.

728
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,799
Scott: But I didn't think of it until just now.

729
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:01,901
Rym: Come on.

730
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:02,403
Rym: All right.

731
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,625
Rym: So my other favorite Dr.

732
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:10,360
Rym: Bull moment is toward the very end when the one guy keeps being like they're all like talking about Sunday.

733
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,474
Rym: Like he's like a god like the world.

734
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:13,400
Rym: He's like pan.

735
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,847
Rym: And the one guy keeps being like, just like pan.

736
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,071
Rym: And finally, Dr.

737
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:20,000
Rym: Bull is like, you seem to think pan is everything.

738
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,541
Rym: Shut it.

739
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:23,268
Scott: All right.

740
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:24,110
Scott: So here here comes.

741
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,065
Scott: OK, so he's like, what's going on?

742
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,090
Scott: I don't have the context.

743
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,970
Scott: But basically the guy says, I see he sneered.

744
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,390
Scott: You prevail like the false pig in Aesop and you fail.

745
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,930
Scott: I answered, smiling like the hedgehog in Montaigne.

746
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,769
Scott: Need I say there is no hedgehog in Montaigne.

747
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,782
Scott: Or a claptrap comes off, he said.

748
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:43,849
Scott: So would your beard.

749
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:49,370
Scott: I had no intelligent answer to this, which is quite true and rather witty, but I laughed heartily.

750
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,310
Scott: Answered like the pantheist boots.

751
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,370
Scott: So in the footnotes, it says the false pig in Aesop.

752
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:07,530
Scott: Probably a nonsense formulation, though in his edition, Stephen Medcalf, I guess he made an edition of Aesop's Fables, identifies the phrase with the fable of the buffoon and the countryman, actually by Phaedrus.

753
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:23,770
Scott: But ascribed to him, ascribed by him to Aesop, a buffoon at a theater imitated a pig squeak so perfectly that the audience insisted he must have a pig hidden about his person, but applauded him definitely when he convinced them he had not.

754
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,790
Scott: A countryman claimed he could do better and made a pig, which he had beneath his smock squeak.

755
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:35,230
Scott: The audience unanimously declared that the buffoons imitation was much more true to life.

756
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:42,489
Scott: The countryman producing the pig says that shows what sort of judges you are.

757
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,219
Scott: In 1912, Chesterton provided the introduction to V.S.

758
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:49,830
Scott: Vernon Jones' translation of Aesop's Fables, illustrated by Arthur Rackham.

759
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,031
Scott: There, he insisted.

760
00:36:51,052 --> 00:37:01,030
Scott: in contrast to fairy tales, fables like those through which Aesop was famously was famous are premised on the idea that everything is itself and will in any case speak for itself.

761
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,880
Scott: The wolf will always be wolfish.

762
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,309
Scott: The fox will always be foxy.

763
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:09,730
Scott: According to this theory, the idea of a false pig is completely incompatible with Aesop, right?

764
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:17,446
Scott: So in Aesop's Fables, a fox would always be foxy, but in this fable, right, you know, things were not as they seem.

765
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,150
Scott: Therefore, it was not an Aesop's Fable.

766
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:39,376
Scott: I just thought, you know, that's the kind of crazy and interesting stuff that was going on here, and I don't remember the context of that weird passage, but when I- That's right!

767
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,430
Scott: Oh, that was actually one of my favorite parts.

768
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,127
Rym: Yeah, because the scholar's quoting, like, he's making real witticisms, and the guy's just like, "Well,

769
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:46,790
Rym: la-di-da!"

770
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,411
Rym: Exactly.

771
00:37:47,611 --> 00:38:02,810
Scott: One of the cops is, you know, impersonates this anarchist scholar, and he impersonates him so well that then what happens is the actual scholar is- gets sort of cast out because they think he's the imposter.

772
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:13,050
Scott: So he is like the pig in this fable by Phaedrus, right, to where he's the real scholar, but everyone believes the imposter is the real deal because he's better than the- right?

773
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:27,730
Scott: So, and the fact that Chesterton wrote an introduction to a collection of Aesop's Fables, I think he knew also that it was the false pig of Phaedrus and not of Aesop, and wrote that on purpose, and shows you what's going on there.

774
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:31,410
Rym: Add some Hamlet level, uh, I'm crazy, check it out.

775
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,690
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

776
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:45,870
Rym: This book, if nothing, when I read it, I think the reason a lot of people think back to it is, one, the premise is great, even though the book itself, not that entertaining, really, except as a comedy, but it is eminently quotable.

777
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:59,670
Rym: Like, if you want something somewhat witty and a little bit lengthy with some references to quote that is relevant to a lot of modern society, the characters are just rife with them, and I think that's why it's quoted in a bunch of stuff.

778
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:01,715
Scott: Yeah.

779
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,843
Scott: Can you guys- do you see a page of quotes there?

780
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,670
Scott: Do you want to rattle them off of hilarity?

781
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,855
Rym: Well, this isn't really- this is just something a character said.

782
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:11,042
Rym: He said, "Your offer is far too idiotic to be

783
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:11,644
Rym: declined.".

784
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:14,150
Rym: I actually really like that one.

785
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:19,049
Scott: Yeah, that's the kind of thing that you can use in everyday speaking, if you could be that witty, you know?

786
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:27,050
Scott: But yeah, my biggest problem with this book is that just the pacing was so crazy, and- The action scenes are unparsable.

787
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:35,703
Scott: Yeah, it was- everything was moving so rapidly, and yet sometimes so slowly, it's like they would pretty much, like, teleport almost.

788
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:39,990
Scott: It's like, "Okay, they're talking in London, and they're in France having a

789
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,250
Scott: duel.".

790
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:49,050
Scott: And it's like, they didn't really just, you know, it's like, they didn't sort of ease into a train trip or anything like that, or the boat, it's just like, BAM!

791
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,990
Scott: And suddenly they're dueling in France, and you didn't even realize they're in France unless you're reading really, really carefully.

792
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:04,010
Scott: And then, especially those two chase scenes toward the end, it's pretty much like, whoosh, they're in a car, whoosh, they're somewhere, whoosh, there's a million people chasing them, where do they come from so quickly?

793
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:11,144
Rym: Yeah, like when the anarchists are chasing them, it's like, there's an army now, and again, those guys are stupid too, they're like, "Hey, there's a bunch of guys over there.

794
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,668
Rym: I guess the entire world has risen up in

795
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:14,210
Rym: anarchy.".

796
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:15,830
Scott: Yeah, it's like, what?

797
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,569
Rym: Let's go to the police station, they'll help us.

798
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:27,310
Scott: And it's like, by the time they're at the police station, the town's being overrun, and it's like, two paragraphs ago, you were just chilling at some dude's house, asking him for his car.

799
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:33,908
Rym: And the weird things that happened, like, when the one guy produces a lantern in the car, and they're like, "Where'd you get that

800
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:34,329
Rym: lantern?".

801
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,125
Rym: And he's like, "Oh, the guy just ripped it out of the ceiling for me, smashed two of his vases on the

802
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:39,425
Rym: way.".

803
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:40,128
Rym: And they're like,

804
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:40,429
Rym: "What?".

805
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:51,930
Scott: It's like, why didn't you show that when it happened, instead of, it feels like someone is writing this with ink and didn't have word processor, so they didn't want to go back and write in the smashing scene, so he put it in later.

806
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,690
Rym: They were a little cartoony, like the chase scene in Kung Fu Hustle.

807
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,389
Scott: I think even crazier and harder to follow.

808
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:07,970
Rym: Well, especially, there's a scene where the guy, early on, that's chasing him, the old man, but always appears right behind him, very Pinkie Pie style.

809
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:14,510
Rym: But there's also the scene when they're chasing Sunday, and he's like, throwing notes at them, and just sticking around with it.

810
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,027
Scott: Yeah, it's like, that's the kind of stuff that you see in a Babar cartoon, or Babar, right?

811
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,110
Scott: That just shit makes no sense.

812
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,860
Rym: But here's what I really want to say about this book.

813
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,730
Rym: I think it was enjoyable to read, but not super enjoyable.

814
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,374
Rym: But, I'm glad I read it.

815
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:36,270
Rym: More importantly, this is a story that really, really needs a loose interpretation.

816
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,970
Rym: Like, a movie or a comic that is not very, kind of like how Robocop the movie, was not very true to the original idea.

817
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,750
Rym: And yet it was better because of it.

818
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,090
Scott: There was something before Robocop the movie?

819
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,390
Rym: Well, the original conception for Robocop was very different from what Robocop became.

820
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,469
Scott: But it wasn't a book.

821
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,972
Rym: Fine, Total Recall.

822
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,540
Rym: Total Recall, the story is one thing.

823
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,110
Rym: The movie, the Arnold one, was actually way different.

824
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,054
Rym: But it, on its own, was really good.

825
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:15,530
Rym: This is that kind of story where, if you just take the events, and the core idea, and interpret it loosely, and do something cool with it, it would make a fantastic and hilarious comedy.

826
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:26,330
Scott: Yeah, I think the number one thing you have to do, right, is the whole first few chapters where, other than the first one, where he discovers that every single other person is a cop, slowly but surely, one at a time.

827
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:33,349
Scott: It's like, after the second or third one, when you go up to the fourth guy, you gotta be like, "Alright, we know you're a cop,

828
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:33,670
Scott: right?".

829
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:38,730
Scott: You know, it's like, you wouldn't even be, you'd just assume everyone else is one at that point, because it's too crazy.

830
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,830
Scott: The three are, the first three you came across were all cops, and you still assume the rest aren't.

831
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:44,310
Rym: But the characters!

832
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:44,913
Scott: All of them.

833
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:48,290
Scott: but the last one are cops, and you still assume the last one isn't.

834
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:54,950
Rym: Well, this is my trouble, Syme was brilliant most of the time, but he was stupid in this one regard.

835
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,207
Rym: He would just, he'd find, he's like, "Oh, I guess there were five cops out of

836
00:42:59,308 --> 00:42:59,629
Rym: seven.".

837
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,750
Scott: Right, it's like, no, no, no, after number three or four, it's like, I'm assuming the rest are cops, right, before I assume they're anarchists.

838
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:13,470
Scott: Because, if it's, even if it was three out of seven, what are the odds that you picked the first three out of seven?

839
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,490
Rym: Also, it's the game of Mafia.

840
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:16,710
Scott: Exactly.

841
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:18,172
Scott: Kind of.

842
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:22,850
Scott: You wanna make a Mafia game that is themed on Man Who Was Thursday?

843
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,910
Rym: It would be a Mafia-like, it would not be a Mafia game, it wouldn't be Mafia.

844
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,260
Scott: You draw a card, it says Sunday.

845
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:27,946
Scott: on it, you're like, "Fuck

846
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:28,188
Scott: yeah!".

847
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:30,308
Rym: I don't know how it would work.

848
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,848
Scott: Well, come up with it.

849
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,709
Rym: Well, no, I gotta come up with my 25 shitty games first.

850
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,010
Rym: The one I'm working on right now, it's Bumway Cars.

851
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,790
Rym: It's placing bums on platforms, and then into trains, and then you have your guys trying to avoid the bums.

852
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,231
Scott: Right.

853
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:53,270
Scott: But anyway, if you did this, if you interpreted this into a movie or something like that, you would have to somehow make it believable that they really, really believe that everyone else was an anarchist.

854
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,730
Rym: Or, you'd have to make it, you'd have to really play it up as a sort of farcical comedy.

855
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:58,168
Rym: Yeah.

856
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,686
Rym: Which could still be done, I mean, like I said, I laughed out loud several times at Dr.

857
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,910
Rym: Bull reacting to things.

858
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:15,230
Rym: Yes, there's also the whole bomb plot at the beginning, which is like- Yeah, the bomb plot was fine until they had the duel, and as readers, we knew the other guy was a cop.

859
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:20,589
Rym: And yet he, and like, I don't understand what his plan was.

860
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:28,030
Rym: If he was a cop and didn't want to set off the bomb, why was he trying desperately to win the duel to go set off the bomb?

861
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:28,511
Scott: Yep.

862
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:33,630
Scott: And meanwhile, while there's a whole bunch of the people coming out to chase them, why were they running away?

863
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,990
Scott: You know, it's like, that's the point where they got caught up with and the chases began right after the duel.

864
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:41,710
Scott: So, it's like, you could just let them catch.

865
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:52,350
Rym: Yeah, I gotta say though, I like Gregory, because he is- I think he's definitely the most- When Greg, that scene in the beginning when he loses the debate, he is the angriest a Gregory has ever been.

866
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:53,248
Scott: Ever been.

867
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:55,150
Rym: He is so angry.

868
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:02,770
Scott: That, I think that was actually probably, you know, that very beginning was like, you know, more well paced and well written than the rest of the book.

869
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,490
Scott: I think it's like, he had this huge idea, he had the perfect set up, and then the rest of it was much looser, but that- I don't think he knew where to go with it either.

870
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,429
Scott: Yeah, but those opening one or two chapters with the whole, the set up, were pretty great.

871
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,690
Scott: If the whole rest of it had been as good as that set up, it would have been awesome.

872
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:25,088
Rym: So, random aside, but I, every time Sunday was described, I could not help but picture the leader from 1Q84.

873
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,390
Scott: Oh, that's a good- Because they were both described the same way.

874
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,250
Scott: Sort of similar.

875
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:38,530
Rym: I imagine the leader from- Their bulk and their movement, specifically when they describe the way the leader moves, is the same as the way this guy moves.

876
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:44,067
Scott: But I imagined, the thing is, I imagined them also very similarly, and I actually did think about the leader from 1Q84, right?

877
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:54,610
Scott: But I imagine the leader in 1Q84 as being taller and thinner, whereas I imagined Sunday, because he was so, being more square, like the kingpin from Marvel comics.

878
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:56,489
Scott: True, but- Like a big square guy.

879
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:03,590
Scott: But in QT84- Which was kind of crazy for the chase scene, because he was running away, but he was immensely fat.

880
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,494
Rym: Oh, that happened all the time.

881
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:07,130
Rym: Look at the action scenes, made no sense.

882
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,090
Rym: There is no way a thrown piece of paper from a speeding cab lands in the other cab.

883
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,771
Scott: Right.

884
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:17,630
Scott: Well, maybe they were like horse cabs, but no, they specifically had gas-powered cars.

885
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:19,709
Rym: Well, later, they both at different times.

886
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,085
Rym: Right, yeah.

887
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:28,010
Rym: But in 1Q84, the way the leader is described as moving, the way he shakes out his shoulders, there is an identical scene in this book.

888
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:31,910
Rym: Where Sunday shakes out his shoulders and quivers like in this mask.

889
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:38,290
Scott: I actually, for a time, because you know, every single one, almost half those guys were like guys in disguise in costume and shit like that, right?

890
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,290
Rym: You thought he was in disguise too?

891
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,870
Scott: I was pretty sure Sunday was like Gregory in an inflatable suit or something.

892
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,186
Scott: Yeah.

893
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,909
Scott: You know, for a few pages there.

894
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,390
Rym: That would have been great, but I like the fact that Gregory was the only actual anarchist.

895
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:50,067
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:51,309
Rym: In the whole book.

897
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,570
Scott: Nobody, no one was anarchist.

898
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:55,890
Rym: So what was the book trying to say?

899
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,030
Scott: What was the book trying to say?

900
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:04,950
Rym: It made, much like other books we've read like this, it made many small points along the way, but doesn't have an overarching point.

901
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:21,010
Scott: Well, I think, you know, the one point, I think there are many points to take away, but the biggest one I took away was the thing they say, you know, of course, whatever you say near the end of the book, right, is most likely to be, you know, something that is really very important, or towards the beginning also.

902
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:28,109
Scott: So the one thing that I really took away was this one part here where it says, uh, pretty sure this is it.

903
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,636
Scott: Yes.

904
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,190
Scott: So I'm spraying to his feet, shaking from head to foot.

905
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,269
Scott: I see everything, everything that there is.

906
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,950
Scott: Why does each thing on earth war against each other thing?

907
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,570
Scott: Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself?

908
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,150
Scott: Why does a fly have to fight for the whole universe?

909
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,990
Scott: You know, why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe?

910
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,410
Rym: That could be a metaphor for the ridiculously of the anarchist position.

911
00:47:49,430 --> 00:48:08,990
Scott: Yes, but, you know, for the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful council of the days, alone on the councils, he councils a group, but he was alone, so that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist, glory and isolation of the anarchist, so that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good as a man, a man as the dynamiter.

912
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:09,810
Scott: There is something to be said.

913
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:17,290
Scott: So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of the blasphemer, so that by tears and torture, we may earn the right to say to this man, you lie.

914
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:23,030
Scott: No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser, we also have suffered.

915
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:31,310
Rym: That buys into this idea that the anarchist feels put upon and feels alone and has only one noble way to fight back.

916
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:33,990
Rym: But if they actually talk to each other.

917
00:48:34,851 --> 00:48:39,750
Scott: Well, I think a whole lot of this is more about, you know, that's why I emphasized isolation, right?

918
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:49,670
Scott: As you look at this book and it's about, you know, the difference, it shows you, you know, the hypocrisy of your anarchist, but you have a council or, you know, he's a cop.

919
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,147
Scott: He goes, he sneaks into this thing alone, right?

920
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,830
Scott: He thinks he's the only one who's undercover amongst the sea of anarchists.

921
00:48:55,971 --> 00:49:00,510
Scott: He feels as the anarchist feels put upon by, you know, the whole world.

922
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,690
Scott: It's him against this whole council of anarchists.

923
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:07,270
Scott: But then, you know, because he's not an anarchist, you know, he teams up.

924
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:07,530
Scott: Right.

925
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,819
Scott: And that is the difference between the anarchist and the not anarchist.

926
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:17,650
Scott: is that, you know, in a in a place with no rules, you know, and there's no governance and no law.

927
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:24,310
Scott: There can be no teaming up because you all you can't fully trust anyone with no sort of structure or anything.

928
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,810
Scott: But, you know, the good guys, the non anarchist.

929
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:27,313
Scott: Right.

930
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:29,589
Scott: They have the power to team.

931
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,372
Scott: Right.

932
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:32,138
Scott: It's not, you know, it doesn't.

933
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,550
Scott: it makes sense for them to have a council, to have a group to all to join up.

934
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,698
Scott: And as they, you know, it's the whole half the book, more than half the book.

935
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:43,290
Scott: is him going along, teaming up with these guys, getting the band together.

936
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:44,072
Scott: Right.

937
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:49,750
Scott: And then all chasing together in this team to get, you know, why was he fighting against, you know, to isolate himself.

938
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:53,648
Rym: And yet the very nature of his struggle drives him to team up.

939
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:58,290
Scott: Well, but but at the same time, he's the anarchist fights alone.

940
00:49:58,672 --> 00:49:58,954
Scott: Right.

941
00:49:58,974 --> 00:49:59,618
Rym: So here's the thing.

942
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,470
Rym: Look at all the other anarchists from Gregory.

943
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,215
Rym: They form this little council and everything.

944
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:07,129
Rym: And they were doing the same thing, but legit, at least trying to.

945
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,010
Scott: But but when they went to do their bombing, it was one guy would actually do the bombing, whereas police, they went.

946
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,670
Scott: You know, when it was time to do their thing, they all grouped up together in the chase.

947
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,410
Scott: It wasn't like one guy carrying the weight of everybody, the fatal flaw of anarchism.

948
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:28,999
Rym: Whenever you see like punk kids today talking about it, which is very common to libertarians or anything, they always sort of go down this road of.

949
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,950
Rym: we don't need these authorities to tell us what to do.

950
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,474
Rym: We can figure it out ourselves.

951
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:38,350
Rym: We can band together ourselves to provide these services consensually.

952
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,360
Scott: Which is which is all right.

953
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:47,470
Scott: So it's it's this, you know, conflict between the cooperation and individualism.

954
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:56,929
Rym: The true anarchist, the Gregory, who actually would go and put the bomb is the one person that debate who, once the government's gone, would actually prevent new government from coming up.

955
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:57,432
Rym: Yeah.

956
00:50:57,553 --> 00:51:00,430
Rym: And would bomb any government, even an anarchist government.

957
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,054
Scott: But even Gregory.

958
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:02,756
Scott: Right.

959
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:12,850
Scott: Even the Gregory, who would bomb and would prevent government from forming and doesn't want to cooperate, still wants to have friends to walk in the woods with and have witty debates with.

960
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:22,030
Scott: No, but that is and he's still and he still has the honor of not, you know, of sticking to the word that he said.

961
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,078
Scott: He is he is putting law upon himself.

962
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:26,809
Rym: Now, there are two ways to interpret that.

963
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,531
Rym: Mm hmm.

964
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:33,170
Rym: The police were all notably either a religious or straight up atheist.

965
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,415
Rym: None of them knew the Bible.

966
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:37,070
Rym: It was really outside of what they talk about, archangels and things.

967
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,295
Rym: But they it was made they were.

968
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:41,390
Scott: they were educated, you know, in true to atheist form.

969
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,538
Scott: They were very well educated in religion.

970
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,050
Rym: But it was made very clear that they did not know the Bible.

971
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,391
Rym: Yep.

972
00:51:47,893 --> 00:51:51,007
Rym: Yet they had this code of honor anyway.

973
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:51,710
Rym: He was.

974
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,562
Rym: Simon was not afraid of damnation keeping his word.

975
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:56,010
Rym: He kept his word because he keeps his word.

976
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,731
Scott: Exactly.

977
00:51:56,812 --> 00:52:03,749
Rym: Gregory may, you could argue, kept his word out of a fear of submission to this higher authority that he cannot strike at.

978
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,193
Scott: Mm hmm.

979
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:11,370
Scott: So that is you're saying he could believe in anarchy being OK because he also believed in God.

980
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:18,630
Scott: And so you don't need government because God keeps everything in line or because it was keeping him in line because he was religious or he was also an atheist.

981
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:26,490
Rym: But in his isolationism, believe that he looked like he still, for whatever reason, had to keep up this honor, had to be an honorable person.

982
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:35,690
Rym: Yet in the very end, in that scene, in the very end of the book, I point out he tells he basically calls them all cops, effectively breaking his word by revealing that to other cops.

983
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,314
Scott: Yep.

984
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,290
Rym: Sime never broke his word.

985
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,810
Scott: Nope.

986
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:48,310
Scott: There's also the whole thing where the end, you can't even tell how much of that is real and how much that might be Sime tripping on who knows what.

987
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,941
Scott: It's like really quick sentences that are like things went black and then he doesn't remember.

988
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:58,410
Rym: And, you know, it's like, well, it kind of gets to the point that look at Gregory.

989
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:10,250
Rym: If the end is to be believed, despite all of his feelings and being a true anarchist can engage in intelligent conversation and debate and in fact seems more fulfilled by that than by bombing.

990
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:19,510
Rym: So perhaps the true answer is to have all different kinds of people debate all different kinds of things in an intellectual place rather than a physical place.

991
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:24,929
Rym: Or it was just a thriller book with a bunch of allegory written 100 years ago.

992
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,109
Scott: Yeah, it's also definitely what it was.

993
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:31,509
Rym: I'm glad I read it, but I could understand why other people wouldn't enjoy it.

994
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:40,350
Rym: But if I was ever an English teacher, I bet your butt that if you were in eighth grade, you'd be reading this and writing me a five paragraph paper on the symbolism within.

995
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,140
Scott: I will say that, you know, the book had many good parts.

996
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,989
Scott: It had many flaws.

997
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,370
Scott: And if it was any longer, the flaws might have outweighed.

998
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:56,750
Scott: But it is the correct length for the contents that it is containing.

999
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:01,790
Scott: It is a box and all the contents of the box are fitting inside of it perfectly with no empty space.

1000
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:03,799
Scott: And also it is not overflowing.

1001
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:05,810
Scott: so you can close the box very neatly.

1002
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,891
Rym: All right.

1003
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:11,570
Rym: And I guess to wrap up the box metaphor, let's put a bow on it and stop because I'm kind of hungry.

1004
00:54:12,153 --> 00:54:12,665
Scott: Yeah, let's go.

1005
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,680
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1006
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,800
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1007
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:31,220
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1008
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,140
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1009
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,880
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1010

1011
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,700
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1012
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,820
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
