1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,238
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 22nd 2018.

2
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:12,220
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,386
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:19,030
Rym: We're talking about big fish casino.

5
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:21,137
Scott: You're the fish.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:22,889
Rym: it's bad news.

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,627
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:35,046
Rym: So one thing about New York, I love living in the city But if you got a broken toe It's kind of a pain in the ass cuz you do have to walk pretty much everywhere.

9
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:35,770
Scott: you broke your toe.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,114
Rym: I broke my toe like two weeks ago.

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,458
Scott: I'm doing what skiing?

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,246
Rym: Uh, yes skiing.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,696
Rym: I tripped over the rapids cage in the middle of the night, uh-huh, pretty bad and The fit.

14
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:51,228
Rym: but I learned something interesting about broken toes.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,005
Rym: So normally cuz I mean I've broken my toe a bunch of times before.

16
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:55,970
Rym: that's just the thing that happens.

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,755
Rym: I don't know isn't?

18
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:57,861
Scott: I got thousand pieces.

19
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,350
Rym: I've broken a bunch of my toes over there.

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,400
Scott: I have broken no toes and I'm used to it.

21
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:07,113
Rym: and it's one of those things like what do you do when you break your Toe, how do you even know it's broken and I just hurt You.

22
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,182
Rym: the way I'll describe you would know if you broke your toe.

23
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:09,845
Rym: Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:11,090
Scott: Well, I haven't broken it.

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,502
Rym: Then you definitely have not broken your toe.

26
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:27,653
Rym: Okay, it's just a hairline fracture but my whole life broken toe unless like the bone is sticking out then you just set it and buddy tape it like tape it to the toe next to it and just suck it up and wait and it'll heal itself and My whole life.

27
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,230
Rym: I always just assume that's what you do unless like something serious happens.

28
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:34,648
Rym: so this time, you know broke my toe and it was obvious like I broke it.

29
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:43,050
Rym: and Because I've got insurance I Decided well, maybe I'll go to the doctor because there's just like a clinic I can go to in the basement of my office building.

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,616
Rym: It's like a full-on doctor in there.

31
00:01:44,636 --> 00:02:25,190
Rym: So I just went down there and got it checked out and I learned That the advice that you should just tape it up Really only exists in America because our health care system is so shitty that most people can't afford to treat a broken toe the right Mm-hmm, so apparently you should always get it x-rayed even if it's just like a minor broken toe because there is no way to tell just by observing that your toe is broken if it's a hairline fracture that will heal on its own or a hairline fracture that Touches the joint in a way that if you just tape it up You'll probably get arthritis and have problems with that toe 20 years down the road.

32
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,838
Scott: Maybe that's why your toe keeps breaking.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,470
Rym: Uh, no, that is not why my toe keeps breaking.

34
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,298
Rym: adults break their toes Shockingly often in the United States.

35
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:35,650
Scott: Oh, I will live the rest of my life with no broken toe.

36
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:36,334
Scott: I would actually.

37
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:39,170
Rym: I will bet you money that you will break your toe at some point before you die.

38
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,357
Scott: No, I might actually bet on that.

39
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,342
Rym: You want to bet on that?

40
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:43,447
Scott: I am so not.

41
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:48,738
Rym: I'll bet you a hundred bucks Right now that you will break your.

42
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,530
Rym: break a toe at least once in the next ten years.

43
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:52,648
Scott: I gotta research the odds.

44
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,028
Rym: How's it pretty good?

45
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,029
Rym: Because like I said people just tape them up or don't worry about it.

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:06,050
Rym: But yeah The only way to know if your toe is broken in the way That could cause you pretty serious problems way later in life is with an x-ray.

47
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:18,250
Rym: there's no way to tell otherwise, but because most people in America don't have good insurance or Otherwise can't easily get an x-ray The next best advice is to just tape it up and suck it up because it's probably fine.

48
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:26,230
Rym: But because I'm a runner and I actually really care about being able to run into my old age I got an x-ray and had it legit checked out and it was the good kind of broken toe.

49
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,361
Rym: So I just taped it up and did the thing.

50
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:31,796
Rym: but even the doctor was like, yeah You should get it x-rayed because there's no way to know.

51
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,564
Scott: Yes, you should give me money and patronize my doctor business.

52
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:38,400
Rym: They uh, ah They're like a clinic in the building.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,450
Rym: Like I don't I don't actually give them any money.

54
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,744
Rym: It cost me zero money to have to get this x-ray.

55
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,070
Scott: Yes, it cost you zero money.

56
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,800
Scott: But if you go there someone else gives them money.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,650
Scott: if you don't go there, they would have gotten less money from someone else.

58
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:55,770
Scott: Oh, yeah true It also cost them not a lot of money to spend a few minutes talking to you.

59
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:12,350
Rym: but the moral is I think there are a lot of Low-key medical issues in the United States specifically where you should go to the doctor But beyond if you don't have good insurance, you're actually better off not going to the doctor, but there's a small like negative lottery.

60
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:19,385
Scott: I mean I think it's funny is even if you have insurance is just going to the doctor is a slight pain Compared to say going to the store true.

61
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:23,838
Scott: So In other places, right?

62
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,430
Scott: It's not necessarily the fact you have to pay for it.

63
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,423
Scott: It's simply that it's just easy to go there.

64
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:30,548
Scott: You know, there's less dude.

65
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,465
Scott: I have bureaucratic hassle Involved in going there.

66
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:39,390
Rym: I've always Be painted because of the way insurance works.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,565
Rym: It's always a pain in the ass to go to the doctor for anything other than a physical.

68
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:45,626
Scott: you think they want it To be less of a pain in the ass.

69
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:46,170
Scott: even you know.

70
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:51,870
Scott: You think the for-profit insurance companies would want it to be less of a pain in the ass so that you?

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,895
Scott: Oh, I guess no.

72
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:53,764
Scott: then they would have to pay out.

73
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:57,050
Scott: Yeah The doctors would want to be less of a pain in the head.

74
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,452
Scott: The moral

75
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:07,464
Rym: is if you break your toe and you have good insurance Even if you know like I knew that you can just trade it yourself You should probably just go get an x-ray because there's a small chance

76
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:10,520
Scott: if there's anything wrong with your body You should go see a doctor.

77
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,009
Scott: Yeah a real doctor.

78
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,365
Scott: Yeah Not dr.

79
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:14,548
Scott: Nick.

80
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:18,126
Rym: Well, I remember when I cut the tip of my finger off and I tried to go see a doctor.

81
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,057
Rym: then I gave up and went Home and just super glued his shot as a different problem.

82
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:28,010
Rym: Yeah, but uh, so I got this broken fucking toe And it's a giant pain in the ass to walk around New York City on this thing.

83
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:34,103
Rym: So I've actually been wearing my bike shoes Because the bike shoes have a steel plate in the bottom.

84
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:38,698
Rym: They don't bend so they're actually Great for dealing with a broken toe.

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,281
Scott: Hmm.

86
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,787
Rym: So I'm just doing the right thing.

87
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,047
Scott: is your Go to like get a boot?

88
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,637
Rym: Yeah, this serves the same purpose as the boot.

89
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,306
Rym: In fact, it does the exact same thing as the boot.

90
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,169
Rym: It seems squishier.

91
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:54,569
Rym: No, the part the thing about the boot is that it doesn't let the bottom of the foot flex.

92
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,355
Rym: You don't want that toe to fight.

93
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,601
Scott: It's squishy on the top.

94
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,450
Rym: Yeah, my bike shoes are really comfortable.

95
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,019
Rym: They're squishy on the top.

96
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:02,229
Rym: They're hard on the bottom.

97
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:09,060
Rym: But anyway in some gaming news The thing that I predicted open the envelope.

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,717
Rym: Lisa the thing that I've been talking about a lot Very not a very difficult prediction.

99
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,523
Rym: Yeah, but seems like a lot of hockey.

100
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,630
Scott: It's not like you're fucking Nostradamus up here.

101
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,316
Rym: yeah, I was pretty confident.

102
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:25,600
Rym: the Vegas Goldenizer do very well and it has come to pass the The new expansion team.

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:34,310
Rym: There's a new team in the NHL for hockey You don't know and that brand new team in their first year made it all the way to the Stanley Cup playoffs.

104
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:41,510
Rym: They are going to play a series of between four and seven games and they might win the Stanley Cup.

105
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:46,803
Rym: that is For a lot of people really vexing and I find that really funny.

106
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,890
Rym: I really want them to win the Stanley Cup.

107
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,375
Scott: I don't understand why it's.

108
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:55,113
Scott: it's like why you know, the only thing embarrassing about it is Nothing.

109
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,539
Scott: It's like I don't have a problem with.

110
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,210
Scott: it's like why they're a team just like every other team.

111
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,173
Scott: They're valid just like.

112
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:01,297
Scott: I don't see a problem.

113
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:01,518
Scott: Right?

114
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:07,276
Scott: The only problem is it's embarrassing for Existing teams especially

115
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,861
Rym: existing teams who have never won the cup

116
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:17,382
Scott: right teams that have like they've worked all these years Developing players and scouting and doing all this work and they're gonna

117
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,709
Rym: win a cup before the Buffalo Sabres win a cup,

118
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:20,170
Scott: right?

119
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:29,046
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, even if they don't win it It's already embarrassing because it's like even if you're just a team in your second year It's like you had another year to work on this.

120
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,230
Scott: Yeah No, it's like if I'm playing netrunner.

121
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:39,233
Scott: I played since the way beginning people who started playing way after me who didn't you know learn all those cards and they came out Better than me.

122
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:49,603
Rym: Yeah, like ah, but it seems like it's just a consequence of the the way the draft works Well also dated a modern take on forming a team and the team seems to be.

123
00:07:49,623 --> 00:08:05,547
Scott: there's also no there are no other teams expansion teams formed at the same time to exactly and also they made deals even before the thing started and Most of the rest of the NHL didn't seem to take them super seriously and was not worried about them being good.

124
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,396
Scott: No And there's a bunch of other stuff.

125
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,561
Scott: they didn't get any of the.

126
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,850
Scott: you know, everyone is able to protect players.

127
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,530
Scott: They didn't get any a players.

128
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,439
Scott: They just got all B players and but they got like if you play all Grande and you get second place in every cut in every province.

129
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:22,946
Rym: They made the team in NAS ice hockey.

130
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:27,178
Rym: That's all middle dudes Yep, and all middle dudes actually a really good team.

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,421
Scott: It's not bad.

132
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,969
Rym: They don't have to have like one worthless fat guy.

133
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:38,650
Rym: So, uh, yeah pretty excited about this, uh, I'm rooting for the caps in the just to make it.

134
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:42,618
Scott: No, I'm rooting for the Lightning because there's 15 Rangers, Florida Rangers.

135
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,635
Rym: Yes See, I'm ambivalent cuz.

136
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:49,610
Rym: on one hand I want those people even though they're on Tampa Bay to win.

137
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:58,313
Scott: But other than I don't like Tampa Bay What I have nothing against Tampa Bay and I want those people to win and I also want the conditional draft pick to become more Valuable.

138
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:06,500
Rym: I'm rooting for the caps just because they're losing the series But now that they pushed it to game seven, I don't care that much anymore In every series, I don't care about.

139
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:08,210
Rym: I root for whoever's currently losing.

140
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:09,914
Rym: That's all I want.

141
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,144
Rym: I just want everything due to a crazy game seven.

142
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:15,580
Rym: I Think I think Vegas is gonna win the Stanley Cup.

143
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,404
Rym: I would bet money on it.

144
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:17,590
Rym: You want to bet money?

145
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,058
Scott: Go you you can bet money.

146
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,408
Rym: No, you want to bet money against me right now?

147
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:22,819
Rym: No No, you want to bet cash for his lightning?

148
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,490
Rym: No, I'll put 20 bucks on the caps.

149
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,557
Scott: You can go to Vegas and do it.

150
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,306
Rym: I'll put a hundred bucks on Vegas right now.

151
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:30,130
Scott: go to Vegas.

152
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:30,773
Scott: You don't want to.

153
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:31,517
Rym: you don't want that 50.

154
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,830
Scott: No, I'm not talking about Vegas the teams on Vegas the place.

155
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,834
Scott: Go I know I'm talking.

156
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:35,598
Scott: go there and bet.

157
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,863
Rym: go talking you right now.

158
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,189
Scott: if you're so confident go do it.

159
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,029
Rym: I just want to bet against you.

160
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:40,973
Rym: I don't want to bet against.

161
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:41,575
Scott: you could do.

162
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:49,596
Scott: I'm sure you can do like some sort of fantasy not exactly directly betting on the result You know, yeah on draft kings or whatever,

163
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:56,749
Rym: but yeah, I just bring this up because Gaming nerds should pay attention to sports nerds because you're all fans of the same thing in the end.

164
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,157
Rym: So there's other big news and there's.

165
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,582
Rym: there's a lot of there's.

166
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:04,470
Rym: this is actually a much more complicated Story than we even have time.

167
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,879
Scott: There's a lot of details on here and I don't have time.

168
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,750
Scott: if you care about the details go read a hundred articles about them.

169
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,830
Rym: So there's two ways to look at this and I pulled two different articles to link to to give you two different perspectives.

170
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,422
Scott: Well, his is the gist right?

171
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,369
Scott: is that on steam?

172
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:24,268
Scott: There's a lot of games and there usually aren't a lot of games on steam that are just outright porn.

173
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:24,970
Scott: they don't allow that.

174
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,813
Scott: Yeah, you got it.

175
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,259
Scott: You got to sell your porn somewhere else.

176
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:27,981
Scott: It's not steam.

177
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,571
Scott: Yeah, which you know makes sense It's not.

178
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:33,221
Scott: you can't sell your porn at Barnes Noble.

179
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,810
Scott: You got to buy the porn at the porn shop, right?

180
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:45,877
Rym: But then again, you can buy a Danielle steel book at the Barnes & Noble sure, but you know, you can buy our Pornography Every definition of the word blockbuster.

181
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:53,058
Rym: video didn't have porn except apocalypse zero was just on the VHS rack next to like My Little Pony and a Disney movie.

182
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,470
Scott: Yes, but to get actual porn you had to go to the back of video bar.

183
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,350
Rym: Not the front of video, but there was actual porn at the front of video bar.

184
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,140
Rym: It just wasn't obvious that it was porn.

185
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,849
Scott: and but at the back there was real.

186
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,438
Scott: Yeah, straight up for anyway.

187
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,802
Scott: on steam.

188
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:09,307
Scott: There are a lot of games.

189
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:17,238
Scott: most of them Happen to be visual novels in a what is Stereotypically called anime style, right?

190
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:25,000
Scott: Yeah or of Japanese origin that do not necessarily Containment or may contain pornographic material.

191
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:34,590
Scott: but you know, it's a varying degrees of pornographic, you know Yeah content, but right what constitutes pornographic content for valve and steam?

192
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:42,925
Rym: What constitutes it in the United States is I don't want to see it But especially with valve and steam they don't actually have clear policies on this stuff.

193
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:43,106
Rym: how?

194
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,410
Scott: because you can't make it clear policy?

195
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,130
Scott: That's what the policy of the United States is.

196
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:47,173
Scott: You know when you see.

197
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:53,573
Rym: but the trouble is a lot of the things that are being classified as pornographic Aren't?

198
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:55,849
Rym: they just involve LGBT themes?

199
00:11:56,777 --> 00:12:04,477
Scott: also They contain the exact same kind of content that you would see in say Grand Theft Auto which is on steam.

200
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:08,330
Scott: Yeah, or there's a wolfenstein game where there's like a set of straight-up sex scene.

201
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,032
Scott: It's on steam.

202
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:16,369
Scott: Yeah, right, but because it happens to be in a anime style and some visual novel It's viewed differently because like oh, it's a hentai.

203
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:23,610
Scott: But this is just like, you know a sex scene in our rated movies seen differently than you know A sex scene in an anime because then it suddenly becomes a hint.

204
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:30,237
Rym: there is yet another angle here in terms of what they've actually been cracking down on and how a Lot of this might just end up being.

205
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:37,843
Scott: and in some of the cases they like for some of the games They're like, oops We said that you know, we didn't think hard enough about who we sent those messages to.

206
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:40,170
Scott: we're not gonna actually take you off steam.

207
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,610
Rym: Yeah, right, but there is a problem.

208
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:50,138
Rym: there's a situation basically where Some people are taking Japanese crap.

209
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:51,101
Rym: Oh visual novels.

210
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,370
Rym: or just making the good ones or making their jet.

211
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,670
Rym: No I'm talking about the crap Oh ones okay, or they're making their own like super crap.

212
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:04,110
Rym: Oh visual novels and they're just shoveling the shovelware into the steam marketplace as fast as they can.

213
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:12,822
Rym: We're talking like copy/paste the entire game script into Google Translate and just sticking it out there Maybe without even having the actual rights.

214
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:16,641
Scott: Well, didn't steam like change it So you can't just get your game on steam automatically.

215
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,410
Scott: You gotta be approved in the first place.

216
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:22,242
Rym: Yeah, and they got rid of greenlight because greenlight was both good and bad.

217
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:32,848
Rym: and there's there's a. there's a bunch of crap going On here, but these two articles one of them is titled valves move to censor visual novels undoes its steam direct promises And it's a pretty nuanced take on all this.

218
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:38,290
Rym: The more popular title line this is from motherboard is it's an anime titty holocaust.

219
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:40,970
Rym: Steam is cracking down on visual novels.

220
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:48,719
Scott: So I think what it comes down to is if you're someone who wants to play Visual novels that may or may not have porn in them You're gonna want to get them from somewhere else.

221
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:56,770
Rym: is not steam which you probably should anyway But also a lot of games that either aren't pornographic or really should not be banned from steam or being caught up in this.

222
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:10,985
Scott: Yes, there's definitely an unfair, you know Unconsistent application of policy as to what is an unclear policy as to what is and what is not allowed on steam Which is a problem when there's pretty much, you know, it's not they're not monopoly this.

223
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,350
Scott: you know that origins they.

224
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,372
Rym: Amazon doesn't have a monopoly on buying stuff online exactly But they are the.

225
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:26,199
Scott: they basically run PC gaming and choose what PC games are available and it's a problem that they don't just allow everything.

226
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:31,176
Scott: so You know, it's sort of like hey But it's like it's the given it's the.

227
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:38,304
Rym: there's the fine line because at the same time look at the difference between what's in the Apple Store versus what's in Google Play for Android?

228
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:39,328
Scott: Yeah a bunch of crap.

229
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,062
Rym: Yep So, how do you deal with the crap?

230
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:43,825
Rym: I like all these.

231
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:48,378
Scott: all these issues have culminated About what's the perfect right way to do.

232
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:52,151
Scott: handle everything is but I can tell you the way it's being handled right now is a Problem.

233
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:57,830
Rym: it is not good and it's especially considering valves undo influence over the platform.

234
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,761
Rym: But as a consumer, I only want to go to one store.

235
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:19,570
Scott: Yeah, and the main victim here is really Games and other software content that happens to have be perhaps x-rated But also isn't just you know worthless, you know low like porn that has no like You know other value to it, right?

236
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,490
Scott: There could be for example some really highbrow shit that happens to have lots of nakedness and explicit sex scenes in it.

237
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:30,663
Scott: Yeah That will get cut from steam and there's also a lot of and that's the real.

238
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:33,172
Scott: the real victim is stuff like that or a lot Of media.

239
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,998
Rym: that isn't even that explicit.

240
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:47,523
Rym: probably isn't even x-rated maybe not even r-rated but certain Shall we say shitty people will treat anything that involves LGBT themes as Partographic and that is being caught up in here too.

241
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,130
Rym: This really hurts Indies.

242
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:51,159
Rym: it also really hurts really bad.

243
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,916
Rym: companies really shouldn't be selling their games on Steam and It's just a giant mess.

244
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:57,141
Scott: and they got it.

245
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,370
Scott: They got to sort their shit out and say this is what's allowed.

246
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,390
Scott: This is what's not allowed.

247
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,895
Rym: I would argue on a higher level.

248
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:09,662
Rym: valve needs to short sorted shit out because valve increasingly is Not a very good company in my opinion.

249
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:13,577
Rym: like the steam controller failed They kind of stopped making games.

250
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,266
Scott: for the most all they make dota and they're making a dota card game.

251
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:21,125
Rym: Yeah What happened to half-life?

252
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,827
Scott: 3 Have a what?

253
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,496
Scott: Numbers go up to 3.

254
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:43,904
Scott: Yeah, what's half is 2 2 is as high as numbers go To The zombie game - yep numbers only go up to - doesn't know how to count the three To Games.

255
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,067
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

256
00:16:53,347 --> 00:17:02,176
Rym: so when I was a kid in middle school one of the events in the science Olympiad I was always into was the various paper airplane events, but I did it one time.

257
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:03,080
Scott: I was not good.

258
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,960
Rym: Yeah, I was good and I won medals.

259
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:13,020
Rym: But the reason for that was that I got this book that was like here are how to make professional quality paper airplane.

260
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,619
Scott: I got also such a book and I chose the coolest looking paper airplane and not the farthest flying.

261
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:21,349
Scott: But there was no award for coolest looking.

262
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:27,489
Scott: No, I minded mine basically went And then land on the ground, but the trouble was that.

263
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:33,955
Rym: but a lot that book made really good paper airplanes And I actually am very good at fault like making paper airplane.

264
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:34,939
Rym: That's a skill I have.

265
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:35,888
Scott: I mean, it's not it.

266
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,000
Scott: You can just look it up and do it.

267
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,571
Rym: Oh, no, but I like the craft of it like actually folding it myself.

268
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,160
Scott: I can very quickly be easier than like origami.

269
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,386
Scott: Yeah, anybody can do it if they give you just show.

270
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:54,919
Rym: well high-quality paper airplanes are very origami adjacent and actually kind of difficult to Execute because slight miss foldings have drastic consequences for them.

271
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:56,602
Rym: Let's see.

272
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,130
Rym: We're right one to account for next time.

273
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,774
Rym: We go to the park.

274
00:17:58,834 --> 00:17:59,940
Rym: Let's both make paper airplane.

275
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,844
Rym: We'll see who goes furthest.

276
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,089
Rym: You can't look online.

277
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,536
Rym: You have to make it right there.

278
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,520
Rym: You get one piece of paper.

279
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:08,386
Rym: No second chances paper clip Paper clip kind of baby.

280
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:08,867
Rym: Are you?

281
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,672
Rym: he's bigger paper only no tape.

282
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:11,334
Rym: No paper clip.

283
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:12,417
Scott: No paper.

284
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:12,939
Scott: Yeah.

285
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:13,460
Rym: No scissors.

286
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,629
Scott: What kind of paper can I?

287
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:15,335
Rym: uh one?

288
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,847
Rym: standard letter hundred pound eight and a left eight by an F by 11 Just one just one.

289
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,416
Scott: No second chances scissor.

290
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:27,203
Scott: No Ruler.

291
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,168
Rym: though, I'll let you have a ruler.

292
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,234
Scott: Oh, you need a ruler, huh?

293
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,420
Rym: I don't need a ruler.

294
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:32,007
Rym: I'm allowing you to use a ruler.

295
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:32,670
Scott: Are you gonna use it?

296
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:33,474
Rym: No, fuck now.

297
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,203
Rym: I know what I'm doing Mm-hmm.

298
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,115
Rym: I can make a very paper airplane right now.

299
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:37,899
Rym: They'll kick your ass.

300
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:41,980
Scott: But anyway, he's gonna look up how to make best paper airplane and copy that design.

301
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:49,419
Rym: So in the science Olympiad I made the paper airplane design that had the longest hang time because that was the competition that year.

302
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:52,602
Scott: It was I should have done but they didn't have internet in those Long.

303
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:55,496
Rym: is the paper airplane going to stay in the air before it touches the ground?

304
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,904
Rym: the number of seconds That's your score.

305
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:59,299
Rym: and I made an airplane that stayed near a real long time.

306
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,712
Rym: But this other fucking kid is also.

307
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,220
Scott: the throwing technique is the problem.

308
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:07,260
Rym: Oh, I knew I knew the throwing technique is the book told me and I practiced it.

309
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,085
Scott: I watched it.

310
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,400
Scott: I think we'd think of the day once was like farthest airplane.

311
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,870
Rym: Yeah, you kind of stand down.

312
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,340
Rym: you have this like particular launch.

313
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:16,794
Rym: So this other fucking kid and I threw mine.

314
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:17,778
Rym: it hung for a long time.

315
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:19,245
Rym: I felt really good I was gonna the gold medal.

316
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,130
Rym: he walks up.

317
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:34,233
Rym: He makes this weird-looking airplane And it wasn't in something from my book and he throws it into the air and it flies across the arena flips over Flies back the other way flips over flies back.

318
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,600
Rym: It was in the air for fucking ever.

319
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,088
Rym: And I was like, how'd you make that?

320
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,879
Rym: He was like, I'm not telling you you wouldn't talk to me.

321
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:48,200
Rym: This video tells you exactly how to make those kinds of paper airplanes.

322
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,067
Scott: Well, I guess that's the one the video that I'll copy.

323
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:56,906
Rym: this guy makes the world-record paper airplanes and goes into detail on how to Make paper airplanes.

324
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,980
Scott: I'll just copy exactly what he does in this video.

325
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,638
Rym: Yep, if you do what this guy does in the video and you execute it Well, you can make one hell of a paper airplane.

326
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:10,991
Rym: And it's interesting because I found videos like this for Pinewood derbies For boxcar all isn't?

327
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:15,048
Scott: Pinewood derbies want to get a real narrow Without people staying on above.

328
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:18,220
Rym: No, you want to have slightly off-center wheels only three wheels.

329
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:22,019
Scott: Oh You put the wheel in the middle in a hole.

330
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,938
Rym: Oh No I'll make my thing of the day.

331
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:31,860
Rym: So basically all the things that Scott and I and a lot of you are our age did as competitions where we were in school.

332
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:40,477
Rym: nowadays there is a YouTube video that will tell you how to make a thing in that competition that is world record quality.

333
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:50,380
Scott: and Does that mean if I go to a Pinewood Derby like the local elementary school that I'm gonna see all Identical cars except for the kid who doesn't and see the one kid who does not use the internet as a different car?

334
00:20:50,440 --> 00:21:01,438
Rym: So basically what you seem to be seeing because I was poking around to try to answer that question is There'll be like three or four kids who watch these YouTube videos and just make it and learn from professor you.

335
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:20,319
Rym: yes There'll be one kid the kid who actually wins their dad mom or dad watches YouTube and actually does the execution for them because they have adult knowledge of like Execution techniques coupled with YouTube and then every other kid just sucks Like doesn't know how to use YouTube and they just try to do it on their own.

336
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:25,380
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I feel like we should just like people keep talking about like funding for schools and stuff.

337
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,576
Scott: I feel like we can just get rid of all schools private and public and just have professor you only.

338
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:37,180
Rym: I think the problem is My based on this experience in any given sample size of like a hundred kids five or six will go to professor you.

339
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,110
Rym: One of them will go to professor you with their parents.

340
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,540
Rym: the rest of the kids will fuck around and fail on their own.

341
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,660
Scott: They're gonna fuck around and fail in real school - why should we spend money at school needs to teach them to go to professor?

342
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:56,860
Rym: And also the problem is if you just teach them to go to professor you Couple of those kids are gonna go to the Nazi professor you and make a Nazi airplane.

343
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,694
Scott: Yeah, you got a first thing you do when you go to professor you is a professor you.

344
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,160
Scott: how do I ask you questions?

345
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,702
Rym: So, you know what?

346
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:06,827
Rym: Here's the craziest side.

347
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:16,740
Rym: when the internet was relatively new when I was in sixth grade The Science Olympiad had an event that was literally how to fucking search for stuff on a search engine.

348
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:22,464
Scott: Yeah And garbage Alta Vista where all right, it was a real event and the girl There's also 404.

349
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,627
Rym: the competition was.

350
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:31,513
Rym: they gave you a list of like a hundred questions to answer and the only thing you could use Was a computer with access to the internet raising Carta.

351
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:44,180
Rym: No, you could use a CD-roms, nope, you had a computer with a web browser and unlimited internet access With the caveat that that's what the internet was when I was in sixth grade.

352
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:47,480
Scott: I mean, I could probably redo really well at that today or back in the day.

353
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,163
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

354
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:48,485
Scott: I entered.

355
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,670
Scott: that's like my number one skill.

356
00:22:50,012 --> 00:23:02,145
Rym: I uh, I won that event real fucking hard Because kids didn't know how to use Alta Vista and I was like hitting five search engines at the same time Using the and/or not.

357
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:10,364
Rym: minus porn minus xxx minus titties minus anime titty Holocaust Kids don't know.

358
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:10,906
Rym: in the old days.

359
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,779
Rym: The only way to find anything was to type minus a billion things.

360
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:15,715
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

361
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:28,146
Scott: Yeah, so sometimes in life There's a thing that like you sort of feel right but you since you're an intelligent person You don't just believe that you're feeling out the truth Like some people do like

362
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:30,536
Rym: Girl Scout cookies aren't as good as they were when I was a kid.

363
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,600
Rym: like no you when you were A kid you were just addicted to sugar and you didn't know better.

364
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,752
Scott: Sometimes there are things you just feel are true or you just sort of.

365
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,820
Scott: you know, but you you second-guess yourself.

366
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,368
Scott: You're like nah, it's just a feeling I have.

367
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:48,218
Scott: it's not real right and I've sort of felt that Like, you know recently it's like I go to the store and I buy saran wrap and it kind of sucks and I'm like.

368
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,880
Scott: and I Thought oh, maybe I'm just buying the shitty saran wrap.

369
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:01,478
Scott: I got to buy the better shit right out cuz like when I worked in food service For example, you get that big roll and it's just fucking awesome And you know it clings so nicely and it works great and then it kind of just stopped working.

370
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:01,980
Rym: so great.

371
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:06,045
Scott: But like all the saran wrap I bought at home You know like wouldn't work so well.

372
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,813
Scott: and it's like how often do I buy a new roll?

373
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:12,653
Scott: not that often because I don't use it so Much because it sucks and then I discovered like this press and seals.

374
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:14,440
Scott: I bought that instead and it works pretty well.

375
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,586
Rym: So I want to point out this video.

376
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,455
Rym: your thing today was uploaded on May 15th.

377
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:26,047
Rym: Like it's recent I think we both watched it at the same time because we both saw the thumbnail that was like is Saran wrap worse than it used to be right?

378
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:26,990
Scott: It's like apparently.

379
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,180
Scott: yes saran wrap is actually worse than it used to be.

380
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,165
Rym: It's even worse than that.

381
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:33,799
Rym: It's worser than you think it was right.

382
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:42,540
Scott: So apparently what happened without anyone knowing except for people who really know things and the SciShow YouTube channel Is that saran wrap did used to be fucking awesome.

383
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,906
Scott: It wasn't just me hallucinating.

384
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:44,850
Scott: who's they used to be?

385
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,457
Rym: we're talking like early 2000s, right?

386
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
Scott: Like it would cling really really well and keep things really really fresh.

387
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:54,014
Scott: And now it doesn't even if you buy the higher fancy brands.

388
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:58,032
Rym: and it's not just it doesn't cling Well, it literally doesn't even keep you food fresh anymore.

389
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,600
Rym: No, there's no point in using it.

390
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,246
Rym: It's worthless.

391
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:01,520
Scott: get the press and seal instead.

392
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,275
Scott: So apparently what happened was there were the press the the old saran wrap.

393
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:07,740
Scott: there was a chemical in it.

394
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,505
Scott: That was no good.

395
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:09,933
Scott: No, not no good.

396
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:10,980
Scott: Like it would poison your food.

397
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:14,060
Scott: Yeah, no good is in when you threw it away to hurt the environment.

398
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,304
Rym: So not even that it was.

399
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:24,660
Rym: if you threw it away in a context where it was burned or incinerated which is really common It released poison into the atmosphere, which is bad Yeah, so they stopped making that and they made it differently.

400
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,380
Scott: The problem is the one that they make differently now doesn't cling so well.

401
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,339
Scott: So it's like it's a pain in the ass to use it.

402
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:35,396
Scott: And also it is much more porous and your food doesn't stay as fresh.

403
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,580
Rym: We say much more porous.

404
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:37,788
Rym: I think I got it up here.

405
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:41,764
Rym: So old good Clint saran wrap.

406
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:46,620
Rym: the real deal would let one to five grams of water vapor out of your food a day.

407
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:48,774
Rym: So it keeps stuff real real good.

408
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:51,462
Rym: the Let's see.

409
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:52,385
Scott: Where's the new stuff?

410
00:25:52,726 --> 00:26:01,807
Rym: the new shit lets out an order of magnitude more water Mm-hmm, and it lets in Multiple orders of magnitude more oxygen.

411
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:02,749
Rym: That's the real problem.

412
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,822
Rym: old saran wrap let in two to sixteen cubic centimeters per day of Oxygen.

413
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:10,473
Rym: oxygen is the thing that generally makes your food start to go.

414
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,220
Scott: So it's like I stopped using saran wrap.

415
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:21,500
Scott: I use like these glass lock containers like Tupperwares Yep, and then I use the press and seal also if I have to right and I just stopped using saran wrap.

416
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,884
Scott: But now this proof that like.

417
00:26:22,924 --> 00:26:24,729
Scott: no I wasn't just like that.

418
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,660
Scott: that change in my behavior actually was because of a real thing that happened.

419
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,412
Rym: Yeah, we noticed like the oxygen thing two to six.

420
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:33,200
Scott: I wonder if I can buy the old.

421
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,849
Scott: Oh, it's banned saran wrap on eBay or something.

422
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,827
Scott: Even restaurants can't use it as far as I can tell saying like by, you know Yes, someone's still got a role.

423
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:43,600
Scott: yeah, cuz it's gonna throw it away anyway, it's gonna get thrown away anyway.

424
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,097
Scott: I'm not hurting the environment more if I just help use up all the old poison stuff.

425
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:48,061
Rym: That's a problem though Scott.

426
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:51,297
Rym: then you're gonna think anytime you wrap something is it sponge worthy?

427
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:51,840
Rym: That's right.

428
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,617
Rym: But two to sixteen is the oxygen for the old stuff.

429
00:26:56,637 --> 00:27:00,931
Rym: for the new stuff 8,000 it is literally worthless.

430
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,355
Rym: Just throw away your cling wrap.

431
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:03,779
Rym: It is worthless garbage.

432
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:04,422
Scott: now I think.

433
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:07,635
Scott: I think I do have one role that I don't use of the new crap.

434
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:10,284
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna throw it out In the meta moment.

435
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:14,800
Rym: the GeekNights book club book is home as the Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson.

436
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:16,309
Rym: I'm reading it.

437
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:17,156
Rym: You should read it.

438
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:17,560
Rym: It's awesome.

439
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:27,600
Rym: More importantly many of you know, we've been doing a side YouTube show There's been on hiatus for a while called GeekNights presents where on one hand only ever presented one thing.

440
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,828
Rym: Nope, GeekNights presents board games is the other one.

441
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,719
Rym: Okay, but I'm doing that one by mining old episodes of GeekNights.

442
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,739
Rym: That where we've reviewed things.

443
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:46,160
Rym: But there was a lot of reasons why we weren't making more episodes of GeekNights presents utenna Which is a show where we are going deep into the lit crate and analysis of a famous old anime called revolutionary girl utenna.

00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,100
Rym: It's no Olivet.

498
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,719
Rym: So, yeah be ready all of you out there.

499
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:58,134
Rym: So we're gonna talk about this big fucking fish casino game.

500
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,579
Scott: So here's the story here, right?

501
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,859
Scott: It's like why the fuck would these smart people even go near this thing?

502
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,380
Rym: So on it's on my cell phone cuz I had to play it and like really look at this thing.

503
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:10,660
Rym: I am deleting it like within minutes of us finishing this episode.

504
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:22,700
Scott: Yeah So I what happened was is I saw this article like a month ago like late March or something that this app big fish casino Had been declared illegal in Washington State by like a federal appeals court.

505
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:26,145
Scott: It's according to Washington State law Not any other state law.

506
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:30,280
Scott: cuz like there have been similar cases in other states and there's no federal law regarding this.

507
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,500
Scott: So like federal law doesn't apply and I don't understand why a federal court would look at this when it's a state deal.

508
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,211
Scott: But whatever it's not.

509
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:38,580
Scott: I don't care about the legal issue.

510
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:43,639
Scott: I care about the fact that wow, there was an app that was declared illegal now

511
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:49,260
Rym: Before we did a panel and a pax a long time ago talking about kappa gacha cuz Japan banded

512
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,339
Scott: Yeah, so I put a note like hey check this thing out of it at some point, right?

513
00:31:54,621 --> 00:32:09,599
Scott: So at basically like a week ago, I was just laying in bed you know just gonna go to bed and I was poking on my iPad like you do before you go to sleep and And I'm in the App Store and I'm going like look at you know Just see what new games are in there and I see big fish casino and I'm like, that's the illegal

514
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:09,680
Rym: one.

515
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,588
Scott: So I doubt it was free to download.

516
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:15,060
Scott: cuz I you know, it's obviously a free-to-play evil casino thing.

517
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:22,440
Rym: So I downloaded that shit and I've been checking it out and figuring out its deal And it got to the point where he messages me like you got to check the deal.

518
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,986
Scott: I like this for the past week.

519
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,415
Scott: I've been investigating this and this app.

520
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:27,860
Scott: I mean, there's other apps.

521
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,222
Scott: There's like.

522
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:29,550
Scott: there's another one that's a different.

523
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:34,730
Scott: I looked at a couple other casino Things and like this one is a different one.

524
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,960
Scott: That's I think I forgot exactly what it's called.

525
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:45,433
Scott: It's something else casino and it basically is the exact same slot machines you see in real American casinos only Digitized and you play for them with fake money.

526
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:46,739
Scott: you play them with fake money.

527
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:55,626
Scott: But big fish casino is of all of them the most devious most heinous free-to-play app I have ever seen there.

528
00:32:55,707 --> 00:33:00,704
Rym: literally this is a masterpiece of Pavlovian conditioning.

529
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:14,860
Scott: every single game mechanic that has ever been conceived by humanity to gets a rat-to-poke a Skinner box is all combined together in a giant salad in this one app.

530
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:27,619
Scott: Everything that casino that real-world casinos have developed and everything that free-to-play app makers have developed I mean Candy Crush compared to this is totally legit and totally moral in every way.

531
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,148
Rym: Yeah, loot boxes.

532
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:30,839
Rym: I don't even care about loot box.

533
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:35,220
Scott: Overwatch loot boxes hearthstone packs of cards.

534
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,351
Scott: They have literally nothing on talking heinous evil.

535
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:40,815
Scott: That is the big fish casino.

536
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:45,979
Rym: talking about a loot box It is the base like talking about one bullet in World War two.

537
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:51,073
Scott: Big fish casino is the ultimate bait and all of humanity is the fish.

538
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,296
Rym: I want to point something out.

539
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:53,760
Rym: You can't win money.

540
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:55,140
Rym: It's not real gambling.

541
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,300
Rym: I'm gonna read verbatim from their website.

542
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:05,635
Rym: big fish casino is intended for an adult audience and does not offer real money gambling or an Opportunity to win real money or prizes.

543
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:06,300
Scott: That is right.

544
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:11,815
Scott: It is in fact Just like Candy Crush and all the aforementioned things worse than real money gambling.

545
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:16,143
Scott: if I go to a real casino like the ones in Connecticut or Atlantic City

546
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,391
Rym: like we did we went and gambled in Atlantic City

547
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:31,618
Scott: to a real fucking casino and I go to a real slot Machine and I put my real cash in that slot machine There is a non-zero chance that real money will come out of that slot machine and I could.

548
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:32,400
Scott: actually I could.

549
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:34,353
Scott: The odds are not with me.

550
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:44,590
Scott: do not do this I don't recommend it but it is possible that you could leave the casino with more money than you went in with Scott and I Did this placing bets once we went to Atlantic City?

551
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,576
Rym: We were like red red red.

552
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:49,447
Rym: Well, we got some money Fuck this and we just left with the money immediately.

553
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,109
Scott: That's right.

554
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:53,525
Scott: It is possible an unlikely but possible I think we've had on black.

555
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:54,010
Rym: I don't remember.

556
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,520
Scott: with big fish casino You don't have to put any money in and we have not put even one penny.

557
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:04,320
Scott: No, you just get a bunch of fake money you get you gamble with fake chips and you win fake chips.

558
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:11,591
Scott: But you can if you so desire Give them real money in return for more fake chips.

559
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:17,246
Scott: And as soon as you do this, you will immediately lose Guaranteed 100% chance.

560
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,193
Scott: You will immediately lose all of that real money.

561
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:19,996
Scott: It's gone forever.

562
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:21,220
Rym: Remember you don't get it back.

563
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,969
Scott: You can't win real money, but you're.

564
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,191
Scott: that's like if you go to a slot machine in the casino You put in a dollar.

565
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,180
Scott: your dollar is gone.

566
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,083
Scott: You can't win it back.

567
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:30,712
Scott: Even if seven seven seven shows up on that slot machine.

568
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,820
Scott: No money comes out only fake money.

569
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,568
Rym: Now when we say no money, we're being late.

570
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:35,111
Rym: There is.

571
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,140
Rym: you cannot get anything.

572
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:39,045
Rym: No anything at all.

573
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,512
Rym: Nothing can ever come back to you.

574
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:44,620
Scott: All you get is they will flip bits for you in their database.

575
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:46,779
Scott: That's all they will do in exchange for real money.

576
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:52,840
Rym: So on one hand one could argue that how is this different from any other game?

577
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,532
Rym: You're just paying to play this game.

578
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,844
Rym: Sure Like it's you're not.

579
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,028
Scott: this is illegal.

580
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:02,260
Scott: How come you know, the loop boxes and frankly aren't illegal.

581
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:09,200
Rym: I think the only reason this is illegal is that it has casino games in it like status.

582
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:12,836
Scott: Yeah, it is obvious that the only reason that this is it was no

583
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:13,600
Rym: people don't know better

584
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:24,460
Scott: Looks like a casino, but if you actually read some of the comments from the the judges and such They actually point out how the they it's not because it looks like a casino.

585
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,134
Scott: It's because they say that the chips you're winning have some sort of value.

586
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:34,051
Scott: if you run out of the fake chips You can't play the games in the big fish casino.

587
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:42,460
Scott: unless you just make a new account you get another hundred thousand free chips Yes, but they're like, hey if you run out of the chips, you can't play the games in the big fish casino anymore.

588
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:44,046
Scott: Therefore they have value.

589
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:44,788
Scott: Therefore.

590
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,491
Scott: It's gambling.

591
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:47,879
Scott: You're gambling the ability to play the games more.

592
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:50,206
Scott: I'm playing the while you're playing the game.

593
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:51,691
Rym: No, this is not unprecedented.

594
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:54,220
Rym: this I cuz salty bet which I think is great.

595
00:36:54,982 --> 00:37:00,020
Rym: You can buy more fake money to bet and a lot of people do buy fake money to bet in salty bad salty bet.

596
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:01,265
Rym: I actually feel for it.

597
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,816
Scott: Yeah, but way back in the day I paid for it one time.

598
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,557
Rym: I went in there though It's still rockin.

599
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:14,306
Rym: I logged in for like two seconds and immediately there was this floating Goku and someone's like fake Goku and someone else is like that Is the realest Goku I have ever seen.

600
00:37:14,326 --> 00:37:16,153
Scott: and then someone said never bet DBZ.

601
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:17,979
Rym: Yeah, never bet DBZ.

602
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,807
Rym: always What a what a what a what a Perfect community.

603
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,334
Scott: salty bad salty bet still great.

604
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:34,352
Rym: Anyway, but anyway One could also argue that this game I say it didn't have the spend more money to get chips thing.

605
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:40,440
Rym: It is no different than For example, there's no game on the Game Boy the original Game Boy.

606
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,144
Rym: That was just.

607
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:47,760
Rym: hey, here's a casino bet the fake money The games gives you and when you leave the casino, that's your score or a bunch of money you had.

608
00:37:48,883 --> 00:38:02,806
Rym: There's no fundamental difference between them except this thing is designed to make humans addicted to it and it does it so well that as much as it is easy to look down on someone who Gets addicted to a really shitty game.

609
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:07,786
Rym: I Is a victim.

610
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,940
Rym: yeah, it is very hard to play.

611
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,060
Scott: I mean, I can't even begin to list all of the evil things this game does would take a long time, right?

612
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,110
Scott: So first right, but I'm gonna try to list a whole bunch of them.

613
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,020
Scott: just you can grasp how many evil Psychological mechanisms have been combined here.

614
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:35,071
Scott: It's like it seems like what they did is they just looked at every other app and every other casino in the world and all saw the things that they did and just started adding them one by one over the years because this App is years old.

615
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,982
Scott: It's not new And just.

616
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:40,517
Scott: they're just all combined together all the next to each other, right?

617
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:40,959
Scott: So here we go.

618
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:46,200
Scott: So first of all, it does the same thing that real-world slot machines do which is it tells you win when you lost.

619
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,955
Rym: Yeah, so like yo poker does this - it'll give you a payout.

620
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,179
Rym: That's less than what you bet.

621
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:58,752
Scott: This happens at real-world slot machines - let's say you go to a slot machine you put in a dollar Right and you and you spin the it spins and you win 50 cents.

622
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:00,859
Scott: It'll say you won 50 cents.

623
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,889
Scott: No, you didn't go lost 50 cents.

624
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,000
Scott: You put the dollar in asshole, right?

625
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:08,020
Rym: So, you know, you might think I wouldn't be fooled by that.

626
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,004
Rym: I know I lost.

627
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,760
Scott: you think that right but it never tells you lost.

628
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:16,620
Scott: The only thing it'll do is just be silent which means you lost a dollar asshole.

629
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:17,139
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:25,240
Scott: and what's even worse is it shows a Total like a tally of like your winnings over time and it's like you're sitting there and in the bottom corner.

631
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:33,294
Scott: It's like you have won a million dollars today, but you look and you see well I've got a hundred thousand ships and when I started this morning, I had about a hundred thousand ships.

632
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:34,840
Scott: I didn't win shit today.

633
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,534
Rym: Yep, now analogize this to like an overwatch.

634
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:48,280
Rym: when you win or lose the game It says victory or defeat but if If you win or lose it doesn't remind you that you lost because the next thing it does is say oh Here's all the points you got because you played right?

635
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,849
Scott: So that's a thing that real-world casinos do.

636
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:52,073
Scott: this also does right.

637
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:59,140
Scott: telling you you always telling you you won When you lost to make you feel like you're winning when you're not to keep you spinning or playing whatever game, right?

638
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,760
Scott: Okay, so here's the things that does that that apps do right?

639
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:05,110
Scott: So it has this weird.

640
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,380
Scott: the biggest thing I think is the social mechanism.

641
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:08,950
Scott: How do you make a fucking slot machine?

642
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,600
Scott: So, you know, right?

643
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,940
Scott: so you go to the slot machine and it shows you five other people playing the same slot machine and shows you like what they're.

644
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,060
Scott: It's like if they win like flowers and things explode around there.

645
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:20,586
Scott: You can see.

646
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:33,980
Scott: you see they're playing too Right and you can chat with them and you can give gifts to them and buy, you know You can spend the chips to buy Drinks for them which so all it does is make like a drink icon appear next to them.

647
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:43,017
Rym: I chatted with some people just to see today over lunch No one I interacted with past the Turing test, but I do think they were humans.

648
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:43,298
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,467
Scott: No, they're humans Yeah, but they did not.

650
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,777
Rym: these are humans who could not pass the Turing test.

651
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:54,400
Scott: No Also, there are some of the slot machines have an even more evil social mechanism.

652
00:40:54,781 --> 00:41:02,259
Scott: There's scatter slots, which means as you're spinning the slot machine, you know There's all the icons that are there, you know, whatever they are, right?

653
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:04,300
Scott: But there's also these scatter icons.

654
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,792
Scott: If three or more scatters appear anywhere on the slot machine doesn't matter what line they're in or anything Then you'll win money.

655
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,740
Scott: You'll win chips.

656
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:39,769
Scott: Everyone else who happens to be in the same virtual room as you will receive chips when you spin and get scatters and you'll get chips when they spin scatters and People were like saying thank you as if somehow I chose to give them a gift when I happen to randomly get scattered spin Right, and it's sort of like, you know, there's like encouraging, you know group aspect of like, you know The same thing as Wow raids like.

657
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,460
Scott: don't let the team down it, you know.

658
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,143
Scott: It's like everyone.

659
00:41:42,163 --> 00:41:48,060
Scott: you got to keep keep spinning on auto auto spin on max bet So everyone else will scatter to everyone else.

660
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:57,838
Scott: Come on do it for the team and then some people are leeches doing like the minimum spin just to stay in the room Right and leech off everyone else's scatters and try to make money that way.

661
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,409
Rym: Yep Not just craps word like.

662
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,757
Rym: the social aspect is keeping them together.

663
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:06,184
Rym: It's also these social Obligations, right?

664
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,228
Scott: Well, it's either way.

665
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:08,332
Scott: It's it's both.

666
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:16,722
Scott: both ways are the same pressure either pressure to do that max bet and keep spinning forever for the obligation or Pressure.

667
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:22,640
Scott: it's either way keeps you playing right or do what you can do to stay in that room and just leech off other people.

668
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,089
Scott: Either way, they're keeping you in there.

669
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:30,940
Scott: They don't care which one you're doing You know because it's they've already got a hundred percent of your money as they don't care What happens when you actually play the game?

670
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,940
Scott: They just want you to Want to play it more because the more you play the more you're going to need to give them money eventually to keep playing more.

671
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,664
Rym: Yep, think of it.

672
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:41,640
Rym: They get you addicted to it and eventually you run out of chips.

673
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:45,339
Scott: It's like going to the arcade and you played x-men, but you didn't beat magneto.

674
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,119
Scott: yet You need to go back to the change machine.

675
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,389
Scott: Yeah, they want you to go to that change machine.

676
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:49,851
Scott: good.

677
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,718
Scott: They want you to want to beat magneto, right?

678
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,039
Scott: I guess they you know, they want you to get the jackpot or whatever.

679
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:59,700
Rym: I mean I sat in fed quarters into a Simpsons arcade machine all day once until we beat it.

680
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,669
Scott: Yeah, this is like that only not a good game.

681
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,955
Rym: It's not even a game.

682
00:43:03,237 --> 00:43:03,920
Scott: It's just random.

683
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:06,571
Rym: You know, you always say not a game not a fucking game.

684
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:07,495
Rym: these things right?

685
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:09,467
Rym: There's one game in here So there's other.

686
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,240
Scott: there's other evil things going on.

687
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:15,295
Scott: So there's not just the chips, right?

688
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:19,995
Scott: There's also Tickets gold bars and VIP points.

689
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,280
Scott: There's all different currencies, right?

690
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,111
Scott: The VIP points eventually let you get into VIP areas To play VIP games that other people hang out with.

691
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,760
Rym: the people who might be closer to passing the Turing test.

692
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,300
Scott: Play this game only in a virtual room with other people who have played it too much just like you have.

693
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,645
Scott: No get the tickets.

694
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:40,612
Scott: the tickets can be used to get prizes.

695
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,120
Scott: the gold bars can be used to get gifts for other.

696
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,447
Rym: No, it's got those prizes.

697
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,036
Rym: These are only prizes in the game.

698
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:46,700
Rym: It's just more bits.

699
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:53,160
Scott: Yeah, just more bits and pictures and graphics and icons and sometimes chips sometimes other currencies.

700
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:56,919
Scott: I think like you can like use the tickets to get the VIP points.

701
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:57,822
Scott: now Now look at this.

702
00:43:57,923 --> 00:44:02,479
Rym: all that stuff combines into the same kind of pressure that you'd get playing old muds.

703
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,660
Rym: Yeah, you want to be really high level to show off to people around you?

704
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,820
Scott: There's also no matter what whether you win or lose as you play you level up.

705
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,843
Scott: There's like this levels.

706
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:22,440
Scott: you get XP of some and you're always getting levels and whenever you actually get a new level you get VIP points and chips and tickets and tokens and they begins to give you a pile of rewards.

707
00:44:22,803 --> 00:44:28,853
Scott: so you just even if you're losing money You just want to keep playing to get level up because you'll actually win if you.

708
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:36,120
Scott: if you if you lose as little as possible You'll actually profit in virtual currencies if you manage to level up.

709
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,213
Scott: So like I found the slot machine that was losing the slowest.

710
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:44,312
Scott: It's like a really low Minimum bid scatter slot that had like pictures.

711
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:46,300
Scott: So you're basically you're doing forest animals.

712
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,225
Rym: You know what you're doing with you.

713
00:44:47,265 --> 00:44:47,787
Rym: do that Scott.

714
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:50,260
Rym: you're doing what the old sad people in the casino do.

715
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:52,860
Rym: They play the penny slots to build up their reward point.

716
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,490
Scott: I was just trying to see like, you know, how often you level up.

717
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:09,276
Scott: I wanted to see mostly if the if it's like Yeah, if it's like Pokemon go or the leveling up gets harder over time and actually know the leveling up is like a really consistent Rate, it's like you just keep getting levels like, you know out.

718
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:14,400
Scott: with that auto spin I got levels like every you know, however unit of time I just kept getting them.

719
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,680
Rym: Well, cuz unlike Pokemon go this doesn't even need the illusion of real competition.

720
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,185
Scott: They didn't make the levels harder to get.

721
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:24,965
Scott: getting from level 1 to 2 was just as easy as getting from level 49 to 50 It wasn't.

722
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:27,519
Scott: it didn't get you know, they didn't increase the gap size.

723
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,723
Rym: But see this design pattern is again the same thing that's used to trick old people into sitting in front of a penny slot forever Until they die.

724
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:35,712
Scott: Yep now even worse.

725
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:37,580
Scott: They've got clubs.

726
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:44,448
Scott: You can join a club which is like a guild in Wow And you got to contribute money into it.

727
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,670
Scott: and I don't I didn't do this because I you know didn't get enough fake currency to Do this?

728
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:56,683
Scott: Yeah but you you basically somehow you have to contribute money into it and you have to play enough that the people in the club want You in the club.

729
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:01,100
Scott: and then somehow there's like you work together on slot machine tournaments.

730
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:05,102
Scott: I still don't understand how a slot machine tournament works, but they're a thing I think.

731
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:07,530
Scott: it's like you have a time limit and you spit.

732
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:14,860
Scott: it's like who can get the luckiest within that time limit and then You get more payout if you're the luckiest out of everyone who's spinning within that time limits.

733
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:21,018
Scott: like you want to start when the timer starts and spin as much as you can and then One person out of everyone will go.

734
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:29,362
Rym: I can get 1.65 million chips and that would normally cost $100.

735
00:46:29,362 --> 00:46:33,201
Rym: If I click on this in the next 15 seconds, it'll cost me $4.99.

736
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:33,924
Scott: Yeah that I didn't.

737
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:37,140
Scott: obviously that thing keeps popping up all the time.

738
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,186
Scott: It's it's lying to you about the time limit.

739
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:43,400
Scott: the same way that like when you get those info, you know TV commercials even better.

740
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,320
Scott: It takes all what's in the next 20 minutes to save whatever but actually you can call whenever that's the same thing.

741
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,746
Scott: It's like there's a get it now button.

742
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:51,695
Rym: There's a tiny X like a pop-up ad.

743
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:52,639
Rym: That's the only way to close it.

744
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:58,305
Rym: Yep, I'm gonna bet all my money on red till I till I run out right now go Yeah, put all your money on red.

745
00:46:58,345 --> 00:47:00,834
Scott: Maybe you'll actually win like you could have go Paris lights.

746
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:02,099
Rym: Let's go in here do it.

747
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:10,300
Scott: Yeah, like the the amount of things that this app does is like the most endless evil of evils, right?

748
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,650
Scott: And it's just like shocking that like why shouldn't this be illegal?

749
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,355
Scott: Even if it isn't gambling?

750
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:17,599
Scott: and also why is?

751
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,980
Scott: Why is this seen as less evil than actual gambling like an actual gambling?

752
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,048
Scott: Like I said, you can win real your money back.

753
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:26,152
Scott: Maybe here.

754
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,140
Scott: It's a hundred percent guaranteed loss.

755
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:29,386
Scott: This should be illegal.

756
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:36,218
Scott: more than real gambling should be illegal But yeah, so the thing I want to take away from this right is two things.

757
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:42,920
Scott: number one In addition slot machines are most of this app, but it also has some other slot equivalent games.

758
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,340
Scott: There's a horse racing one, which is yeah a slot machine that looks like horses basically effectively.

759
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,360
Scott: There's Texas hold them is in here, which is like hey if you want to play Texas hold them with fake money.

760
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,847
Scott: This actually isn't a bad way to do it.

761
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:58,101
Scott: It's a pretty good UI for that and you can't you know It's.

762
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:03,458
Scott: that's actually probably, you know worth playing this app compared to doing real hold them with real money.

763
00:48:03,658 --> 00:48:08,239
Scott: Yeah It also had video poker which is just a slot machine that looks different.

764
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:15,200
Scott: But it also had this game called burn 3 poker imagine Oh as roulette, which is also a slot machine.

765
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,484
Scott: Yeah, but yeah the burn 3 poker once I played it is actually almost a game like this.

766
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:36,080
Scott: actually decisions you make and It's mostly luck because you basically only have like a few cards to choose from and you keep getting new cards because you burn the other three Called burn 3 but actually is like there's some thought that goes into like where you position the cards.

767
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,943
Rym: It's actually it's.

768
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:40,615
Rym: it's like a really baby version of battle line or lost cities.

769
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:42,240
Scott: Yeah, it's like a one-on-one game.

770
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:48,202
Scott: It pairs you up with someone you put up some money and if you be if you win against the other person you take The pot.

771
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:51,740
Scott: there's no like raising or anything or any sort of betting mechanic.

772
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,640
Scott: It's literally just put money in the pot play this game against another human being and if you win you take everyone's money.

773
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,055
Scott: Yeah, and I think the house maybe takes a cut and there's almost like there's almost a game there.

774
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:02,300
Scott: Yeah, it's like a little game.

775
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,364
Scott: It's almost a little game.

776
00:49:03,445 --> 00:49:07,220
Scott: I was surprised it was in there because he got it Foster that competitive element.

777
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:13,600
Rym: Yeah, craps is not in here Which is interesting because craps is like the most social existing game.

778
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,523
Scott: I'm also you know also the one well It's still favors.

779
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:26,160
Scott: the house obviously has the best odds for the players if played properly, but yeah true true Crap, when I perhaps is the way to lose your money the slowest at a real casino?

780
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:26,582
Scott: Yep,

781
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,320
Rym: craps is also probably the most fun game you can play in a casino

782
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:41,111
Scott: Game where if you lose your money slow enough and you bet low enough It's actually sort of like fun and it's like, you know I don't feel if I play craps with a low enough minimum bid.

783
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:43,218
Scott: Yeah, some of those tables like $20 minimum bid.

784
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,422
Scott: It's like hell.

785
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:44,985
Scott: no.

786
00:49:45,005 --> 00:49:47,796
Rym: No, but if it's like what I said 20 cent minimum bid, here we go.

787
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:48,640
Scott: It's like a dollar.

788
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:52,231
Scott: It's like it's actually sort of like hey, it's you know, it's almost.

789
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,879
Scott: it's half as fun as putting a dollar in a DDR machine.

790
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:58,909
Scott: Okay What was I gonna say?

791
00:49:58,929 --> 00:49:59,995
Scott: I forget.

792
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:02,803
Scott: so oh No, I forgot.

793
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:03,063
Scott: Okay.

794
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:08,840
Rym: The moral of all this is that we've there's a fine line because on one hand we're both extremely

795
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:09,985
Scott: In

796
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:14,172
Rym: favor of free speech and we think video games are speech but on the

797
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:14,638
Scott: other hand

798
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:21,540
Rym: This addictive shit is really evil and it praised very directly on a lot of people

799
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:23,111
Scott: All human beings

800
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:23,957
Rym: and yes, like

801
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:23,998
Scott: I

802
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,106
Rym: Even though I am mostly me.

803
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:28,510
Rym: I'm very much inoculating.

804
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,453
Rym: It's this kind of shit.

805
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,278
Rym: Like I'm constantly evaluating games.

806
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:35,040
Rym: I play Even I over lunch like poking around in this game.

807
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:37,088
Rym: They got it a little bit into it.

808
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:37,711
Rym: I was like, oh shit.

809
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:39,340
Rym: No, and I'm actually deleting the app right now.

810
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,380
Scott: Yeah, they this thing they have slot machines of every different visual style and theme.

811
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,032
Scott: So no matter what you're personally like into what your culture is.

812
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:50,340
Scott: There's actually a slot machine in here for you.

813
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,200
Scott: There's one that's like a dragon's horde that looked pretty cool.

814
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:56,700
Scott: The pac-man one is obviously the best one, but the minimum is too high.

815
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,740
Scott: So I couldn't play it unless I wanted to lose all my chips.

816
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,020
Scott: Maybe that's what I'll do is I'll just put the pac-man one on max bet and spin it.

817
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,286
Scott: So all my chips are gone then delete it.

818
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,231
Rym: I just uninstalled it.

819
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:05,397
Rym: It's uninstalling right now.

820
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:05,820
Scott: Good job.

821
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:09,110
Scott: But there's also like America one is a Baywatch one.

822
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,534
Scott: There's like, you know, no matter.

823
00:51:10,795 --> 00:51:12,240
Scott: It's cute little animals.

824
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:16,289
Scott: There's like any you know There's any kind of theme that interests you.

825
00:51:16,691 --> 00:51:21,862
Scott: one of these slot machines will appeal to you visually And you know the music, you know all the same thing.

826
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:30,581
Scott: a real slot machine does musically and visually attracts you and makes you want to watch it and get hypnotized mesmerized by it and all that stuff Right.

827
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:49,736
Scott: So the actual takeaway here that the other thing I want to talk about is that I think there's a way That we can use all of these evil mechanics or some of them and apply them to a not evil casino right to some other kind of good game Right and get people to play it.

828
00:51:50,118 --> 00:52:00,800
Scott: Yeah People to do a thing that is good for people to do like vote for Democrats I mean just you know get addicted to a good behavior and not a meaningless behavior.

829
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,632
Scott: Also how much people talk about how much electricity Bitcoin is using?

830
00:52:03,813 --> 00:52:05,460
Scott: how much electricity is people wasting?

831
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,719
Scott: You know that their phones are using on worthless apps like this.

832
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,222
Rym: But it's just.

833
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:11,611
Rym: it's interesting that I'm actually pretty.

834
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:16,266
Scott: always got their phone like set to auto spin somewhere Just killing, you know eating off the power grid.

835
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:18,091
Rym: I'm okay with legal gambling.

836
00:52:18,131 --> 00:52:21,480
Rym: what I'm actually not okay with are these addictive experience, right?

837
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:30,594
Scott: I think there should be a lot like if there was a law that was like hey If you got a slot machine and someone puts a hundred in and they win 50 It should be forced to say lose 50 on it.

838
00:52:32,021 --> 00:52:36,960
Rym: But where's the line in a game where there there is no actual gambling here?

839
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,605
Rym: Where is the line between?

840
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:41,537
Rym: this game is good and people keep playing it versus.

841
00:52:41,577 --> 00:52:44,633
Rym: this game is Mechanically addictive and people people keep playing it.

842
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:45,880
Rym: Where's the line between?

843
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,713
Scott: I think it just has to be honest and in the case of this game The honesty has to be like hey here.

844
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:56,351
Scott: They should have to tell you for example Here's the amount of money you've given us over real money.

845
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:58,560
Scott: You've given us over time total, right?

846
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,940
Scott: You're not and it should be like you've lost all this money.

847
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,250
Rym: Well see there's that I think was the real important differences.

848
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:11,886
Scott: when it says here's the amount of money you won today It should have to show you the net not I think you know the the real line To regulate this.

849
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,752
Rym: you don't regulate games.

850
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:20,662
Rym: Generally you specifically regulate microtransactions in games Microtransactions.

851
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:29,492
Rym: if this game had no way for you to give them money directly if it just had ads be as addictive as you Also has that you can watch ads to get more chips.

852
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:31,400
Rym: Yep, but make it hundred percent.

853
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,959
Scott: I didn't watch any ads to get chips.

854
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,803
Rym: Yeah, if you make an addictive app That's just free speech.

855
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:45,312
Rym: if you make an addictive app with microtransactions or a non addictive app with microtransactions those Microtransactions should be heavily regulated.

856
00:53:45,794 --> 00:53:47,380
Rym: That is where I feel like the liner.

857
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:54,878
