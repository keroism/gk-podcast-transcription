1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,099
Rym: I feel like it's Tigress and Euphrates season suddenly.

2
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,838
Scott: How is that a season?

3
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:17,239
Rym: I feel like that's what happens.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,380
Scott: Spring, summer, fall, went to Tigress and Euphrates.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,139
Rym: You know, if those were the four seasons, I would have a pretty good life going on.

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:36,080
Rym: I think what happened is just that because we taught some people how to play and we did a live stream the other weekend, and then the following weekend, more friends came out and we just played it because we all know how to play.

7
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:40,539
Rym: I also kind of got hustled in that game.

8
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,799
Rym: Emily beat me in a game that we played with Phil and Jay the other night.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,460
Rym: And basically what happened was, the first game that we played, I won the game and crushed everybody.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,900
Rym: It was partly because Jay attacked me and I just happened to have four green tiles in my hand.

11
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,120
Scott: It just happened.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,439
Rym: Like they were there, I got attacked, I was like, "Well...".

13
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,880
Scott: You didn't see the attack coming?

14
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,699
Rym: I did not expect the attack at that time.

15
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:06,746
Scott: See, that's the thing.

16
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,200
Scott: When I play Tigress and Euphrates, I basically see the future.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,557
Scott: Because every...

18
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,380
Rym: Well, if you can see the future, you didn't see the future of me winning.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,040
Scott: People only have two actions, right?

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,660
Scott: So you can't really surprise anyone.

21
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:24,000
Scott: It's pretty easy to see every possible conflict that could happen on your turn.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,642
Rym: Well, you should be clear.

23
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:28,074
Rym: You can't necessarily predict what people will do, but you can narrow it down to.

24
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,720
Rym: there's only a few things they can do.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,440
Scott: But at least in a four player game it's harder, but in a two player game it's ridiculously easy.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:45,580
Rym: It's more that in this attack, it was a strong, augmented attack from a hand that happened to be repulsed by an equally lucky strong defense from the hand.

27
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,176
Rym: The kingdoms themselves were not that powerful in either direction.

28
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:49,779
Rym: It was pretty even.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,934
Rym: But then the next game, I was winning hand over fist.

30
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,280
Rym: Just hand over fist.

31
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,800
Rym: And then I attack Emily.

32
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:03,260
Rym: And if I won that conflict, I would have won the game mathematically.

33
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,780
Rym: There was nothing anyone could have done to stop me.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,880
Scott: But she had six tiles.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,779
Rym: She just has a handful of black tiles.

36
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:12,458
Rym: And just due to the way the game ended...

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,260
Scott: You couldn't get your black guy back on the board.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,349
Rym: I had like 15, 15, 15, 4 at one point as the score.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
Scott: You couldn't get the black guy back on the board.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,940
Rym: Ah, so the next turn, because I was still winning and I had a chance, I internal conflicted with my black leader...

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
Scott: That's the only way to get it back on.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,260
Rym: ...to get onto a spot that had two black monuments.

43
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:35,160
Rym: And yeah, once again, Emily just happened to have a whole bunch of red tiles in her hand.

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,446
Scott: See, here's the thing, right?

45
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,620
Scott: So here's some basic T&E strategies.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,280
Scott: We're not going to do a whole show on this, right?

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:40,541
Rym: No.

48
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:41,974
Rym: Well, we have done a whole show on it.

49
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:42,580
Rym: I'll link to it.

50
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,033
Scott: You can see what's coming and you can look at your tiles in your hand and you can tell, "Aha, a black conflict is coming.

51
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:50,738
Scott: Am I going to win

52
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:50,819
Scott: it?".

53
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:57,320
Scott: If you're not going to win it, you can either A, abandon it or B, dump tiles to try to get black tiles.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,562
Rym: Yup.

55
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,291
Rym: Now...

56
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,960
Scott: Other basic strategy.

57
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,360
Rym: Well, what was I saying the other day?

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,020
Rym: The two most powerful things you can likely do in that game are build a monument in someone else's kingdom.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,460
Scott: Yup.

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,940
Rym: Or start a fight between two other people's kingdoms.

61
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,680
Scott: You can also, the catastrophe can swing you.

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:23,480
Scott: If you don't have the red tiles to get, if the kingdoms are big and are stable, then you can only use internal conflicts to get your guy back on the board, right?

63
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,858
Scott: It's very hard to use external conflicts to get back on the board.

64
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,780
Scott: Unless you go back on the board in a shitty location and just start taking two points, not the greatest.

65
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,148
Scott: So, you need red tiles to get back on the board.

66
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:37,880
Scott: You can dump to get red tiles or you can use catastrophes.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:48,369
Scott: That'll probably get you back on, but if you use your catastrophes first against someone to get back on the board, they still have their catastrophes.

68
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,340
Scott: You don't want to be the first person to catastrophe.

69
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:52,039
Rym: Yup.

70
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,840
Scott: You want to be the last person to catastrophe.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,799
Rym: If you're building a snake tendril of a kingdom out to touch somebody and make some mischief, and that somebody doesn't have any catastrophes left.

72
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:13,780
Scott: Yeah, if you still have catastrophes and the other players have been forced to use them all, then what you can do is you can start using board positions that are normally weak to catastrophe with no fear.

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,094
Rym: Like four leaders huddled around one un-treasured red.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,488
Scott: You can leave a leader next to one red tile.

75
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,940
Scott: You can make a long snake of tiles to grab a treasure.

76
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:43,120
Scott: You can do all this stuff that you normally cannot do when catastrophes are out, but if you can force the other player to use theirs to get back onto the board by kicking them off and maybe blocking a nice internal conflict, like if they try to internal their way back on and they lose, they have to catastrophe their way back on, catastrophe them off, take your position back.

77
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,319
Scott: They're out of catastrophes and now they're done.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,281
Rym: Yup.

79
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,172
Rym: Seriously, you know, we talk a lot about board games.

80
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:53,167
Rym: We play a lot of board games and, well, we played.

81
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,978
Rym: Lately, Scott doesn't play as many.

82
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Rym: But Tigris and Euphrates has consistently remained my favorite tabletop board game.

83
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:03,899
Scott: So good.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,600
Rym: There are a few games that I might argue are better.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Rym: It really depends on what you mean by better, like.

86
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,719
Rym: better at, you know, what's a good at.

87
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,500
Rym: Like Puerto Rico is probably a more finely tuned test of skill in a general sense.

88
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,200
Scott: There's no random tile grab.

89
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:22,920
Rym: Eclipse, however, is better at like satisfying that big old war game intense feeling.

90
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,807
Rym: But in terms of the average of all possible aspects of a game, Tigris and Euphrates is far and away my favorite tabletop game.

91
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,207
Rym: And it's telling that after all these years, nothing has unseated it.

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,479
Rym: Even games that I really like.

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,241
Scott: All right.

94
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:42,600
Scott: So in the news, there's a new board game coming out that was announced today.

95
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,145
Scott: Look at how new this news is.

96
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:57,972
Scott: Fantasy Flight Games, publishers of such games as Netrunner and others you may enjoy, Citadel's, I guess, are now going to publish X-Com, the board game.

97
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,399
Scott: Oh my glob.

98
00:05:59,439 --> 00:05:59,600
Scott: So.

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,487
Rym: Well, well, oh my glob.

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,669
Rym: It's funny you say that because usually when there's property, I like game in that property.

101
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,056
Rym: warning signs.

102
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:08,760
Scott: That is true.

103
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,280
Rym: But Fantasy Flight, not like Cryptozoic.

104
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,709
Scott: So this is the thing people don't realize.

105
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:19,232
Scott: is that X-Com, there's an interview I watched with the CEO of Fantasy Flight Games.

106
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,000
Rym: You almost said the CEO of X-Com.

107
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,747
Scott: No, the CEO of Fantasy Flight Games.

108
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:25,140
Scott: So I guess is now possibly also the CEO of X-Com.

109
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:33,627
Scott: And they asked him, how do you choose which properties to license and how do you get such good licensed properties?

110
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,773
Scott: Because they do Star Wars.

111
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,080
Scott: They're making X-Wing, right?

112
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,803
Scott: Star Wars.

113
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,940
Scott: What bigger licensed property is there than Star Wars?

114
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,530
Scott: They're doing Warhammer and they're not games workshop.

115
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:42,454
Scott: Okay.

116
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:46,168
Scott: It's like, how are you getting these properties as Fantasy Flight?

117
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,100
Scott: And he's basically like, look, we do such a good job.

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,620
Scott: All the licensers are coming to us trying to get us to make games for them.

119
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:53,102
Rym: Yeah.

120
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,146
Rym: Take, take note of that.

121
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,000
Rym: Anyone who goes to Cryptozoic and we turn most of them down.

122
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,559
Scott: And then I guess they go to Cryptozoic and who always says yes and just make some piece of shit.

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,159
Scott: So the fact that they said yes to X-Com, right, is a big deal.

124
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,367
Scott: So is this game good?

125
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:12,059
Scott: Well, let's see what we know about the game so far.

126
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,540
Rym: It has an embed, like an app that goes with it.

127
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,760
Rym: Right.

128
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,442
Scott: So here's the deal.

129
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:26,100
Scott: All the descriptions of this game seem to suggest it's a combination of Pandemic, which sucks, and Space Alert, which is good.

130
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,579
Rym: The board game is a hybrid digital game that requires a companion app.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,682
Scott: Right.

132
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:35,760
Scott: So Space Alert uses like a CD or an MP3 or a cassette or whatever it uses.

133
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,765
Scott: This uses an app.

134
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:44,075
Scott: So it's basically it's more versatile and they could update the app to add more scenarios and things of that nature.

135
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:44,839
Scott: So that can be pretty cool.

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,026
Rym: Of course, you could also.

137
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,720
Rym: it could also be Omega virus.

138
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,885
Scott: It could also be Omega virus.

139
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:56,828
Scott: But so basically you and your friends are co-op against the game, which is X-Com, the aliens.

140
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,480
Scott: And each person does something different, right?

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:10,580
Scott: You've got the chief scientist who manages the science, the commander who moves the interceptors around the central officer who basically pays attention to the app and also the satellites.

142
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:14,020
Scott: The squad leader manages the units who come out of the sky ranger.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,589
Scott: And so each person has their own job.

144
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:27,314
Scott: And it doesn't seem like the jobs are programming related, which fixes the Space Alert problem of some of the people you're playing with can't program even for instructions and are incompetent.

145
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:33,390
Scott: So you can't actually play Space Alert properly by making it more pandemic like.

146
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:39,693
Scott: And at the same time, each person has to concentrate on a completely different thing, not more pandemic.

147
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:40,880
Scott: Everyone's doing the same thing.

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,051
Scott: So you is going to be less quarterbacking because of that.

149
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:54,740
Scott: And also because it's real time with this app telling you what's going on and having to react to the app in real time, there's less quarterbacking because one person can't handle all four jobs.

150
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,487
Rym: You need four people.

151
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,572
Rym: That's a big factor.

152
00:08:57,612 --> 00:09:01,649
Rym: The game now becomes much more reliant upon things like charisma, shouting ability.

153
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,340
Scott: But you're all on the same team.

154
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:08,220
Rym: Yeah, but even on the same team, you're not going to charisma the aliens into leaving.

155
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,280
Rym: No, but you're going to charisma your friend into doing what you tell him at the critical moment.

156
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,181
Scott: Yeah.

157
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:31,399
Scott: I mean, if you can even, you know, hopefully it looks like like there's so little information about the game, but looking at the board and the pieces, it looks like each player has so much going on that I don't know if you could really like even pay attention enough to what the other people are doing in order to manage more than one of these jobs at a time.

158
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,114
Scott: I'm sure there's some smart person out there going to handle two or three of the jobs.

159
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,125
Scott: handling all four at the same time seems pretty difficult.

160
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,460
Scott: So, uh, yeah, this looks like it'll be fun.

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,232
Scott: I don't know if I'll pay for it, depending how much it is.

162
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:50,315
Scott: I think I might sell a bunch of board games I don't play and buy this if I can't convince someone else to buy it.

163
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,038
Rym: We'll see.

164
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,343
Rym: I wonder if we'll be able to.

165
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:53,888
Scott: I really want to try it at PAX.

166
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:57,479
Rym: Yeah, this is a game that I don't know.

167
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,121
Rym: It could be good.

168
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,843
Rym: It could be bad.

169
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,951
Rym: There's factors in both directions.

170
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:02,553
Scott: Yep.

171
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,334
Scott: It's just exciting to see the XCOM license used at all for something besides a video game.

172
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,065
Rym: Well, I mean, people forget the days of like XCOM Interceptor.

173
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,429
Scott: Well, that's a video game.

174
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,014
Rym: Yes, a bad video game.

175
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:14,416
Scott: Yes.

176
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:19,614
Scott: But I wish that, you know, the XCOM license were used more often on other things.

177
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,849
Rym: Also, I was reminded why you should never read comments on articles.

178
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,124
Rym: The comments on this polygon article about this are choice.

179
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,047
Rym: Okay.

180
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:28,873
Rym: Here, I'm going to quote one of these guys.

181
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:32,661
Rym: This is trinium 1029.

182
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,145
Rym: I'm sorry, but no.

183
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:41,792
Rym: XCOM is great as a video game because it allows for real tactical decisions without needing to worry about a bunch of numbers and fuzzy stuff.

184
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,640
Rym: Board games aren't so good at.

185
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,045
Scott: XCOM has no numbers.

186
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:51,659
Rym: He says that board games are bad at being real tactical games.

187
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,722
Rym: is what he's saying here.

188
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:54,026
Scott: Okay.

189
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:55,271
Rym: I agree.

190
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,980
Rym: Converting the XCOM to a board game seems like a painful experience.

191
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,690
Rym: The plot and theme would make for a great game.

192
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:04,407
Rym: These people, it's like they have no idea how to evaluate.

193
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,199
Scott: Well, also he's like, it would be a bunch of numbers and stuff.

194
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,242
Scott: In other words, I'm dumb.

195
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,628
Scott: No want to do hard thing.

196
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,296
Scott: In other words, you're dumb.

197
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,403
Scott: We should not consider anything you have to say.

198
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,771
Scott: You admit ignorance and anti-intellectualism.

199
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:20,906
Scott: If you are proud of being stupid, why don't we just kill you?

200
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,231
Scott: You're worthless and you admitted it.

201
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:26,874
Rym: You should go post there because you're right in the tone of this discussion.

202
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,860
Scott: That's exactly what I'm saying.

203
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,184
Scott: Perfect internet comment.

204
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,635
Rym: Plus five would read again.

205
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,563
Scott: I'm even posting this comment to the internet in MP3 form.

206
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:36,285
Scott: It's so fancy.

207
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,262
Rym: I suspect if I have to guess, I think this is going to be a fun game.

208
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:43,508
Scott: It could be good.

209
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,371
Scott: It's worth it.

210
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,722
Scott: It's going to be worth playing at least once to see how this app works.

211
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:47,464
Scott: Now here's the thing.

212
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,571
Scott: Requires this app.

213
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,916
Rym: That's fine by me.

214
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:54,066
Scott: Which you can use in a computer, a tablet, a phone, whatever.

215
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:55,370
Scott: Even a desktop.

216
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:00,727
Scott: But what about those people who don't have any computing device whatsoever?

217
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,232
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:08,017
Rym: I'm going to have to get four friends and they're each going to have to buy a Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy Advance link cable.

219
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,806
Scott: You know people are going to say that?

220
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:10,309
Rym: Yep.

221
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,240
Scott: They're going to be like, "I can't play this game because I don't have the

222
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,481
Scott: app.".

223
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,147
Scott: Or, "The game's at a convention.

224
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,894
Scott: Check it out of the library.

225
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:19,549
Scott: You don't have the app on your phone and no one does either in the

226
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:19,870
Scott: group.".

227
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,642
Rym: And the wireless is too slow because you're at a convention.

228
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:25,660
Scott: You can't get the game because you got to download this massive app over wireless.

229
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,692
Scott: Is the convention going to put a tablet in the game box?

230
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:30,753
Rym: No.

231
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,618
Rym: Well, I could see.

232
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:39,444
Rym: so I could see like mag fest like having one person who just did that because they'd be pretty trusting of that.

233
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,388
Scott: Maybe.

234
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,673
Rym: I don't see that happening at PAX.

235
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:46,733
Scott: I'm just saying, right, that's a problem for this game and convention libraries and other game libraries.

236
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:48,981
Rym: What I would do is, you know what?

237
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,373
Scott: It's also a problem for this game in the distant future.

238
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:57,394
Scott: if you don't have some, you know, this app isn't going to be updated for all time, right?

239
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:00,605
Scott: It'll probably stop working on iOS 12 or Android 20 something.

240
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:07,280
Scott: It can go into the pile of such games as Tribes 2 and Quake 2.

241
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,334
Scott: But it's a board game, so board games usually don't become unplayable.

242
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:18,331
Rym: I have a WWF, that's how old it is, wrestling game that requires a VHS tape.

243
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,558
Rym: I don't have a VHS player.

244
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,889
Scott: No, but you can get a copy of that video in YouTube or something.

245
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,374
Rym: I wonder if I can, actually.

246
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,462
Rym: This is a piece of software.

247
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:31,477
Scott: You would need like an iPhone emulator and a copy of it or something.

248
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:37,318
Scott: It would not be as easy to play this game in the distant future when the software is no longer available.

249
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,646
Rym: Playing Tribes 2.

250
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:43,820
Scott: Well, there is a desktop version of this app, it appears, because it's a picture of a laptop.

251
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:50,961
Scott: So whether I buy this game or not, I'm going to download the software and then keep it somewhere safe.

252
00:13:52,024 --> 00:14:03,237
Rym: So here's the thing, if this game is good enough to be remembered to the point that anyone would want to play it after it is sort of expired technologically, it'll be kept around.

253
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:07,976
Rym: I mean, how many packs of every ROM from every console ever are available online?

254
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,808
Scott: I'm just saying, this is not, you know, it's not guaranteed.

255
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:16,885
Rym: It's guaranteed because if it's forgotten, it was forgotten for a reason.

256
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,356
Scott: There are things that are forgotten that shouldn't be.

257
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:20,219
Rym: Very few.

258
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,904
Rym: Some things.

259
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:22,852
Scott: Nothing lasts forever.

260
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:23,960
Rym: Some things ye mighty.

261
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,529
Rym: So in other news, I want to bring this up briefly.

262
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:34,408
Rym: We've been talking a lot and everyone's been talking a lot about Nintendo's not doing well.

263
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:35,653
Scott: No, they're doing awful.

264
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,749
Rym: You guys really need to pay attention to how poorly Nintendo is doing.

265
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,793
Scott: Super awful.

266
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:46,740
Rym: This isn't just like, I mean, like there were times in the past where they'd have like a weird, like, Oh my God, we were unprofitable.

267
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,592
Scott: And then they came back and it was just like Apple came back.

268
00:14:49,613 --> 00:15:00,193
Rym: Well, a lot of those instances were due to things like currency fluctuations or cycles missing between like when Sony releases something, but Nintendo doesn't have something to release that quarter.

269
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:00,999
Rym: Like all sorts of things.

270
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,774
Rym: Nintendo lost $97 million in the quarter ending June 30th.

271
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:07,135
Scott: Okay.

272
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,238
Scott: So Nintendo lost $97 million.

273
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,051
Scott: Let me tell you some unrelated news just to give you some scope.

274
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:12,452
Rym: Yeah.

275
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:19,677
Scott: Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 guy basically was mad bribery corruption and he was going to go to jail.

276
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:27,620
Scott: And in fact, the other guy who was involved is in jail and he paid the court a hundred million dollars to not go to jail.

277
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,361
Scott: Basically.

278
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:35,097
Scott: So Nintendo lost less money than that dude paid to not go to jail.

279
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,523
Scott: That's how much money 1% has.

280
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,469
Scott: But there you go.

281
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,271
Rym: That's just sad.

282
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:41,174
Scott: Think about that.

283
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:41,856
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,080
Rym: That's why Luigi is so mad.

285
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:47,180
Scott: If they just gave that money to Nintendo, Nintendo would be in the profit zone.

286
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,068
Rym: So why is Nintendo not profitable?

287
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,534
Scott: Well, no one's buying their shit.

288
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,177
Scott: Wii U sucks.

289
00:15:52,237 --> 00:16:01,179
Rym: No one's buying the Wii U and no one bought a Wii U who didn't already own one to play Mario Kart 8.

290
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:06,200
Scott: Why would I buy a Wii U just for Mario Kart when I already have 10 Mario Karts that are perfectly awesome?

291
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,465
Rym: Just remember that there was a time in my life where GameCube, we had to own one because there's going to be a Mario Kart.

292
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,550
Rym: We didn't buy GameCube.

293
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,540
Scott: We didn't even buy GameCube for Mario Kart.

294
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,021
Rym: Yeah.

295
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,435
Rym: But we bought a big GameCube because you knew that there'd be one.

296
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,668
Scott: I don't even own Double Dash and I've hardly played it.

297
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,111
Scott: Yeah.

298
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:23,237
Scott: I don't even like Double Dash.

299
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,086
Scott: It's one of the worser Mario Karts in my book.

300
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:25,689
Scott: Worser.

301
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,135
Rym: Not one of the worst though.

302
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,099
Scott: No, it's not the worst.

303
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,926
Scott: It's not a great Mario Kart.

304
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,431
Scott: Take that.

305
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:32,616
Scott: People are mad at me now.

306
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:33,358
Rym: Of course they are.

307
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:39,567
Rym: A lot of people I know think that's the best Mario Kart because usually it's the people who are bad at Mario Kart who like to be the partner in the back.

308
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:43,643
Scott: Those are the people who can't play the real Mario Kart on the Game Boy Advance.

309
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:44,024
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,393
Rym: What about the snaking Mario Kart on the DS?

311
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,416
Scott: That's really bad.

312
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:51,290
Scott: Actually, that could be the best one if it didn't have the snaking.

313
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,134
Rym: But for snaking.

314
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:56,249
Rym: Well, we're going to talk about snaking at our panel at PAX on how to win at games.

315
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,651
Rym: Right.

316
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:57,875
Rym: On Monday at noon.

317
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:04,422
Rym: But the problem is that Nintendo does not have a lot to bring to the table anymore and they've gotten to the point.

318
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:04,622
Rym: They do.

319
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,169
Scott: They're just not bringing it to the table.

320
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:08,579
Rym: Well, as a result, they don't.

321
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,903
Scott: Pokemon MMO.

322
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,026
Rym: Come on.

323
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,297
Scott: How desperate do they have to be to make the Pokemon MMO?

324
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,040
Rym: If they were going to make the Pokemon MMO, it would have to be on the PC and mobile devices, not on a Wii U.

325
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,923
Scott: Yes.

326
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,107
Scott: Just fucking do it.

327
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:32,466
Rym: The problem is Nintendo's gotten to the point now to where their first party games are no longer, oh shit, I need to own the console to play that game or the current generation of those games.

328
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,940
Scott: Of course not, because those games aren't Super Metroid 2.

329
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,928
Rym: They're also not getting better.

330
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,882
Rym: Mario Kart 8 is, you know, it's got a lot going for it, but it's not.

331
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,830
Scott: How is it any different from Wii Mario Kart?

332
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:44,895
Rym: Minor improvements.

333
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:46,461
Rym: The Luigi Death Stare.

334
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:47,224
Scott: Okay.

335
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:47,605
Scott: Yeah.

336
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,271
Rym: The network works better.

337
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,277
Scott: Probably the same as Wii Mario Kart.

338
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,622
Scott: What do I need it for?

339
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,813
Scott: I'm sure it's great, but it's not worth paying money for.

340
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,522
Scott: when I can play Wii Mario Kart.

341
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,155
Rym: I'm actually still really liking the 3DS Mario Kart.

342
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,080
Scott: Yeah, that's an okay Mario Kart.

343
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,708
Rym: Also, look at the Mario Tennis.

344
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,560
Rym: Recent Mario Tennises have gotten easier and worse.

345
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:07,443
Scott: Yep.

346
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:08,387
Rym: Objectively worse.

347
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,774
Scott: I got GameCube Mario Tennis.

348
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:10,960
Scott: What do I need another Mario Tennis for?

349
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,000
Rym: I think GameCube Mario Tennis was the peak of Mario Tennis and it's been a decline since then.

350
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,622
Scott: Obviously.

351
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:20,417
Scott: Well, did you ever play the GBA Mario Tennis?

352
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,843
Rym: Yes, I have played it, but I never owned it.

353
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:29,976
Scott: The GBA Mario Tennis is made by the people who made Golden Sun using the same engine and it's got like an RPG aspect to it.

354
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,120
Scott: It's actually pretty awesome.

355
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:32,807
Scott: I recommend checking it out.

356
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:38,494
Scott: I don't recommend maybe playing the whole thing because it takes a while, but it's worth seeing for like, "Ooh, this

357
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:38,876
Scott: happened.".

358
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,361
Rym: I don't think Nintendo is going to recover.

359
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:42,147
Scott: Maybe not.

360
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,491
Rym: I don't foresee.

361
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:48,049
Scott: I would just, I hope that they could recover so easily if they would just do what I tell them.

362
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:49,456
Rym: Well, look at what happened.

363
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:52,611
Scott: The thing about this, all right, so here's something someone pointed out the other day, right?

364
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,489
Scott: We talk about, people are talking about like PS4 and Xbone.

365
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,280
Scott: There's more 3DSs than PS4s and Xbone combined.

366
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,802
Rym: Well, watch out.

367
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,610
Rym: The PS4 is selling like crazy.

368
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,654
Rym: The Xbone's not.

369
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,521
Scott: It seems like the PS4 is winning, for sure.

370
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,544
Rym: Winning, I think won.

371
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,808
Rym: I think done.

372
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,851
Scott: Probably, yeah.

373
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:15,150
Scott: But still, 3DS is crushed both of them by a lot, right?

374
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,118
Rym: Is that just because it's been a lot longer?

375
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:23,116
Scott: Why doesn't Nintendo just abandon their Wii garbage and just go full-on 3DS and give the people what they want?

376
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:26,833
Scott: Nintendo's main problem is not that they can't give the people what they want.

377
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:27,195
Scott: They won't.

378
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:32,703
Scott: If Nintendo would just do what we tell them, as we've been saying on this show, for as long as this show has existed.

379
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:36,157
Rym: Well, in the GameCube era, they would make all the money.

380
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,101
Scott: The profit would go whoop.

381
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:44,127
Rym: In the GameCube era, they experimented and they went toward their like sort of core, invested in Nintendo demographic.

382
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:48,061
Rym: But yet, they also had the infinitely profitable mobile platform at the time.

383
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:56,328
Rym: Then, in the Wii era, because they weren't doing so well, they had a rapid gear shift and they went toward the Blue Ocean strategy.

384
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,460
Scott: Which made them a lot of money on Wii Sports.

385
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,084
Rym: Wii Bowling.

386
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:01,868
Rym: Not even Wii Sports.

387
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,415
Rym: It was pretty much just Wii Bowling.

388
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,360
Scott: And then also Wii Fit.

389
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:05,141
Rym: Yeah.

390
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,955
Rym: And then all those people didn't buy any other games.

391
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:09,778
Scott: No, of course not.

392
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,285
Rym: And certainly weren't going to buy a Wii U.

393
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:11,847
Scott: No.

394
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,077
Rym: Meanwhile, all the people like us said, "Yeah, fuck you

395
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:14,459
Rym: guys.".

396
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:15,944
Rym: So we left.

397
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,975
Rym: So now they're floating out in the Blue Ocean alone.

398
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,745
Scott: But Nintendo could easily please us people.

399
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:26,648
Scott: If they would just make what I tell them, all of us would suddenly have to go and buy whatever they were selling.

400
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,215
Scott: If they made the right game for it.

401
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,461
Rym: I've said this so many times.

402
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:40,069
Rym: If Nintendo did even a quarter, an eighth, a twentieth of what the Wii U controller is capable of, I would have bought that console in a heartbeat.

403
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,373
Rym: But they haven't.

404
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,062
Rym: They've done nothing with it.

405
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,633
Rym: Just like they did nothing with the waggle.

406
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:51,787
Rym: The last time they did anything was Four Swords and Crystal Chronicles with the GBA link cable.

407
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,470
Rym: I gotta reach back for glory.

408
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:02,134
Rym: And the greatest achievement in terms of proving an interesting path forward?

409
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,843
Rym: Most people consider those games a failure.

410
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,870
Rym: I think those people are wrong and kind of dumb.

411
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:11,539
Rym: Tiny side news too.

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,611
Rym: There's an article on Polygon that caught my eye a minute ago.

413
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,620
Rym: Zelda fans debate Sheik's gender.

414
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,061
Scott: What?

415
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,508
Scott: It's Princess Zelda in disguise.

416
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:21,870
Rym: Yeah, guys.

417
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,914
Rym: It's Zelda in disguise.

418
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,541
Scott: Have you not played Zelda 64?

419
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:33,566
Scott: I think that the title can't be true because if you don't know that Sheik is Zelda in disguise, you're not a Zelda fan.

420
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,613
Scott: He's not a real Zelda quote.

421
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:39,425
Rym: Sheik's gender is a surprisingly hot debate among Nintendo fans.

422
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:42,474
Scott: Is Samus gender a debate as well?

423
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,076
Rym: You know what?

424
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,645
Rym: It was when I was a kid and there was no Internet.

425
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:50,602
Rym: I remember when someone told me Samus Aaron was a girl and I said, "How do you

426
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:50,923
Rym: know?".

427
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:58,766
Rym: And the thing is they couldn't beat the game quickly enough to show me, so I didn't believe them until I went and found a picture of it.

428
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:08,056
Rym: Is Sheik, the mysterious character first introduced in The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time, a man or a woman?

429
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:14,682
Rym: The debate has begun again after Nintendo reveals that Sheik will be a playable character in the upcoming Hyrule Warriors.

430
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,932
Scott: Have you played Smash Brothers?

431
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:19,597
Rym: This article's amazing.

432
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:22,086
Scott: You don't even have to have played Zelda 64 to know this.

433
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:31,082
Rym: One person argues that, yes, it's Zelda, but it's Zelda dressing up as a man, therefore it's cross-dressing, blah, blah, blah, non-gender, binary, fluid, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, argument.

434
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:35,680
Rym: Therefore, it's better if you argue that Sheik physically transformed into a man.

435
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,144
Rym: So that's all fan garbage.

436
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:40,931
Rym: At the bottom, the Polygon article.

437
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:42,155
Rym: I'm just gonna read this.

438
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:51,640
Rym: This is "Sheik asked Nintendo if there was an official word on this, and they answered the call.

439
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,260
Rym: Nintendo's official line quoted from Nintendo's senior product marketing manager, Bill Trinen, is

440
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,262
Rym: this.".

441
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:01,389
Scott: Nintendo of America, not Nintendo of Japan?

442
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,260
Rym: Uh, Bill Trinen, so I think Nintendo of America.

443
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:04,681
Rym: Yeah.

444
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,109
Rym: I actually don't know which one he works for.

445
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,081
Scott: He could have hired an English dude in Japan or vice versa.

446
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,187
Rym: They could have, but I don't know.

447
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,012
Rym: I don't know Bill Trinen.

448
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:10,535
Rym: Anyway.

449
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,901
Rym: I've heard the name, but I haven't.

450
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:12,122
Scott: Anyway.

451
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:19,360
Rym: Quote, "The definitive answer is that Sheik is a woman, simply Zelda, in a different

452
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,861
Rym: outfit.".

453
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,742
Rym: You don't say.

454
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:22,404
Rym: You don't say.

455
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:23,245
Scott: You don't say.

456
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,697
Rym: So things of the day.

457
00:23:31,717 --> 00:23:35,283
Rym: You know the old game, high five?

458
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:38,476
Rym: Where you give someone a high five, and then you mess with them?

459
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:39,600
Scott: You mean slap me high?

460
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,041
Scott: Yeah.

461
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:40,483
Scott: Slap me low?

462
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,547
Rym: Down low, too slow?

463
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,535
Scott: Slap medium, slap me low, you too slow?

464
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:43,676
Rym: Yep.

465
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:44,700
Rym: All those kinds of things.

466
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:55,316
Rym: The interaction in middle school, or possibly elementary school, where the cool kid does this to the not cool kid, and the not cool kid gets flustered, and it's hilarious.

467
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,042
Rym: You know, that kind of thing.

468
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:01,874
Rym: This video, I don't know what to say about it, but Mr.

469
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:09,512
Rym: Ligandarius has presented an 18-second drama recorded entirely in vines of that experience.

470
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,917
Rym: This is amazing.

471
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,127
Scott: This is, we'll have to compete with my equally amazing thing of the day.

472
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:21,160
Scott: Three words, Russian duck farmer.

473
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:22,985
Scott: That's all I'm going to say.

474
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:23,828
Rym: It's pretty good.

475
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:26,458
Scott: It's a tough choice between mine and yours.

476
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,582
Scott: Excellent things of the day.

477
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:30,091
Scott: Today, perhaps of great vintage.

478
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,743
Rym: Perhaps we're back into the, we might be coming into a vintage year.

479
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:36,412
Rym: No longer do we just go to College Humor.

480
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:38,459
Scott: Those days are long past us.

481
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,471
Scott: I haven't stopped going to College Humor, which is part of the reason.

482
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,014
Rym: Thing is, as a result, I've been going to College Humor, and it's still consistently the best source of great videos.

483
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:45,395
Scott: Probably.

484
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:45,857
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,863
Scott: Other meta moments.

486
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:50,533
Rym: The Book Club book is The Canticle for Leibowitz.

487
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:53,242
Rym: I'm hoping Scott will read it on the flight to Seattle.

488
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:54,385
Scott: Maybe.

489
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,207
Scott: It's too nice out.

490
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:57,132
Scott: Yeah, too nice out on the plane flying to Seattle.

491
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,346
Scott: I guess I recharged my Kindle.

492
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,964
Rym: Yeah, actually just bought a, I found a book that purports to teach me Turkish.

493
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,196
Rym: that's relatively new, so I bought it on the Kindle.

494
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:10,920
Rym: I'm gonna try it out.

495
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,646
Scott: We'll see how much Turkish you learn.

496
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:17,241
Rym: I know more Turkish than most people in America who are not Turkish.

497
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,084
Scott: You don't say.

498
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:21,736
Scott: I know more Hebrew than most people in America.

499
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,923
Rym: Those ducks know more Russian than any of us.

500
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,026
Scott: That is true.

501
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:32,306
Rym: We are giving away two fucking tickets, four-day tickets, fuckers, to PAX Prime 2014.

502
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:32,627
Rym: Holy

503
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:38,347
Scott: shit, if you want to go to PAX Prime 2014 and you can get there on your own, and you can find a place to stay on your

504
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:41,579
Rym: own, and you can either give us your address or meet us at

505
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:50,212
Scott: PAX, and for some reason you didn't get tickets because maybe you were lazy and didn't buy them, or you were just slow, or you're bad at internet, or whatever.

506
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,317
Scott: You didn't listen to us.

507
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,329
Rym: I can no longer blame people for being lazy or slow.

508
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:54,932
Scott: I got them.

509
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:55,896
Scott: How come you couldn't get them?

510
00:25:55,956 --> 00:26:01,615
Rym: Scott and I saw that it went up at the same, like within seconds of each other.

511
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,401
Rym: We both jumped into the queue.

512
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:08,855
Rym: Scott bought as many four-day badges as he could, and I could not buy any.

513
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:11,382
Rym: However, I got the good hotel.

514
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:14,653
Scott: To get these two tickets, here's what you must do.

515
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:19,831
Scott: You must tweet on Twitter and shamelessly self-promote us GeekNights.

516
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:22,099
Scott: We need promotion, so here's how it works.

517
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:22,701
Scott: You make a tweet.

518
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:26,234
Scott: The tweet must contain the hashtag of PAX.

519
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,541
Scott: That way people who are looking at that hashtag will see it.

520
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:33,555
Scott: It must contain either the hashtag of GeekNights or @GeekNights.

521
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:43,260
Scott: If you use @GeekNights, do not make that the very first thing in the tweet, because then only we will see it, and other people who follow us and also follow you will see it, but no one else will see it.

522
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,852
Rym: Thus defeating the purpose of shameless self-promotion.

523
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:50,764
Scott: And it must contain a link to some sort of GeekNights content.

524
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:53,851
Scott: It could be one of our panel videos on YouTube.

525
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:59,404
Scott: It could be Geek episode, right?

526
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:11,480
Scott: It could be anything that is us to promote us, and you make that tweet sometime before the tickets arrive at my house, and then if you make more than one tweet, it won't help you.

527
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,387
Scott: It won't disqualify you, but it won't help you.

528
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,271
Scott: One tweet is enough.

529
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:16,440
Scott: More tweets are welcome.

530
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:21,114
Scott: Tweet all you want, but only one entry per person.

531
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:29,395
Rym: Because the more popular we get, I mean, we just spent like a thousand dollars on new microphones to do some awesome stuff, but we'll do that awesome stuff faster if you guys get us around more.

532
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:40,655
Scott: And then on that day, uh, sometime soon, I will search all those tweets and use random.org to pick one of the Twitter accounts, and those two tickets will go to that person.

533
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:45,112
Scott: If that person sells the tickets for money, you're a fucker and an asshole and a jerk.

534
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:49,610
Scott: I won't be able to stop you, but I'll be hella pissed, and I'll put your name on the shit list.

535
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:51,658
Rym: It's a short list, so watch out.

536
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,773
Scott: If I give you the tickets, I want to see you at PAX, like at our panel and go, "Hey, what's

537
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:54,934
Scott: up?".

538
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:55,376
Rym: Yeah.

539
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,277
Rym: So, in fact, if you come to our panel with those tickets, what panel would that be?

540
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,787
Rym: That would be, oh, I gotta go to the older news, archive news.

541
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,457
Rym: It is How to Win Every Game.

542
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:09,460
Scott: Every game.

543
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:16,040
Rym: The example games we list are games like Stratego, Settlers of Catan, or Football.

544
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,424
Rym: We're not even joking.

545
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,086
Scott: No, we're not.

546
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,896
Rym: Noon Monday, Sandworm Theater.

547
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:24,240
Scott: Sandworm Theater.

548
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,055
Rym: So, if you get the badges and you come to that panel and say hi.

549
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,541
Scott: Don't say the word Beetlejuice when you come.

550
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,588
Rym: But bring spice, though.

551
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:38,374
Rym: Can you think of a third Sandworm thing?

552
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:40,297
Rym: No.

553
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:40,958
Rym: Really?

554
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:41,900
Rym: Tremors?

555
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:42,948
Rym: No tremors?

556
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,016
Scott: I don't know what the hell that is.

557
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:44,580
Rym: Really?

558
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,207
Rym: Scout doesn't know what tremors is.

559
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,213
Scott: I don't know what you just said.

560
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:50,747
Rym: What rock do you live on top of?

561
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,737
Rym: Because if you lived under it, they would have gotten you by now.

562
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:53,200
Scott: Long Island.

563
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,890
Rym: So, beyond all that, oh, that's a bachelor party.

564
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,896
Rym: Do I have any other stuff?

565
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:01,137
Rym: Yes.

566
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:05,533
Rym: We've started streaming and uploading videos of us playing tabletop games.

567
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:07,280
Rym: So, a lot of you asked for that.

568
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:08,103
Rym: We did it.

569
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,939
Rym: If you liked it, spread it around, post it to Reddit, and we'll do more of it.

570
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,339
Rym: That's a good way to get into the GeekNights PAX Ticket Giveaway as well.

571
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,827
Rym: So, Curse of the Necrodancer.

572
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,520
Scott: So, this is a game I know has been coming for a long time.

573
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,144
Rym: Played it at a PAX.

574
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:26,575
Scott: I played it at a PAX like a minute, so it barely counts.

575
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:29,388
Rym: They had, and I feel like, well, we'll talk about it.

576
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:38,104
Rym: I feel like it was a little bit of disingenuous advertising, but they had it at PAX, and they had a dance pad set up, and there'd be people standing there dancing in front of the game.

577
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:38,545
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:43,899
Scott: So, this game, on paper, is a rhythm roguelike.

579
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,002
Scott: Oh, my God.

580
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,447
Scott: DDR plus roguelike.

581
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:53,613
Rym: You know, not just us, but people in general are big fans of the "What if you took Mega Man and mashed it up with

582
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:54,416
Rym: football?".

583
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:58,131
Scott: But, I mean, that particular combination is just so, well, there's Mega Man soccer.

584
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,700
Rym: That's what I was about to make a joke about.

585
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:06,706
Scott: That particular combination of roguelike and rhythm is just so, you can just imagine how amazing this game is going to be.

586
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:14,960
Scott: Walking through a dungeon, equipping items, fighting really hard bad guys, but also funky music, excellent soundtrack, moving around, up, down, left, right.

587
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,463
Scott: Oh, my God.

588
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:16,328
Scott: This has got to be the greatest.

589
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,601
Scott: You play it for like a minute, and you're like, "Oh, my God.

590
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,223
Scott: I can't believe

591
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:19,344
Scott: it.".

592
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:24,460
Scott: Finally, the pre-release of the game is on the Steam.

593
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,760
Rym: Pre, pre, pre, pre-release, alpha, nowhere near done.

594
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,161
Scott: Sure.

595
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,697
Scott: It's nowhere near done, but it's actually more done than you would think.

596
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:36,116
Scott: I think, like, the only thing that's missing is, like, final bosses and ending levels.

597
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:43,580
Rym: It's got plenty of levels and there's tons- It's missing UI stuff and polish and a few tweaks to the core conceit.

598
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,328
Scott: Well, I don't know if it's ever going to get this.

599
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,434
Rym: I don't think it will.

600
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:52,411
Scott: But, regardless, we both played it, and let's talk about it.

601
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,480
Rym: Yeah, Crypt of the NecroDancer is pretty fun.

602
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,362
Scott: Great name.

603
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:57,186
Rym: Yep.

604
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,009
Rym: Great music.

605
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:01,283
Scott: I have a feeling- I mean, the music isn't the greatest rhythm music, but it's still great.

606
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:05,480
Rym: The music reminds me so much of Super Hexagon's music.

607
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,362
Scott: Yeah, a little bit.

608
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:12,286
Rym: It's a little bit less- I don't know, but listen to it again without playing the game.

609
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:16,704
Rym: But someone told me, and I haven't tried to do this, that you can just put any song in there.

610
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:19,394
Scott: But it has to be the right rhythms.

611
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:19,996
Rym: Hellorb.

612
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,681
Rym: It'll figure out the beat, supposedly.

613
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,051
Rym: So much Hellorb.

614
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:27,093
Scott: Okay.

615
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:27,935
Scott: Mr.

616
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:28,336
Scott: Hellorb.

617
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,859
Rym: I'm not Hellorb.

618
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:30,360
Rym: You are.

619
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:35,698
Rym: So, basically, what it is, is it's a row-like where you play it in a rhythm.

620
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:42,543
Rym: So, it's almost like a row-like where instead of just you move and then, like, the world's turn happens because you took your turn.

621
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,513
Rym: Instead, turns happen every beat.

622
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:48,282
Scott: So, if you stand still, bad guys keep moving on the beat.

623
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,213
Scott: And you move on the beat.

624
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,737
Scott: You don't have to move on the beat.

625
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,247
Scott: You can't really move faster than the beat, right?

626
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:57,954
Scott: So, ideally, you move on the beats.

627
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,063
Scott: If you miss the beat, you don't really move.

628
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,805
Scott: It's like, oops.

629
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:05,823
Rym: Now, the game rewards you for continuing to move on the beat exactly.

630
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:07,370
Scott: You get a coin multiplier.

631
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,312
Scott: So, the coin multiplier basically means that when you kill guys, you're getting more and more monies, right?

632
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:16,611
Scott: So, when you go to the shop, you can buy pretty much everything if you have your coin multiplier up.

633
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,515
Rym: That's my problem.

634
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,483
Rym: I kind of want to dwell on the bad stuff first.

635
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:24,662
Rym: The problem with this game, fundamentally, is that the rhythm aspect of it matters very little.

636
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:26,647
Rym: That coin multiplier is it.

637
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,696
Rym: Except in a few rare cases.

638
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:35,396
Rym: Like when there's a shrine that you can activate and then you get hurt every time you miss the beat.

639
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:37,304
Rym: But you know what happens when that happens?

640
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,447
Rym: You just die.

641
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:43,383
Rym: I mean, most of the games... So, yes, the rhythm multiplier would be cool.

642
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:46,112
Rym: Except it only really is triggering when you have a fight.

643
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:51,632
Rym: A good chunk of all the play is walking around a mostly empty level exploring.

644
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:55,907
Rym: Staying on the rhythm during that time is boring and you're just gonna fuck it up.

645
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,637
Scott: And it's just a steady rhythm, right?

646
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:03,254
Scott: And it's not like you have to follow a particular pattern or hit different beats.

647
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:06,325
Scott: It's just keep pushing the arrows at this rhythm.

648
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:11,020
Scott: And different levels are... Later levels get faster and the rhythm is faster.

649
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:21,945
Scott: And this is kind of good because if the game was turn-based, the way you fight the bad guys, it would be trivial because you could sit there and think about each and every move and figure out the optimal move.

650
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:28,350
Scott: Because it makes you move fast, that's what makes you screw up because you don't have time to think and the bad guys are coming.

651
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:33,568
Scott: But in terms of it, it needs a little more DDR going on here.

652
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:37,704
Rym: Yeah, that's why I said in the early time when you see it set up and people are showing it off.

653
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:38,588
Scott: It seems amazing.

654
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:42,604
Rym: Because they have the dance pad out and you imagine it being a certain kind of thing.

655
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,011
Rym: The dance pad is an afterthought.

656
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,123
Rym: The dance pad does not really add to the game.

657
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:53,270
Scott: It's a different control aspect and it also makes the game a lot harder which is why they have dance pad mode which is basically easy mode.

658
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:57,428
Rym: But for example, Dance Dance Revolution, you're walking around the mat doing patterns.

659
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:03,668
Rym: This game, you're mostly going left, left, left, left, left, right, left, left, left.

660
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,634
Rym: It's really fucking tedious.

661
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:09,286
Rym: You can't even just leave your foot down to keep going left.

662
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:10,069
Rym: You have to keep tap.

663
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,667
Rym: So it's basically tap with your foot on a really inefficient bullshit controller.

664
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:18,621
Scott: As opposed to DDR which is like up, down, jump, both, left, left, left, right.

665
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:27,145
Rym: If the game had like combos like do a rhythm to cast a spell or a particular dance to do a thing.

666
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:30,138
Scott: All the items that you cast are basically two buttons at once.

667
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,853
Scott: So it'll tell you on the screen like for bomb, go down and left simultaneously.

668
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:38,052
Scott: So if you're using a game pad, you can't use the D-pad or the analog stick.

669
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:41,587
Scott: You have to use the four buttons on the right to control the game.

670
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:42,792
Rym: Or bind a combo button.

671
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:43,795
Scott: Yeah, which sucks.

672
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,900
Scott: You don't want to do that.

673
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,735
Rym: Yeah, now what I would have done is made the game more like eighth note patterns.

674
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,387
Rym: So on the beats, you move and do the normal game.

675
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:57,674
Rym: But if I want to use a potion, I should have to be like up left on an eighth note pattern to use the item instead.

676
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,763
Rym: That would have been cool but they don't do anything like that.

677
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:05,147
Scott: Now the other thing is the bad guys in this game, each bad guy has his own pattern of movement and attacking.

678
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,180
Scott: So you can learn each bad guy in the way to approach them.

679
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,049
Scott: For example, there's a green slime.

680
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,360
Scott: All you got to do is walk up and bump into it to kill it.

681
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,022
Scott: Pretty easy.

682
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:14,668
Scott: There's a blue slime.

683
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,294
Scott: The blue slime only moves up and down.

684
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,228
Scott: To kill him, you have to hit him from the left or the right.

685
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,762
Scott: If you approach him from the top or the bottom, he's probably going to hit you.

686
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:23,951
Scott: Unless you get your timing really right.

687
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,648
Scott: And then you know bosses and stuff come at you in even harder ways.

688
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:36,044
Scott: So it's like when the dragon comes, it's like you have to step away from the dragon, then step back at it, then hit it, then step away and go at it and hit it and so on.

689
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:38,676
Scott: It's like there's more complicated things you have to do.

690
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:48,435
Scott: There's a ghost that's like boo and he follows you around invisible but then you turn it and you got to turn around right when he's just behind you to get him to appear and stab him, right?

691
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:49,940
Scott: And you have to do this on the rhythm.

692
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:58,233
Scott: So when there's a room full of a bunch of different bad guys and you have to keep moving, it's not the easiest to think of like the exact right patterns.

693
00:35:58,273 --> 00:36:02,912
Scott: Like you can focus on one guy and then another guy is going to come over and kill you like the big dragon or something.

694
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:14,497
Scott: So you know the rhythm is good and then it forces you to, because if you could just sit there and think and assess all the bad guys and how they move, it would be trivially trivial and dumb.

695
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:18,114
Scott: You would never get hit and never die because you'd always be able to make the right move.

696
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:23,192
Rym: And I enjoy this that aspect of it a lot because it is not even analogous to DDR.

697
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:24,477
Rym: It's not even the same realm.

698
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:29,291
Rym: It's just a you don't have time to think roguelike.

699
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:34,347
Rym: The other problem I have with the game is that it does a very poor job of Mega Man X-ing.

700
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,518
Rym: It does not tell you fuck all about what things do.

701
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:43,718
Rym: but in rogue and roguelikes that's fine because you sit there and think like I do a thing.

702
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,565
Rym: What the fuck did that weird thing do?

703
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:52,570
Rym: In this game because it's moving so fast, unless you read a fact, you will never know how the weapons actually work.

704
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,785
Scott: The only way to learn anything is to learn the bad guy movements.

705
00:36:56,825 --> 00:37:00,083
Scott: They have a little training mode where you can go and practice against all the different bad guys.

706
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:03,418
Scott: You have to unlock the guy who does that for you by playing.

707
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,653
Scott: And there's another one where you can unlock bosses to practice against them.

708
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:09,245
Scott: To unlock that you need to get diamonds and shit.

709
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:18,383
Scott: So it's like you can't get the practice mode to learn the game for the different bad guys and their movements until you get kind of far in the game and have probably beaten those guys.

710
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:30,162
Rym: And also a lot of the game is very unrhythmic in the sense that the patterns of the monsters are sort of mitigated by the fact that you can dig up pretty much any wall.

711
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:40,662
Rym: So the game is very open and you spend a lot of time backtracking through empty areas which is super boring especially because you've got your coin combo going and you want to just keep it going.

712
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:51,156
Rym: So you got to be like left, left and follow the rhythm perfectly and then you'll a lot of backtracking through boring empty areas even in harder higher levels.

713
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:55,632
Scott: I think part of the game is sort of trying to be like spelunky in a way.

714
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,920
Rym: Yeah it reminded me a lot of spelunky.

715
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,394
Scott: Where it's like okay the stages are kind of small right.

716
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:02,680
Scott: They're sort of randomly generated.

717
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,890
Scott: They have a few areas and a few aspects in common.

718
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,000
Scott: There's always a shop with some random items.

719
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:17,456
Scott: There's always going to be certain numbers of rooms with bad guys and a treasure chest maybe and maybe a key and you know it's like okay do you just rush for the exit?

720
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,303
Scott: Do you try to beat all the bad guys?

721
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:30,503
Scott: Do you you know try to get certain items and things you know and it's like doesn't have as much stuff as spelunking but it has bombs which spelunky has and it also has the shop and whatever.

722
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:33,776
Scott: So you know I think they're hoping that you know.

723
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,524
Scott: people are going to try to do the same thing with this.

724
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:48,635
Scott: they did with spelunky like trying to perfect it trying to unlock secret stuffs trying to do easter eggs speed runs all that sort of stuff which you could do that with this game but it wouldn't be as good as spelunky until a lot more is added.

725
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:52,427
Scott: Spelunky is mad polished after being released on like a zillion different platforms.

726
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,744
Rym: So I don't know this game like if I had to say in some.

727
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:58,808
Rym: now it's not done yet.

728
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:05,856
Rym: I don't think and I think you agreed when you hinted this earlier it's never going to get the the highest level of polish like.

729
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:06,880
Rym: I don't see that happening.

730
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,467
Scott: There's no way it's like.

731
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:17,101
Scott: unless they keep working on this thing for years which I don't see happening it's not going to reach like the spelunky level but it's definitely going to be better than it is now.

732
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:22,235
Scott: but I don't see them changing the core conceit and adding more rhythmness to it.

733
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:39,371
Rym: So if I had my dream game it would be a game where you hold a controller to move around and you dance on a dance pad to do things like almost like robotron controls but it's moving with the hands and casting spells by doing complex combos with the feet.

734
00:39:39,793 --> 00:40:01,593
Scott: What I would actually like to make is a pure rhythm game where it's just ddr but the visualization of the game right you know like when you're playing regular ddr the visualization just the arrows yeah and the guy dancing in the right and and you can see him going through the dungeon.

735
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:08,517
Scott: and as long as you keep hitting perfect the guy goes through the dungeon nicely and if you you know mess up playing ddr.

736
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,244
Scott: the visualization is not so good.

737
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:12,273
Scott: you get hit when you make a mistake.

738
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:13,900
Rym: oh you don't even have to be a visualization.

739
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,964
Rym: imagine going between the two.

740
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:24,138
Rym: imagine if the the dungeon in one of these levels in this game was very linear and you're playing it and the enemy's patterns are all sort of.

741
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,724
Rym: basically you have to the pattern.

742
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:26,527
Rym: that's perfect.

743
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,193
Rym: there's no like empty spaces.

744
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:32,391
Rym: you're just going through stuff monsters and the dance pattern is always the same.

745
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:36,728
Rym: don't make it randomly generated necessarily and you've got to just like play perfectly through it.

746
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,962
Rym: but also you know what it doesn't do anything with you.

747
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,167
Rym: either get the rhythm or you don't.

748
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,637
Rym: there's no like gradation there.

749
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:54,304
Rym: what if every day if you hit the rhythm so perfectly like the perfect in ddr you got like a 1.1 to x damage got a good.

750
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:57,537
Rym: maybe it's 0.8 x damage like it doesn't do anything like that?

751
00:40:57,557 --> 00:40:58,340
Rym: i don't think it ever will.

752
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,344
Scott: hmm that would be good.

753
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,000
Scott: yeah there's a lot of this and the rhythm is always steady right on the beats.

754
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,833
Scott: there's some things that'll speed it up and slow it down sure but within a single level the rhythm doesn't change unless you fall into a trap or something that messes with it.

755
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:16,231
Scott: why not have the rhythm actually follow like the melody a bit right so it.

756
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:24,578
Scott: you know the game would be like move move move move move move move move move instead of move move move move move move.

757
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:32,011
Scott: you know it would be a lot more interesting that way because you know you had to sort of sit around in the opening part of the game get a feel for the song.

758
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,461
Scott: you know there would be certain times like you'd be like all right.

759
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:38,419
Scott: wait for the bunch of movement then approach the room full of bad guys on this beat.

760
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:53,600
Rym: you might get caught by surprise when the suddenly you know there's a there's an awesome does have pretty good co-op in the sense that you just play together and it's actually really fun.

761
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:59,125
Scott: but if you get to the edge of the map you're sort of stuck yep and it doesn't do any split screen or anything interesting.

762
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:07,040
Rym: and if you die well fuck you just sit there and wait for your friend to beat the level or die and the game over because it's a roguelike you're dead you're dead.

763
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:20,868
Scott: yep i'd say it has a bit of the rogue legacy though where when you die any diamonds you got other things don't matter but any diamonds you got can be used in the lobby to buy stuff but if you don't use them you lose them.

764
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:25,001
Scott: so you can't build up diamonds over time sort of like rogue legacy.

765
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:39,227
Scott: yeah uh and you can use that to buy things in the shops that either you know put items into chests in the dungeon to make the chest better or permanent upgrades like more heart containers just period stuff like that.

766
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:44,926
Rym: so if i had to rate this game in terms of fun it's about the same level as the binding of isaac?

767
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:46,713
Scott: yeah by the same level.

768
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:51,732
Rym: it's the kind of idle game that i like playing my laptop with my fingers while i'm waiting for an airplane.

769
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:53,558
Scott: it's not an ftl level.

770
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,775
Rym: yeah uh speaking of which i've been playing a lot of ftl.

771
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:00,804
Scott: still you don't say people were talking.

772
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:07,688
Scott: i heard some rumblings right not of anything actually happening in terms of an official thing but just you know fan made.

773
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,058
Scott: they were typing in fan made ftl board game.

774
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:13,427
Rym: but also i've been talking about that.

775
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,877
Rym: i've started prototyping an ftl board game.

776
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:22,476
Scott: someone else is talking fan made ftl tabletop rpg using torchbearer ish kind of rules.

777
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:23,378
Rym: yeah that would be.

778
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,006
Rym: that would be the fucking bomb.

779
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:27,981
Rym: that's what i'm saying especially because then you take those like the care.

780
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,267
Scott: would it be the fire bomb?

781
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,476
Rym: you take the character sheet inventory tetris.

782
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:33,825
Scott: i'll be i'll be mantis man and you couple it.

783
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:37,980
Rym: you can be stone man but you couple it with the ship's inventory tetris.

784
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:41,573
Rym: yep oh my god there's so many possibilities there.

785
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:42,517
Scott: i'm mantis man.

786
00:43:42,677 --> 00:43:43,280
Scott: that's all i'm saying.

787
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,933
Rym: you really have to read more culture books scott.

788
00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:49,320
Rym: that's all i'm gonna say this mantis man.

789
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:50,224
Rym: uh i'm just.

790
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:51,570
Rym: there's so many things.

791
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,182
Scott: i'm sure if you're in the culture you can just become a mantis man.

792
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:55,226
Rym: who's gonna stop you?

793
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:57,434
Rym: there's that guy who he's he?

794
00:43:57,514 --> 00:44:00,264
Rym: he's the ambassador to the species called the affront.

795
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:01,548
Scott: they're mantises.

796
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,497
Rym: no they're just the worst but he's like.

797
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:07,951
Rym: he kind of likes them even though they're the worst and he's kind of like me.

798
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,156
Scott: are they worse than azad?

799
00:44:09,177 --> 00:44:12,344
Rym: uh you have no idea.

800
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,209
Scott: that's why i'm asking.

801
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,756
Rym: that's pretty tame compared to the affront.

802
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:17,498
Rym: are?

803
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:22,695
Rym: i'll put it this way they were found by the like normal civilizations.

804
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:30,798
Rym: the big guys and they were like you motherfuckers are an affront to existence and this civilization liked that name so much.

805
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:32,664
Rym: they adopted it as their own name.

806
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:39,927
Rym: awesome and this culture guy's like kind of want to become an affronter and everyone else is like what the fuck is wrong with you.

807
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:43,178
Rym: but there's mantis men too.

808
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:45,024
Rym: yeah mantis man they're not that they.

809
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:48,880
Scott: uh they're not that great mantis men in ftl though are the best.

810
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:52,272
Rym: i'm more a fan of a bunch of rock men to be honest.

811
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:53,779
Scott: uh all right let's get in a fight.

812
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,025
Scott: you're mantis man you're rock man.

813
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:56,853
Rym: i just got my mantis man all right.

814
00:44:56,873 --> 00:44:58,841
Rym: fine you know what rock man mantis man.

815
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:01,088
Rym: i'll just cut the oxygen in the room.

816
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:02,152
Rym: that's fine.

817
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,540
Scott: we're fighting inside my med bay on my ship.

818
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:14,337
Rym: yeah you should play ftl advance because one thing you can start as is the mantis ship that doesn't really have a lot of weapons and you just teleport guys over and fuck shit up.

819
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,708
Rym: yes the whole game is killing people.

820
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:22,795
Scott: yes but then you get it's so much easier if you can board people because then you get to steal their ship and upgrade really fast.

821
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:25,367
Rym: the game's an easy mode and then you get some anti-bio beams.

822
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:29,082
Rym: you're also shooting deadly stuff at their ship but that doesn't hurt mantis.

823
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:30,306
Scott: men it's good times.

824
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,641
Rym: so uh yeah hopefully we'll keep doing shows right up until packs.

825
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:42,360
Rym: but uh the week of packs there's gonna be no shows at all because if you don't live in the u.s.

826
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:48,045
Scott: this is labor day weekend which is a holiday you don't know about but it's always the first weekend of september.

827
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,719
Scott: so we're going to Rym's gonna be going to packs like way earlier than me.

828
00:45:51,739 --> 00:46:02,852
Rym: me and emily are flying out to packs on tuesday because we're going to PAX dev first then scott's joining us we're all going to the sky high tabletop charity as vips and then we're going not because we're actually vips but just because we paid for that.

829
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:07,953
Rym: yes you realize most people who are vips paid for that or are friends with people who run whatever.

830
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:08,555
Rym: that is.

831
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,422
Rym: yeah in a general sense not this thing.

832
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:13,531
Rym: just in general vip means money or nepotism.

833
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:20,689
Rym: in this case money yes and then packs for four days and then we're flying back like the tuesday after pack.

834
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:27,165
Rym: so we're gonna be gone for a is like tomorrow i think.

835
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,373
Rym: uh-huh i'm going to pack sauce.

836
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:33,372
Scott: okay i don't know if scott is so i don't think it's gonna happen like yeah i'm gonna go somewhere else.

837
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,620
Rym: should we kick start you going?

838
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,250
Scott: someone else gives me a whole pile of money.

839
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,863
Rym: i'll just why did you just kick start like you going and doing the panels?

840
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,452
Scott: because that's not a thing you can kick start.

841
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:42,136
Scott: yes it is.

842
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,462
Scott: you do it then i'm not doing it.

843
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:44,565
Rym: the result of the kick start?

844
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,290
Rym: well i i can just pay to go.

845
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:49,320
Scott: you you kick start me going.

846
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:50,203
Rym: why would i do that?

847
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:54,156
Rym: i'll kick start me going and i'll just pocket that money.

848
00:46:54,176 --> 00:47:00,319
Scott: if anyone's just mad rich living in australia and you got money to burn send me some monies and maybe i'll go.

849
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:03,451
Rym: the good news is as a result i submitted a panel that i've always.

850
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:04,435
Rym: we did it.

851
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:05,439
Rym: we never videoed it.

852
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,074
Rym: i thought it was a great lecture so i rewrote it and i want to do it again.

853
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,560
Rym: scott wants nothing to do with this.

854
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:12,125
Rym: so that's what i'm hoping to do.

855
00:47:12,186 --> 00:47:12,808
Rym: a pack sauce.

856
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:13,932
Rym: great it's.

857
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:15,257
Rym: the losing should be fun.

858
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:16,663
Scott: uh you and your losing should be fun.

859
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:18,712
Rym: i think that was one of our better better lectures.

860
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:24,016
Rym: i think it was way better than the other unvideoed one the egregiously unrealized potential.

861
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:27,969
Rym: that one was not good that one was better than money-making games.

862
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:34,812
Rym: i think maybe i like that one because it was basically the end was 20 minutes of us going contento.

863
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:37,482
Scott: what the fuck the thing we just did just now.

864
00:47:37,662 --> 00:47:45,809
Rym: yes also that was the one where we got to talk a lot about how bionic commander rearmed was the true sequel and the actual sequel failed.

865
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:47,976
Scott: everyone knows that.

866
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:50,165
Rym: a lot of people don't seem to know what happened there.

867
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,615
Rym: yeah i remember we pulled up the sales figures.

868
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:53,700
Rym: the audience was like what.

869
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:57,223
Rym: so yeah see you guys at packs.
