1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,189
Rym: It's Thursday, October 20th, 2022.

2
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:17,040
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is the GeekNights Book Club.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,560
Rym: Tonight we are talking about The Binti Trilogy by Nnedi Okorofo.

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,598
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:33,520
Scott: So, uh, there was a news recently that, uh, The Phantom of the Opera was going to close on Broadway.

6
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:35,424
Scott: Which has been running, right?

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:40,317
Scott: I mean, I think the show is as old as 1986, but it's in New York since, like, '89, maybe?

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,240
Rym: I mean, I saw it at the Pantages twice.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,740
Scott: In Detroit?

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,674
Rym: Yeah, actually, no, that's in Canada.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,737
Scott: Oh, in Canada.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,360
Rym: We would often, for a lot of reasons, we would head over to Canada to see shows instead of seeing them in Detroit.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,100
Scott: I mean, you know, it's the same, you know, usually when there's a traveling show, it's the same, this one cast goes around the country, right?

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,860
Scott: So, wherever you see it, if it's not, if you're not seeing it in a place where there's a centralized theater like Broadway, West End, et cetera, right?

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,480
Scott: A foreign country, then you're seeing, you know, the same show is going to be in Seattle and Chicago, right?

16
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,800
Scott: So, they just go around.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,505
Scott: Um, so anyway, it was closing.

18
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:25,274
Scott: Now, I had seen it on Broadway in 1990x, right?

19
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:34,300
Rym: You know, I think I also saw it in Detroit because I saw it three times in two different theaters.

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,999
Scott: But you never saw it in New York.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,939
Rym: Never saw it in New York.

22
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,480
Scott: Well, you know, it's very different if you see it in New York.

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,299
Rym: I mean, sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,440
Scott: No, this is, no, this is definitely different because not having seen it in New York, right, a lot of the show is built into the theater.

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,898
Rym: Oh, you mean like the chandelier that's over the audience that comes crashing down almost into the audience.

26
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:54,400
Rym: that happens?

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,500
Scott: I mean, that is one major component, but there are others besides that.

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,320
Rym: Because like Les Mis, even the Detroit show in the old days had the rotating stage.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,360
Scott: Rotating floor is very important for that show.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,499
Rym: Which the new Les Mis apparently does not have, so I have no desire to see it.

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,300
Scott: No.

32
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,620
Scott: But anyway, so, I mean, Phantom has a whole bunch of other shit.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,300
Scott: It's got moving staircases in the back, it's got a hole in the floor the guy jumps into, it's got the descent, you know, I guess spoilers.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,920
Rym: I remember all those things happening in the shows I saw, and weirdly, the one in Canada was the same as the one in Detroit, as far as I can remember.

35
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,316
Scott: Anyway, so, it was closing, right, and Amanda never saw it.

36
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:32,260
Scott: Ever.

37
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:36,379
Scott: And I'm like, well, I'm like, well, why the fuck, we can just walk over there.

38
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,980
Scott: It's right there, it's not, you know, there'll be a bunch of tourists, but whatever.

39
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,720
Scott: So I went over and saw it, and I was like, you know, I saw this in the 90s, and it was, you know, terrific.

40
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:49,268
Scott: But it's like, who's the cast now?

41
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:53,420
Scott: Just some, you know, life Broadway employee, you know, cast people, right?

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,440
Scott: Who are obviously going to be talented at singing and dancing, but it's not like ultra-famous people or anything, you know.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,819
Scott: And I'm like, they do this show, they've performed this show in that theater tens of thousands of times, right?

44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,160
Scott: And it's like, you know, A, goddamn, that's hard work to do all that, what a pain in the ass.

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:20,480
Rym: Like, even imagine us, like, it takes some effort to do an hour of being animated on a stage, doing a panel where we mostly ad-lib everything.

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,919
Rym: Imagine doing that, like, every day.

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,100
Scott: Sometimes twice, almost every day, like, they take one day off a week, but some days they do it twice.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:37,519
Scott: It's like, Jesus Christ, what a pain in the ass it is to do that fucking show that much, right, for that many years, without stopping, right?

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,243
Scott: It's like, holy shit.

50
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:44,720
Scott: And it's like, so how much effort are they really going to put into any one performance, right?

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,489
Scott: Are they giving it 100% every time?

52
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,580
Scott: It's like, no way, not a chance, right?

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,019
Scott: So I'm thinking like, well, you know, I'm just going to bring someone who's never seen it while there's still a chance to do so.

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,960
Scott: The London show, post-pandemic, when it came back, came back in a reduced fashion, right?

55
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:09,820
Scott: The New York one is the only one I know of on Earth that is still doing the complete original production.

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,360
Scott: Though there are rumors that after it closes, it may eventually come back in a reduced fashion.

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,380
Rym: Oh, definitely, just like Les Mis did, like Les Mis is the pattern now.

58
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,435
Scott: Man, it's going to come back, but this thing has been going since 1980-something, right?

59
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,058
Scott: Oh, it's been going longer than a lot of people have been alive, right?

60
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,780
Scott: You know, but I haven't seen the thing since last millennia, right?

61
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,820
Scott: So I'm going in with, you know, the expectation is that, yeah, the show is good, the music will be great, right?

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,707
Scott: You know, the instrumental music.

63
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:42,755
Scott: But I don't know how well these people sing.

64
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,860
Scott: I assume they'll sing well.

65
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,400
Rym: I'm imagining this leads to it blowing you away because it was full effort.

66
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:55,720
Scott: It's not full effort, you know, but even if it's not full effort, that show still fucking kicks ass.

67
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:56,076
Scott: Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,229
Scott: That show is so good, right?

69
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:02,078
Scott: There's a reason it was there for 30-something years, right?

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:11,300
Scott: Even, you know, I mean, you know, talented people giving it 80%, it's like, fuck yeah, Phantom of the Opera is awesome.

71
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:17,660
Scott: If you have a chance, it's not going to be hard to get tickets, even though it was more crowded in there than I expected.

72
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:22,540
Scott: Obviously, lots of tourists and students and that kind of group, you know, old people.

73
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,580
Scott: But if you have the opportunity or can make the opportunity, it's going to close like in February.

74
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:36,280
Scott: And if you've never seen it, get your ass down there because it'll go away and that'll be it, right?

75
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,279
Scott: You'll never have a chance.

76
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:47,400
Scott: I also want to say, you know, revisiting the story of Phantom of the Opera, right, not having thought about it much in a long time, right?

77
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,180
Scott: Adult Scott now sees the story somewhat differently.

78
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,198
Rym: I can see that.

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,680
Scott: My current interpretation is that basically the Phantom is like this incel dude, right?

80
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:01,278
Rym: Oh, absolutely.

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,795
Scott: The Phantom is just a cranky incel guy, right?

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,269
Scott: And he happens to be talented at many things, right?

83
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,200
Scott: Like, you know, music and, you know, science and whatnot, right?

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,739
Scott: He's a talented, intelligent person, but he's, you know, an incel with low self-esteem because of his deformity.

85
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:30,100
Rym: But also, I always comfort him as a character who ends up blaming the problems he causes himself on that to a degree.

86
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:34,220
Scott: Right, the moral of the show, spoilers, the moral of the story.

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,940
Scott: Phantom doesn't win.

88
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:36,597
Scott: Right, well, obviously.

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,697
Scott: Is that he's like, "No one will love me because I'm

90
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:40,020
Scott: ugly.".

91
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:44,358
Scott: And then she's just basically like, "No, I don't like you because you're fucking evil murdering

92
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:44,719
Scott: people.".

93
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,358
Scott: That's why.

94
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,939
Rym: If you had just, like, helped me sing better.

95
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,494
Scott: Your soul is dark, not your face, right?

96
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:52,920
Scott: And that's the moral, right?

97
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:02,320
Scott: And I'm like, you know, in the concept of incels not being a, I mean, they were a thing, but the word, you know, that wasn't in the, you know, cultural consciousness.

98
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,720
Scott: But now that it is, it's like, oh, that's another reason this show has held up for so many years because it's so fucking true.

99
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,460
Rym: It gave voice to that specific archetype of problem person.

100
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:24,800
Scott: Yeah, so the other thing about the show I think that really makes it last a long time is that it's cool, right?

101
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,157
Scott: It's other Broadway shows, even the long-lasting ones, have a lot less coolness factor to them.

102
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,420
Rym: The set pieces, like that scene in the end with, like, the people climbing down the big, like...

103
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,300
Scott: Well, that's the very end.

104
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,480
Rym: Yeah, the cage thing, all those, like, just spectacle pieces.

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,520
Scott: Right, but it's like, you know, Les Mis is kind of cool, Cats is not that kind of, not that cool, right?

106
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,400
Scott: It's like a lot of, the aesthetic of a lot of shows doesn't have, you know, sort of that badass darkness aspect to them, right?

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,300
Scott: You know, Titanic's not really cool, right?

108
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,319
Scott: You know, the Disney ones, they're Disney ones.

109
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,440
Rym: You know what actually had that pretty well was the Jekyll and Hyde.

110
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:05,980
Scott: Yeah, that was an okay one, right, in terms of coolness.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,900
Rym: Yeah, the relevant story was, like, they were really stretching what little there is to that story to make a musical that long.

112
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, that's the other thing, Phantom isn't that long, right?

113
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:19,620
Scott: They have this original book, right, and they don't stretch it.

114
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,171
Scott: They're just like, "This is what we gotta work with,".

115
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,440
Scott: and there it is, right?

116
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,319
Scott: And after the intermission, there's not much left, right?

117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,300
Scott: It's like, you get the intermission, and then the second part is not that long, right?

118
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,684
Scott: It's like, "The

119
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:29,826
Scott: end."

120
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,049
Scott: All right, so yeah, if you can see it, go see it.

121
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,860
Scott: It holds up perfectly well.

122
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,080
Scott: No Ozymandias here, right?

123
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,300
Scott: It's still a full statue with no ruins, you know?

124
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,437
Rym: And you look, and you're like, "Yeah, look at

125
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:47,618
Rym: that."

126
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:52,160
Rym: Especially because there are enough people on Earth who can sing that one note.

127
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:59,300
Rym: All right, so Binti, the Book Club book.

128
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:09,139
Rym: I picked Binti, but we're gonna talk about the entire Binti series, because it is a trilogy, and it is about as long-- It is three tiny books.

129
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:21,319
Rym: Yep, it is about as long as a short-ish novel as a whole, and I've already forgotten exactly where the first book ends and the second book ends, because it's so short and so much happens.

130
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:25,340
Scott: Yeah, the three books are so short individually.

131
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,726
Scott: I'd say an hour each, right?

132
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,580
Scott: It's like three chapters of The Tale of Genji, basically.

133
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,960
Scott: And combined, it's still a short book, right?

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,599
Scott: Even if you put them all together.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:10:00,754
Scott: But despite the short length and word count, page count, however you want to measure it, and the speed at which you can read the whole thing, the amount of stuff that happens, the amount of characters, the amount of meaning, the amount of everything that is in there, is just as much stuff as you would get in some full-ass thousand page, and I didn't feel like--.

136
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:11,740
Rym: Oh, no, because it is dense with content and allegory and meaning, but every sentence advances something that you're interested in.

137
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,340
Rym: There is not a wasted word in this book.

138
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:20,480
Scott: Right, it's dense without being heavy or difficult to get through.

139
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,799
Scott: It's not dense like the Silmarillion.

140
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,860
Scott: Right, it's not dense like you're walking through a bog.

141
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:36,953
Scott: It's dense like there is a cheesecake which is rich in flavor, but it is light and fluffy, and you eat the whole thing really quickly and don't feel full, but it was still tasted of richness.

142
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:40,839
Scott: It's still a cheesecake.

143
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:49,860
Rym: So I got to say, irrespective of the GeekNights book club, if you have not read the Binti trilogy yet, we're going to spoil everything in it.

144
00:10:50,661 --> 00:11:00,239
Scott: We don't remember where one ended and one began, so if you've only read one book or two books, then I can't promise I'm talking about something from only book one or something like that.

145
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,299
Rym: Though at the same time, it would be very hard as a human to have read just that first book and not immediately read the first page of the next book.

146
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:14,020
Scott: I'm glad that we only started this after all three books were available, so that I was able to immediately go and get two and then three.

147
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:24,820
Rym: Yup, so we're going to spoil everything, and also I will just say that these are fantastic books, and I urge everyone listening to this, if you have not read it, just go read it.

148
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,840
Scott: If you're a nerd, if you're listening to this, you're going to like it, right?

149
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Rym: Yup, you're going to have a lot of thoughts about it, you're going to have a lot to say about it, you'll have a lot of opinions.

150
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:51,280
Scott: If you have not yet acquired the books and are going to do so in a legal fashion, I guess the cheapest would be a used bookstore, but if you're using some other method like buying ebooks or brand new books, look for some sort of box set or something, or a three-in-one, you'll probably save some money.

151
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,860
Scott: If you buy one, then two, then three, you might end up losing a couple dollars.

152
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,940
Rym: So, 100% recommendation, like this is a top-tier book.

153
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:12,134
Scott: Well, I mean, yes, 100% recommendation, but I have almost nothing negative to say about the books, can I point to anything that's bad about them?

154
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:12,980
Scott: Not really.

155
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,860
Scott: But, they're not like fucking masterpieces.

156
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,920
Rym: Well, I'm not saying this is in the top ten books of all time written by humans.

157
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,780
Scott: It's weird, it's like, can you name any flaws?

158
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:24,282
Scott: No.

159
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:28,980
Scott: Well then, shouldn't it be an S-tier all-time great masterpiece like fucking Shakespeare or something?

160
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:29,964
Scott: No.

161
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:30,389
Scott: Right?

162
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:42,739
Rym: But in terms, I would say, in terms of the GeekNights Book Club, it is in the S-tier of, just read it, don't even worry, just read it, no matter what, no matter who you are, there's no one who should not read this book.

163
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:47,037
Scott: Yeah, an illiterate person should learn to read this book.

164
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,183
Rym: Exactly.

165
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:54,460
Rym: But also, the reason, not just for spoilers, but we're going to, it's the GeekNights Book Club, it's a book club.

166
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,920
Rym: The whole point of a book club is that you talk about the book with all the people who've read the book.

167
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:07,860
Rym: So, to remind all of you, because, you know, the Genji really set us back on book clubs for a while, we're going to talk about this book like you have also read it.

168
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
Rym: We're not going to explain the plot.

169
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Rym: We're assuming you have read the same words that we have read, and now we are reacting to and interpreting those words.

170
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:24,940
Rym: So, it's not just, oh, we're going to spoil everything, which, the book has some radical twists that often happen mid-sentence along the way.

171
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,600
Rym: This book is like, alright, I see where this is going, I see where this is going, then you read a sentence and you're like, wait, what?

172
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,480
Rym: You almost back up and read the sentence again because now everything's changed.

173
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:45,500
Rym: And that happens at least three or four times over the course of, there are revelations that are, I guess the scope of it grows with every chapter in ways that you won't expect.

174
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:52,380
Scott: So, let's talk about it, I guess, in a not spoilery way for a brief time, right, as we usually do.

175
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,500
Scott: So, what the hell is Binti about?

176
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,440
Scott: Well, it's this person who is, you know, of college age, I guess, right?

177
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,618
Scott: You know, I guess late teens.

178
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,186
Rym: I think she's 16 or 17, living in Africa somewhere.

179
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,380
Rym: And it's not exactly clear when.

180
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:18,880
Scott: Well, on a planet that is some, right, you know, it isn't explicitly Earth, right, it's some planet, right?

181
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:23,340
Scott: In a multi-planet galactic society of some kind.

182
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:39,280
Rym: Yep, you do get more specific details later in the book, especially when you get some flashbacks, but when it's presented, you're just presented with this person in this culture in a time that is definitely the future compared to the kind of time we live in now.

183
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,700
Scott: Yeah, it's a sci-fi, futur-y, space travel kind of place.

184
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,540
Rym: Yeah, like, they have cell phones and internet, but they're obviously more advanced and special than what we have today.

185
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:59,374
Scott: Right, and the culture that this person is a part of, right, is a special and important culture that basically makes cell phones, right?

186
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,800
Scott: No one else, no other cultures or societies can make smartphones.

187
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:19,832
Scott: Therefore, because of their ability to be the ones who make those, their culture endures and sustains, despite being kind of a minority, and the society is largely dominated by another culture.

188
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,475
Scott: that are sort of colonizers, kinda?

189
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Scott: A little bit, right?

190
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:31,280
Scott: They largely run the show in this area, though not in the galaxy, but on the planet.

191
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:45,899
Rym: Yeah, it's very much apparent that the Himba that the main character comes from are a traditional culture that is, to a significant degree, oppressed by and exploited by this larger culture that is sort of in the cities surrounding them.

192
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:55,060
Scott: Yeah, and both of the cultures are sort of conservative in their own different ways and advanced more or less in different ways, right?

193
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,446
Scott: You know, with good aspects and bad aspects, right?

194
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:05,560
Scott: They're just different people with different ideals, different ways, different traditions, different everything.

195
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,019
Rym: Yep, not necessarily good or bad.

196
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,959
Scott: They live near each other and somewhat depend on each other.

197
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,500
Rym: Just different and complex.

198
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,393
Scott: Yes, but the Himba are very much outnumbered in their geographic area, right?

199
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:17,974
Scott: By a lot.

200
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,780
Scott: They're not the government.

201
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,201
Scott: Yep.

202
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:32,239
Rym: So, the main character, Binti, basically gets accepted to the Space College, and the Space College, Umsa University, is described as- Basically, they were eleven.

203
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,720
Scott: Yep, but- Literally.

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:55,115
Rym: Yeah, like, imagine there are countless alien species and, like, the most ridiculous post-Star Trek universe you can imagine, and the smartest beings in the entire galaxy go to this one university, it's the most exclusive place there is, and Binti is not just- like, humans definitely attend this university.

205
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:55,917
Rym: They're the minority.

206
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,039
Rym: There are not many humans there.

207
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,165
Scott: There's not many anything there.

208
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:03,680
Scott: It's a lot- it's a few members of every different, you know, sentient alien species.

209
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,960
Rym: Yep, but there has never been a member of her culture there, ever.

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,288
Scott: Right, well, it's sort of, you know, against her culture, right?

211
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,618
Scott: It's like, you know, she applied to there in secret, you know?

212
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:23,480
Rym: A family vaguely disapproving, and she sneaks off in the night and gets on a spaceship and goes to the university with a full ride, basically.

213
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,117
Scott: Yep, and then adventure happens.

214
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,571
Rym: And adventure happens suddenly, like, a couple ch- like- Yep.

215
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,644
Scott: There's not a lot of pages.

216
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:36,000
Scott: It happens on the next- she takes off, and then adventure happens immediately.

217
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,664
Rym: Yep.

218
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,600
Scott: So, uh- Terrifying adventure.

219
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:51,700
Scott: Seriously, from this point forward, major, major spoilers, so, I literally had to, like- It's hard to talk about the plot- in such a short set of books, it's hard to talk about the plot beyond page, like, two, and not spoil everything.

220
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,187
Rym: Yep, but what I would say is that what's interesting about how, like, the scope of the book expands.

221
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:06,440
Rym: suddenly, like, every chapter or two, there's something you learn that greatly expands the scope of what is going on, and, like, what is at play.

222
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,679
Scott: Especially at the very, very end.

223
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:09,699
Scott: Oh, yeah.

224
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:25,940
Scott: The end of the third book, it's like, you know, after, like, the major climax, it's like the sort of epilogue denouement at the finale is, like, just vastly expands the scope of what, you know, and makes everything that happened previous look small.

225
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:29,000
Scott: But I guess- In, like, just two or three pages.

226
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:49,740
Rym: These explosions of scope are definitely direct allegory to the themes of the book, and also the literal reality of what is happening to the characters, because as Binti goes to college and learns about the world, you also have this sort of backfilling of everything has a more complex deal than it appeared at first.

227
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,882
Rym: Literally everything.

228
00:18:50,962 --> 00:19:04,327
Scott: Every culture, every person, every piece of technology, everything you are presented with, you learn a new piece of information- It isn't like this one terrible secret of space like a lot of sci-fis have that you're trying to resolve and answer.

229
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:14,920
Scott: It's like every different component of every proper noun has its own terrible secret of space to think, you know, the true motives, the true reasons, the true history of each thing.

230
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:23,320
Scott: So you're constantly being exposed to new things and, you know, it's not like this is one end goal, right?

231
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,471
Scott: And I think that's part of what contributes to the richness, right?

232
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,620
Scott: Is that there's just so much happening all over, right?

233
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,022
Rym: So, spoilers!

234
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:41,398
Rym: The moment when the Medusae attacked the ship and murdered everyone, I literally had to back up and read that paragraph again because there was a moment of, "Wait, what?

235
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:41,859
Rym: Just what?

236
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:42,460
Scott: What

237
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,640
Scott: happened?".

238
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,554
Scott: I also had to clarify as like, "Is that really literally what just

239
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:47,995
Scott: happened?".

240
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,620
Scott: Yes, yes it is.

241
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,005
Rym: 'Cause it was instant.

242
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:54,580
Rym: That was the first like tone shift, like, okay.

243
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:02,100
Scott: The short number of pages in which such a monumentous, dramatic, huge thing happened.

244
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,066
Rym: Especially because it was following.

245
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:10,319
Rym: what I would expect is a semi-typical plot of, "Alright, she's on the spaceship going to the

246
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:10,680
Rym: university.".

247
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,904
Scott: "Meets a boy on the

248
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:12,346
Scott: spaceship.".

249
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:13,510
Rym: "He's kinda cute.

250
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,938
Rym: She's exploring these new cultures and these new

251
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,380
Rym: ideas.".

252
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,965
Scott: The spaceship is sentient and awesome.

253
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,269
Scott: It's a giant space shrimp.

254
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:20,854
Scott: It's biological in some way.

255
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,640
Scott: It's not just a machine.

256
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,584
Scott: It's pregnant or whatever.

257
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:31,260
Rym: But I had a sense of where this was going and then the Medusae killed literally everyone on the ship instantly.

258
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,971
Scott: And it's like suddenly they're on this ship going to space college with everybody and then boom!

259
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:38,398
Scott: The ship is attacked and everyone dies except her immediately.

260
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:39,300
Scott: In like a paragraph.

261
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,907
Rym: And what was interesting, like form is function.

262
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:47,060
Rym: Kinda like how when you watch the Skycrawlers movie, you start to fall asleep because it's so boring.

263
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,491
Rym: But that sort of helps you appreciate the moral of that movie.

264
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,560
Rym: Now you have no idea where this is going to go.

265
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,660
Rym: Like from that point, I could not tell where, like this could go in a number of directions.

266
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:08,619
Rym: Just as Vintie is locked in her room on the ship and the Medusae are like outside banging around and like they keep coming back and they're like, "Are you still in there and

267
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:08,980
Rym: alive?".

268
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,224
Scott: At that point, I was like, "What can even

269
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:11,625
Scott: happen?".

270
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:13,368
Scott: I'm trying to think of what the outs are.

271
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:24,651
Scott: It's like, well her family doesn't even fucking know.

272
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:25,854
Scott: Literally everyone's dead.

273
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,117
Scott: She's trapped in this room.

274
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:28,320
Scott: She doesn't fucking know anything.

275
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,180
Scott: The Medusae are just evil and they're gonna murder literally everybody.

276
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:35,637
Rym: Except that the ship's pilot was okay too.

277
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:37,249
Scott: Oh right, right, right.

278
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,679
Scott: It's like, but you didn't know that.

279
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,189
Rym: Nope, you don't know that until later.

280
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:41,740
Rym: And they're trying to kill her.

281
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:50,559
Scott: And it's like the only out I'm imagining is like, "Okay, I'm guessing the sentient spaceship, which is a living being, will do something about this,

282
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:51,060
Scott: right?".

283
00:21:51,260 --> 00:22:00,500
Rym: It's like, you know, what other- I like how we don't find out what the ship was thinking about all of this until like the last two chapters of the entire trilogy.

284
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,551
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I'm like, "Well, I was thinking that, well that's the out, the ship.

285
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,536
Scott: But the ship hasn't done anything yet.

286
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:10,340
Scott: It didn't stop this from happening.

287
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,284
Scott: So what the hell is it gonna do now?

288
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,106
Scott: Just arrive?

289
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:18,079
Scott: Is it gonna refuse and fly to space university no matter what the bad people

290
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:18,179
Scott: want?".

291
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:24,695
Rym: And then it escalates so quickly that before you know it, you're at the university.

292
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:26,380
Rym: She is now half Medusa.

293
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:31,392
Rym: She is standing before like this university council of aliens.

294
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:34,600
Rym: And now you realize, oh, there are a lot of extremely inhuman aliens.

295
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:42,620
Rym: There's like five of them that are even similar to the Medusa who at this point had been described as extremely alien and mysterious.

296
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,363
Scott: And now there's like- Yeah, this is right up my alley.

297
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:52,500
Scott: I'm all about the all kinds of messed up different aliens that are radically different from just some humanoid green guy, right?

298
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:58,752
Scott: It's very star control style where it's like, "Ah, this alien is just a gaseous form.

299
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,235
Scott: And this one you can't even see.

300
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,019
Scott: And this one is made of refracted

301
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:02,319
Scott: light.".

302
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,040
Scott: And you go from the Medusa- This one is a classic pile of tentacles.

303
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,440
Rym: Like the Medusa are unknown and mysterious and they're at war with the Kush for reasons we don't understand.

304
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,980
Scott: They're jellyfish people.

305
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,867
Rym: And like no one's ever talked to them.

306
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:19,760
Rym: And then we get to the university and like three of the professors speak the Medusa language.

307
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:21,768
Rym: And they're like, "Oh, it's Medusa.

308
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:22,290
Rym: Okay.

309
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:23,435
Rym: What's up?

310
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:24,138
Rym: Hey

311
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:24,419
Rym: guys.".

312
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:27,319
Scott: There are some Medusa people who are students there.

313
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,280
Rym: Yup, not from that particular species, but very similar, related, not really explored.

314
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:41,160
Rym: And I still was at that point now, I was not sure if the university was good or bad.

315
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,200
Scott: Oh yeah, I didn't know at all.

316
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:53,140
Rym: Like at that point, when the professors are debating what to do, knowing now that they knew everything, I figured that they stole that stinger on purpose.

317
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,199
Rym: I figured a lot could be going on.

318
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,720
Scott: I was also thinking like, is there- there must be a situation here where there is no galactic governing body.

319
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:08,820
Scott: It's just all these separate, you know, each race of alien species or planet or whatever.

320
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,880
Scott: There must be local governments everywhere and the university is just like its own entity that governs itself and nothing else, right?

321
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:26,740
Scott: And that's why some, you know, professors, I guess, are meeting and, you know, acting as a governing body, you know, for a population of people that live there, right?

322
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:35,140
Scott: Because I guess there is never anywhere in all three books any mention of like some sort of, you know, UN or anything like that.

323
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,993
Scott: Because if there was, you would say, well, where the fuck is it?

324
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,059
Scott: It would be- it would be involved, but it isn't.

325
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:50,100
Rym: But what I do really appreciate is that I'm glad the university ended up just being pretty much a benign force of knowledge, peace, and understanding.

326
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,573
Rym: Like it was good and it tried hard as an entity.

327
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,220
Rym: It was not a bad guy.

328
00:24:55,921 --> 00:25:04,620
Rym: And even in the beginning, you know, they meet and they're like, oh yeah, that stinger was fucking stolen and that's shitty and we're giving it back and we're sorry and oh my god.

329
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:05,586
Rym: Like immediately.

330
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:07,819
Scott: And then, by the way, you want a full ride?

331
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:16,480
Scott: Yeah, that's an example of like, you know, sort of the, you know, of like just how there isn't a single terrible secret of a space, right?

332
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,640
Scott: There's like these many, many, you know, many resolved plots, right?

333
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,280
Rym: Because I suspected there was still something sinister about the university at several points along the way.

334
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:37,360
Rym: Like when Okwu, the jellyfish guy, that's her friend, is learning weapons and you thought he was going to kill the professor, but that was actually just his final exam and it was fine.

335
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,540
Rym: Like there are a bunch of points along the way.

336
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,220
Scott: See, I mean, I was questioning the university until that we actually got there.

337
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:49,379
Scott: And then once I got there, it sort of felt like, you know, I guess maybe because I've seen they were 11 more than once.

338
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,083
Scott: But it sort of felt like that.

339
00:25:51,123 --> 00:26:00,580
Scott: that same situation where, you know, there's the university presents itself as sinister upfront and you hop over that barrier and it's like there's the truth on the other side.

340
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,494
Rym: I guess there was one moment where I wondered about the university.

341
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:05,920
Rym: It was the last time I wondered.

342
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:11,220
Rym: And it was when she was studying the Edan, like the magic rock with that one professor.

343
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:18,560
Rym: And then she left to go home and she just thought to herself like there was one of those moments that this book does a few times and other great books have done it.

344
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:28,500
Rym: Where you have one throwaway line at the end of a chapter where the main character was like, I wish I had paid more attention to what had just happened because it explained what happened later.

345
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:30,439
Rym: And it just kind of left you with that.

346
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:38,600
Rym: And that was right after the professor had basically said, all right, go home with the jellyfish guy to the planet with all the diplomacy stuff.

347
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:44,460
Rym: And I thought, I wonder if the university had some ulterior motive, but then clearly not.

348
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:48,139
Rym: And that was the end of that thread of suspecting the University of malfeasance.

349
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:49,303
Scott: Yep.

350
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:51,600
Scott: All right.

351
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,460
Scott: So, you know, I guess but yeah, it's like the Stinger plot.

352
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:59,580
Scott: It's like, ah, why did the aliens attack this ship and murder everyone?

353
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,000
Scott: Well, because, you know, they're they're like leaders, you know, Stinger, like a part of his body.

354
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:05,684
Scott: Right.

355
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,560
Scott: Was like chopped off and stolen.

356
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:08,242
Scott: Right.

357
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:13,640
Scott: Like like an artifact and absconded with to the university, like the university was the British Museum or some shit.

358
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:14,523
Scott: Right.

359
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:16,839
Scott: And they were like, hey, give that shit back.

360
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,461
Scott: Right.

361
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:24,500
Scott: And the university just sort of and it's like you think, well, that's you know, you're presented with that sort of MacGuffin motive thing.

362
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,081
Scott: Right.

363
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:25,784
Scott: Early on.

364
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:30,860
Scott: And you got to imagine that right when you're presented with that kind of thing, that that's going to be the climax.

365
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:31,182
Scott: Right.

366
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:34,440
Scott: Resolving, you know, getting that when they finally get the Stinger.

367
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,794
Scott: But it's like, no, they get that quickly.

368
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:36,943
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:38,680
Rym: Like instantly they give it right back to him.

370
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,572
Rym: Like, we're sorry.

371
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:39,998
Rym: Here you go.

372
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:41,182
Scott: Right.

373
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:41,503
Scott: It's like.

374
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,045
Scott: so there's like.

375
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:46,300
Scott: you're presented with a thing that's resolved, but there's more book to go in a short book.

376
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:53,700
Scott: You know, that's the only thing I think that carries on for a long time is the magical device that she has.

377
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,682
Scott: That is true.

378
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:55,043
Scott: Right.

379
00:27:55,504 --> 00:28:01,180
Scott: But even that one, you know, where it's like, ah, the truth of it doesn't come out until much later.

380
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:09,040
Scott: She's constantly like reminded of it, focused on it, working on it, studying it, has a professor helping work on it.

381
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,301
Scott: Right.

382
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:14,320
Scott: It's like they're not like ignoring it, like, you know, a lot of magical, you know, girls in anime or whatever.

383
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,020
Rym: I guess nobody, no character in this book ignores something that a reasonable person would not ignore.

384
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:19,802
Scott: Right.

385
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,340
Scott: It's like, ah, the girl has the magic item.

386
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:26,340
Scott: And then at the final episode, we learn what the magic item is.

387
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,700
Scott: It was a key to a door or it was a this or it was a that.

388
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:29,962
Scott: Right.

389
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,240
Scott: And the whole in between time, it's mostly ignored.

390
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:32,541
Scott: Right.

391
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,909
Scott: It's like not not at all.

392
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,820
Scott: It's like I have a magic item.

393
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:40,280
Scott: I will spend all the spare time figuring it the fuck out from immediately.

394
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,986
Scott: And it's constantly focused on nonstop.

395
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:50,020
Scott: And even though the final truth of it doesn't come out till later, subtruths are constantly revealed.

396
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:50,642
Scott: Right.

397
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:54,660
Scott: It's progresses and is constantly emitting bearing fruit.

398
00:28:55,161 --> 00:29:01,660
Rym: And I like the the radical expansion of the universe we're interacting with because so quickly.

399
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:09,280
Rym: So suddenly we learn about the space university and like the ridiculousness of the wider world that these cultures play a part in.

400
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,800
Rym: And then we learn, you know, as we go on, like we learn, oh, the desert people.

401
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,347
Rym: Oh, they got space internet.

402
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,420
Rym: They're way more advanced than fucking anyone.

403
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:25,460
Rym: And even the himba were prejudiced against them as being savages because they just didn't know, even though they made smartphones for them.

404
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:25,901
Rym: Yeah.

405
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:35,860
Rym: And that even at the very end, like, oh, the himba, actually, they got a secret society and all sorts of not like they got stuff going on to literally everybody's got something going on.

406
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:44,900
Scott: It's almost like, you know, when the author was doing like some world building exercise, were like they just started with a character and were like almost playing like some solo RPG.

407
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,527
Scott: It's like, OK, I'm allowed to write one paragraph.

408
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:51,899
Scott: Then I have to flip over a card to add something new to the mix doing that.

409
00:29:53,081 --> 00:30:16,760
Rym: But it played well into the sort of overall themes of the story, because if you look at this as a story of cultures interacting, you have a person who lives in a culture that that is traditional and oppressed by the people around it culturally, yet has both redeeming qualities and negative qualities like their culture is pretty sexist and was holding people like Binti back.

410
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:21,674
Rym: But also their culture was way more reasonable about a lot of things than like the coach.

411
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:23,760
Rym: But they were oppressed by the coach.

412
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:30,960
Rym: But they also were in turn effectively oppressors, at least they thought they were of the desert people who they disrespected.

413
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:31,982
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:38,559
Scott: I mean, just about every one of the different cultures presented, it's like there's not some clear good guy, bad guy deal.

415
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,341
Scott: Right.

416
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:48,420
Scott: Of like colonizer, colonized, like you would, you know, it's like every single culture and different group of species or whatever they are.

417
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:48,982
Scott: Right.

418
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:52,419
Scott: You know, has positive and negative aspects, even.

419
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,321
Scott: Right.

420
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:59,070
Scott: These these ridiculous, you know, the Medusa who just come out as like, you know, genocidal murderers.

421
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:00,013
Scott: Yeah.

422
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:00,714
Scott: Immediately.

423
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:00,955
Scott: Really?

424
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:06,550
Rym: What's funny is they're a lot like Klingons in Star Trek, like very, very Klingon.

425
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,577
Scott: Pretty even I know that that's true.

426
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:13,990
Scott: It's like you got to think that they're bad.

427
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:14,512
Scott: Right.

428
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:18,789
Scott: All you've seen of them is they came and just murdered a bunch of innocent people, students.

429
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,994
Scott: It's like that's as bad as it gets.

430
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:30,710
Rym: But like at the very end, when Binti is trying to make peace between them and she's like, look, fuckers, what did you think they were going to do when you attack their leader and cut off a part of his body?

431
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,470
Scott: Right.

432
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,695
Scott: It's like they were just they're just.

433
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:36,290
Scott: they're still bad because, you know, getting vengeance in that way isn't good.

434
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:45,230
Scott: But it's like they they're not just, you know, genocidal maniac species or whatever, just going around, you know, killing everyone.

435
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,546
Scott: It's like they just become evil when there's a reason they had their own bad.

436
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,470
Scott: You stole from them.

437
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,331
Scott: And that's also bad.

438
00:31:51,012 --> 00:32:01,910
Rym: But thus we've got the sort of intertwined allegory of Binti is literally becoming more than human and more than she's becoming culturally more than just him.

439
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:09,290
Rym: But even though that is where she came from, she is also becoming physically more than just human through multiple stages along the way.

440
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:15,470
Rym: She's half the deuce, half spaceship, half human with you, also with the alien Internet in her brain.

441
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:21,990
Scott: Like, yeah, well, I think that's you know, that's what allows her to sort of be the main character.

442
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:27,750
Scott: And, you know, she brings all the you know, her story, what she does brings all these different groups together.

443
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:28,533
Scott: Right.

444
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,809
Scott: But also, you know, incorporates them into herself.

445
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:32,010
Scott: Right.

446
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:39,650
Scott: So she's not it's not you know, it's sort of, you know, not just into herself, but also by default, incorporates part of herself into them.

447
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:42,410
Rym: No cultures interact without both of them changing.

448
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,001
Rym: No people interact without both of them changing.

449
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,170
Rym: No things interact without both of them changing.

450
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:47,972
Scott: Right.

451
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,890
Scott: I mean, you know, you can't really be you know, she's like a translator slash diplomat.

452
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:53,572
Scott: Right.

453
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:58,230
Scott: And, you know, ends up being forced into that role, even though that's not what she wanted.

454
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:58,491
Scott: Right.

455
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:02,510
Scott: And it's like, it's hard to be you know, if you're if she was still just herself.

456
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:03,212
Scott: Right.

457
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,390
Scott: And hadn't become part Medusa, part spaceship, part whatever.

458
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:17,610
Scott: Then it sure makes it a lot harder to bring those groups together because you'll always be seen as just representing the interests of, you know, who you are.

459
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,310
Scott: Right.

460
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:21,861
Scott: But by be actually literally becoming right.

461
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:25,010
Scott: The other, you know, kind of person.

462
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:25,893
Scott: Right.

463
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:30,190
Scott: At the same time, it's like she could garner the trust of everyone.

464
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:31,033
Rym: Right.

465
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:31,575
Rym: Yep.

466
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,281
Rym: It was very appointed moment.

467
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:35,650
Scott: Not really possible even in the real world.

468
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:43,670
Rym: It was a very pointed moment when she did convince, you know, the warring leaders to make peace, have a truce and it all fell apart anyway.

469
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:53,708
Rym: But the fact that she saw that the Medusa chief was surprised and sad and the Kush king was also surprised and sad that it was neither of them was.

470
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:54,530
Scott: it wasn't their fault.

471
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,218
Scott: It was that sub sub guy.

472
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:56,741
Scott: Yeah.

473
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,429
Scott: The general dude or whatever his name was.

474
00:33:59,232 --> 00:33:59,975
Rym: Yeah, it was.

475
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:04,150
Rym: it was that the peace was not that easy to achieve between their two cultures.

476
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:05,231
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:15,230
Scott: It's like even if you get, you know, like I mean, you can see even in the history of the real world, there have been times when you've had world leaders from countries that are really mad at each other.

478
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:15,973
Scott: Right.

479
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,969
Scott: Sign a treaty, shake hands, do a photo op.

480
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:19,731
Scott: Right.

481
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:26,130
Scott: But that doesn't mean that all of the people of those countries are now happy with each other and chill.

482
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,731
Scott: Right.

483
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:36,070
Scott: Or that, you know, there might be a change of government or some other people, you know, government isn't just one person, even if it's a dictator or a monarch or something.

484
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,391
Scott: Right.

485
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:39,900
Scott: You know, some general goes off or someone else.

486
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:40,822
Scott: Yeah, it happens.

487
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,248
Rym: But this but all this happened in the book, too.

488
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:54,909
Rym: I would say the top line primary theme that stands out to me in this entire work, this trilogy, is that having a broader perspective is never bad.

489
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:09,550
Rym: Learning more is never bad, even if you don't like what you learn, because the only reason Binti is able to do the things she does is because she learns and embraces and evolves as she interacts with other cultures and sees a broader and broader universe.

490
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,513
Rym: And she doesn't forget where she came from.

491
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:27,130
Rym: She doesn't reject the culture she came from wholly, but she also does not slave it like stick strictly to the conservative elements of her culture that are like like the sexism that aren't necessarily ideal.

492
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,029
Rym: She grows to become something more than incorporates both of them.

493
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:38,910
Scott: Yeah, I mean, to go to bring up Broadway again, I think the primary, you know, theme message is a fiddler on the roof.

494
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,035
Scott: It's like, you know, you got the tradition.

495
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:42,697
Scott: Right.

496
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:43,999
Scott: And then you got the kids.

497
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,830
Scott: And do the kids like, you know, give up on where they came from?

498
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,471
Scott: Right.

499
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:55,823
Scott: It's like, no, but, you know, their horizon broadens outside this little village and also terrible.

500
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,290
Scott: It's, you know, terrible things come and happen to the people living there.

501
00:35:59,672 --> 00:35:59,853
Scott: Right.

502
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:02,289
Scott: That forces them out of their little shell.

503
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,719
Rym: But like Binti was right to expand out of her shell.

504
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,785
Rym: She was right to leave and see the world.

505
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,190
Rym: And she came back better for it.

506
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:12,564
Rym: And her people were better for it because that war was going to happen anyway.

507
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:14,130
Rym: That is very much apparent.

508
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,692
Rym: The kush.

509
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,013
Scott: Yeah.

510
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:17,642
Scott: If she was not on that ship.

511
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:18,625
Scott: Right.

512
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:20,070
Scott: What would have happened instead?

513
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,532
Scott: Right.

514
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:21,924
Scott: Well, everyone on it still would have died.

515
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:22,348
Scott: Right.

516
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,070
Rym: Umza University would have been attacked by the Medusa.

517
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,573
Scott: Exactly.

518
00:36:26,593 --> 00:36:27,458
Scott: Right.

519
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,308
Scott: So, you know.

520
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:37,870
Rym: But the part that I guess surprised me the most was as soon as we meet the desert people, my first thinking was, all right, what's their deal?

521
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,253
Rym: Because by that point, there have been enough.

522
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:40,595
Rym: Everybody's got a deal.

523
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:46,608
Rym: that when she actually meets the desert people, I'm just thinking, all right, sums up.

524
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:47,750
Rym: What's their deal?

525
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,669
Scott: The desert people, I think, you know, when I first when they first came into the picture, I was like, well, this is a little bit tropey.

526
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,191
Scott: Right.

527
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:58,825
Scott: To have like the mysterious people in the in the in the sands, Fremenish kind.

528
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:00,630
Scott: I imagine to be Fremenish kind of.

529
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,533
Rym: I did it first.

530
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,763
Rym: And I love how they're like, the fuck's wrong with you?

531
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:04,546
Rym: We're just on Twitter.

532
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:05,369
Rym: Like, what's up?

533
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:06,672
Rym: Yeah.

534
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:06,934
Rym: Yeah.

535
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,820
Rym: You can have Twitter too.

536
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,289
Rym: Your dad just didn't hook you up to it.

537
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,250
Scott: Right.

538
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:10,651
Scott: Exactly.

539
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:13,197
Scott: But, you know, they're these mysterious people from the same.

540
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,059
Scott: It felt like a trope.

541
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,520
Scott: Right.

542
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,988
Scott: That was just coming in to, you know, to fill out the last book there.

543
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:18,730
Scott: Right.

544
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,239
Scott: But then it's like, no, actually, your dad is one of those people.

545
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,221
Scott: It's like, oh, what?

546
00:37:23,963 --> 00:37:26,490
Scott: Oh, he was hiding it the whole time.

547
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:26,931
Rym: Yeah.

548
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:28,334
Rym: Well, he was ashamed of it.

549
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:32,325
Rym: You see, the Himba are pretty directly racist against the desert people.

550
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:34,390
Rym: The Kush are pretty directly racist against the Himba.

551
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,979
Rym: And there there's complexity to all of that.

552
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,250
Rym: None of them are 100 percent right about any of their neighbors.

553
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:45,648
Rym: And if any of them had learned more about each other, there would be less conflict.

554
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,891
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:55,350
Rym: But at the same time, the desert people are very rightly like, yeah, you guys all kind of suck at this and we're just going to do our own thing with our super alien Internet.

556
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,519
Rym: And good luck.

557
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,670
Rym: Have fun with all your nonsense.

558
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:06,869
Scott: Well, I think it's it was, you know, the rare depiction of, you know, a technology like basically Internet.

559
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,270
Scott: Right.

560
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,492
Scott: Or instant messaging.

561
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:09,154
Scott: Right.

562
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:15,588
Scott: That wasn't like computer bad, you know, a robot destroy sci fi.

563
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,129
Scott: Right.

564
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:23,990
Scott: It was like actually the Internet people are a lot better off in some ways, you know, and it's kind of cool and awesome that they have Internet.

565
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,251
Scott: It's Internet's great.

566
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:25,571
Scott: Right.

567
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:28,634
Scott: But also, I was very logical representation.

568
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:47,130
Rym: I very much enjoyed the way her connecting to space Twitter Internet felt, because imagine someone, a human, an intelligent human being from, I don't know, Roman times and just stick them in front of a computer with translated Internet and just bombard them with it.

569
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:55,119
Rym: Like Latin, Google, like the Twitter, Google is far and I see it.

570
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:03,569
Rym: All the nonsense that we take for granted would be confusing and terrifying to someone who didn't really understand the scope of what the Internet was capable of.

571
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,214
Rym: And that is portrayed very well, I think.

572
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:10,281
Rym: But, you know, like the himba, like, oh, they're crazy.

573
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,483
Rym: They wave their arms all the time.

574
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:12,045
Rym: You made them.

575
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,490
Rym: It's like, oh, yeah, because they're literally constantly typing.

576
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:16,066
Scott: Yep.

577
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,971
Rym: Let's see.

578
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:23,818
Rym: I the spaceship stuff was interesting because I also I suspected.

579
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:25,360
Scott: Well, you know, that's my favorite deal.

580
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,921
Rym: Oh, yeah.

581
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:32,450
Rym: You know, that had something very, very similar happens in the third of the nine Fox Gambit books, like almost identical.

582
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:40,048
Scott: I mean, any any any sci fi book where the ships have the spaceships have names, which I don't know if the culture was the first one to do that.

583
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:41,030
Scott: Definitely not.

584
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,712
Rym: But I guess there's a difference.

585
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:56,990
Scott: There's a difference between ships having names like Star Trek where it's like, you know, it's a navy and they have a designation versus the ship being a character with a name and some sort of, you know, intelligence to it.

586
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,250
Scott: Right.

587
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,853
Scott: Like Kit and Knight Rider.

588
00:39:59,053 --> 00:39:59,274
Scott: Right.

589
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:02,339
Scott: Is basically it's a character.

590
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:05,784
Scott: It's not a, you know, place or vehicle.

591
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:06,425
Scott: Right.

592
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:07,928
Scott: Or weapon.

593
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,210
Scott: It's actually a character.

594
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:15,496
Scott: So, yeah, the the shrimpy the fact that the shrimpy also is is nice, but I like that.

595
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:30,950
Rym: they make a point that every one of these cultures, regardless of their differences, even regardless of the negative and problematic aspects of some of their cultures, every one of them learn something about the other cultures that they would not have learned on their own.

596
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:54,050
Rym: Like even the desert people learn about the trees and their deal from the himba, who they mutually thought were primitive, because all there's there's always there's some thing gets one of those ideas of as societies evolve, you take all the good parts from your past and you try to merge them together and you collectively try to shed the bad parts.

597
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:57,860
Rym: Maybe you disagree on what's bad and it's kind of how societies evolve over time.

598
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:01,730
Rym: Like the sexism about the himba, probably just objectively bad.

599
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:20,790
Scott: But I mean, that's that's trying to, you know, allude to the the message that we're hearing, you know, often in the real world, which is that like, you know, a lot of I guess on Earth, right, the highly advanced, you know, so-called developed or whatever you want to call them, the golf playing nations, I think is the best term.

600
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,251
Scott: Right.

601
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:26,079
Scott: The colonizer places that are, you know, have high technologies and Internet's or whatever.

602
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:26,820
Scott: Right.

603
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:32,870
Scott: Actually do have something to learn from the places and cultures that they view as lesser or primitive.

604
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,434
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like there is knowledge there.

605
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:36,075
Scott: Right.

606
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,317
Scott: Not all of it is true.

607
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:37,698
Scott: Right.

608
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:45,290
Scott: But there are, you know, like their agricultural practices and other other sorts of things that are have been well known.

609
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,951
Scott: Right.

610
00:41:46,031 --> 00:42:04,570
Scott: Amongst other peoples for centuries, millennia, how long that are ignored or discounted or, you know, whatever, because, you know, those are viewed as primitive societies or lesser than and that their knowledge isn't isn't worthwhile because you have the most advanced knowledge.

611
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:06,976
Scott: Therefore, what do you have to learn from anyone else?

612
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:07,778
Scott: Right.

613
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,565
Scott: And the book tries to teach you that lesson.

614
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,670
Scott: That is a true a true lesson to learn.

615
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,111
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:24,688
Rym: And if you zoom all the way out, the moral could be everyone would be better off if they got to go to college and also got to study abroad because they would bring something new back home to where they came from.

617
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:25,990
Rym: And everybody is better for it.

618
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:30,890
Scott: I don't know if everyone needs to go there, but it's good if enough people go.

619
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:40,047
Scott: And from every culture and those people and that when those people come back, right, they are, you know, respected and listened to.

620
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,850
Rym: Yeah, because Benji is not respected to listen to when she comes back.

621
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:53,524
Scott: That's something I think me and I think many people can identify with would be families sending you off to college to get educated.

622
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:57,890
Scott: And then you come back and you tell them things and they don't listen to what you learned.

623
00:42:58,211 --> 00:42:58,471
Scott: Right.

624
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:00,715
Rym: Like, oh, no, university ruined my child.

625
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,138
Scott: Like you literally told me.

626
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:06,887
Scott: you literally told me my whole life that it was important to be educated and learn things.

627
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:08,550
Scott: You emphasized education so much.

628
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:10,853
Scott: And now I've learned and I've learned so much.

629
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:12,215
Scott: I've learned more than you learned.

630
00:43:12,695 --> 00:43:13,777
Scott: And you won't listen to me.

631
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,280
Scott: It's like, yes, I do still have things to learn from you.

632
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,961
Scott: Right.

633
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:23,610
Scott: You know, I'm not going to discount you like some colonizer might discount, you know, the culture that they've colonized.

634
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,195
Scott: But it's like there are things that I've learned that I know are true.

635
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:36,890
Scott: And you're arguing with me, even though you really, really wanted me to go learn those things and paid a lot of money for me to learn them and got mad when I didn't learn them well enough.

636
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:43,704
Scott: And now I'm telling you the thing I learned and you disagreeing with me like you thought the education was so important.

637
00:43:43,744 --> 00:43:46,370
Scott: Why aren't you respecting the education that you thought was important?

638
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:59,810
Rym: So one thing I like is we don't really get a sense of when any of this is set or even specifically where the year XDXDX until when Binti is on the space Internet.

639
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:14,610
Rym: And she basically starts reading the space Wikipedia and she finds out like it was basically a smartphone era in like Namibia or somewhere in that region where the golden aliens were came down and the people there just use their technology.

640
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,853
Rym: And also we're like, you know what?

641
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:16,975
Scott: Oh, I forgot about that.

642
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:18,498
Scott: But that was like the best part.

643
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,866
Rym: I was one of my favorite scenes in the entire desert.

644
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:23,569
Scott: That's because that's another trope.

645
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,870
Scott: Right.

646
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:34,130
Scott: Is like the visiting, you know, super aliens, the precursors, the even better the aliens that are better than all the other aliens, you know, like the in 2001.

647
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,310
Scott: Right.

648
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,591
Scott: The monolith guys.

649
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:35,851
Scott: Right.

650
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:38,633
Scott: It's like, you know, there's always one alien species.

651
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:40,574
Scott: That's not just another alien species.

652
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:43,236
Scott: It's like the precursor godlike.

653
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:44,837
Rym: Even Star Trek has that.

654
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:46,218
Rym: And like they meet them at one point.

655
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:46,759
Rym: Oh, they do.

656
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:47,179
Scott: I didn't know.

657
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:47,899
Rym: I didn't know that.

658
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,896
Rym: The moral of that one is other than the humans, pretty much everyone is like, fuck you.

659
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:08,898
Rym: There's no way that's true.

660
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:09,839
Rym: We refuse to believe it.

661
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:10,981
Rym: And it's never spoken of again.

662
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,830
Scott: OK, but anyway, that's that's a common trope in sci fi, the great precursor species.

663
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,130
Scott: Right.

664
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,112
Scott: And the desert people.

665
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:18,633
Scott: Right.

666
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:23,279
Scott: Their history, you know, was that, ah, yes, these golden aliens.

667
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:23,539
Scott: Right.

668
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,890
Scott: These precursor great species of amazingness visited them long ago and bestowed upon them the technology and befriended them.

669
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:34,595
Scott: Just like the old conspiracy theories about aliens in Egypt or whatever.

670
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:35,216
Scott: Right.

671
00:45:35,377 --> 00:45:37,560
Scott: But it was true, at least within this fictional world.

672
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,002
Scott: They were all just chill.

673
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:41,045
Scott: And then disappeared.

674
00:45:41,265 --> 00:45:41,506
Scott: Right.

675
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:43,829
Scott: They never saw them again because that's the trope.

676
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,230
Scott: Right.

677
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:53,504
Scott: But then she goes to the back to the university at the end and there's just people from that species chilling and like, oh, yeah, hey, how are those desert people doing?

678
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:54,205
Scott: We should go.

679
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:56,990
Scott: It's like they're not some magical precursor species.

680
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:03,941
Scott: They're just another alien race, just like all the rest that just happened to go on vacation there for a while.

681
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:04,061
Scott: Right.

682
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,625
Scott: And I love the same as anyone else.

683
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:09,770
Rym: We just wanted a referral to the university.

684
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:11,731
Scott: Right.

685
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:20,448
Scott: It's like it's like that's just turning that trope on its head was just like so fun, even though it was a small part of the overall story.

686
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:21,530
Scott: It was really satisfying.

687
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:26,017
Rym: So there was a minor bit that comes up near the end, but it's brought up.

688
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:31,726
Rym: It's alluded to several times along the way, mostly with Binti and the red clay that she puts on her body.

689
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:34,570
Scott: And like there's a lot of that's that's throughout the whole book.

690
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:44,745
Rym: But at the end, it culminates when she's with the desert guy and she's like, it's taboo for anyone, even like a husband, to see me without this on.

691
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,447
Rym: And I'm ashamed.

692
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:48,170
Rym: And he's like, but that's your culture.

693
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:49,893
Rym: I don't have that culture.

694
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,697
Rym: So I just see it as an adornment.

695
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:54,900
Rym: It shouldn't be taboo to you because I do.

696
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:56,042
Rym: I come from a different place.

697
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:59,507
Rym: And then he's like, so this hair, nobody's allowed to touch.

698
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,150
Rym: This is the special hair to my people.

699
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:03,353
Rym: But you know, you're not part of my culture.

700
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:04,776
Rym: Go ahead and touch my hair.

701
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:13,470
Rym: And that whole scene was a really interesting meta depiction of like what taboo means in society.

702
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:22,390
Rym: And it was a good way to talk about the kinds of conflicts that happen in the real world today around things like drawing a picture of the Prophet Muhammad.

703
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:37,269
Rym: And I thought that was a very like, I think, if nothing else, that section of the book is the kind of thing that if I were a teacher in an English class and I was our social studies class and I made them read this book, we would do a little unit on like that part of the book.

704
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,006
Scott: But yeah, the whole, what's the word for the clay?

705
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:41,570
Scott: I can't remember.

706
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,268
Rym: Otize, Otize, something like that.

707
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,864
Scott: So I think that's maybe one of the most important things in the whole book.

708
00:47:49,924 --> 00:47:51,950
Scott: And I can't believe we didn't mention it until now.

709
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:58,579
Rym: Well, I love the growth of like, she makes it at home and then she's on an alien planet and she misses it.

710
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:05,328
Rym: But then she like makes it on the alien planet and it's not the same, but it's still part of that lineage and tradition.

711
00:48:05,368 --> 00:48:06,710
Rym: And we just see that sort of evolve.

712
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,451
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:15,584
Scott: It's, you know, it's, I guess it's, you know, the same as say, like, I don't know, I'm trying to think of an actual earth culture equivalent, right?

714
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:19,070
Scott: Because I don't know of any people that like cover themselves in mud every day.

715
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,416
Rym: Well, it's interesting because she finds it as a comfort because it ties her to her culture and her people.

716
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:32,470
Rym: But also she starts to see that it is definitely used to some degree in a sexist way by her own culture.

717
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,217
Rym: And she starts to have a nuanced understanding of it.

718
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:43,670
Rym: And I like how she still wears it and still respects it, but she has a broader understanding of its true meaning and where it comes from.

719
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:50,750
Rym: And it's a choice as opposed to something that is afflicted upon her by her culture.

720
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:56,163
Scott: I guess it could be a parallel to be like, you know, the Muslim women wear a hijab on purpose, right?

721
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:58,570
Scott: As opposed to someone making them wear it because...

722
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:00,859
Rym: Or someone forcing them to take it off.

723
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,249
Rym: Neither of those options is a good option.

724
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,771
Scott: Exactly.

725
00:49:05,932 --> 00:49:13,222
Scott: But it's also, right, not only does it serve to bring that message, right, but it also is sort of like a mental health thing, right?

726
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:19,289
Scott: It's like whenever she's like, you know, when she doesn't have enough of it, she's like feeling insecure, right?

727
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:30,646
Scott: And like, you know, and it's like, you know, when she's feeling nervous or whatever, she can like smell some or, you know, get some extra and it makes her feel better, right?

728
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:33,510
Scott: Sort of like a security blanket kind of deal.

729
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,152
Rym: You know, that's a fun aside.

730
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:42,030
Rym: You know, she clearly, like from what happened on the ship, she is suffering from anxiety and PTSD and having panic attacks.

731
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:50,205
Rym: And I like how her cell phone is just like, she gets therapy and her cell phone has an app that is like, listen, you're having a panic attack.

732
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:51,648
Rym: Take deep breaths.

733
00:49:51,728 --> 00:49:52,690
Rym: Like it's fine.

734
00:49:54,332 --> 00:49:54,673
Scott: Exactly.

735
00:49:54,813 --> 00:50:01,129
Scott: But how the, you know, the mud that she rubs on herself is serving like these multiple purposes throughout the story, right?

736
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:05,204
Rym: I mean, it's a healing solve for the, uh, for Oku.

737
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,595
Rym: Yup.

738
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:19,347
Rym: And, uh, yeah, like there's not that much more I can really say unless we start going like plot point by plot point or character by character.

739
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:20,770
Rym: Let's see who stood out.

740
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,710
Rym: The, uh, the grandma in the desert is like, I think my favorite character because she is very much.

741
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,290
Scott: It's what you would expect from an awesome desert grandma.

742
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:34,705
Rym: She's very just matter of fact, like, oh, honey, don't, don't, don't look at that much Twitter that quickly.

743
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:35,808
Rym: You got to ease into it.

744
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:36,269
Rym: Come on.

745
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:42,005
Rym: But I was like, oh yeah, my piece of shit son decided he was going to throw this away.

746
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:43,349
Rym: He barely talks to me.

747
00:50:43,771 --> 00:50:45,779
Rym: And then she's like barely meaning he does talk to you.

748
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,703
Rym: What the fuck?

749
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:47,968
Rym: Dad never told me.

750
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,049
Rym: Dad had access to the space internet this whole time.

751
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:56,429
Scott: I have to go with, you know, the spaceship again.

752
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,310
Scott: At the end sends, it's very super Metroid situation, right?

753
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:04,469
Scott: The baby ship comes to the rescue at the end.

754
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:06,570
Rym: The baby ship is so cute.

755
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,522
Scott: You can't even see it.

756
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:10,009
Scott: It's a book.

757
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,883
Rym: But the way it talks and she's like, oh yeah, mom sent me.

758
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:14,310
Rym: Didn't quite explain everything.

759
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,117
Scott: It befriends, it basically, you know, combines with her right.

760
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:23,010
Scott: The way that, you know, Samus and the baby Metroid have a symbiosis of kind, right?

761
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:31,140
Scott: But I like along those lines, how, and then she goes to space university and they're like, oh, you're, you're, you're, you're tied up with one of those spaceships.

762
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,031
Scott: Yes.

763
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:38,630
Rym: Some of the other students are also, but that's a big deal when they test, like how far away should I be able to get from it?

764
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:46,870
Rym: Like there is definitely an undercurrent of curiosity is a worthwhile pursuit among all sentient beings.

765
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:53,050
Rym: Because anytime something weird happens, Binti and whoever she's with, they experiment and try to figure out what to do.

766
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,210
Rym: Like they don't just take things for granted, which I think is very important.

767
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,134
Rym: So absolutely read that guy.

768
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:08,370
Rym: I hope you read this book and didn't just listen to this, but, uh, I very much thought this book was great.

769
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,488
Rym: I think, uh, Nettie's works continue to be amazing and good choice.

770
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:13,571
Scott: Good choice.

771
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:13,992
Scott: Yeah.

772
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:18,220
Rym: So, uh, do you want to announce or do you want to present the choice?

773
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,690
Rym: We haven't figured out exactly like when you present the choice, should I have to pick right now?

774
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:25,635
Scott: Oh, I don't care about that.

775
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:27,161
Scott: I'm just thinking about the rules.

776
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,309
Rym: We haven't set the rules for how the book club is going to go.

777
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,834
Scott: So here's the story.

778
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:34,522
Scott: I went to, I have a, you know, wishlist of books.

779
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:35,244
Scott: I have, right?

780
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,268
Scott: Books I want to buy.

781
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:36,990
Scott: I haven't read yet.

782
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:40,340
Scott: I went to that list and I said, well, I guess I'll just pick two books on the list.

783
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,490
Scott: That way, no matter which one Rym picks, it's a book I want to read.

784
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,331
Scott: Really simple.

785
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:46,094
Scott: Can't go wrong with that, right?

786
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:47,576
Scott: Just pick two books from the list, whatever.

787
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:55,650
Scott: So I go to the list and I go down the whole list and I noticed like the two books on the list had the same author.

788
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:57,856
Scott: And I was like, I never heard of this author.

789
00:52:58,398 --> 00:52:59,261
Scott: I don't know who, I don't know.

790
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,344
Scott: I never heard their name before.

791
00:53:00,364 --> 00:53:01,407
Scott: I don't know who they are.

792
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:02,370
Scott: I don't know anything about them.

793
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:11,690
Scott: I've never read any of their books, but somehow two of their books got onto my book wishlist at completely separate points in time, right?

794
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,749
Rym: It's not Umberto Eco, is it?

795
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:14,751
Scott: No.

796
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:20,790
Scott: And it seems like they've only written two novels, but they've written many other things.

797
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:21,968
Rym: It's not Simon Rushdie, is it?

798
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:22,931
Scott: No.

799
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:25,697
Scott: They've only written two novels, right?

800
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:31,288
Scott: So the author, I don't know if Rym even knows this person because I didn't until recently, the author is G Willow Wilson.

801
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,010
Scott: Do you know this person?

802
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:34,009
Rym: I don't think so.

803
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:39,939
Scott: So G Willow Wilson is a person who has mostly written comic books, right?

804
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,088
Scott: And I think is most known for creating the Ms.

805
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:45,890
Scott: Marvel character.

806
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:47,100
Rym: Oh, okay.

807
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:47,828
Rym: I didn't, okay.

808
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,630
Scott: Kamala Khan, right?

809
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:50,163
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

810
00:53:50,811 --> 00:54:00,850
Scott: So this is the person who invented the character of Kamala Khan, has written lots of popular recent-ish comic books, is exactly the same age as us, right?

811
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,132
Scott: She was born in 1982, right?

812
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:05,217
Scott: She's wrote some X-Men.

813
00:54:05,237 --> 00:54:06,358
Scott: Oh, what is it?

814
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:14,050
Scott: Wikipedia says she first encountered comics when she read an anti-smoking pamphlet featuring the X-Men in fifth grade.

815
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,889
Scott: She started watching X-Men every Saturday, right?

816
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,930
Rym: Oh my god, so we come from the same comics lineage.

817
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:21,671
Scott: Right, exactly.

818
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:26,335
Scott: So this person has written two books, novels, right?

819
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:31,640
Scott: One book is Alif the Unseen, and the other book is The Bird King.

820
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:40,969
Scott: The Bird King I think is the newer one that came out pretty recently, and the Alif the Unseen is the one that they wrote some years ago, right?

821
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:49,370
Scott: And then I'm like, "Well, this person is clearly some excellent writer who is one of us old millennial X-Men watching

822
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:49,530
Scott: type.".

823
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,593
Rym: Oh, fuck.

824
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:56,990
Rym: I just skimmed a really high-level summary of both of those books, and they are equally compelling.

825
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,078
Scott: Right, so I'm probably going to read both of the books.

826
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:02,407
Scott: I don't care which one you pick for us to discuss.

827
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,090
Scott: I can't lose.

828
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,062
Rym: Ooh, it's really tough.

829
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:07,949
Rym: Which of these two?

830
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:09,712
Scott: Yeah.

831
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:13,462
Scott: I don't care if you pick now or later.

832
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,104
Scott: It's up to you.

833
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,207
Scott: Those are the two books.

834
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:30,070
Rym: I'm going to set a precedent of being willing to pick right now, having just seen the choices, and I'm going to choose Alif the Unseen solely because of the word cyberpunk, and cyberpunk has been very front of mind lately.

835
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:39,148
Rym: And I'm very interested in, quote, "In the novel, a Middle Eastern hacker named Alif discovers a book of gene tales which may lead to a new age of quantum

836
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:39,649
Rym: computing.".

837
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,509
Rym: Just put that straight into my veins.

838
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,317
Scott: Alright, well here it comes, right into your veins.

839
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:45,040
Scott: And look at this.

840
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:47,770
Scott: If it wasn't for Book Club, Rym wouldn't even know about this book.

841
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:49,792
Scott: Or this person.

842
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:57,690
Scott: And I don't know how these two books got onto my wish list without me knowing who this was before I went to choose the books.

843
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:09,370
Scott: And if I can predict the future, it doesn't really matter which road Rym picked because I pretty much can guarantee once he finishes the Alif the Unseen, he's going to read The Bird King next.

844
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:10,318
Rym: I mean, you know me.

845
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:11,390
Rym: You know how I do with books.

846
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:12,788
Scott: That's how we do.

847
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,030
Rym: Oh, let's read one Wheel of Time book, 14 books later.

848
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:24,110
Scott: I mean, I haven't started reading either one either, but I can probably say that's the same as going to happen, right?

849
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,288
Scott: It's like, how could these be?

850
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,210
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

851
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:38,350
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

852
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:43,750
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

853
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,697
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

854
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:51,450
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

855
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,946
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

856
00:56:56,211 --> 00:57:02,390
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

857
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:41,270
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this GeekNights Book Club episode are... The next station is Finch West, Finch West Station, and a number of people who have chosen to either not have me say their name, or who, rightly, have decided to give us the minimum possible donation on Patreon, which is perfectly fine.

858
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,002
Rym: So, yeah, this was a really good book.

859
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:45,470
Rym: I look forward to this next book.

860
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:55,570
Rym: I'm not sure if I'm actually going to make Scott choose between Foucault's Pendulum and the book by the voice actor of Garak from Star Trek.

861
00:57:56,271 --> 00:58:13,030
Rym: I might actually make him choose between that and a Simon Rushdie book, partly because, while I like that book and I'm enjoying it so far, I don't think Scott has any fucking context for what's going on, so it might not be the best introduction for him into Star Trek.

862
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:30,179
Rym: But anyway, we'll see what he chooses, we'll see what I choose to give him the choice of, but for now, I simply leave you with... ...additioning for Field Reporters, Andy and Ollie.

863
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,361
Scott: Back to you, Andy!

864
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:32,361
Scott: Back to you, Ollie!

865
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:33,963
Scott: Back to you, Ollie!

866
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,030
Scott: Oh, okay, no, no, no, no, forget it.
