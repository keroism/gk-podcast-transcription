00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,078
Rym: It's Thursday, September 2nd, 2021.

2
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:11,600
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,946
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:19,149
Rym: tonight We are talking about outerwear like jackets and shit.

5
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,207
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:37,330
Rym: so, uh Yesterday, I know Scott was going to tennis and I was just home doing my thing and I was sitting around the evening and I had a concept in my head of what the weather forecast was which was some rain will come but it's no big deal.

7
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:47,819
Rym: But then the weather started changing really rapidly and then I go online and the forecast went from a little bit of rain to Massive dangerous thunderstorm shelter in place.

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,030
Rym: that storm system came out of almost nowhere.

9
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:54,530
Scott: That wasn't what I. so I knew it was gonna.

10
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,570
Scott: I thought it was basically gonna rain all day and I knew the remnants of the hurricane were coming in right later.

11
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:15,501
Scott: But we were only going to the tennis from noon to 5 and then eating dinner and then going home and I figured we were Gonna just beat the horrible rain home You know and I knew it was probably gonna be a bad rain But I didn't think it was gonna be as bad as it was obviously.

12
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,090
Scott: Yep, but I'm saying the hurricane remnants.

13
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:23,410
Scott: I guess I think the hurricane just lost less energy than we thought it was gonna lose on its way up.

14
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,681
Rym: Well from what I gather I was looking.

15
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:39,850
Rym: I was reading some weather calm like reporting on it because I was surprised by it is The system strengthened suddenly and rapidly in Pennsylvania like a bunch of stuff happened along the way But it happened so quickly that the forecast changed way too late for anyone to react to it.

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,608
Scott: Mmm, so yeah, usually because usually what happens is once a hurricanes on land.

17
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,778
Scott: There's no Ocean under it for it to get more water.

18
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:53,809
Scott: So it was just losing water right onto the ground And I guess somehow it gained power even in on land.

19
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:05,410
Rym: well, sometimes you get situations like I don't you ever experienced like an actual direct show where a Storm will sort of like there'll be a thunderstorm and the forecast is even like yeah thunderstorm But suddenly it's not a tornado.

20
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:15,172
Rym: The thunderstorm just gets really really really really strong over the matter of minutes out of nowhere And it has a constant wind going in one direction Mm-hmm.

21
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:21,139
Rym: It's a kind of scary if it happens to you and you're outside Especially if you're like out in the woods or something.

22
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:37,250
Rym: I got hit by one on a hike long ago but The rain that came down officially was the most intense hour of rainfall New York City has ever experienced in our recorded history of trying to track how much rain falls in this area

23
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,054
Scott: Measured in inches in

24
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,423
Rym: inches the second most rainfall.

25
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:59,810
Rym: the previous record was from two weeks ago Yep, so climate change is real and everyone who is resisting drastic societal changes to address This is honestly in my opinion literally committing violence against society and everyone who lives here against humanity.

26
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:04,347
Rym: Yep, like that's a crime against humanity at this point, and I don't know what we can do about it.

27
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,383
Scott: like Cut Captain Planet was on fucking TV.

28
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,409
Scott: How many years ago?

29
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:11,476
Rym: Al Gore had his book.

30
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,630
Scott: I was in before out before anyone who Al Gore was in first grade.

31
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,918
Scott: They were telling us reduce reuse and recycle.

32
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,530
Scott: if they were telling me that in first grade, right?

33
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:32,970
Scott: It wasn't first graders who came up with that It was adults at the time when I was in first grade people who are now really old Right who decided that that's what I should have been taught in the 80 something.

34
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:39,529
Scott: Yeah, so and that means most of the people at least where we are learn this fucking lesson.

35
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,977
Scott: How come so many people haven't learned a lesson?

36
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,827
Rym: if I learned in first grade and I'm old I can actually say why.

37
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,355
Rym: because one All environmental issues.

38
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:52,087
Rym: This was a shift that started in the 90s actually started before then but it really came to fruition.

39
00:03:52,408 --> 00:04:05,623
Rym: in the 2000s Anti environmental messaging became a cornerstone of right-wing messaging Solely because it was in opposition to something that was perceived as progressive or liberal Kind of like it definitely was not.

40
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:10,079
Rym: until it was not most people in America didn't give a shit about a mask mandate.

41
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:18,978
Rym: if if the Republicans hadn't made masks a thing and the government had just Been like yeah wear masks for the foreseeable future It probably wouldn't have been nearly as contentious of an issue.

42
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,509
Rym: But instead it became a partisan shibboleth.

43
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,888
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know in the in the 80s and 90s, you know, it was just like yeah.

44
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,762
Scott: Well, and you know, no there was no one around who was like cats and planets the bad guy Let's fuck the environs.

45
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:33,489
Scott: No one that I saw.

46
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:42,356
Rym: Yeah But like literal like Republican platform and what a good chunk of Americans believe is one climate change is a myth - even if it's happening Who gives a shit?

47
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,090
Rym: and three we should actively pollute?

48
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,058
Rym: Like that third one you I think I'm joking.

49
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,343
Rym: I am NOT.

50
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:55,066
Rym: that is there are a Surprising number of people who advocate that we should pollute more and exploit the environment more.

51
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:59,598
Rym: and the argument is God gave us earth to exploit.

52
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:02,328
Rym: He would never let us harm it so bad that it would come back to bite us.

53
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,795
Scott: There's many different arguments right?

54
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,102
Scott: there's the argument of it makes me more money.

55
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,650
Scott: therefore, I'll convince some doofus to support it.

56
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,257
Rym: There's the argument.

57
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:15,367
Scott: I think it's a problem for no reason.

58
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:19,844
Scott: Yeah I'm just I'm a bully the kind of person who would have been.

59
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,818
Scott: it was a bully in school And I just like doing it makes other people mad.

60
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:24,239
Scott: Therefore.

61
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,962
Scott: It makes me happy.

62
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:31,184
Scott: I don't really care about what the consequences are Yep, but this is only gonna get worse.

63
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:38,929
Rym: New York City got fucked up last I saw I think 25 people are dead and there's still a lot of people unaccounted for and New Jersey also is in a state of emergency.

64
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:40,990
Rym: We have not recovered from this.

65
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:46,170
Rym: I haven't even been outside yet But from what I can tell there is significant damage even a few blocks away from our apartment.

66
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,629
Rym: We just happen to live literally at the highest point in Long Island City.

67
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:50,818
Scott: Well, I'm not.

68
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,120
Scott: I'm not at the highest point But you know the height doesn't really matter so much right?

69
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,544
Scott: because if you look at the flood map.

70
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,050
Scott: the flood map is for.

71
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,044
Scott: You know storm surge, you know situations like where the river is coming up, right?

72
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,870
Scott: That's what the flood map is measuring.

73
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,710
Scott: So there are people who lived like not even in flood zones like in a place that's high up where it's like.

74
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,842
Scott: You know, you're not gonna even if the sea level rises a fuck ton Your house will still be on a hill of some on land.

75
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,910
Scott: All right, you're gonna be just fine here.

76
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:24,079
Scott: But what happens is when it rains It's not the river.

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,561
Scott: the river might rise sure But the it's not the river rising that causes a flood.

78
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,230
Scott: the water lands right on you no matter how high you are.

79
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:40,657
Scott: And if it doesn't drain because the drain is clogged up Well, you're gonna know your basement still gonna flood and if you're at the top of a hill It is a little more complicated than that.

80
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,844
Rym: those maps imply a bunch of things.

81
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,808
Rym: height is the primary thing that matters But they're high definitely helps you sure.

82
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,022
Scott: There were many high up places that still got flooded basements.

83
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,446
Rym: They got flooded a very different way.

84
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:57,261
Rym: There are two different like mechanisms of flooding.

85
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,299
Rym: one is Standing water and the other is flash flood.

86
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,310
Rym: a lot of those basements flooded because an area had a lot of water pass through it.

87
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:11,084
Rym: Flood waters didn't stay like the street was no longer flooded almost immediately after the rain stopped.

88
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:21,119
Rym: but on its way down The rain would find a nice basement and say hey, that's a cool place to hang out go into the base That's also and then have no situation that happens.

89
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,370
Rym: Yeah, but that happened at my mom's house in Arizona a flash flood.

90
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:29,450
Rym: So there was this hill on their property and no one knew what it was there for it.

91
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,510
Rym: It wasn't in any of the like topographical diagrams.

92
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,984
Rym: So they got rid of it because it was just annoying it in the way.

93
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:46,787
Rym: years later a Rare flash flood happened and water came streaming Straight toward the house went past where that little hill used to be and slammed right into the side of the house and completely flooded the basement.

94
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,103
Scott: No, I mean, you know, I think you know in the city, right?

95
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:58,485
Scott: We're mostly worried about the flood situation because You know forget, you know, you know hills and drains and all that sort of situation.

96
00:07:58,907 --> 00:07:59,730
Scott: Everything's concrete.

97
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:03,284
Rym: Concrete absorbs a little well, that's why there's so much but it's not.

98
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,670
Scott: it's not dirt, right?

99
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:14,019
Rym: So that's why there's so much work on all those different mitigation techniques to put green spaces dirt trees grass Yeah around because water goes.

100
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:18,238
Scott: water goes in dirt It doesn't go in kind of and that'll it.

101
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,510
Rym: that'll give you a buffer even if those things don't drain themselves.

102
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:26,310
Rym: They'll hold more water and give you a buffer to lower the damage of flash floods.

103
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,583
Scott: You're in a grassy field and you see a little puddle in the grassy field.

104
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:37,993
Scott: if you took all the water and sucked it out Of the grassy field and put it onto like a you know, piece of concrete you'd be up to like It'd be deep.

105
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,722
Scott: So but if you look out and you say okay.

106
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,429
Scott: Well, the city's got these flooding problems.

107
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,102
Scott: Well, how's it going out there in the in the burbs, right?

108
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,470
Scott: Why don't we just you know, maybe the city time is bad.

109
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,087
Scott: It's like no actually shreds.

110
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,024
Scott: The suburbs got a different problem, right?

111
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:54,910
Scott: They don't got flooding.

112
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,522
Scott: They got some flooding going on especially in places with shitty infrastructure.

113
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:58,683
Scott: who?

114
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,730
Scott: nor bad geographies or topologies.

115
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,070
Scott: But their situation is they the trees the trees that are so good.

116
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,010
Scott: They got knocked down by the wind and then you get your powers gets cut out.

117
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:15,250
Scott: I know my parent my my mom the big giant tree in the front lawn that's been there forever.

118
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,270
Scott: You know, she's or we already lost a shit ton of trees over the years.

119
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,790
Scott: The big tree went down it knocked to hit all the power lines.

120
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,783
Scott: Luckily, it went down towards the street and not onto anyone's house or anything.

121
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:31,318
Scott: So I can't say that trees enormous And yeah, cut took the power right out.

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,447
Rym: every single person who lives in New York City Even if they had to deal with some flooding Showed up at work today like online like they all dialed in.

123
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:44,686
Rym: Almost everyone who lived upstate couldn't had no power and couldn't kill or no internet and couldn't get to work.

124
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:52,516
Scott: Yep So, yeah, I mean the other thing is that in the city, you know, it's like yeah, there's a flood But the flood is mostly hitting.

125
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:59,127
Scott: it's gonna hurt you the most if you're in the basement or first-level Abode which is often this I'm on the floor.

126
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,104
Scott: Yeah, I haven't done the math on this but I'm gonna check to see.

127
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,570
Scott: but I feel like all right.

128
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,690
Scott: Tell me if this if this seems reasonable to you, right?

129
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:18,770
Scott: Cuz usually when the when you hear them talking about like sea level rise climate predictions They're talking about like inches which is very significant like if the sea goes up a few inches, that's a big fucking deal, right?

130
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:29,109
Scott: yeah, that's disastrous, but I it feels like okay if that much ridiculous climate change is gonna rise things by inches Which is still devastating and bad, right?

131
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,715
Scott: I'm five stories up.

132
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:38,629
Scott: I feel like if all the ice and all the glaciers on earth melted Well, I'd probably be dead for many other reasons.

133
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:45,956
Scott: But I feel like even then the water wouldn't reach the fifth floor, yeah, but that's Literally worthless knowledge.

134
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:58,987
Scott: that doesn't do anything because I didn't say but I just saying like so but you know if that won't reach the fifth floor then I Floods, you know that are happening now aren't gonna hit the fifth floor now.

135
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:06,870
Scott: So if we just put buildings up on some stilts or whatever that's gonna keep us at least our shit dry for a little while.

136
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,698
Rym: But you know, it can't just go up on stilts.

137
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,632
Rym: all the infrastructure like a giant building not like Electricity.

138
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,057
Rym: Yeah the internet pipe.

139
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:15,543
Scott: Oh, yeah, they'll be poop.

140
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,049
Scott: There'll be poop rivers underneath your build.

141
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,747
Scott: their house Yeah, sure.

142
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,617
Rym: But also the way it will be.

143
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:23,130
Rym: your places like places where floods happen more often or people build around it.

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,511
Rym: Usually.

145
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:32,110
Rym: what they do is all the nice stuff is on the second and third floor and the first floor is built in a way To where if it gets flooded you have to gut it and rebuild it.

146
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:35,590
Rym: It's really easy and cheap to do and you can keep living in the top while that happens.

147
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:42,170
Scott: Yep, just one more thing to mention is that of course you can listen to famous GeekNights' Thursday episode water in the ceiling.

148
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,957
Scott: Yeah in the city.

149
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:47,250
Scott: He got a lot of flat roofs and not necessarily the nice pointy roofs.

150
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:54,470
Rym: Oh, you know, yep Some people had water from the ceiling and water from the ground But I must say there was a lot of water in the ceiling yesterday.

151
00:11:54,671 --> 00:12:00,745
Rym: You saw the videos of what was happening to apartments in the city, especially poorer parts of the city.

152
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:06,110
Rym: Remember that scene if you saw a parasite where the rain happens at the end and that's a real thing.

153
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:14,743
Rym: So water is coming up from the ground and if you can imagine where the water coming up from the ground comes from It's really gonna come from primarily your toilet.

154
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,277
Rym: Yep, so I would argue that categorically.

155
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:23,109
Rym: I will always take water coming from above compared to water coming from below.

156
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,909
Scott: I don't want to come from either day in any direction unless I'm in a water park.

157
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,557
Scott: Yeah, then it comes from every direction.

158
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:30,401
Rym: god there's.

159
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:42,488
Rym: I just think of the scene and it's always sunny where long story short two of the characters go to the top of a water slide that was closed and think that they can just do it and they know dump a bunch of buckets of water down it and the scene.

160
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:43,452
Rym: the way they Portray it is.

161
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:52,262
Rym: you get this wide shot and you see the guy just jump and you hear this like Streaking noise and a little line of red just grows behind him.

162
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:54,830
Rym: It gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then he just stops.

163
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:00,790
Rym: Yeah, that's bad, yeah, so uh, how is that pre storm tennis?

164
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:02,674
Scott: Yeah, so yeah.

165
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:06,810
Scott: yesterday, you know, we took a day off work, you know, cuz we're not going to PAX West.

166
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,910
Scott: Yeah, so the US Open which is one of the four major world tennis tournaments is like right near us in Queens.

167
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,730
Rym: Yeah, we never wait because it's always at the same time as packs.

168
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,064
Scott: Right, and I don't care about tennis that much but I like tennis.

169
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:30,233
Rym: All right, I respect the tennis Sports where I don't really follow a lot of the people I don't care that much who wins other than a very small number of people but I Will pretty much just like.

170
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,524
Rym: watching anyone play high-level tennis is always amusing.

171
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:34,427
Scott: Yeah.

172
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,580
Scott: So anyway So I'm like, you know what not going to PAX West.

173
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:39,630
Scott: Let's go to the tennis.

174
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,609
Scott: So I figured out how tennis tickets work.

175
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,610
Scott: I think you know, we went we go over there and I learned so much about what's going on at the tennis tournament.

176
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,114
Scott: I don't want to.

177
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,129
Scott: I guess I could spend a whole episode talking about it.

178
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:59,083
Scott: But I think all I got to say right now is that when you go to see tennis like the US Open or something like That it's not the same as going to like a hockey game.

179
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,736
Scott: where you go you watch a hockey game It ends you leave.

180
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,225
Scott: right you go you watch a baseball game.

181
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:03,869
Scott: It ends you leave.

182
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,258
Scott: Basically, you're going to the packs of tennis.

183
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:10,407
Scott: It's like a convention and they're just tennis fucking everywhere.

184
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:26,110
Scott: There's Expo Hall kind of At least all over the place Right and like you can get up and walk around and look at different tennis is like they're like they're freaking pet like tennis courts are busy panel rooms and you can just go all around and see.

185
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,322
Scott: And there's only a few that are special like the main events, you know I think there's two and a half that were like special ones.

186
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,269
Scott: You can't just walk into easily.

187
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:37,995
Scott: But yeah, it was.

188
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:40,510
Scott: it was actually a lot of fun even if you don't give a shit about tennis.

189
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,830
Scott: It was cheap because we only went for five hours in the afternoon.

190
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,473
Scott: Right, it caused less than half of a Madison Square Garden hockey game and hockey games like three three hours Maybe right.

191
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:51,980
Scott: and I was there for five hours.

192
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,190
Scott: So huge huge bargain.

193
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,655
Scott: we sat in the ridiculous nosebleed type seats in the in the place that we had to pay and You could see just fine.

194
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:04,690
Scott: And even though we mostly saw people we didn't really know or care about.

195
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,079
Scott: It's like even watching no-name people.

196
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,267
Scott: like everyone there is professional tennis player.

197
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:09,749
Scott: It's like whoa.

198
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,314
Rym: That's what I was saying.

199
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,465
Rym: Like professional tennis is just something to see if you've never seen.

200
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:16,675
Scott: and sometimes you're really you know You're on a field court.

201
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,304
Scott: It's like sometimes you're really fucking close.

202
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,330
Scott: You just get with the ball.

203
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,184
Scott: It's like, you know these people you'd reach out and touch him if you wanted to.

204
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:28,789
Scott: you'd get in trouble, but you know Yeah, I was surprised there weren't like fences and more security like around.

205
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,310
Scott: Well, it's like the local tennis court has more security.

206
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,718
Rym: We'll get to this when we do our show.

207
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:37,430
Rym: the show we were talking about doing around likes going to sports events.

208
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,743
Rym: But I imagine and I'm trying to say this without saying anything specifically classes.

209
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:53,364
Rym: the average person who goes to a tennis match compared to the average person who goes to an American football match is or a baseball match is far less likely to Get naked and run out onto the field.

210
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,309
Scott: I thought about it.

211
00:15:56,552 --> 00:16:00,810
Rym: I imagine that would be a situation of you're the first one and they're all like, oh shit that's never happened.

212
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,984
Scott: But I was like, wow, there's really nothing stopping me from being that streaker guy.

213
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,899
Scott: and I was like, well, let's see How would I do it?

214
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:10,804
Scott: All right, and then And then I was like, okay, so now I'm on the court naked running around.

215
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,310
Scott: what's gonna happen next?

216
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,050
Rym: There was whatever incident where dude like ran out and stab someone though.

217
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,199
Scott: Did that's true.

218
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,549
Scott: Yeah, that was a big deal.

219
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,844
Scott: And I was thinking about that incident when I said well This is probably what's gonna happen.

220
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:31,634
Scott: and I was like Is there any way that I could do this and have it not be terrible Monica Celeste back in 1993?

221
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:35,962
Scott: Yep, but I was like, yep There's pretty much no way I could do that and have it not be the worst.

222
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,328
Scott: so I'm not gonna even think about it.

223
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,572
Scott: Yeah anymore.

224
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:42,180
Scott: It looks like if you didn't check the news I didn't do it.

225
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,226
Scott: Otherwise you would be like is that's good?

226
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:57,728
Scott: on the tennis One headline flood number two headline naked guy by God naked bald guy.

227
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:03,283
Rym: The other thing about the US Open is that it's not it like.

228
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,869
Rym: it goes on for a while.

229
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,930
Rym: It goes to what still like September 12th like this.

230
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,374
Scott: Yeah, I mean we could have we could have gone to it like before or after Pax But it's just.

231
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,484
Scott: it's such a hat, you know, well because we won we go.

232
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,369
Rym: we go to Pax early.

233
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,839
Rym: We usually stay at Pax a little late.

234
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,390
Rym: I usually need time to get my shit together before Pax.

235
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,616
Rym: I'm usually too tired to do anything after Pax.

236
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,579
Rym: So yep.

237
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,347
Scott: It was yeah, I would I would go again.

238
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:32,363
Scott: I think I Don't feel like I need to go again like oh I don't want to miss it But it's like, you know, if someone was like, hey, let's go again.

239
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,199
Rym: I'm like, alright That or any other tennis I've.

240
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,490
Rym: I still keep thinking about playing tennis again.

241
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:48,810
Rym: The only reason I haven't is that and I mentioned this on the show a long time ago But in New York City specifically you need to pay for a special city license to legally play tennis in any outdoor court.

242
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:54,190
Scott: Only the ones that have the little guard there, you know, there are some places you can play.

243
00:17:54,612 --> 00:18:01,403
Rym: So any as far as I've read any New York City Official park with tennis requires that permit even if it's no attendant.

244
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,434
Rym: and legally, I'm saying yes But there are.

245
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,040
Scott: there are places like.

246
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,430
Scott: they'll be like, you know some like playground or basketball.

247
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:12,450
Rym: Usually those are actually covered by that rule the ones that aren't my private.

248
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,624
Scott: There are places like the back of this like a middle school.

249
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:26,504
Scott: over here behind the middle school It's just a field of concrete right and there's some basketball hoops and there's some paint on the ground and you know It's barely populated whatever and there happens to be a tennis court painted on the ground.

250
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:30,863
Scott: if you just put a net there You know with so your weight weight.

251
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:31,789
Rym: There's no net there.

252
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,517
Scott: No, you have to bring one.

253
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,970
Rym: Yeah, so that's not really usable.

254
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,262
Scott: Also, I bet it's it's a floor and you could put a net there and play 10.

255
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,430
Rym: also concrete playing tennis on concrete sucks ass.

256
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,146
Scott: And also I'm just saying you could play tennis there.

257
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:46,810
Scott: No one's stopping.

258
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,753
Rym: Yeah I'm not gonna buy a net and carry with me on my bike and also I Suspect.

259
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:57,056
Rym: if I went there with another adult and just started playing tennis with my own net No, I would give a shit.

260
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,160
Rym: I'm pretty confident.

261
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,310
Rym: I would get trespassed off of that place by a cop.

262
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,082
Scott: It's a public park.

263
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,156
Scott: No one's gonna give a shit If it's a public party.

264
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:09,541
Scott: people people play volleyball in public parks all the fucking time Because volleyball does not have a licensing system.

265
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,163
Rym: Like tennis does.

266
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,590
Rym: tennis is unique in New York City.

267
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,518
Scott: There's all kinds of people.

268
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:14,582
Scott: you can you can't there.

269
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:20,370
Scott: you can play guerrilla tennis But the thing is why would you when you can get the license and play on a nice tennis court?

270
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,756
Rym: Even then I did look into that.

271
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:22,459
Rym: with the license.

272
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:27,690
Rym: every good tennis court has you have to put in Reservations way in advance and you get like an hour to play at a time.

273
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,755
Rym: It's a giant pain in the ass.

274
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:29,278
Scott: The only.

275
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,810
Scott: if you go to Astoria Park, there's plenty of tennis courts.

276
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,035
Scott: They're rarely all full.

277
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:39,661
Scott: you could as wise you can just walk up and play on one of the empty ones and they only kick You out if when more people show up and it's full they kick out.

278
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,283
Scott: Whoever's been there?

279
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,307
Scott: the longest basically.

280
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:41,568
Scott: That's the.

281
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:42,270
Scott: that's the system.

282
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:49,069
Scott: Res pretty much reservations are for like the really popular ones like Central Park and whatnot where people are crowding up in there.

283
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,567
Rym: They're more.

284
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:54,270
Scott: They're more if you go to go to the Bronx if you go up to like Crotona Park you play tennis all you want.

285
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,408
Rym: Yeah, when I bike up in the Bronx, I see the courts all full all the time.

286
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,514
Scott: Yeah, that's popular.

287
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,440
Scott: But you can absolutely play there.

288
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,584
Scott: Yeah, there's empty courts.

289
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:02,865
Rym: Sure.

290
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,230
Rym: I'm saying I've looked into it.

291
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,849
Rym: It's too much of a pain in the ass to be worth it.

292
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,496
Rym: The only good way to play ten.

293
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:10,829
Scott: the reason I don't play tennis is because I love hitting a ball back and forth.

294
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,034
Scott: hitting a Back-and-forth is awesome.

295
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,861
Scott: I love hitting the ball back and forth the sport.

296
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,930
Scott: I don't like run back and forth the sport.

297
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,797
Scott: So I'll stick to badminton.

298
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,347
Rym: Well, if you don't like run back and forth just play ping-pong.

299
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:21,975
Scott: Pink feeling.

300
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,045
Scott: the problem is balls too small.

301
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:23,509
Scott: I can't hit it.

302
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,289
Rym: It sounds like you just don't want to play a sport you're bad at.

303
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,900
Scott: Well, I mean, it's like I don't play sports.

304
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,984
Scott: It doesn't upset me.

305
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,370
Scott: It doesn't upset me that I'm bad.

306
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:34,381
Scott: I don't expect to win it.

307
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,210
Scott: badminton either.

308
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:40,109
Scott: It's that I will barely be playing because it'll be like someone serves and I can't return it.

309
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:41,963
Scott: I'm like, I'm not even playing.

310
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:42,890
Scott: I'm so bad, right?

311
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,850
Scott: If I was a little bit better to where I could actually get a volley going and then get scored on I'd be okay.

312
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:53,370
Rym: I mean how you do that is you play you take lessons and then you just play again.

313
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,276
Scott: Let's not do that.

314
00:20:55,336 --> 00:21:00,248
Rym: I spent 15 years playing tennis Actually seem worse Lee more than that.

315
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:04,166
Rym: But what I might do instead is just start playing racquetball or wall ball or something.

316
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:10,108
Rym: But anyway there is.

317
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:15,868
Scott: This is coming and we talked about it was happening for a while and then it happened.

318
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:26,914
Rym: effectively The US Supreme Court has for all intents and purposes overturned Roe vs Wade meaning that there is nothing preventing any state in America from just banning abortion Full stop.

319
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,542
Scott: Well, as long as they do it in a particular way.

320
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:40,130
Rym: Yeah, but the way that Texas did it is so egregious and Violent that it's worth pointing out what this law does basically is it bans abortions after six weeks?

321
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:43,781
Rym: Which for all intents and purposes bans all abortion.

322
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,569
Rym: very few people even know they're pregnant at that point.

323
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:47,837
Rym: There's your body like.

324
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:49,490
Rym: there's no way to know unless you get a test.

325
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:57,877
Rym: You wouldn't think to get a test half the time and to the law says that anyone Literally anyone can sue.

326
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:14,092
Rym: I guess I guess anyone who's a citizen anyone in Texas can sue anyone who they suspect got an abortion and Get a $10,000 like bounty if in fact that person did get prosecuted for an abortion Mm-hmm.

327
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:17,829
Rym: That is fucked up like beyond belief.

328
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:22,346
Scott: Why can't we have bounties for other things right like?

329
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:23,310
Rym: I can tell you why?

330
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,924
Rym: activation because if we did that for anything else the Supreme Court would strike it down.

331
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:46,336
Rym: the only reason they didn't strike this down is because The sole goal of a lot of people who push for Donald Trump and George Bush and Mitch McConnell Like a big part of why the Republican Party is in the position of power It's in is a dedicated group of people in America whose sole political issue is Banning women's health care.

332
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:51,576
Rym: they want to ban abortion and then if they are successful they want to ban birth control Like and they don't care what.

333
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:54,330
Scott: that's the only thing they care about literally they care about nothing else.

334
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,037
Scott: They have like this single mindset.

335
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,785
Scott: So they'll vote for it for whoever will do that.

336
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:01,521
Scott: And so The you know, and it's a thing we don't want to do.

337
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:06,062
Scott: So we're not gonna do it to get their votes And the other people just want to win.

338
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,595
Scott: They don't care what they do They only care about winning.

339
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:14,296
Scott: So that's who they keep voting for and they don't care what other things those, you know People they voted for do so.

340
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:40,542
Rym: What's even worse the American anti-abortion movement that movement originally came out of and is primarily actually driven by anti-black racism because where that movement came from was a bunch of schools that excluded black students were basically told that they cannot maintain their charitable status as schools like they can't be a charity anymore unless they integrate.

341
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:50,010
Rym: and the movement that forms Focusing on abortion formed out of the resistance to integration in schools primarily religious schools.

342
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:51,402
Scott: Yeah, there's.

343
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:55,681
Scott: there's like 10 billion You know, we could go on for a hundred years talking about the history of.

344
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:58,430
Scott: you know, the abortion issue in the United States.

345
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:05,683
Rym: Abortion is a 100% human right and if you disagree with that, I'd rather you not.

346
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:07,909
Scott: it's not any different from any other medical procedure.

347
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,109
Scott: It's only a special separate thing because some religious nutjobs decided to make it a special different thing for some.

348
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:14,350
Scott: you know.

349
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,343
Scott: Yeah, right, but I guess it's like banning abortion isn't any.

350
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:31,510
Rym: it's like you might as well say Ben, you know Appendectomy, it's like yep, so To not focus on that but just focus on what this news means and what it is and you can go read more from experts.

351
00:24:31,591 --> 00:24:31,976
Rym: But there's.

352
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:33,109
Rym: this is a lot.

353
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:43,252
Rym: a lot of really important things are gonna come out of this and you Have to internalize that things are gonna get way worse on this front before they because all the other shitty states are gonna do the Same thing.

354
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:48,870
Rym: pretty much everyone worse every Republican controlled state in America is gonna ban abortion in the coming few months.

355
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:52,425
Scott: And you have to realize, you know, it's like, you know, you're like, oh, okay.

356
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:53,730
Scott: Well, I don't care about those shitty states.

357
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,815
Scott: I'll stay in my good state.

358
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,930
Scott: you realize the shitty states are mostly not shitty people.

359
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,204
Scott: It's a minority of people in those states.

360
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:02,350
Rym: It's about half and half.

361
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:07,830
Scott: There are all of the red states also the majority of the people in those states, right?

362
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,898
Scott: That's where most of the black people live.

363
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,601
Scott: Yep.

364
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,590
Rym: Well, so there's two kinds of red state.

365
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:30,326
Rym: well, there's three kinds of red state but the two that matter for this conversation and this is something that a lot of Tech bro leftist progressives just erase or don't know or willfully ignore is that half of these red states are Almost entirely white and the far majority of the people there support a lot of what the public place

366
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:31,971
Scott: like like, Iowa Yeah,

367
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:32,974
Rym: or West Virginia.

368
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:35,982
Rym: West Virginia last I checked is like 94 percent white.

369
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:47,043
Rym: So the population there is low Yes but the other half of red states Wyoming are more like a 60/40 split like only 60% of the people there are vile monsters.

370
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,230
Rym: The other 40% are just trying to live their lives.

371
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:59,861
Scott: Well, it's not even that it's only in those days 60% of the voting people who aren't different because those states 60% of the people who successfully vote Yeah are vile monsters.

372
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:05,307
Scott: if you actually Had a vote of every person in the state and forced them to vote and so what kind of person they were?

373
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,940
Scott: a lot of Those states I think are probably actually not red

374
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:09,322
Rym: because

375
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:15,882
Scott: a lot of those dates gerrymandering Disenfranchisement, etc, etc, right, you know a lot

376
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:28,187
Rym: of those things have a very large non-white People that basically can't effectively vote because of voter restrictions that are only in place today Because the Supreme Court overturned the Voting Rights

377
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,759
Scott: Act anyway,

378
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,899
Rym: so Every red state is gonna ban abortion.

379
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:35,670
Rym: We can't stop it from blue states.

380
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:48,329
Rym: There is literally no way to stop this legally other than the Congress packing the Supreme Court meaning appointing more justices so that then they can just rerule on this and ban this.

381
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:58,303
Rym: or Congress passing a law guaranteeing access to abortion which which probably they could do which Probably would be overturned by the compromise Supreme Court.

382
00:26:58,544 --> 00:26:59,709
Rym: So we still have to pack the court.

383
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,084
Rym: Oh, yeah, the problem is to pack the court.

384
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:11,150
Rym: we need either 50 Democratic senators willing to overturn the filibuster and a president willing to pack the court.

385
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:25,770
Rym: We have you don't need to overcome the filibuster to because when it comes to You know filling this note because it's not just it's not just a point It is you you actually change the size of the court via a congressional action and then on that.

386
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:29,002
Scott: So that action but actually appointing people you don't need to.

387
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:41,808
Rym: but the changing the size you would yeah You need either 60 senators to agree to effectively overturn the filibuster and agree to pack the court or You need 50 senators plus the president to agree to do it.

388
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:52,590
Rym: And we only have 50 Democratic senators at least two of which are evil vile people Sinema and Manchin who refuse to do anything on anything that matters to America.

389
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:58,994
Rym: So as long as the Republicans are 100% opposed to this Democrats there is.

390
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:06,009
Scott: there is no way within the system of America following the rules That we can do it given the people that are there.

391
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:18,908
Rym: Yep Because to to fix voting rights so that the people who are disenfranchised in red states could vote You need those states to vote to remove the power of the people who currently control those states.

392
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:19,650
Rym: and guess what?

393
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,122
Rym: Those people are gonna vote they're gonna vote.

394
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:30,097
Scott: No Mmm, this is the fundamental problem not just with America but with all systems on the entire Human society.

395
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,010
Scott: is that just about every system we have?

396
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,590
Scott: Right puts the power to control the system in the hands of the people who are winning at the system.

397
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:43,643
Scott: Alright, so by winning you have the power to keep yourself winning.

398
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:57,990
Scott: whether it's voting money Business a board game, you know children's classroom games every single system on the whole face of the earth Most of the ones that are human society systems, right or even biological systems, you know.

399
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,094
Scott: It's like if you're a virus.

400
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:03,329
Scott: that's you know, if you start winning then you have the power to.

401
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:09,569
Scott: you know Control the ecosystem to make yourself more winning the way humans well and then destroy it to make yourself losing.

402
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:17,251
Scott: But that's you know, we had to overcome that fundamental rule Systems.

403
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:24,450
Scott: Yeah to where the winners aren't the people who control the environment in which the winning and losing takes place.

404
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,309
Rym: but that's it's actually a little subtly different here because what happens specifically in America?

405
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:36,270
Rym: because We have to marry that sort of theory with praxis and like the reality of a specific situation or there's no way to move forward.

406
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:49,170
Rym: There's a lot of great theories on how to fix this But the practical reality is that the problem literally comes down to the fact that American states Themselves get equal representation to each other despite having radically different populations.

407
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:51,996
Rym: Yep, that is the fundamental problem.

408
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:58,960
Rym: that literally prevents anything from being done about this and I think Non-legal action is what we need to do.

409
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:07,610
Rym: races and I saw a couple other groups Starting to pledge that they're going to keep performing abortions in Texas and just they're gonna do civil disobedience.

410
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:10,062
Scott: Yeah, that's obviously a good idea.

411
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,790
Rym: That's might be the only path.

412
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:20,202
Scott: The other thing we can do is here's the thing is you're there even if you know Organizations weren't doing abortions in a civil disobedient.

413
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:22,710
Scott: Like we're doing abortions, right?

414
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,989
Scott: We're sitting at the counter at Walgreens kind of way, right?

415
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,975
Scott: Abortions are happening in Texas.

416
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,883
Scott: No matter what the law is that would always have.

417
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,570
Scott: they would always continue to happen in Texas.

418
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,716
Rym: They happen whether

419
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:40,860
Scott: they're doctor Nick in the back room whether they're good doctor in the back room whether they're rich Person which right Republican

420
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:41,846
Rym: here's what's gonna have

421
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:44,094
Scott: it gets it done Anyway in secret rich

422
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:50,473
Rym: people in Texas even people who voted for this ban and wanted this ban will secretly get abortions in other states With their money.

423
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:51,957
Rym: poor people are just fucked.

424
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,903
Scott: or in Texas that you know, nothing's.

425
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:54,846
Scott: they're rich people.

426
00:30:54,947 --> 00:31:00,610
Rym: Yeah, so At least one thing that has happened to and I want to point this out in the news.

427
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:03,760
Rym: So the Denver guys actually responded pretty quickly.

428
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,007
Rym: The house is gonna vote soon.

429
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,110
Rym: They already put together.

430
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,754
Rym: They're finishing up a bill like as of today.

431
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:18,323
Rym: This is news that would guarantee abortion access nationally, of course The Senate won't pass it because the Senate is controlled by evil douchebags.

432
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,489
Rym: Nothing can pass the Senate right now literally nothing.

433
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:25,927
Rym: But the house remember Democrats only control the house by a couple seats.

434
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:32,010
Rym: And yeah They're gonna vote on this bill Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house.

435
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:39,053
Rym: Basically the way American system work is the whoever controls these chamber has full authority to decide anything that even makes the floor in that Chamber.

436
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:50,713
Rym: so because also a problem Yeah, but so because Democrats control the house they can put legislation down But they probably often won't if they know it won't pass because that usually just hurts them Electorally.

437
00:31:51,155 --> 00:32:00,390
Rym: the fact that Nancy Pelosi says they're gonna vote on this Like soon like this month as soon as possible to pass this bill means they have enough votes to pass it.

438
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:14,326
Rym: We know Pretty much every Republican is gonna vote against that meaning the Democrats in the US House Which represent a huge diverse chunk of America are in lockstep on this issue.

439
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:15,990
Rym: that is worth recognizing.

440
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:22,430
Scott: American Democrats have never been doesn't matter unless those two other people are in lockstep on the issue.

441
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:23,394
Rym: Oh, it seems like they are.

442
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:25,903
Rym: I'm saying that the yeah the other people in the Senate.

443
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:30,322
Rym: the problem with the Senate again Is that it doesn't actually represent the population.

444
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,890
Scott: we've said the same thing a thousand times.

445
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,599
Scott: Yes, it you know say pointing out the problem that we all know doesn't fix the problem cuz I think there's literally no way to Legally fix the problem.

446
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,669
Rym: I don't know what to do about it.

447
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:43,025
Scott: That's you said the same thing and we've all said the same thing for how many years?

448
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:45,254
Rym: alright, so then here's the question What do you do about this?

449
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:47,924
Rym: abortion is just gonna get banned in half this country, and there's nothing we can do I?

450
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,873
Scott: Think that's you know you.

451
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:59,312
Scott: I think that the the the thing you have to come to terms with is that you know we're sit There's there's problems, and there's Consequences.

452
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:04,026
Scott: right it's like what we're seeing isn't like oh, we're losing the game.

453
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:05,390
Scott: We lost the game a long time ago.

454
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,293
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

455
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:08,038
Scott: We've already lost your now.

456
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:09,522
Scott: We're just suffering the fight.

457
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:15,928
Rym: the final round of that game was when Al Gore Wrongly was not made president despite winning the popular vote.

458
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:22,630
Scott: All right, and it's like you know as long as the people who have the power aren't going to you know try.

459
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:26,470
Scott: It's like there is no within the system way.

460
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:31,330
Scott: So the question is are you willing to do an out-of-the-system way or not?

461
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,350
Scott: Yeah, right and each person will do what they're gonna do and history is gonna history.

462
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,584
Rym: Yeah, and what you can do in the show do so you.

463
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:38,410
Scott: so you you know.

464
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,570
Scott: But you the only thing that you can control is what you do.

465
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,153
Scott: You're just.

466
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,930
Scott: you know you're one person, and you know you can do something.

467
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,911
Scott: So you do what you're gonna Do.

468
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,934
Scott: you're one person.

469
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:49,536
Scott: that is you.

470
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:57,647
Scott: yeah, maybe convince other people and then with a podcast or something like that Yeah, and then you see what happens and then one day you die.

471
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,150
Rym: yep.

472
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,163
Rym: So what I would recommend you all do right now is the most immediate thing we have to deal with is the harm That's happening to people in Texas.

473
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:11,630
Rym: in these other states There are lots of charities that will help people get abortions if they need them and that is driving to another state.

474
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,708
Scott: You know do do what in the back?

475
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:14,552
Scott: Secret?

476
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:18,764
Rym: those are the organizations to donate to easy the speakeasy abortion.

477
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:27,969
Rym: you know what I'm saying is those are the organizations to donate to Now because the money you donate for political causes and other activism won't help those people for years.

478
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,899
Rym: So we got to focus on those people first mm-hmm.

479
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:41,292
Rym: So all I really have to say about that is I am definitely never setting foot in Texas again So long as all these laws are in place and if there's a bunch There's a lot.

480
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:45,630
Scott: I mean I was already not too happy about how many times I did set foot in day.

481
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,679
Rym: Yeah, so if there's a PAX South this coming year.

482
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,370
Rym: I will not be at it, but that's just one tiny thing.

483
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:56,748
Scott: I also think you know don't think they should have a PAX South in Texas given this situation.

484
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,609
Scott: right given I was already a after the gun situation.

485
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:10,201
Scott: You know busy, Texas was already at don't forget the anti-transgender rights bill that they just passed and the answer Between the last PAX South and now Texas went way over the line.

486
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:16,348
Rym: they passed over 600 individual Bills that restrict human rights in one way or another.

487
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:19,970
Rym: Mm-hmm like since the last time we were in Texas.

488
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:21,328
Scott: Yep.

489
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:31,581
Scott: So yeah, you know and I think we talked about how Major League Baseball moved over the voting thing moved the all-star game from you Know Atlanta to Colorado.

490
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,650
Scott: right, Texas is way worse.

491
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:42,409
Scott: I feel like we should pressure Not just you know packs and penny arcade which are close to us so we can pressure them I guess more because we're close to them at least in some way.

492
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:46,875
Scott: But we should pressure basically Every organization.

493
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:55,475
Scott: you know obviously not the ones that are like they're helping people right not those, but basically any capitalist Organization of any kind.

494
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:59,228
Scott: pressure them to fuck over, Texas as much as possible.

495
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:05,232
Scott: be like yeah You know and be like hey if you're gonna do business in the state of Texas Fuck you.

496
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:08,101
Scott: I also think we'll do anything to benefit that state.

497
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:16,920
Scott: bring that state down to you know ruin I think what would help there too, and I in a way that hurts in a way that hurts money Not a way that hurts the poor people living there.

498
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:30,161
Rym: so in terms of the latter part of that one angle we could take and I got to read more theory and like Read more from experienced activists to see if this would be helpful or not I think charities to help people who want to leave these states.

499
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:35,090
Rym: leave them help them find like money and Resources to move get a job in a blue state.

500
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:38,750
Rym: I think that would one reduce the harm to the people who are trapped in these states.

501
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,129
Scott: How about a purple state instead?

502
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,830
Rym: Oh, yeah I'm just well I said blue state first because I'm focusing more on their safety.

503
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,195
Rym: Then I'm just gonna fix this.

504
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:57,350
Scott: if we get all if all the good people of Texas move to like Ohio And to Ohio and Florida right take half the good people in Texas put them in, Ohio Take the other half put them in Florida problem solved.

505
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,246
Rym: That actually wouldn't get us enough Senate seats to pass the Voting Rights Act.

506
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:02,130
Scott: that would get us.

507
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,735
Rym: So we get us four more.

508
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,741
Rym: we need a level.

509
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,690
Rym: actually we need 12 more to get past cinema and mansion.

510
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:10,454
Scott: No, we don't we just need.

511
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,722
Scott: if we get four more we can eliminate the filibuster.

512
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:23,129
Rym: and no because no no we can't necessarily Because there is a lot of evidence that there's a bunch of Democrats at least I've seen like real people who no more brothers than me say between four and twelve who?

513
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:24,375
Rym: Will not?

514
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:27,007
Rym: I will absolutely not get rid of the filibuster because they're.

515
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:32,849
Rym: even if those Mansion and cinema we could expose them by what you described, right?

516
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,713
Scott: I don't know.

517
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:37,550
Scott: and once you knew who they were then if they're in blue states, then they can be outvoted.

518
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,140
Scott: Yeah, we can replace them with another right we can't replace.

519
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,710
Scott: You know mansion with it with a Democrat, right?

520
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,418
Scott: He's gonna get replaced.

521
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,250
Rym: Yeah, that scene is lost.

522
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,149
Scott: We have to pretend that's right to Republicans, but if it turns out that like, I don't know.

523
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,559
Scott: Well, yeah, what's?

524
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,910
Scott: who's a good example, right?

525
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,238
Scott: I mean we should get rid of her.

526
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,936
Scott: Anyway Feinstein in California Yeah, you know if she vote, you know, we can probably get rid of her if she votes Yeah, but then we run into stuff too.

527
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:00,939
Rym: Like, you know what?

528
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,450
Rym: The primary thing is holding up Medicare for all the two Connecticut senators.

529
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:06,194
Scott: Yeah, basically.

530
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:11,792
Rym: Yeah, they're Democrats, but that state makes all its money from a corrupt industry Mm-hmm.

531
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:18,770
Rym: So yeah America is in super deep shit right now And this is gonna get way worse over the next couple years.

532
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:22,997
Rym: Like this issue is not going to get better anytime soon Prepare for the worst.

533
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:23,660
Rym: like I'm not.

534
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,810
Scott: even the whole world is just getting worse, right?

535
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,476
Scott: What place on earth is?

536
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,823
Scott: are things on the upswing?

537
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:37,876
Rym: Uh Parts of Europe are doing better in a lot of ways Like where that's the best I can get.

538
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:40,765
Rym: honestly Germany is continuing to reach.

539
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,110
Scott: people on the beach are doing better.

540
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:42,512
Rym: Oh, yeah.

541
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,677
Rym: Yeah billionaires doing better.

542
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,710
Rym: Yeah, don't get me started on wealth caps again.

543
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:52,254
Rym: I think no human should have more than ten million dollars in assets, and I don't even think it should be like Oh, well tax you above that.

544
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,050
Rym: I think it should be a felony to be caught having that many assets.

545
00:38:57,056 --> 00:38:57,750
Scott: Sure, whatever.

546
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:03,960
Rym: anyway It's time for things of the day.

547
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:21,619
Rym: So the other day I was in a private discord Looking to respond to someone with a meme because someone quoted the the transit Advisor from SimCity 2000 who is iconic if you've never seen this guy and I wanted to post a meme of that guy.

548
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,248
Rym: So I looked for a SimCity 2000 like meme generator.

549
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:24,649
Rym: like you do.

550
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:26,996
Rym: That's way easier than photoshopping it.

551
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:31,470
Rym: someone did the work and what I discovered is a website called death generator calm.

552
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:42,570
Rym: It has like it has generators for So many old video games that it died about an hour and a half of just great fun using this thing last night.

553
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:43,861
Scott: And I did.

554
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:44,204
Scott: I did.

555
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:44,869
Scott: it was two nights ago.

556
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:45,968
Rym: Yeah, it was two nights ago.

557
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:56,056
Rym: But this thing is super fun if you want to make like Oregon Trail or Legend of Zelda or Doug memes like This meme generator is just a plus.

558
00:39:56,136 --> 00:39:56,938
Rym: It's well designed.

559
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:57,640
Rym: It's elegant.

560
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,687
Rym: It just works props to at food.

561
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:01,769
Rym: who made this thing?

562
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,450
Scott: Yeah, what a horrible night to have a meme generator.

563
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:11,190
Rym: Are you a bad enough dude to post topical appropriate memes and their respective channels?

564
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:19,610
Scott: Are you a bad enough dude to go from a serious topic about the you know end of human society to then talking about video game memes?

565
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:27,600
Rym: Ah, but I uh, if there's one thing that keeps me sane throughout the hellscape of my adult life It is the fact that I have computer still works.

566
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,050
Scott: You have your you have your foot bread and your circus.

567
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,511
Scott: It's it.

568
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:31,314
Rym: I have my bread.

569
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:38,202
Rym: I have my circus but more importantly I have a very dark sense of humor that That's not even festival from hell world.

570
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:39,550
Scott: That's for when I was a target to help you.

571
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,476
Scott: You got a scary clown circus.

572
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:45,450
Rym: not a fun clown circus, yeah, but I go to the scary clown circus and I'm kind of into it.

573
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,133
Rym: That's the difference.

574
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,341
Scott: I like the good clown circus.

575
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:48,944
Rym: I like both.

576
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,410
Scott: I like both scared of clowns.

577
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:57,856
Scott: I like both happy clown and terrifying clown equally and as long as the clown is here for me It's all about where the clown is talented.

578
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,370
Scott: right an untalented clown is sort of just really sad and disappointing.

579
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:03,690
Scott: But a really talented clown is like whoa, right?

580
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:16,050
Rym: They've got the juggling and their magic And unchallenged clown is actually scarier than a scary clown because an untalented clown is Someone whose life is probably also very sad and you can feel that sadness.

581
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,640
Scott: They got the mime skills.

582
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,270
Scott: a clown just got so many skills, right?

583
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,730
Scott: You look at someone like, you know, Charlie Chaplin with like all the physical humor.

584
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:23,213
Scott: That's like a -.

585
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,045
Scott: that's what a talented clown is right.

586
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:25,810
Scott: only live.

587
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,480
Rym: All I get it now is that that tweet from space twigs doctor.

588
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,604
Rym: The treatment is simple.

589
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:31,927
Rym: go see Orville.

590
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:33,832
Rym: very funny clown Pagliacci.

591
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:39,428
Rym: what about Pagliacci doctor Pagliacci, man, I could not name a more suck-ass clown.

592
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:47,335
Scott: just Haven't heard that one.

593
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:47,917
Scott: Oh, that's a good.

594
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,410
Scott: That's a good Pagliacci remix if I ever heard.

595
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:03,532
Scott: Okay, so one thing a clown might do is jump rope, I'm actually becoming a fan of jump rope lately Cardio.

596
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:04,738
Rym: like you think running's hard.

597
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,948
Rym: try jump roping at speed for ten minutes.

598
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:08,034
Scott: Good God I can't even.

599
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:09,605
Scott: I couldn't even jump rope for five minutes.

600
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:14,866
Scott: So Yeah, jump ropes are real cheap - I got one for a few bucks, right?

601
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,921
Scott: And it's just like yeah It's other than biking.

602
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:21,970
Scott: jump roping is fun Yeah, you know and you can exercise and fun or even a fake jump rope with this.

603
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:23,219
Scott: There's that app on the switch.

604
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:27,399
Scott: You can just fake jump rope with two Two joy cons with no string.

605
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,385
Scott: jump roping is getting a whole body workout.

606
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:30,027
Rym: And it's also.

607
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,845
Rym: it's difficult It's not easy to do.

608
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:34,962
Scott: Well Yeah, you'll I mean I can do it.

609
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:38,204
Scott: I just can't do it super well But you get but you get better very quickly with.

610
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:42,930
Scott: so it's a weird aside But it's not like ping-pong where you try a hundred times and you still can't you know, even get it.

611
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:55,068
Rym: In my elementary and middle schools on the playground we would often get engaged in jump rope offs and the way they would work is two people start jump roping and Basically, whoever can go the longest wins.

612
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,094
Scott: That was it We would do the.

613
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,029
Scott: you know, we would do the three people write two people on the ends hold the big one.

614
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:08,450
Scott: You know whenever that happened usually the turn turning around, you know doing it, you know, I could do a flip.

615
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,000
Rym: It's what you were doing more freestyle and we were doing technical.

616
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:18,250
Scott: some people could you know do the switch feet like left right left Right, some people would do like jump once but make the rope go under them like three times before they land.

617
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:21,452
Scott: I could do it two times before I land but not three time I could.

618
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,666
Rym: I never successfully did the two jump ropes at the same time ever.

619
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,319
Rym: I fell on my face 100% of the times I tried that.

620
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,304
Scott: Oh the double dutch.

621
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:28,786
Scott: Yeah, I can't do.

622
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:29,490
Rym: I can't do it at all.

623
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:36,010
Scott: I just but here in this thing of the day They're doing a shocking number of jump ropes at the same time.

624
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:42,588
Scott: In fact, it is a dangerous number of jump ropes at the same time so dangerous that there are two spotters Watching the person jumping.

625
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:46,286
Scott: I don't even understand really how this works.

626
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:46,910
Scott: Is this fake?

627
00:43:47,952 --> 00:43:50,866
Scott: I don't know what it is, but it's worth looking at and that's why it's a thing of the day.

628
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:58,385
Rym: So the top posts under this are that would fuck you up if you miss the jump the next place.

629
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:00,010
Scott: it would instant bondage.

630
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:05,422
Rym: Yes, it would Imagine failing a jump and being strangled right there in front of.

631
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:07,350
Scott: how do they even make the ropes for this fucking thing?

632
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:14,270
Rym: Imagine failing a jump and being just strangled there right in front of everyone by everyone.

633
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:17,261
Scott: Well, that's what it's two people to Russian and save you just standing there.

634
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:19,490
Rym: Yeah, I hope those two people have knives on them.

635
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:21,239
Scott: I think they probably.

636
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,130
Scott: I assume they do otherwise But you never know cuz this is like how I think really the impact of getting hit is really what's gonna mess you up?

637
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,857
Rym: Oh, yeah, especially cuz those jump ropes are so long And there's so many of them right?

638
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:35,826
Scott: It's like imagine you get whipped by one whip.

639
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:36,790
Scott: It's like ow, right?

640
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,130
Scott: You know if it's and these aren't getting whipped hard like someone's trying to you know, give you lashes, right?

641
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,177
Scott: They're just sort of going a little bit but it.

642
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:50,190
Scott: so it's sort of like a weak whip but a weak whip times that many Right plus the leverage of a long rope.

643
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:57,150
Scott: You know, there's a lot of leverage in there in give me a rope long enough and I'll move something.

644
00:44:57,371 --> 00:45:02,465
Rym: Yeah, so in the better moment, we will not be at PAX West which is ongoing this weekend.

645
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:06,130
Rym: This is the first PAX Anywhere in the United States?

646
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,258
Rym: We have not been to and presented at.

647
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,051
Rym: says it's happening physically since we started in 2008.

648
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,990
Rym: We've also presented at every virtual packs.

649
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:19,761
Rym: So Thus ends the streak officially as of today.

650
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,190
Scott: It's an arbitrary streak.

651
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:28,510
Scott: No, my health is more important than and even if the streak was a meaningful thing and not an arbitrary thing.

652
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:29,594
Scott: Oh, yeah, no regrets.

653
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:32,225
Scott: It is more important by like a billion.

654
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:33,410
Rym: Don't get me wrong though.

655
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:39,130
Rym: I broke the streak a year after you really when we didn't keep going to PAX Australia every year because I had ridiculous.

656
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:40,232
Scott: I have.

657
00:45:40,293 --> 00:45:43,425
Scott: no I have like, you know, you think oh you have this big long streak.

658
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:44,810
Scott: you think I'd be like upset about it.

659
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,038
Scott: It's like.

660
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,662
Rym: no I had a streak of over a decade.

661
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:52,650
Rym: go to Wildwood every year and I broke that streak for good reasons.

662
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:58,248
Scott: Yeah, I just you know, it's like, you know, it's not a big deal arbitrary numbers and things don't mean any.

663
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:58,509
Scott: you know.

664
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:58,931
Scott: It's like.

665
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,341
Scott: what means something, you know, it means something being healthy.

666
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:05,870
Scott: No one that I know and care about I mean some people I know and care about got COVID, right?

667
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:14,316
Scott: But you know for the most part the damage that I and people I care about have suffered has been way less than what other People have done for which I'm thankful.

668
00:46:14,798 --> 00:46:17,407
Scott: I'll give up fucking PAX forever in exchange for that.

669
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:18,309
Scott: So I don't give a shit.

670
00:46:18,932 --> 00:46:28,204
Rym: Yep, our last PAX panel, which was a PAX East Online 2021 Camp PAX Atari game design is just on YouTube slides and notes.

671
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:29,267
Rym: Everything is just there.

672
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:29,910
Rym: You can just watch it.

673
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:31,966
Rym: You don't have to wait for PAX to post a VOD or whatever.

674
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:32,309
Rym: They're gonna do.

675
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:34,917
Rym: Book Club book is still the tale of Genji.

676
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:44,530
Rym: I haven't read any since the last show we did but that was only two days ago, so hey, but uh, I think definitely gonna finish it within a month or two because I'm steamrolling along.

677
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,930
Scott: and Well, I guess I guess I'll start reading.

678
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:54,650
Scott: I think the thing the thing that's actually motivating me is like there's these other books I've discovered that I want to read but I feel guilty reading a book that's not good.

679
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:56,949
Rym: Oh the book I picked for the next book is you pick Genji.

680
00:46:57,952 --> 00:47:01,369
Scott: I know the book you pick for the next book is a book that I very badly want to.

681
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:08,530
Scott: yes Wait, I wanted to wait to read it until it's series that it is in is completely done.

682
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,063
Scott: No, I'm just gonna be the boys.

683
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:10,709
Scott: You know, I hate.

684
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:16,989
Rym: Yeah, though if you the thing is this author we know we'll finish what they start quickly.

685
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:20,159
Scott: Well, oh, yeah, and he will end in our you know, hopefully right?

686
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,125
Scott: Well, we are Scott backer.

687
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,610
Rym: Well, what's going on, buddy?

688
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,435
Rym: Nothing ever come on, buddy.

689
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,460
Scott: I assume it's done.

690
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,224
Scott: I assume that's it.

691
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:29,396
Scott: We're not getting anymore buddy You got it.

692
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:30,423
Rym: you got a good I got it.

693
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:31,390
Rym: you got to explain.

694
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,358
Scott: I mean, I'm a piece of the fact we're not getting any.

695
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:38,421
Rym: I am confident that Cal moments with a C and Cal moments with a K. that is not a coincidence.

696
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:45,670
Rym: I'm gonna die on that hill and The only way you can prove me wrong is to publish a goddamn book or I guess come on the show and tell us what?

697
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,737
Rym: The ending was gonna be otherwise.

698
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:52,787
Scott: while we're talking about books just real quick I want to call out the shenanigans that Amazon is doing, you know, they're doing lots of shenanigans.

699
00:47:52,968 --> 00:48:01,922
Scott: Oh, yeah, but If you add a book to your wish list on Amazon, right which I have done What they'll do is sometimes they'll send you this email.

700
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,570
Scott: That's like, hey, I see you got the book on your wish list.

701
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:06,842
Scott: All right, you want to buy the Kindle version of the book?

702
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:07,405
Scott: I know you do.

703
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:08,250
Scott: you got on your wish list?

704
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:09,062
Scott: I know you want to read it.

705
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:12,037
Scott: I know Here's five dollars.

706
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:18,780
Scott: if you buy that book within the next seven days We will discount the price on the e-book by five dollars.

707
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,570
Rym: That's like the Sunday super shopper special, right?

708
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,025
Scott: But it's like specifically for you because it was on your wish list.

709
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:28,077
Scott: in seven days You have to and it's like.

710
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:28,681
Scott: it's like fuck.

711
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:29,789
Scott: I do want to read that book.

712
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,138
Scott: I'm gonna read it one day or at least I think I am.

713
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:33,845
Scott: if I don't buy it now.

714
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,250
Scott: I'm losing five bucks.

715
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,210
Scott: I'm just giving Jeff Bezos five.

716
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,487
Rym: Don't buy now don't buy something unless you're imminently about to use it.

717
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:45,830
Scott: That's of course my policy and that is of course why I'm not buying it.

718
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,560
Scott: But that's an evil.

719
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:56,146
Scott: whoever came up with that evil dirty trick I got a guess at Amazon that person probably got promoted like ten times for that trick And that trick should be illegal.

720
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:02,150
Rym: also My guess is that someone in Amazon just took some training on modern pricing methodologies.

721
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:07,650
Scott: Whoever I'm saying whoever implemented that system that does that should go to jail and it should be illegal.

722
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:11,885
Rym: That doesn't bother me nearly as much as gacha mechanics in games and pay-to-win.

723
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:13,310
Scott: I'm just saying is bad.

724
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,890
Rym: I mean, I'm more mad that Pokemon unite is a terrible game because of pay-to-win than I am about that.

725
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:20,701
Scott: I'm listening.

726
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:26,930
Rym: It's just another thing In the world someday, we'll get power and we'll break Amazon into a million pieces.

727
00:49:27,872 --> 00:49:28,315
Scott: What the book?

728
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:29,120
Scott: one will still be doing?

729
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,610
Scott: the evil shit the book company.

730
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:32,800
Rym: But if they were just a book company, they would.

731
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:36,027
Rym: the other book companies could compete with them maybe.

732
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:38,343
Rym: Well, we could probably see.

733
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:38,969
Rym: here's the other thing.

734
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:44,570
Rym: Remember my my praxis and I haven't talked to this a lot on GeekNights, but I'm not gonna derail this.

735
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,962
Rym: we're getting right into the main bed, but Here my main thing is we can't just become communists like.

736
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,430
Rym: there's no non-violent way to make that just happen.

737
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:53,597
Rym: I mean as much as I want that.

738
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,416
Rym: the pragmatic for approach is You make public options.

739
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:04,743
Rym: you start with things that make a lot of sense to a lot of people like oh, yeah Public utility public health care, whatever, but then you start edging into.

740
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,550
Rym: there's the government game company.

741
00:50:06,952 --> 00:50:11,214
Rym: There's the government silverware company government streaming service Free markets.

742
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:14,447
Scott: welcome to compete with that government option have a government streaming service.

743
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:15,050
Scott: It's called library.

744
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:24,190
Scott: That doesn't let you that doesn't stream you on a public platform that the library There are the library has like a thing that you can log into and watch a fucking ton of movies.

745
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:30,264
Rym: No, no, I'm talking publishing streams not in this case Me making a stream out to the world.

746
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:31,833
Scott: Oh, I Was.

747
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:32,918
Rym: that was what I was referring to?

748
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:35,469
Rym: Otherwise, yes, you were correct if you think about the opposite end of that.

749
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:38,790
Rym: But yeah If thanks, there should be a public out the public bookstore.

750
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:40,638
Rym: Amazon has to compete with the government.

751
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,064
Rym: one and guess what the government won't.

752
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:46,004
Rym: let you say our books are free We just pay the authors and we give the books away for free.

753
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:46,990
Rym: Fuck you Amazon.

754
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:49,470
Rym: That's how you get to communism.

755
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:57,870
Rym: Anyway, anyway Genji continues to have no job other than sleeping with ladies after telling them poetry.

756
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,936
Scott: What a job though.

757
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:24,670
Rym: of everything I've read up to this point the funniest moment still is from Moderates like it's still in the first third of the book But it just stands out of the moment when he's trying to woo that one woman and he's incognito and then he sees someone else in the area who's also incognito and he Realizes that that dude is trying to woo the same woman and then they bump into each other and they're both like what the fuck?

758
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,176
Rym: Are you doing?

759
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,210
Rym: what the fuck are you doing?

760
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:33,513
Rym: Nobody can see either of us here and they sneak back into the court and pretend they'd been there the whole time Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,049
Rym: I think that's the funniest thing that's happened in the book so far.

762
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,140
Scott: Yeah, it's not exactly a comedy.

763
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:40,089
Rym: Yeah, but funny things like that happen.

764
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:44,710
Rym: So Outerwear, I heard you had some trouble with your rain jacket yesterday.

765
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,127
Scott: Well, yeah, so my strategy because I was going to the tennis and didn't know the situation there.

766
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,016
Scott: apparently You know, I could have.

767
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:55,501
Scott: just you know, I was like, well, let's not bring any bags Let's not even bring a camera with a big lens.

768
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,350
Scott: Who knows what they're gonna let me do, right?

769
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:59,864
Scott: Let's go with as minimal things as possible.

770
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:05,610
Scott: I know it's gonna rain Yeah, but I'm not gonna bring an umbrella because I know you're usually not allowed to open it at the tennis because it blocks people's.

771
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:08,318
Scott: Let's not even bring umbrellas.

772
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:09,889
Scott: Let's just wear our raincoats.

773
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,339
Scott: They'll keep us dry if we get rained on.

774
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:13,705
Scott: well, we don't have anything on us.

775
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:14,950
Scott: So who gives a shit if we get wet?

776
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:15,392
Scott: Right.

777
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:15,733
Scott: We'll just.

778
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:22,850
Scott: we'll just walk home wet and then change we get home And well, you know in a raincoat will keep us dry enough that it won't be intolerable.

779
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:30,949
Scott: So my raincoat that I wore was basically, you know this $20 effectively sheet of plastic.

780
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:36,110
Scott: ish It's like a synthetic cloth and inside the synthetic cloth is basically like a rubbery coating.

781
00:52:36,673 --> 00:52:37,718
Scott: You know, I got a Uniqlo for like 20.

782
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:43,256
Rym: so I have one question for you is it slightly stretchy Or is it completely rigid?

783
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,883
Rym: Can you stretch it a little or not at all?

784
00:52:44,903 --> 00:52:47,294
Scott: I Don't know I had to go.

785
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:48,118
Scott: I'm just curious.

786
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:50,649
Rym: go look is that sounds like cheapo soft shell?

787
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:58,230
Scott: So, you know, we went to the tennis and surprisingly didn't get really wet at the tennis And then we went out to eat dinner with some friends, right?

788
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:02,890
Scott: We got a little bit rain on the way when we were walking to the food place to the restaurant.

789
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:05,590
Scott: But you know, it was fine walking into the restaurant.

790
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:12,950
Scott: But when we were at the restaurant outdoor dining, but with a roof over us right to keep us dry, but still outdoors It was so, you know acceptable.

791
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:15,229
Scott: That's when the big rain came.

792
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:20,990
Scott: And you know, we waited to leave the restaurant until the raid died down a little bit and then we left.

793
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:25,273
Scott: But of course on the walk the rain picked up Came down.

794
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:28,102
Scott: We basically got completely soaked and my shoes are completely soaked.

795
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:31,255
Scott: I expected that I knew that was gonna happen Short-soaked.

796
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:33,005
Scott: I expected that before I left the house.

797
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:33,849
Scott: I was okay with that.

798
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:36,867
Scott: You know, it's just fine with all those situations.

799
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:49,609
Scott: but while I'm walking My shirt not that not the raincoat thing the shirt that was completely covered by the raincoat I felt water going down my back and I'm like how the fuck is this water getting in there?

800
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:50,631
Scott: Right.

801
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:53,010
Scott: Yeah water has gotten in there all I've been in the ring already.

802
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,299
Rym: The answer is from the very beginning when you said that.

803
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:57,629
Rym: when you said the words, I'm gonna quote you.

804
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:03,656
Scott: Yeah Somehow my shirt was getting wet.

805
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:05,402
Scott: even you know, it didn't it?

806
00:54:05,803 --> 00:54:10,219
Scott: this thing kept me dry for quite a while But not forever.

807
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,050
Scott: eventually I was getting wet.

808
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,381
Scott: So what happened is when I got onto the train.

809
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:20,964
Scott: finally when we were nice and dry on the subway train I Realized hey because it's a blue.

810
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:21,689
Scott: It's a blue coat.

811
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:26,029
Scott: There were like these blue specks on my hands and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

812
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:32,130
Scott: Thing was like fucking disintegrating from like the inside into little bits and then the water was getting through.

813
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:34,279
Scott: I was like this thing is totally shot.

814
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,123
Scott: I just got to throw it out.

815
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:35,866
Scott: It's useless now.

816
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:39,334
Rym: Yeah Like it sucks that.

817
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:40,738
Rym: the reality of the world is this.

818
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:50,307
Rym: but especially with outerwear like sports outerwear or weather protection outerwear The more expensive ones are better but not just are they better up to a certain point.

819
00:54:50,367 --> 00:55:03,110
Rym: up to a certain point obviously but they are better to a Shocking degree like So for example, I I wear like a couple hundred dollars ski jacket a hard shell like serious a normal price.

820
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:04,556
Rym: Yeah, that is not.

821
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:05,942
Rym: it's not waterproof at all.

822
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:07,890
Rym: You want an actual waterproof ski jacket.

823
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:12,930
Rym: You're spending middle 500 plus now 800 just for the top and it's uninsulated.

824
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,329
Rym: Then you have to buy all the other layers separately and then buy the bib and the overall separately as well.

825
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:27,262
Rym: it's like the Gulf between pretty good and Actually, like fully good is so wide with this kind of stuff.

826
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:28,807
Scott: Well also what's you know?

827
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,510
Scott: good it's you know Good enough right for what you're doing.

828
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:39,750
Scott: It's like you can pay for more and more levels But really the $200 level for walking around is gonna be perfect for anybody.

829
00:55:39,856 --> 00:55:41,375
Rym: Yeah But like for skiing.

830
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:44,770
Rym: if you're skiing like a lot or doing like out like backcountry skiing.

831
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:51,008
Rym: That's $200 is not good enough because it's dangerous to use something so weak compared to a quote.

832
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:51,710
Rym: real solution.

833
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:56,204
Scott: So yeah, it really depends on the more you pay the more you pay right you get.

834
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,545
Scott: a you're warmer Yeah, B your dryer.

835
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:07,618
Scott: Yeah C you're gonna be less like sweaty and shit cuz you're gonna get like some nice, you know, like Breathe more.

836
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:08,868
Rym: it's like design better.

837
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:09,811
Scott: Yeah It's breathe.

838
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:12,100
Scott: it breathes better or wicks or who knows what it's.

839
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,930
Rym: usually but not always it'll last longer because I can talk about.

840
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,410
Rym: one Of the jacket I own is extremely expensive.

841
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:24,410
Rym: It's also extremely fragile But it serves a very different use case because it weighs nothing and I can get arrested.

842
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,948
Rym: I can compress it into a ball about the size and shape of my cell phone.

843
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:31,162
Scott: Yeah, when you pay more you're getting more durability, right?

844
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:32,026
Scott: You're getting more comfort.

845
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:35,977
Scott: You're getting better Design, it looks cooler right more fashion.

846
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:40,450
Scott: You're getting you know possible, you know crumple ability like Rym just said.

847
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,770
Scott: Yeah, you're also getting lighter, right?

848
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:47,150
Scott: It's like you could pay, you know, like get a really warm coat that for really cheap.

849
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,929
Scott: That's gonna keep you nice and toasty all winter and but it'll be like big puffy boy like poof poof.

850
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,343
Scott: Yeah, you can also get something that's like ultra thin and weighs nothing.

851
00:56:56,845 --> 00:57:07,265
Scott: It feels like I'm wearing nothing at all But somehow it's keeping you warm like it's a big puffy coat or a blanket.

852
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:08,349
Scott: like how the hell is it doing?

853
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:10,053
Scott: well they They Filled it with u.s.

854
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:10,996
Scott: Dollars, that's what's happening.

855
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:11,920
Rym: Yeah, that's right.

856
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,530
Scott: You're insulating with with pictures of dead.

857
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:21,088
Rym: the listener chimed in like Scott strikes me as a raincoat kind of guy which is true.

858
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:28,136
Rym: cuz what my first reaction when you said oh, I got wet my raincoat is that I Personally hate raincoats.

859
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:31,570
Rym: like the idea that I would wear a coat to keep myself dry just seems silly.

860
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:38,942
Rym: I had to use an umbrella or I get wet and raise my umbrella - No, well because I grew up in a place.

861
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:40,610
Scott: you see you you changed your mind.

862
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,392
Rym: Yeah you know why.

863
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,825
Rym: cuz I live in a place where I walk everywhere and I live in New York.

864
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:50,440
Rym: when I used to not live in New York when I lived in Michigan or even when I lived in the suburbs, I Never needed to go outside in the rain.

865
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,250
Rym: And when I did I only really needed to get to my car.

866
00:57:52,392 --> 00:57:55,661
Rym: I just run for it Like I wouldn't get that wet not wet enough to matter.

867
00:57:56,123 --> 00:58:05,195
Rym: when I grew up like no one ever used an umbrella they Someone would like drop you off in front of the mall and then like one person in the family would have one giant umbrella just To get themselves in.

868
00:58:05,517 --> 00:58:09,717
Rym: no one else have had an umbrella or even owned one half the time We had umbrellas.

869
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:10,421
Rym: Yeah, we didn't.

870
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:12,412
Rym: it's just a thing in Michigan I guess.

871
00:58:12,513 --> 00:58:18,477
Rym: but I guess my point is a raincoat that Sands umbrella can keep you connects.

872
00:58:18,497 --> 00:58:19,440
Scott: Thursday umbrellas.

873
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,165
Scott: All right next keep going seems.

874
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,650
Rym: Oh, I got opinions on umbrellas.

875
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,141
Rym: They got that fancy when I imported.

876
00:58:24,262 --> 00:58:24,806
Scott: Yeah, we'll do it.

877
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:27,223
Rym: Not now That umbrella is so good.

878
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:27,829
Rym: But yeah, not now.

879
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,929
Rym: Restrain how it's how much I love that fucking umbrella that I paid $100 to import from Europe.

880
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,324
Rym: Anyway, I was hundred dollars in import plus what it actually cost.

881
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:55,985
Rym: It was a. this was a expensive of a brand Mm-hmm, and it's the second one because the first one I bought got stolen anyway, so If I wear a coat that in driving rain would keep the top of me dry but the rest of me gets wet I feel like there's zero value in that.

882
00:58:56,045 --> 00:59:07,479
Rym: if my pants are wet, I don't care if the rest of me is wet and rain gear that would keep my body effectively completely dry is Stupid unless I'm out in the backcountry hiking.

883
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,124
Rym: We're away from civilization.

884
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:13,257
Rym: Like I'm not willing obviously because Gear that can keep you completely dry.

885
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:17,009
Rym: It kind of like the security paradox of more security means more pain in the ass.

886
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:20,220
Rym: More dryness means less comfort.

887
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:21,905
Rym: That's just how it works.

888
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:23,330
Rym: You want to be completely dry?

889
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,778
Rym: You're wearing something that hermetically seals your body.

890
00:59:25,818 --> 00:59:27,805
Rym: Guess what that shit sucks to wear.

891
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:31,820
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't interesting on you Really interesting to being completely dry.

892
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,563
Scott: that's not right.

893
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:36,169
Scott: It's like I bet you like I said when I left the house I sacrificed my shoes socks.

894
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:40,290
Scott: I wore shorts because I knew that jeans would get soggy and uncomfortable even though a little bit cold.

895
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,239
Rym: So you understood your threat profile like what you were seeking here?

896
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,830
Scott: Yeah, it's like I just need enough of me to be dry.

897
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,622
Scott: Right, you know so that I can you know walk around if I'm.

898
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:56,134
Scott: just if I was just out there with you know Nothing, it would be like that would be horrible Uncomfortable and Cold.

899
00:59:56,194 --> 01:00:07,402
Rym: and because that then it gets into because outerwear from one definition could just mean whatever the furthest out layer of clothes you have on is and If you go to any clothing store.

900
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:10,877
Scott: if you click on the outerwear section You're gonna see raincoats.

901
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:16,402
Scott: winter coats had a little like jackets hoodies Or outerwear hoodie some.

902
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:17,750
Scott: sometimes you'll see hoodies in there.

903
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:27,150
Scott: Sometimes you'll see it in a different section But usually when they say outerwear they mean jackets and occasionally it'll be something like snow pants depending on the website.

904
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:32,862
Scott: Yeah, that might qualify but usually it's various jackets for different situations, right,

905
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:43,730
Rym: but I guess what I'm getting out there is that I Wear if I'm gonna get wet like if I go outside hiking like I don't bring rain gear Even if I'm going on a very long hike or camping expedition.

906
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:55,249
Rym: What I bring is I wear outerwear and clothes that are themselves expensive and beyond the scope of the show That are wicking and designed to get wet and dry quickly and I just let myself get wet.

907
01:00:56,133 --> 01:01:05,110
Rym: But if I were not wearing that specialized clothing Which I don't want to wear in normal circumstances Like I wouldn't wear that at a pecs because that kind of clothing has other problems.

908
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:07,779
Rym: It smells bad way earlier than normal clothes.

909
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,063
Rym: Like it's harder to wash.

910
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:09,886
Rym: It's more expensive.

911
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,210
Rym: It wears out faster.

912
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:13,663
Rym: It's not that fashionable like.

913
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:14,869
Rym: there's a lot of other reasons there.

914
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:19,610
Rym: But if I was wearing like a packs t-shirt and jeans and I got soaked.

915
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,255
Rym: Absolute misery.

916
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:24,169
Rym: that is that is one of the most miserable situations you can be in.

917
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:34,850
Scott: I mean forgetting, you know the current world situation where you know A lot of jackets are like inherited from the sporting outdoors world and brought down into the fashion world.

918
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:42,230
Scott: You look at how many people in you know, New York City the fashionable thing is to wear a Canada Goose jacket Which is originally meant for like trekking around in the Arctic.

919
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:47,676
Scott: $500 like a fashion statement.

920
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:52,130
Rym: Yeah 500 but contrast that because the jacket is still aimed as a fashion accessory.

921
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:56,103
Rym: $500 doesn't even buy you close to the jacket.

922
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:57,650
Rym: You need to go trekking around in the Arctic.

923
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,850
Scott: Well, I mean people did go trekking around the Arctic with those jackets.

924
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:02,950
Scott: Oh, yeah company the same jackets.

925
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,290
Scott: But obviously if you're doing it now you would buy a higher-end model from that company.

926
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:16,900
Rym: Like I. just it's a thought that runs through my head every time I ski because I put on all this outerwear like jackets and gloves and everything and I Just and I don't even have the most expensive stuff.

927
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,136
Rym: Like I said, I use a normal ass ski jacket I use like crappy.

928
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:20,779
Scott: you have better.

929
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:23,370
Scott: you have better than what rich people had last century.

930
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:34,050
Rym: Yep like I have better equipment on me to walk through the snow to buy groceries in the winter than Anyone in the HMS Terror and Erebus expedition had when they went to the pole and died.

931
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:38,650
Scott: Yep, pretty much but yeah, you know forgetting about that sort of jacket, right?

932
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:45,874
Scott: there's all kinds of other kinds and the purpose of most jackets really if you think about it is Temporary shirt.

933
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:46,356
Rym: Yep.

934
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:56,109
Scott: It's like you put a shirt on your body to you know Just cover your torso when you're going outside because that's a normal thing to do and you can't really take that off.

935
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:07,033
Scott: But sometimes right you're gonna be going you're gonna be leaving your clear wardrobe behind and venturing into the world And you're going to encounter Different temperature.

936
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:10,106
Scott: right if you're just going to a single place with one temperature, right?

937
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:14,621
Scott: I'm going for a walk outside You know then you can you could.

938
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,910
Scott: you don't need a jacket like this temporary shirt.

939
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:25,107
Scott: You could just shirt yourself appropriately with permanent shirts or at least, you know the kind you're not gonna take off While you're on that walk and then come home.

940
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,270
Scott: The jacket is because I'm going to go outside and it's gonna be cold.

941
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:33,370
Scott: So I'll put this extra shirt on but it has a big ol zipper in the front or buttons or something.

942
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:38,049
Scott: And then when I get where I'm going, I'll take it off and that won't be getting naked.

943
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:50,350
Scott: And when I leave but it's like people, you know, it's something everyone just inherently knows But you don't really think about it in terms, you know in that in that way because it's such a natural thing You know examine it closely.

944
01:03:50,450 --> 01:04:01,144
Scott: But like that's what a jacket is the temporary like plus shirt that you you know can take on and off Appropriately at different locations to adjust your temperature level.

945
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:02,970
Rym: Hmm our case in point.

946
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:06,002
Rym: But it can be inverted like so I Pat and a PAX.

947
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:07,608
Rym: the jacket is just like PAX East.

948
01:04:07,668 --> 01:04:11,930
Rym: in the winter It's just to get me to that building and then the jacket is just a liability.

949
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:16,589
Rym: I don't want to carry it with me so I can hang it up somewhere I can leave it somewhere and come back to it.

950
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:18,617
Scott: The coat hook was invented.

951
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:20,526
Rym: Yeah, the coat hook or the coat check.

952
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:27,390
Rym: I I always I do actually really like using coat checks and I find a lot of people avoid them.

953
01:04:27,714 --> 01:04:32,470
Rym: but the caveat is Any large event the coat check is more trouble than it's worth.

954
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,590
Scott: It depends on how the coach at PAX that coat check is a fucking nightmare.

955
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:48,449
Scott: I'm so always if I if I'm thinking about a coat check if I see one and it would be advantageous to me I scope it first to see how it's operating and I try to predict like is it going to be a shit show?

956
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:55,190
Scott: when I Try to leave, you know, then I that and I make my decision, you know How shitty will it be if I have to hold on to this coat the whole time?

957
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,374
Scott: Etc.

958
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:58,150
Rym: And then also there's another point here.

959
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:07,041
Rym: This is a very different situation from the things that I usually do of going out to the wilderness or doing some crazy sport where it's all about layering like.

960
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:17,863
Rym: I'm not gonna layer to a PAX with like multiple different levels of like shirt outer shirt fourth shirt jacket because I don't need that many levels of clothing and comfort to switch between.

961
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:30,010
Rym: and The key of a jacket is that it's very easy to take on and put it to put on and take off Compared to like a secondary base layer that I have to like peel up over my head or deal with in some way.

962
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:31,716
Scott: I get to think about.

963
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:35,250
Scott: think about the layers when it comes to not outdoors enos, right?

964
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,400
Scott: But think about the layers for formal wear, right?

965
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,866
Scott: So it's like you got a shirt right.

966
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:40,194
Scott: the dress shirt That's the.

967
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,100
Scott: that's the thing.

968
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:42,530
Scott: The dress shirt is the thing.

969
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:46,270
Rym: Yeah, you usually have an undershirt under the dress shirt to protect the shirt, right?

970
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:58,290
Scott: It's a shirt that makes you look good But you put a shirt under it so that you a can't see through the dress shirts material to your hairy body or whatever Your body looks like and B to keep your sweat from messing up the dress shirt.

971
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,253
Scott: It's a dressy shirt.

972
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:03,770
Scott: Then you got a dress coat that goes over the dress shirt.

973
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:10,753
Scott: You can take it off and you will usually but it looks a lot nicer if you have that coat on right like your tuxedo Coat or whatever.

974
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:14,170
Scott: so, you know, you'll have that on during your ceremonies and whatever.

975
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,390
Scott: But you might take it off when you're sitting down to eat dinner.

976
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:25,944
Rym: Go to any wedding, but it's everyone all the all the all the people who wear suits are wearing suits And once they sit down for dinner 90% of those suits get unbuttoned and they're hung over the back of the chair.

977
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:31,503
Rym: and now you only got a vest on Exactly, and then let's not even talk about the vest right?

978
01:06:31,544 --> 01:06:32,186
Scott: But here's the thing.

979
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:33,070
Scott: What are the kind of bonds?

980
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,470
Scott: Well, that's not a part of the jacket.

981
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:39,650
Scott: So the jacket right, but this is a dress jacket.

982
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,590
Scott: It's like a sport jacket or a suit coat or who knows we all tuxedo coat something like that.

983
01:06:43,952 --> 01:06:44,597
Scott: That is not.

984
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:46,149
Scott: I mean it does keep you pretty warm.

985
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:49,546
Scott: And if it's a little chilly outside like in the fall, that's perfect.

986
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:50,150
Scott: That's sufficient.

987
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:55,467
Scott: But if it's gonna rain or something, well you this is such a dressy coat.

988
01:06:55,547 --> 01:06:56,472
Scott: It's not just a coat That's.

989
01:06:56,492 --> 01:06:57,869
Rym: you can't let water touch that thing.

990
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:03,530
Scott: So now you need like the trench coat or something now right to go over that shit.

991
01:07:04,012 --> 01:07:07,230
Scott: Right and that trench coat is what the coat check was for.

992
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:13,883
Scott: Yeah So that when you show up at the Broadway show or the dinner party or whatever the fuck it the concert at the opera Whatever the fuck it is, right?

993
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:19,950
Scott: It's like you're gonna be wearing your fancy jacket while you're sitting and watching or doing or whatever because that's what looks good.

994
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:26,490
Scott: But you had to wear this raincoat that protected your dress coat and you don't want to bring that around with you.

995
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,933
Scott: It's all soaking wet and they didn't have better technology than trench coat in 1940 50 something.

996
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:34,402
Scott: but also that is what you give to the to the coat check.

997
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:43,560
Rym: so less fancy jackets like a sport jacket or A blazer blazer or the top of a leisure suit like that kind of stuff Partly because of my job and also just because I like them.

998
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,788
Rym: like I wear those a lot in my daily life like when I'm Like pre-covid times like when I'm going out.

999
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,566
Rym: But those are different because they're designed to be worn every day.

1000
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:55,966
Rym: So Until it's too cold to do this usually in the winter.

1001
01:07:56,086 --> 01:07:56,810
Rym: I don't wear a coat.

1002
01:07:57,312 --> 01:08:01,839
Rym: I just wear a heavy sport jacket on my way to and from work with like Scarf and that's it.

1003
01:08:01,899 --> 01:08:03,390
Rym: Like I don't actually wear like a coat.

1004
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:05,800
Rym: I actually don't own that many coats.

1005
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,500
Rym: Like if I look at what I own I have one Insulated trench coat.

1006
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:10,770
Rym: that is my winter coat.

1007
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,693
Rym: I fucking love that thing.

1008
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:18,269
Rym: trench coats long coats are the best if you're not doing a sport Because they keep your legs warm too.

1009
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:20,857
Rym: They hold in so much heat like.

1010
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:25,368
Rym: it's hard for me to imagine not living my life without a long coat in the winter.

1011
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:27,536
Rym: It's my favorite kind of coat.

1012
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,045
Rym: I used to wear dusters, but that's cuz.

1013
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,370
Rym: I was awesome in high school.

1014
01:08:31,531 --> 01:08:35,669
Rym: I do like dusters, but the long insulated jacket is what I actually need.

1015
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:39,341
Scott: Let's talk about some like different coat styles, right?

1016
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,325
Scott: So one coat style.

1017
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:46,886
Scott: I actually like a lot Is like the bomber jacket style where it's like, oh, I like those in middle school.

1018
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:48,090
Rym: I'm not a big fan anymore.

1019
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,296
Scott: It's a little bit insulated, right?

1020
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:51,301
Scott: It's kind of styling.

1021
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:52,926
Rym: you can really puffy like.

1022
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:53,990
Rym: you have a big puff around you.

1023
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:57,078
Scott: Sometimes they're puffy, but sometimes they're not so puffy.

1024
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,625
Scott: It depends on which one you get.

1025
01:08:58,665 --> 01:08:59,870
Scott: There's various levels of puff.

1026
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:05,590
Scott: They have those like a ribbed sort of cuffs around the arm the arms usually in the waist area.

1027
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:06,576
Scott: It's sort of keep it tight.

1028
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:08,529
Scott: So winds not coming in there and stuff.

1029
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:13,859
Scott: the thing I don't like about those is Pulling up the sleeves is kind of meh on them.

1030
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,709
Scott: Some of them have zip-off sleeves actually, but not too many.

1031
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:25,029
Rym: the only bomber jackets I actually did really like and still kind of like are the ones that look like what they came from an actual bomber jacket.

1032
01:09:25,636 --> 01:09:26,728
Scott: Yeah, most of them look like that.

1033
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:33,630
Rym: There seemed to be a whole bunch of fashion jackets called bomber jackets that look nothing like bomber jackets.

1034
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,801
Rym: Lot of people are calling things bomber jackets.

1035
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:39,551
Rym: that I would not consider a bomber jacket Usually.

1036
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:46,407
Scott: what the the one that William Gibson made famous is the one that you know is really popular and then most people are modeling it After that one, right?

1037
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,447
Rym: So but now I'm talking about the ones like the traditional.

1038
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:58,161
Rym: one is Brown with fur or fake fur around like the cuffs and around the neck and it zips up in the front and it's puffy and A lot of leather and that's pretty much it.

1039
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:01,686
Scott: Yeah, the fur Is optional sometimes right.

1040
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:05,310
Rym: the fuzzy ones Yeah, not that I would ever wear a ferg like don't get me wrong, right?

1041
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,859
Scott: But the thing is it's sort of like it.

1042
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:16,177
Scott: those are sort of like these in-between Kind of jackets, right because you know, you can actually keep that one on as long as you're not, you know Sweating like crazy, right?

1043
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:31,747
Scott: It's like you can you know, keep that on and it's almost occupying the sort of sport coat zone right where it's it's as opposed to the You know hang up zone but for normal everyday stuff and not for fancy stuff.

1044
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:38,490
Scott: Yep, right There's a few other coats that sort of occupy that same space like like some parkas and stuff.

1045
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:44,130
Scott: You can wear them right and just keep them on all the time and it doesn't look like why are you wearing your coat?

1046
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,945
Scott: Even though we're inside now It's like it's.

1047
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:51,427
Scott: you know It's almost like a hoodie where it's still acceptable to keep wearing it Even when you're in the thing.

1048
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,714
Scott: There's other coats.

1049
01:10:52,996 --> 01:11:05,576
Scott: if you wear like one of those big old pea coats and you show up and you don't take it off And you're sitting in the restaurant with your pea coat on without like those big buttons with the anchors on Even if you unbutton it It's like you look really silly.

1050
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:07,625
Scott: if you keep that shit on you get your North Face coat.

1051
01:11:07,866 --> 01:11:13,710
Scott: if you sit down at the restaurant Or in the theater and you still have that on and you haven't taken it off people would be like, are you cold?

1052
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:14,295
Scott: Are you all right?

1053
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:14,739
Scott: What's wrong?

1054
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:22,930
Rym: Yeah, but I Have worn my North Face ski jacket indoors at conventions in the past because sometimes that AC is sometimes it's cold.

1055
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,350
Scott: Yeah, then you'd be like, yeah, it's cold.

1056
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:27,001
Rym: People are constantly being like why you were in your winter coat.

1057
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,186
Rym: It's like what the fuck is wrong with you.

1058
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:28,949
Rym: Do you not feel this?

1059
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:36,234
Scott: Yeah, there are some but there's other kinds of coats right that you can that you can keep wearing and it's like Oh, that doesn't look.

1060
01:11:36,354 --> 01:11:38,043
Scott: you don't look ridiculous keeping that on.

1061
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:43,269
Rym: Yeah, so Interestingly is because I wear blazers and sport jackets so much.

1062
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,149
Rym: I don't own a single one of though what you would want that kind of coat that you described not one.

1063
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:51,122
Scott: See the problem I have is actually I own a couple.

1064
01:11:51,282 --> 01:11:52,589
Scott: I think I got like one or two, right?

1065
01:11:52,790 --> 01:12:06,111
Scott: but the problem is is if I want to wear it as a You know inside coat like not take it off Then you could end up looking silly if say you go to you're going to work in the year 2021.

1066
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:16,078
Scott: Yeah, if you went to work every day and you changed all your clothes every day But you had like some bomber jacket and you just wore it all day every day at work It'd be like why you always wearing the same.

1067
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:22,078
Rym: and the difference is I can wear the same blazer for weeks on end Because people don't notice that it fades into the background.

1068
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:24,404
Rym: the shirt under it changes every day.

1069
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:26,833
Rym: the pants combined with it change every day So it's.

1070
01:12:26,853 --> 01:12:33,025
Scott: you can also see the shirt a lot more through us Big the deep V going on in the front, right?

1071
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:33,930
Rym: Exactly So.

1072
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:38,364
Rym: so but yeah, I don't own anything like but my but I go straight.

1073
01:12:38,424 --> 01:12:40,310
Rym: I go between hoodie and above hoodie.

1074
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:52,127
Scott: It's like I don't have anything until I get to but to which I Several different coats that are appropriate for wearing and not taking off Right is a lot of money and a lot of closet space.

1075
01:12:52,188 --> 01:12:58,090
Rym: that Actually is what I was about to say because that is why I don't own any of the coats you described like not one.

1076
01:12:58,752 --> 01:13:04,190
Rym: I have so many highly specialized like sporting outdoor coats that I don't really have room to have more.

1077
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:09,790
Rym: So I try to use those instead of what you described as a more normal jacket.

1078
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,581
Rym: So I go from my coats.

1079
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:16,070
Rym: go from lightest to heaviest Summit jacket, which I'll get back to after that.

1080
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:21,370
Rym: It's hoodie or fleece like but you're just like me my base layers for skiing and stuff.

1081
01:13:22,112 --> 01:13:30,263
Rym: the next step after that is like when my ski jacket and the next step beyond that is my Fully insulated trench coat and I got nothing else.

1082
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:32,436
Scott: His is the list of coats I got right.

1083
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:34,129
Scott: actually actually I might have more coats than you.

1084
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:38,130
Rym: Oh, you definitely have more coats than me because my coats are few and expensive and bulky.

1085
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,145
Scott: Some of mine are at least a little bit expensive not now and probably I don't.

1086
01:13:42,165 --> 01:13:47,650
Scott: probably don't have a single coat That's more expensive than your most expensive coat, but I have several hundred dollars.

1087
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:50,070
Rym: I one way I can cheat my most expensive coat.

1088
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:53,825
Rym: I paid very little money for because it had a slight defect and I got it for like nothing.

1089
01:13:53,865 --> 01:14:03,449
Scott: clearance sale Good deal Yeah, so assume forgetting the things that I have abandoned and don't wear anymore, right?

1090
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:07,081
Scott: That I might still have somewhere like packs hoodies I've abandoned.

1091
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:07,282
Scott: right?

1092
01:14:07,603 --> 01:14:09,290
Scott: I have two hoodies now that I actually wear.

1093
01:14:09,752 --> 01:14:13,370
Scott: They're basically the same hoodie, but one is lighter than the other for different seasons.

1094
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:15,198
Scott: So there you go.

1095
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:16,570
Scott: I got two hoodies, right?

1096
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:17,816
Scott: I then I have.

1097
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:19,284
Scott: I guess I'm gonna have to rip.

1098
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:20,470
Scott: I had two raincoats.

1099
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:27,059
Scott: I had the one that died the pla- it was basically just a sheet of plastic for 20 bucks And I had like a real kind of raincoat.

1100
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:35,030
Scott: the problem with my real kind of raincoat is it's still pretty good But it hasn't like an insulating layer which works very well.

1101
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:40,970
Scott: But sometimes it rains and you're not it's not cold and then it sucks to wear that coat because way too hot in it.

1102
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,210
Scott: Yeah, also the sleeves on it are too short and you can't make sleeves longer and my arms are long.

1103
01:14:45,912 --> 01:14:55,022
Scott: so I think I'm gonna abandon the broken plastic sheet and donate the good raincoat and Just get something that's a raincoat that fits and have that be the raincoat.

1104
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:56,046
Scott: So raincoat.

1105
01:14:56,428 --> 01:15:06,849
Scott: then I Have a special like ultra thin, you know Plasticy raincoat that is only good for biking if you wear it when you're not biking you look like a dingus.

1106
01:15:08,431 --> 01:15:10,861
Scott: But if you're biking in the rain, it's incredible.

1107
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:13,210
Scott: like you'll you can actually bike in the rain with this thing.

1108
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,406
Rym: I've been thinking about getting something like that because it wasn't cheap.

1109
01:15:17,486 --> 01:15:18,490
Scott: It wasn't the cheapest.

1110
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:25,574
Scott: It's just like a sheet of plastic kind of situation, but I assume it's gonna last my whole life and it's amazing Biking stuff the same way.

1111
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:26,458
Rym: I approach my ski stuff.

1112
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:29,250
Scott: It sounds like I have a second biking only coat.

1113
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:30,549
Scott: It is for biking in the cold.

1114
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:40,330
Scott: I can't bike in like fucking snowy winter with it But like I can bike in like, you know close to freezing as long as it's not snowing or anything.

1115
01:15:40,771 --> 01:15:44,220
Scott: It's not like ultra below zero if it's that warm.

1116
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:50,421
Scott: if you wear this while biking and the problem is most coats You wear while biking you start to get all sweaty inside this one.

1117
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:50,762
Scott: Nope.

1118
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:52,810
Scott: You feel great while biking if it's cold.

1119
01:15:52,951 --> 01:15:54,530
Rym: That's what that's actually what I do with biking.

1120
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:58,345
Rym: I don't have a biking specific one, but guess what, but all the kit I use for skiing.

1121
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:07,150
Rym: not the pants obviously But like the top part Perfect for biking except it's less aerodynamic than a bike specific solution, but it's perfectly comfortable.

1122
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:14,670
Scott: Yeah, alright, so then so I got the two biking coats one for just it's wet out But it's warm and the other four it's cold, but it's not wet.

1123
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:15,801
Scott: I don't really have a cold.

1124
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:22,210
Scott: if it's cold and wet I don't bike so I don't have I don't need a third biking coat and I don't have to combine the two either.

1125
01:16:23,932 --> 01:16:24,756
Rym: The listeners are also.

1126
01:16:24,796 --> 01:16:26,465
Rym: they've all devolved into still suit.

1127
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:27,109
Rym: That's the way to go.

1128
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:30,990
Scott: Yeah, I have a bomber ish kind of jacket that I can wear.

1129
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,526
Scott: You know when it's like a little bit cold like you're going maybe apple picking or something, right?

1130
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:38,743
Scott: It's not too cold out You know, you're not freezing but obviously it's too cold to go with no coat.

1131
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:42,215
Scott: Yeah, you know kind of in-between deal Right see in that situation.

1132
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:44,243
Rym: I either wear a hoodie or wear my hiking gear.

1133
01:16:44,263 --> 01:16:46,250
Scott: Yeah, then I got two more.

1134
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:49,370
Scott: I got two wintry coats I used to have in the old back in the day.

1135
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,669
Scott: I used to always buy a North Face kind of thing, but I got tired of that.

1136
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:53,753
Scott: Yeah, so what I have.

1137
01:16:54,034 --> 01:16:59,230
Scott: so what I have now is I have one that's sort of like a pea coat kind of ish situation.

1138
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:11,215
Scott: You know what the buttons as zipper end, you know, whatever in a hood that you can detach, you know It's that same kind of material and basically it doesn't matter if it's cold as long as it's not snowing because obviously there's no real Waterproofness to it.

1139
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:11,416
Scott: Yeah.

1140
01:17:11,456 --> 01:17:12,099
Rym: Yeah, that's right.

1141
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:27,290
Scott: But as if it's just cold, it's great It keeps you way warm in there right deep pockets nicely It's you know great, but then I have another one that's basically the it's snowing jacket Which is actually two jackets one that goes inside the other one so I could separate them and use just half for half.

1142
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:29,250
Rym: Yeah, all ski jackets are like that.

1143
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:33,910
Rym: Usually the ski jacket is just a shell and you zip an insulator into it and then you do more and more layers.

1144
01:17:34,712 --> 01:17:40,527
Scott: Yeah, this is I think it's the one this is technically called like a three-way jacket But I pretty much only wear if it's cold and snowing.

1145
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:44,864
Rym: Yeah it's well because what I found is those jackets like my ski jacket.

1146
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:52,101
Rym: I can wear the whole thing or I can unzip the insulating layer out of it and wear it just as a shell or Yeah

1147
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:58,890
Scott: The problem even if I tip thing is this one Even if you know there are ones where the insulating layer is like where all the insulation is this one.

1148
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:00,917
Scott: Some of the insulation is in both layers.

1149
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:04,550
Scott: if I just try to wear the outside only it's like you're still pretty warm.

1150
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:07,590
Scott: Right, if you wear the inside only it's like well, why don't I just wear the bomber jacket?

1151
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,217
Rym: Yeah, my jacket cuz it's fancier.

1152
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,670
Rym: The outside is completely on insulated.

1153
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:14,310
Rym: I can just use it as a shell and mix and match what I want to use inside.

1154
01:18:14,711 --> 01:18:24,435
Rym: But the inside part is also a jacket that is perfectly capable of being worn on its own and it's actually great for That mid-tier situation.

1155
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:41,510
Rym: The only reason I don't use it for that purpose and and fill that gap in my wardrobe is that I use this jacket to ski and I ski a lot and it It looks grody as shit from the grease of my body and the sweat and just mess of skiing.

1156
01:18:42,173 --> 01:18:45,667
Rym: And I mean when I went to her I'm cleaning we'll make that thing look like I'm not a hobo.

1157
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:50,845
Scott: so that is When we went to college, I knew it was gonna be snowy in Rochester.

1158
01:18:50,885 --> 01:18:52,510
Scott: That's what I brought with me freshman year.

1159
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:58,196
Scott: I bought like the fanciest Gore Tex like outer shell and I got the fanciest inside I mean for Rochester.

1160
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,069
Rym: that might not save your life on the quarter-mile.

1161
01:19:00,954 --> 01:19:06,730
Scott: But that's that's what I had for years at RIT and I you know I only did died because I buy it was killed by Rochester.

1162
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:12,358
Scott: I had the fanciest thing that you know, but I realized when I left Rochester I don't really need that anymore.

1163
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:13,807
Scott: That was that's not necessary now.

1164
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:20,150
Rym: Yep So yeah, you have way more jackets than me, but we both have a lot of highly specialized jackets.

1165
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:24,446
Scott: Cuz yeah, I mean if you do specialize I guess I you know, I'm not even counting like.

1166
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:25,230
Scott: I have one suit.

1167
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,079
Rym: I was about to say I have more jacket.

1168
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:27,943
Scott: I have one jacket.

1169
01:19:27,984 --> 01:19:29,230
Scott: That's not a part of a suit.

1170
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:33,510
Rym: I have more jackets than you if we count Blazers and like leisure suits and all that.

1171
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:36,101
Rym: Yeah, I have one two, three, four five two.

1172
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:44,893
Rym: I have 11 sport jackets That I wear regularly and in the non-covid times, obviously, I might have two suits, but only one of them I think is wearable.

1173
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:48,185
Rym: I have 11 sport jackets and I have three dress jackets.

1174
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,130
Rym: I Also have a seersucker that don't wear much anymore.

1175
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:55,240
Scott: But yeah, I guess I'm gonna downsize raincoats.

1176
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,926
Scott: I'm gonna get rid of two and add one.

1177
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:57,950
Scott: Yeah, that'll be good.

1178
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:03,070
Rym: So the jacket I have that you don't have is the one that it look Marmot made it but they don't make it anymore.

1179
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,200
Rym: I'm actually googling around this.

1180
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,349
Rym: so I got this.

1181
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:12,965
Rym: I was in Salt Lake City years and years and years ago I was actually out in Park City like the ski resort But I was there to mountain bike in the off season.

1182
01:20:13,025 --> 01:20:17,069
Rym: long story short I had a whole day with nothing to do and nothing was open before I could fly home.

1183
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:20,720
Rym: So I wander around this town and I find this sport shop.

1184
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,425
Scott: No, these are reasonable prices Marmot.

1185
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:23,308
Rym: Oh, yeah Marmot is.

1186
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:34,350
Rym: Marmot is not to turn this into an ad but Marmot is The best like jacket where you're gonna get for a price that you Scott would consider reasonable.

1187
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:38,059
Rym: That is comparable in quality to the Arcturix stuff.

1188
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,443
Rym: That is just insane quality.

1189
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:41,267
Scott: Let's see rain rain.

1190
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:48,723
Rym: I mean where I every Marmot Outerwear item I've ever bought has been utterly phenomenal for the dollars.

1191
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:49,104
Rym: I paid.

1192
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:51,030
Scott: All right, let's check out these raincoats.

1193
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:53,421
Rym: So the thing I have they don't make anymore.

1194
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:55,150
Rym: They haven't made it for a long time.

1195
01:20:55,674 --> 01:21:06,170
Rym: I bought it from this shop that had a like discount rack of Clearance items that were unsaleable or had defects or things like an outlet store and I paid $80 for this thing.

1196
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:13,001
Rym: it retailed for four or five hundred dollars, but It is so it's that that's that tiny jacket.

1197
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:14,446
Rym: I described it's so small.

1198
01:21:14,507 --> 01:21:15,470
Rym: It's the size of my cell phone.

1199
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:16,648
Rym: I can just wad it into a ball.

1200
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:19,122
Rym: It's sort of.

1201
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:20,814
Rym: it's waterproof But that's not what it's used for.

1202
01:21:20,855 --> 01:21:27,440
Rym: like you couldn't use this raincoat because the underarms are completely vented So you can just like vents your sweat out of them.

1203
01:21:28,102 --> 01:21:30,570
Rym: these jackets are used for exactly two things.

1204
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,478
Rym: It's a highly specialized piece of basically outdoor survival gear.

1205
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:43,890
Rym: you carry it in your pack and you put it on when you're summiting a mountain Not a not a like super high mountain like Kilimanjaro, but like a normal moderate-sized mountain.

1206
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:48,110
Rym: It's just this extra layer you put on only at the top when you're making your summit approach.

1207
01:21:48,514 --> 01:22:05,519
Rym: It's too much to wear on the whole trip But it's like a windbreaker you put on at the very end and the other use for it is it's an emergency layer That weighs nothing that you can whip out if you suddenly need a jacket and you literally have no Room weight space or anything to carry a jacket.

1208
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:05,720
Rym: like.

1209
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:11,207
Rym: I could put this jacket in my back pocket out of packs and just whip It out if suddenly it gets too cold late at night.

1210
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,074
Rym: You've seen me wear it.

1211
01:22:13,134 --> 01:22:14,661
Rym: It's that shiny blue shirt.

1212
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:22,830
Scott: Oh the show's gone on way too long Yes, but I guess the final word on jacket is that one day we'll have some awesome cyberpunk.

1213
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:25,464
Scott: You know you'll just you'll just right you'll just have.

1214
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:29,021
Scott: you'll have cyber skin And you'll just change the fucking skin and you want to worry about that.

1215
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:31,975
Scott: and then your clothing can just be all style if you Even have clothing.

1216
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:33,464
Scott: so and that'll be great.

1217
01:22:33,484 --> 01:22:38,888
Scott: yeah Until then you got to own a hundred different jackets to shift your form.

1218
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:42,160
Rym: yeah Alright, and if it is watching the stream.
