1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,889
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 17th, 2011.

2
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:10,130
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:12,577
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,147
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,998
Rym: Tonight, the Borrower, Arietty.

6
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,468
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,869
Rym: Played some Burning Wheel last night, like we do.

8
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:35,790
Rym: And, you know, one trouble of the large game, even the small game of D&D or anything, is that you need food.

9
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,469
Rym: And it's not like the old days when we were punk kids.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,289
Rym: You just, you know, buy an infinite amount of terrible snack food, like Sun Ships and stuff, and just...

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,569
Scott: And one guy eats them all?

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,366
Rym: Yeah, that one guy.

13
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:57,230
Rym: But those are like the 12-hour gaming sessions where, you know, maybe six hours of that was gaming, and the rest was just dicking around and attacking the darkness and all that crap.

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,676
Rym: But we're adults now.

15
00:00:58,696 --> 00:00:59,723
Rym: We've got adult lives.

16
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:00,670
Rym: We're in a hurry.

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,748
Rym: So when we play a four-hour game, it's a four-hour game, and we don't have time to do anything else.

18
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,249
Rym: So I thought I'd make some chili.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,825
Rym: Figured that's a nice way to have some food for everybody while we're playing the game.

20
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:16,150
Rym: that doesn't, like, get in the way, slow us down, don't have to, like, go out or order pizza or anything.

21
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,162
Rym: And I think it was pretty good chili.

22
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:18,867
Rym: Would you agree?

23
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:19,310
Scott: It was all right.

24
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,810
Scott: It was good.

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,654
Rym: It was pretty spicy.

26
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:22,121
Rym: It was the right level of spicy.

27
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,830
Rym: I think I did the spiciness correctly.

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,130
Rym: So I put in this thing, a third a cup of chili powder and a whole bunch of cayenne pepper and green peppers and jalapenos, and it was awesome.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,730
Rym: But I washed the pot after everyone went home before I went to bed.

30
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,150
Rym: And then I went to play some Nintendo games.

31
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:47,390
Rym: And my hands are starting to, like, burn, like they're tingly, and I'm kind of wondering, like, what's going on?

32
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,090
Rym: Why are my hands tingly?

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,990
Rym: And it's getting worse and worse and worse.

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,530
Rym: And then they're starting to get hot, like they're on fire and I can't figure it out.

35
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,129
Rym: I'm just about to freak out.

36
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,710
Rym: And then I'm like, wait a minute.

37
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:02,330
Rym: And I think back to washing out the bottom of the pot.

38
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:06,050
Rym: And it was basically like the condensed scrape down pepper at the bottom.

39
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:09,710
Scott: This is why you wear gloves when you do dishes.

40
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,130
Rym: I usually don't do dishes.

41
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,389
Scott: It's just one of the reasons you wear gloves when you do dishes.

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,508
Scott: There are many other reasons.

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,889
Rym: Nah, you don't do enough dishes to warn gloves.

44
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,530
Scott: OK, if you're doing even one dish, gloves.

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,670
Rym: You're going to put on gloves to wash one water cup?

46
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,126
Rym: Yes.

47
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,501
Rym: Really?

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,068
Rym: Yes.

49
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,170
Rym: You really put on gloves to rinse out one water cup?

50
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:27,728
Scott: Yes, I do.

51
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:29,108
Rym: I don't believe you.

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,690
Rym: In fact, I'm going to wait with a camera and catch you not doing it.

53
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,190
Scott: Uh, sure.

54
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,090
Rym: So that sucked.

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,910
Rym: I wash my hands.

56
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,750
Rym: Obviously, that doesn't work.

57
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,308
Rym: It's too late.

58
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,969
Rym: So I give up and go to bed with my hands kind of on fire.

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,670
Rym: Woke up in the morning.

60
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,529
Scott: Hands still on fire.

61
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,670
Rym: Hands still on fire.

62
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:49,330
Rym: Took a shower.

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,510
Rym: Hands still on fire.

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,088
Rym: Went to work.

65
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,430
Rym: Hands still on fire.

66
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,070
Rym: It was about noon that the hands were no longer on fire.

67
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:56,888
Scott: So you go.

68
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:57,370
Scott: You deserve.

69
00:02:58,535 --> 00:02:59,290
Rym: It wasn't bad.

70
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,729
Rym: It was just kind of odd.

71
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,670
Rym: Like it was an odd sensation that I had not experienced before.

72
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:05,510
Scott: Some people pay for that.

73
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,709
Scott: You can go to the drug store and buy like capsicol or whatever.

74
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,970
Rym: So it's Wednesday.

75
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:14,543
Rym: Yeah.

76
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,770
Rym: There's lots happening in the anime world.

77
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,585
Rym: Tons of news.

78
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,967
Scott: Not really, no.

79
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:22,790
Rym: I mean, Otakon happened and eh.

80
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,203
Scott: Yeah.

81
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,530
Rym: Gotoshinkai will also be at the New York Comic-Con Anime Festival.

82
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,289
Rym: So we'll get him there.

83
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,660
Scott: Good.

84
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,248
Scott: So check this out.

85
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:34,768
Scott: What was one of the best movies of recent years?

86
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,610
Rym: How recent do you qualify recent years?

87
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,489
Scott: I have to ask IMDb because I forget the year.

88
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,770
Rym: Because depending on the time span, my answer keeps changing.

89
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,350
Scott: So what is the top three movies of 2009?

90
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,434
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,110
Rym: Was Inception 2009?

92
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,550
Scott: I'm going to find out.

93
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,311
Rym: Or was that 2010?

94
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:57,765
Rym: I don't remember.

95
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,249
Scott: I'll find out right now.

96
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,271
Scott: No, Inception was 2010.

97
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:02,750
Rym: Ah, crap.

98
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,010
Rym: What even came out in 2009?

99
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,567
Rym: I guess Avatar?

100
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:06,610
Scott: The blue one.

101
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,072
Scott: Yeah, that was 2009.

102
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:08,569
Scott: The blue one.

103
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,550
Rym: I put that on the list.

104
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,450
Rym: I thought that was a pretty solid sci-fi movie.

105
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:11,906
Scott: It was okay.

106
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:12,669
Rym: I enjoyed it.

107
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,049
Scott: Not as good as the movie I'm thinking of.

108
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,523
Rym: Ah, what movies did I see that were from 2009 that were good?

109
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:20,587
Rym: I don't know.

110
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,890
Scott: How about Black Dynamite?

111
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,570
Rym: Oh, shit, son.

112
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,122
Scott: Oh, shit.

113
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,847
Scott: And you know what?

114
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:28,109
Scott: Black Dynamite.

115
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,690
Scott: First of all, there's a comic book.

116
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,790
Scott: I already have issue one.

117
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,007
Scott: You got to get that shit.

118
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,909
Scott: Number two, there's going to be a cartoon.

119
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,290
Rym: I've seen the first episode.

120
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,030
Scott: The first episode, you can go watch an Adult Swim's website.

121
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:40,749
Scott: It's for real.

122
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,189
Rym: Well, it is very good at being exactly what it should be.

123
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:46,390
Scott: Which is awesome.

124
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,330
Rym: But it's hard for me to say that it's good.

125
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,510
Scott: It's got a lot of--.

126
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,330
Scott: How is it not good?

127
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,429
Rym: I don't know.

128
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,590
Rym: There's something weird about it.

129
00:04:55,972 --> 00:05:00,630
Rym: The whole time, part of my brain is saying, this is awful, thrown together, pablum.

130
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,249
Rym: And the other part of my brain is saying, shut the fuck up.

131
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,789
Scott: My entire brain just says, anyone who doesn't like this is a jive ass honky.

132
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:17,510
Rym: I think why I like it in the end, and why all the cons are outweighed by the pros, is that every time it makes a joke, it doubles down on that joke.

133
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,849
Rym: You got a stereotype, you double the fuck down on that stereotype.

134
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,690
Scott: That's why it's not just blacks.

135
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,130
Scott: It's blaxploitation.

136
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,670
Scott: This is what black bastards-- If you don't double and triple down, that's not sploitation.

137
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,447
Rym: This is what black bastards should have been.

138
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:31,970
Rym: But I don't know.

139
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,029
Rym: And also, once it doubles down, it'll make a joke.

140
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,990
Rym: It skips immediately to the set up for the next double down.

141
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:42,466
Rym: It moves quick, and it pretty much skips any sort of plot.

142
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,809
Rym: And it's really true to the movie, too.

143
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,990
Rym: I love the flashback, where he's like-- I used to be a children.

144
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:57,010
Rym: His dad is like, I'm leaving you to raise black dynamite as a single mother, because I'm going to go drinking.

145
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,389
Rym: You should all watch this.

146
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,889
Rym: It's pretty good.

147
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,766
Scott: You should watch this, and then when the show comes out, watch that, too.

148
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,210
Scott: And if you haven't watched the movie, what the fuck?

149
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,410
Rym: A warning on the movie.

150
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,750
Rym: The movie is great, but much like "Eden of the East," the movie starts out as an A, blaxploitation movie.

151
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,810
Scott: Yeah, the movie's like a little bit of a roller coaster.

152
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,610
Scott: It's like, so awesome, this part is a little bit boring.

153
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,190
Scott: Oh my god, it's awesome again.

154
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,810
Scott: And then this went on too long.

155
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,450
Rym: Tell you straight up, the so awesome peaks right before "Secret Chinese Lab" on Island.

156
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:36,610
Rym: And then it's way downhill, but then it has this huge uptick with one of my favorite lines in any movie ever.

157
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,650
Rym: I threw that shit before I came in here.

158
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,548
Scott: Oh, I threw that shit before I came in the room.

159
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,030
Scott: You don't even remember the line.

160
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,210
Rym: No, because the point is, he threw that shit before.

161
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,330
Scott: He came in the room.

162
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,129
Scott: He came before.

163
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:50,329
Scott: Yeah, sure did.

164
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,030
Rym: But then he fights Nick.

165
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,450
Rym: The movie's just like a half hour too long.

166
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:59,490
Rym: Kind of like how "Eden of the East" went from an A to a B by the end.

167
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,030
Rym: That's all right.

168
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,990
Rym: So the moment, once the thing comes back that he threw before, you can actually stop watching the movie.

169
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,610
Rym: There's nothing else to see that's worth seeing.

170
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,305
Scott: Anyway, "Black

171
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:11,729
Scott: Dynamite.".

172
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,318
Scott: Yeah, "Black

173
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:12,848
Scott: Dynamite."

174
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,967
Scott: Don't miss it.

175
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,270
Rym: I feel like I'm going to watch the entire cartoon.

176
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,350
Rym: It's right up there with Archer in terms of amount of actual physical laughter brought out of me.

177
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,207
Scott: I don't like that show.

178
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:23,009
Rym: I don't know what's wrong with you.

179
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,606
Rym: Archer is, in my opinion-- Not funny at all.

180
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,450
Rym: --the funniest cartoon to come out in many years.

181
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,629
Scott: "Ponies" is way funnier than that.

182
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,750
Rym: "Ponies" I like a lot, but it's the drama and the characters and the cuteness that draws me in more than the funny.

183
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,290
Scott: That's what I'm saying, is "Ponies" is not just humor, but Archer supposedly is.

184
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,310
Scott: But Archer has less humor than a show that is only partially humor.

185
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,390
Rym: I don't think it does-- here, I rate humor-- In fact, it has no humor.

186
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:48,630
Rym: It's not funny at all.

187
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,989
Rym: The way I rate humor in shows now is I use my own metric of me, because I will often see things that are funny.

188
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:58,390
Rym: But if I'm with people, you tend to laugh.

189
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:07,830
Rym: Even if something's not that funny, if there's a bunch of people around, at a stand-up comedian, there's this human vibe where you'll laugh more often, like you'll laugh at stuff.

190
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,170
Rym: I remember we'd watch, I don't know, like Dana Carvey together, like a bunch of the crew.

191
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,069
Rym: We'd laugh hysterically.

192
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:18,369
Rym: I can watch "Chopin' Rocket Lab" by myself, and my brain says, this is hilarious, but it does not force me to laugh out loud.

193
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,550
Rym: I don't just laugh in an empty room.

194
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,450
Scott: This is well-known psychology.

195
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:32,590
Rym: So "Archer" has made me laugh out loud by myself more times than any TV show I have seen in at least a few years.

196
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,769
Scott: It made me laugh zero times.

197
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,110
Rym: I don't know what's wrong with you.

198
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,589
Rym: It is some funny shit.

199
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,590
Scott: It's not funny at all.

200
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,929
Rym: How can you not find "Archer" funny?

201
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,140
Rym: It's kind of like how you don't like

202
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,462
Rym: "Firefly.".

203
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:42,870
Scott: It's just boring.

204
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:43,357
Rym: Or "Cowboy

205
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:43,787
Rym: Bebop."

206
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:44,350
Rym: And weird.

207
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,625
Rym: I like "Cowboy

208
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:45,747
Rym: Bebop."

209
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,390
Rym: But you don't like "Firefly" or "Archer"?

210
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:47,968
Scott: What the fuck?

211
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:56,920
Rym: Anyway, so "Redline," we've talked about, well, I've talked about this off and on.

212
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,220
Rym: I've been excited about "Redline" pretty much from before it existed.

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,055
Rym: It's been in production forever.

214
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,339
Rym: And the fact that it actually came out kind of amazed me.

215
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,460
Rym: Like when we saw that trailer for it way back, it looked like the kind of thing you'd see from like a genius party.

216
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,618
Rym: Like I was amazed that it was actually a movie that was really coming out.

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:35,019
Rym: And I don't know if we talked about this before, but the date has finally passed because it was announced in April that "Redline," which was kind of botched in terms of release, like reviewers who have seen it have said surprisingly unqualified things like this is the greatest and most important animated movie to come out in the last decade.

218
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,979
Rym: - Uh-huh.

219
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,996
Rym: - Not a lot of people have been saying things of that level about

220
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:39,179
Rym: "Redline.".

221
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,339
Scott: - You realize a lot of anime movies have come out in the last decade that are better than that.

222
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,974
Rym: - Well, other than "Summer Wars" and "The Girl Who Left Her Time" and "Sort of a

223
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:48,437
Rym: Stranger.".

224
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,659
Scott: - But I mean, there's movies that came out in the last decade that are animated that it cannot possibly be better than.

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,840
Rym: - I don't know, 'cause what people have been saying is not so much best but most important because it's different and weird.

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Rym: It's kind of like the cool 4C stuff.

227
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,132
Scott: - What year is it?

228
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,300
Rym: - It's 2011.

229
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,559
Scott: - So what year was it, 10 years ago?

230
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,240
Rym: - 2001.

231
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,189
Scott: - So a 2001 movie could qualify?

232
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,540
Rym: - Can you name 10 anime movies that came out in that time that you would consider good?

233
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,422
Scott: - I don't have to name 10.

234
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,139
Scott: I just didn't name one.

235
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,740
Scott: - "Spirited Away" came out in 2001.

236
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,600
Scott: Therefore, this cannot possibly be better.

237
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,559
Scott: - I didn't say better.

238
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,480
Scott: Nor, I didn't even say most important.

239
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,580
Scott: - It can't possibly be more important.

240
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,900
Rym: - I said that people are saying, I'm reporting on what those assholes are saying.

241
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,760
Scott: - I just proved that they're assholes.

242
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,972
Rym: - I have not seen

243
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:32,640
Rym: "Redline.".

244
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:42,200
Rym: I do not have an opinion on "Redline" yet, but much like when I saw that trailer to "Escaflowne" way back before it came out in the US, I've been mad excited about it, which is rare.

245
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,019
Rym: I rarely get excited about an anime movie that is coming.

246
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,820
Rym: And the release was kind of botched.

247
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,020
Rym: It didn't really have a good theatrical release either in the US or in Japan.

248
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,900
Scott: - What is up with everyone around the world, right?

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,559
Scott: It seems like everyone is botching releases of things, except for Valve.

250
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,220
Scott: When Valve makes a game, they release that game to the entire world simultaneously with great fanfare at the same price.

251
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,500
Scott: They've learned that lesson, and it's awesome.

252
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,660
Rym: - Because Valve doesn't have to rely on theaters playing a movie.

253
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,139
Scott: - Nintendo has these games, right?

254
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
Rym: - Nintendo's just stupid.

255
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,219
Rym: I'm not defending Nintendo.

256
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,900
Scott: - But two of those games, they're just gonna put out in Europe.

257
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,420
Rym: - Now, you know what's awesome?

258
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,380
Scott: - It's like, what the fuck?

259
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,999
Rym: - The whole "Nintendo, let me give you my money" thing.

260
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,460
Rym: As we'll talk about at PAX, they used to do that.

261
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:41,960
Rym: They brought out not just AeroBiz, but AeroBiz Supersonic, a game where you play the CEO of an airline and you have to increase profits and send Tanaka to business meetings in Hong Kong.

262
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,919
Scott: - I also wanna say Millennium Actress, Paprika, and Tokyo Godfathers all came out in the last decade.

263
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,959
Scott: - Yeah, and they're super good movies, but-- - There's no way, I would bet zero dollars that Red Line is better than any of those four movies.

264
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,060
Rym: I did not say-- - Or more important.

265
00:11:57,601 --> 00:12:00,560
Rym: - I said one of the best, that it'll rank up there.

266
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:19,880
Rym: And two, the reason people are saying it's important is that it has a lot of the qualities that gave it that kind of general appeal that movies like Akira had when they were released in the U.S Like Akira, a lot of people who never saw any anime before and never saw any anime again saw Akira in the theater.

267
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,289
Scott: - They did.

268
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:25,986
Rym: - And the argument is that Red Line has all the qualities of an Akira to where.

269
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,833
Rym: had it not been botched, this would have been like another wave of people seeing anime.

270
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:34,478
Scott: - You know what quality Akira had was actually in theaters that people could go to?

271
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,352
Scott: That normal people went to.

272
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:41,813
Scott: - It's not just that, but it was an action-- - Was on the sci-fi channel and was much advertised that it was going to be on the sci-fi channel.

273
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:50,359
Rym: - But it was, very particularly, an action sci-fi, which, surprisingly, it's weird how Hollywood seems to be afraid of doing a real action sci-fi.

274
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,731
Scott: - I don't know why.

275
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,300
Rym: - I know.

276
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,820
Scott: And every now and then-- - They don't wanna be 290s.

277
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,516
Rym: - Every now and then, one comes out and even Inception, you could argue, is action sci-fi-esque.

278
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,298
Scott: - Pretty much, yeah.

279
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,180
Rym: - And yet, they didn't even wanna make Inception.

280
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,299
Rym: They didn't wanna release it.

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,690
Rym: The fact that it came out was a miracle, and then they're like, "How the fuck did it make "so much

282
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:06,998
Rym: money?".

283
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,970
Scott: - Avatar was.

284
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:08,380
Scott: - I know.

285
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,500
Scott: - The blue one you just mentioned.

286
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,180
Rym: - Yeah, Avatar is a great example.

287
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,992
Rym: It's like they forget that--.

288
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:12,480
Scott: - I like the thing.

289
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,447
Scott: that's annoying, you always get to see Avatar, the blue one.

290
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:15,904
Rym: (laughing) - Why?

291
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,800
Scott: - You can't just say Avatar, 'cause there's so many of them.

292
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,720
Rym: - It's not like there was any other Avatar movie.

293
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,020
Scott: - Yeah, Ultimate Quest for the Avatar.

294
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,180
Rym: - That wasn't a movie.

295
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
Scott: - I did, people get confused.

296
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,378
Scott: (laughing) There's too many things called Avatar.

297
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,580
Rym: - There's the new Avatar stuff coming out, but we'll talk about that later.

298
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,200
Rym: But anyway, it was announced that Redline will be released on Blu-ray in Japan.

299
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:41,760
Rym: There's no announcement of an American release or anything, but the Blu-ray will have English subtitles.

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,239
Scott: - Which means it'll be on the internet real soon.

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,760
Rym: - Well, it came out on August 10th, and it looks like the torrents are already making their way around the internet.

302
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,495
Rym: - Yeah, torrents.

303
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,200
Rym: - Go watch Redline and tell me if the people who are saying it is one of the most important anime ever are accurate.

304
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,240
Scott: - I doubt it.

305
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,779
Rym: - Dude, it's F-Zero the movie.

306
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:00,960
Rym: How can you not be pumped about that?

307
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,359
Scott: - There was an anime, it was F-Zero the anime that was on Cartoon Network, and it was, I forget what it was called, but it was awful and no one watched it.

308
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,120
Rym: - There was no F-Zero anime.

309
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,577
Scott: - It wasn't--.

310
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,199
Rym: - There was no Avatar movie.

311
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,400
Scott: - Actually, there was an F-Zero anime that was F-Zero, and there was another anime that wasn't actually F-Zero.

312
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,600
Rym: - You wanna know a weird F-Zero trivia that I found?

313
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:20,960
Rym: - Okay.

314
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,219
Rym: - I was researching emulators for the Peck stuff, right?

315
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,578
Rym: - Yep.

316
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,736
Rym: - And I found an emulator that only emulates the original F-Zero on the SNES.

317
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,518
Rym: - Yep.

318
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,679
Rym: - It can't play anything else.

319
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,779
Rym: You know why this exists?

320
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,480
Scott: - Because no emulator emulates F-Zero properly.

321
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,880
Rym: - No, it's not because of that.

322
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
Rym: It's no more accurate than like SNES 9x for F-Zero.

323
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,500
Scott: - Oh, okay.

324
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,160
Rym: - It hacked in six player online multiplayer simultaneous racing.

325
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,479
Scott: - Ah, shit son.

326
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,138
Rym: - It updates your position on everyone else's ROMs in memory and you race fucking the original SNES F1.

327
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:55,900
Rym: After PAX, I'm gonna get this shit going.

328
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,259
Scott: - No one's gonna play that.

329
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,580
Rym: - I'll play it like once and then I'll give up.

330
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,458
Scott: I'll talk about it.

331
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,620
Scott: - I'd be more excited if it was Game of Cube F-Zero.

332
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,976
Scott: - Game of Cube F-Zero was the best F-Zero.

333
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,960
Scott: - There was an anime called F-Zero GP Legend.

334
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,599
Scott: It was an anime that was F-Zero.

335
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,120
Scott: And there was also another anime, I forget what it was called, that was about racing of the similar sort.

336
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,179
Scott: I never saw it, but it was on Cartoon Network and no one cared about it.

337
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,599
Rym: - So things of the day, what do you got for me?

338
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,736
Scott: - You know, I know you don't like this game, but I like it, Wolfenstein 3D.

339
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Rym: - It's, you know what, to say that I don't like the game is somewhat of a misnomer.

340
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,645
Rym: I do not terribly enjoy maze games, and Wolfenstein 3D--.

341
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:42,839
Scott: - What about Maze Craze?

342
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,140
Rym: - Maze Craze is different 'cause that's two player versus and it's just the maze.

343
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,960
Rym: - Whatever, the point is-- - If it was a two player versus race through a maze, then yeah, I would like it.

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,620
Scott: - I'm actually often disappointed that newer FPSs are so un-mazelike and they don't have as many just completely arbitrary secret passageways.

345
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,160
Scott: But the problem with the secret passageways in Wolfenstein is while I like them, they're sort of just, there's not often a clue to them.

346
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,340
Scott: It's pretty much brute force touching every wall.

347
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,540
Rym: - Well, they'll be like, oh, it'll be behind the swastika.

348
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,999
Scott: - Yeah, but it's usually it's just touch every wall, right?

349
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,800
Rym: - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

350
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,740
Rym: Wolfenstein was not a fun game from any perspective.

351
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,360
Scott: - It was fun if you just tried to beat it and didn't try to find all the secrets.

352
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,420
Rym: - It was also fun because we'd never seen a game like that before.

353
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,293
Scott: - But anyway, here's a great game, Wolfenstein 1D.

354
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,318
Rym: - Oh shit, son, is that in HD?

355
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,099
Scott: - It is HD 1D in your browser, totally free.

356
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:31,846
Rym: - 1080p?

357
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,240
Scott: - You can pay $35 for all three episodes if you send your money to Apogee Software in Tejas.

358
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:42,920
Scott: You can specify three and a half or five and a quarter inch disks when ordering.

359
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,760
Rym: - I love it when someone has a funny joke.

360
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,415
Rym: Like someone could say, yeah, Wolfenstein 1D.

361
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:51,080
Rym: And then someone actually makes the game.

362
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Rym: that was the joke, demake style.

363
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,020
Scott: - I had an idea for a similar game today.

364
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,180
Scott: I don't know how, it might work, but I don't give it a good shot of working, but it's possible.

365
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,890
Scott: Ready for this idea?

366
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:01,340
Scott: - I'm ready.

367
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,780
Scott: - Turn-based Dota.

368
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,260
Rym: - That would actually probably work pretty well.

369
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,739
Scott: - Maybe.

370
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,540
Rym: - I want Dota text adventure.

371
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,259
Scott: - Yeah.

372
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,800
Rym: - You have to type obscenities as fast as possible.

373
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,060
Scott: - I think someone made a Dota roguelike already that was like, do you wanna go to lane one, two, or three?

374
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:19,579
Scott: One.

375
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,173
Rym: - So I'm a big fan, as Scott knows, of YouTube videos people make that are compilations of like the 10 greatest times.

376
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,259
Rym: Arnold Schwarzenegger goes ah, ah, ah.

377
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Scott: - Tom Hanks peeing in every movie.

378
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,279
Rym: - Yep, or every death in Total Recall, stuff like that.

379
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,867
Rym: So this one is one that was actually pretty informative because I did not know.

380
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:43,960
Rym: most of these were improv.

381
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:55,840
Rym: 25 movies that have 25 scenes and those scenes, which are somewhat famous or well-known or iconic or a very big actor in them, were actually improvised and not in the script.

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
Scott: - Or at least some portion of them was improvised.

383
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:58,500
Scott: Some component.

384
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,760
Scott: - Yeah, some of them are like-- - Some of them are entirely improvised, some just have an improvised component.

385
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:14,340
Rym: - Yep, or like in one of them, a cab, a real cab, drove onto the set where they had blocked everything off for filming and the actor interacted with a cab that shouldn't have been there.

386
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,019
Rym: that ended up in the movie, stuff like that.

387
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:21,779
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is the ear, the eye, the arm.

388
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,319
Scott: - The foot, the leg, the hand, the face.

389
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,799
Rym: - The joke that keeps getting made every show.

390
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,959
Scott: - Yeah, it's a great joke.

391
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,620
Rym: - It's okay.

392
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,860
Rym: It's kind of like the nine somethings, nine somethings, nine somethings game.

393
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,420
Rym: - We will be at, not this weekend, but next weekend at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle.

394
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,198
Scott: - Next to Walla Walla.

395
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,513
Rym: - We will be doing, on Saturday at noon, Discover the Forgotten Masters and Saturday evening, 6 p.m.

396
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:49,795
Rym: to 8 p.m.

397
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,679
Rym: in the tabletop workshop area, we'll be teaching people to play a whole bunch of games.

398
00:18:54,224 --> 00:19:01,679
Rym: and in general, the bigger news, there is a gigantic, well, a gigantic new thing for PAX, the tabletop workshop room.

399
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,180
Rym: The experiment of it is this year.

400
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,060
Scott: - It's not that gigantic.

401
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,056
Rym: - But it's something new at PAX.

402
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:12,380
Rym: They haven't been adding new things for a while, they've just been kind of extending things they've got.

403
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Rym: - Well, Penny Arcade in general, as we know-- - Well, they added that late show that we kind of obeyed.

404
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,880
Scott: - Yeah, that was horrible.

405
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,199
Scott: Penny Arcade in general has a policy of if you're not gonna do something awesome, don't do it at all.

406
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,020
Scott: That's why they stopped making their video game because they lost the ability to make it awesome.

407
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,619
Scott: So they just said, well, let's not do it.

408
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,400
Scott: We either do it awesome or not at all.

409
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,499
Scott: So whenever they do something new, they dip the toe.

410
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,879
Rym: - PAX Seattle, in Seattle, PAX Prime is pretty much for what it, like every part of it is run as perfectly as it could be run.

411
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,879
Scott: So now-- - And they're running out of space and the Halo Fest has taken up a lot of room.

412
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,500
Rym: - So they have to add more interesting things.

413
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,479
Rym: They got more tabletop space, obviously, 'cause that whole addendum area, the appendix this year-- - Is mostly taken up by Halo Fest.

414
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,959
Rym: - Yeah, but it's there at least.

415
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,320
Rym: So Halo Fest doesn't impact existing PAX.

416
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,716
Rym: - That's true.

417
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,800
Rym: - But they have a tabletop workshop area consisting of two workshop rooms.

418
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,580
Rym: And if this goes well, then we will hopefully be doing something with them and they will have a gigantic one at PAX East.

419
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:13,239
Rym: So my task to you, fellow PAXians, is to go to the tabletop workshop area content and make sure that goddamn room is full.

420
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,560
Rym: Make them realize that they need more content like this.

421
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,980
Rym: They're gonna have indie RPG creators running demos of their indie RPGs.

422
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:24,180
Rym: We'll be there playing games, teaching people how to play games.

423
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,340
Scott: - All right, I think you've gone on enough about this.

424
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,859
Scott: It's supposed to be the meta moment at the meta hour.

425
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,979
Rym: - All right, all right, you're gonna talk about how we have a website and Facebook and all that?

426
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,679
Scott: - Yeah, you should check us out on the internet, on all the internet places.

427
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,000
Rym: - Yep, our channels are online, all that stuff.

428
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,077
Rym: Tweeter, tweeter.

429
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,259
Scott: - Yep, search for GeekNights with the Googles.

430
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:48,420
Rym: - So it's not that often that an anime movie, a full feature length movie that isn't Pokemon, Bleach, One Piece, Naruto.

431
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,700
Scott: - It's mostly One Piece every year and Pokemon every year.

432
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,399
Rym: - Yep, but there aren't that many that come out.

433
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,838
Rym: Nevermind ones that get any manner of theatrical release in the US.

434
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,419
Scott: - Well, I mean, and even ones that do come out.

435
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,540
Scott: Some of them are compilation movies.

436
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,780
Scott: Some of them are like direct to DVD OVA type movies.

437
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:11,917
Scott: It's very rare that you get, and some of them are like part of an anime series, like even the East movie, right?

438
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:20,240
Scott: It's very rare that you get the standalone anime movie, even though when you first start out in anime, there's such a history of them.

439
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,420
Scott: There's a whole big pile of them you get to watch, but really in total, there aren't that many, and especially even fewer awesome ones, right?

440
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,700
Scott: But that, you know, and I think about it, how do you get into anime?

441
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,620
Scott: Almost exclusively just watching movies, not really watching TV series so much.

442
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,400
Rym: - Yeah, you'll see a movie.

443
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:42,380
Scott: - I think kids nowadays get into anime with TV series like the Naruto's and the DBZ's, but when I started, it was mostly movies that grabbed you.

444
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,200
Rym: - You'd see a movie, usually out of context, people would see like Project Aco or the Tenchi movie.

445
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,359
Scott: - Wasn't Project Aco an OVA?

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,020
Rym: - Yeah, but the first episode, the way it was shown on TV, I mean, you could treat it as a movie.

447
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,719
Rym: It's kind of a standalone thing.

448
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:05,120
Rym: Each episode of it is basically standalone, and plus there was Battle Gray and Battle Blue, which was the movie, which I think was actually also an OAV, but I digress.

449
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,817
Scott: - I'll look it up.

450
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,480
Rym: - So, well, it was originally porn, but people would see these things.

451
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:18,838
Rym: Like I remember I saw the Tenchi movie, and I was fascinated because the movie didn't make a lot of sense if you didn't know about the TV show or like what was going on.

452
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,800
Rym: So I'm just like, who are these characters?

453
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,600
Scott: - I know, it was a movie.

454
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,367
Rym: - Why does she have a tail?

455
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:23,380
Rym: - Project Aco movie.

456
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,860
Rym: - Why, is that Project Battle Gray, Battle Blue?

457
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,820
Scott: - It just says Project Aco movie.

458
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:35,960
Scott: Then there was Project Aco 2, which is an OAV, 3 was an OAV, 4 was an OAV, Aco the Versus was an OAV, and Aco the Manga was a manga.

459
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,279
Rym: - Versus kind of sucks.

460
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,619
Scott: - Okay, it was a movie, I was wrong.

461
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,480
Rym: - Yeah, all right.

462
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,819
Scott: - It's just 80 minutes, they're short.

463
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:50,379
Rym: - But anyway, so movies that are anime, if they come out, you know, we always talk about what anime you should see, you should pretty much see them all because it's not that hard to do.

464
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,380
Scott: - Yeah, even if they're not good ones, they're so rare, it doesn't take much time to watch them all.

465
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Rym: - And a lot of them recently have been pretty good that we've been seeing.

466
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,980
Rym: I mean, Sword of a Stranger, I really enjoy.

467
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,959
Scott: - Yeah, I haven't seen any awful ones that are painful, but just at worst, they're average or slightly above average.

468
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,713
Rym: - The last bad anime movie I watched all the way through, I think, was Gundam F91.

469
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
Scott: - That's a very old movie from 1991.

470
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,100
Rym: - Well, there is also Goro's Earthsea.

471
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,920
Scott: - That wasn't, I mean, that was bad, but it wasn't, like, hideous.

472
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,720
Scott: Like, I'm dying, this is the worst thing ever.

473
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,320
Rym: - I don't know, though, it hurt because the animation was so good, but the rest of it was so stupid.

474
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,700
Scott: - Yeah, it's bad, but there's a lot worse things out there.

475
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,940
Rym: - Yeah, I guess I don't regret having seen Goro's movie.

476
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:39,500
Rym: - Goro, the good tournament.

477
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:53,980
Rym: - I almost regret seeing Gundam F91 'cause it was just so fucking boring and long and I had no idea what was going on and I kind of fell asleep, and then everyone was in an orange jumpsuit and their dads died and it was just stupid.

478
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,560
Scott: - Everyone had a dad, everyone's dad died.

479
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,540
Rym: - Yep, and every dad was in an orange jumpsuit.

480
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:09,960
Scott: - The problem with F91 is it seemed like a compilation movie that didn't leave out the small details, so it had a lot of small things that had very short scenes, so you didn't care about them 'cause they weren't there long enough to care, whatever.

481
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:10,840
Scott: We've done a show on that.

482
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,860
Rym: - Yep, so we did see, you know, there was, for those of you who weren't paying attention, another Ghibli movie.

483
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,816
Scott: - There was.

484
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,118
Rym: - Yes, and it was not by Miyazaki's.

485
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,656
Scott: - No.

486
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,920
Rym: - It's one of the non-Miyazaki Ghiblis.

487
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:31,660
Scott: - Yeah, I know, people always get these confused a lot, like they don't know which Studio Ghibli movies that were directed by Miyazaki and which ones weren't, and they get confused all the time.

488
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,020
Rym: - Yep, as long as they're not directed by Goro.

489
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,840
Rym: - Self-included.

490
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,220
Rym: - So The Borrowers was, it looks like there was a cartoon and a live action.

491
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,173
Scott: - Yeah, I knew that there was a thing called The Borrowers, and I didn't know anything else about it, and I got it confused slightly with The Rescuers for a time, but that was wrong.

492
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:48,460
Scott: - Really?

493
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,609
Scott: - Yeah.

494
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,540
Rym: - Ah, little people.

495
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,420
Scott: - Yeah, but basically The Borrowers is about little people, but it's not Lilliput, it's not, what's his name?

496
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,660
Scott: - Gulliver?

497
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,919
Scott: - Gulliver and his travels.

498
00:24:58,521 --> 00:24:59,799
Scott: It's another little people, right?

499
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,719
Rym: - You realize only the first bit of Gulliver's travels is little people.

500
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,209
Scott: - I know.

501
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:03,720
Scott: - Okay.

502
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,400
Scott: - But whenever you see Gulliver's travels portrayed in any other medium besides book, it is just mostly focusing on little people.

503
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:25,259
Rym: - True, but The Borrowers, basically, this is a straight up adaptation of The Borrowers, which is the story of these little humanoid people who live in the walls of houses and out in the wilderness and borrow stuff that humans wouldn't miss and don't want to be seen.

504
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,620
Scott: - Yeah, so for example, rather than growing sugar cane, which they really can't do 'cause they're tiny and they don't live anywhere near sugar, they steal one cube of sugar from some humans at the middle of the night in their kitchen.

505
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:39,239
Scott: The humans won't know it was missing 'cause it was one cube.

506
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,639
Scott: But meanwhile, that one cube is enough sugar for fucking months and months for those little tiny people 'cause they're so tiny.

507
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:48,200
Scott: Ignore the science, it's a fantasy.

508
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,440
Rym: - And this is kind of like a slice of a story.

509
00:25:51,640 --> 00:26:00,420
Rym: It kind of just picks up kind of in the middle of this life of the borrowers and there's this kind of underplot of how come there are so few of us?

510
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,519
Rym: The borrowers we follow in the story don't actually really know about any other borrowers out there anymore.

511
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,220
Rym: They've lost contact with everyone.

512
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:23,759
Scott: - Yeah, 'cause if you're so small and you can't move around quickly and you don't live in a big city of borrowers, your closest people, assuming there's a borrower in every house, the closest people are in the next house, which is a whole yard away, that's like a week-long trip to get over there.

513
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,700
Rym: - I don't think a week, they're not that small.

514
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,340
Scott: - No, I'm just saying.

515
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,260
Rym: - They're inches, they're not centimeters.

516
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,077
Scott: - If you can't ride an animal or a boat or a tiny plane, you're not getting over there.

517
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,593
Rym: - The next yard over is not that far.

518
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:35,420
Rym: if you're inches tall.

519
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:35,978
Rym: - It's far.

520
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,759
Rym: - No, it's not.

521
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,040
Scott: - It is, especially when you live in the middle of nowhere, like these people.

522
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,838
Rym: - Ah, well they live in the middle of nowhere, that's a different thing.

523
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,560
Scott: - That's what I'm saying.

524
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:53,400
Rym: - But the movie basically kind of picks up, there's this kind of little drama and then you follow this little story of the kid in this house who has anime heart, a very specific disease.

525
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,440
Scott: - It's the same disease from, oh, what was that very-- - Staring Up at the Half Moon.

526
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,018
Scott: - Yeah.

527
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,680
Rym: - I really like that, actually.

528
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,980
Scott: - I'm remembering, I just didn't remember the name of it, but yeah, I should watch that again.

529
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,620
Rym: - Anime heart is a very specific disease.

530
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:09,159
Rym: It causes you to be bedridden, but yet you can get up and do stuff whenever you need to.

531
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,379
Rym: You're not going to school, everyone's afraid you're gonna die.

532
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:17,400
Rym: If you exert yourself, things get dire and dramatic music plays and you start to sweat.

533
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,459
Rym: And you may die after the credits.

534
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,540
Scott: - Oh, you may die earlier than that.

535
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,780
Rym: - Usually anime heart only kills you after the credits.

536
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,499
Scott: - And you know, sometimes anime heart, it can only be cured by miracles.

537
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,140
Scott: If it is cured by miracles of some sort.

538
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,159
Rym: - The story, what it really picks up with is a family comes to their house.

539
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,080
Scott: - Anime heart usually only afflicts children.

540
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,538
Rym: - Yes.

541
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:48,200
Rym: And the young boy has anime heart, so he's kind of bedridden, and he sees a borrower and they're not supposed to be seen.

542
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,960
Rym: And then we kind of follow the story from there.

543
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,260
Scott: - Well, it's not that they're not supposed to be seen.

544
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,320
Scott: It's not like, you know--.

545
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,080
Rym: - Well, they don't want to be seen.

546
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,040
Scott: - Right, they don't want to be seen because they're basically afraid that humans will pull a King Kong situation, right?

547
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:00,537
Scott: Rightly so.

548
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,879
Rym: - Yes, because King Konging seems to happen.

549
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,620
Scott: - If you saw little people in your apartment, would you not King Kong?

550
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,659
Rym: - I don't know if I would King Kong, per se.

551
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,820
Scott: - At the very least, you would YouTube King Kong.

552
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,620
Rym: - And that would cause them trouble.

553
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,480
Rym: - But the story really, you know, Ariete from the title is just a young girl.

554
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:31,056
Rym: She's like the daughter of two of the borrowers, and she doesn't necessarily, she's really curious about this family, and the boy is kind of really nice to her and curious about her, and the parents are like, "No, we gotta leave, they've seen

555
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:31,198
Rym: us.".

556
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,240
Rym: And I'm obviously being very vague and kind of avoiding talking about the plot because it's a movie, you should just go see it.

557
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,719
Rym: There's no reason not to see this movie.

558
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Rym: Nothing we say from this point forward should convince you to see the movie.

559
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,980
Rym: You should already be on your way to see it.

560
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,159
Scott: - It's a Studio Ghibli movie.

561
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,220
Scott: It is not directed by Miyazaki, but the guy who did direct it, what's his name?

562
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:49,798
Scott: I don't even know.

563
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,900
Rym: - It is fantastic, and it's directed by Yone Bayashi.

564
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,839
Scott: - Yep, I wouldn't say it's fantastic, but it's very good.

565
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,545
Rym: It is great.

566
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:04,517
Rym: - I would say it's fantastic because it gave me that feeling after you watch a really good movie, just like, (sighs).

567
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,940
Scott: - Nah, it didn't give me the strong feeling of the top level of Ghibli movies.

568
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,342
Scott: - Really?

569
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:14,660
Scott: - Such as the Spirited Away or the-- - Well, Spirit, here's the difference though.

570
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:19,840
Rym: Spirited Away had a bit, and Lopita both had a more epic story.

571
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:20,750
Rym: I mean, Lopita ends--.

572
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:21,460
Scott: - Or the Whisper of the Heart.

573
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,640
Rym: - With the gigantic castle in the sky and the collapse and the pirates and everything.

574
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,760
Scott: - It's not on the same level as the Whisper of the Heart.

575
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,500
Rym: - And Spirited Away has the epic journey.

576
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,940
Rym: - Or the Castle of Cagliostro.

577
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,900
Rym: - This is like a slice.

578
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,240
Rym: It tells one tiny piece of this larger borrower's story.

579
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:36,753
Scott: - Yeah.

580
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:41,140
Scott: I would put it slightly above actually Howl's Moving Castle.

581
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:45,240
Scott: 'cause honestly, the only thing I really liked in Howl's Moving Castle was Talking Fire.

582
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:52,300
Rym: - Well, Howl's, I think, suffered from the fact that if you hadn't read the book, it was kind, like the plot didn't really make sense.

583
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,999
Scott: - Yeah, that was the main problem there.

584
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,672
Rym: - You're like, "What's all

585
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:54,916
Rym: this?".

586
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,600
Scott: - Yeah, but the Talking Fire really helped out.

587
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,938
Rym: - But no, I really liked the borrowers just because it had-- - I'm not saying I didn't like it.

588
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,694
Scott: I'm just saying it's like, "Oh,

589
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:04,279
Scott: fantastic.".

590
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,419
Scott: I'm like, "Fantastic is a level too high for

591
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Scott: me.".

592
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,439
Rym: - No, I would call it fantastic 'cause it mainly-- - I would say great.

593
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,058
Rym: - It had the Ghibli atmosphere to a T.

594
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,480
Scott: - Well, 'cause the Ghibli animators went all out.

595
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:25,679
Rym: - It kind of followed in the, at least in the way I felt watching it, like the atmosphere from Ponyo and that it kind of had this slow, explore this setting and the people-- - I would definitely say it was equal to Ponyo.

596
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,991
Scott: - Lots of great animation.

597
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,160
Rym: I think the animation really sold it too.

598
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,859
Rym: Like the fact that right in the beginning, you notice that they animated the water tension, like the surface tension of water, relatively accurately to little people.

599
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,140
Rym: So like you're trying to pour tea and like one blob kind of just goes like plop into the cup.

600
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,800
Scott: - Yeah, that was really cool.

601
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:50,440
Scott: It's like they didn't pay attention to science so much 'cause obviously little people, not possible.

602
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:57,840
Scott: But a lot of other things that were somewhat scientific of like, what would it really be like if you were that small?

603
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
Scott: What kind of concerns would you have?

604
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Scott: You know, what would be different?

605
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:04,339
Scott: They paid attention to some of those things, like you said, tension of liquids.

606
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,860
Rym: - Yep, and that just made a really neat atmosphere.

607
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,640
Rym: Like look at all the detail they put into the kind of environment the borrowers had built inside the house.

608
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,260
Rym: Like all the nails and the journeys and the sound too.

609
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:25,420
Rym: They really did a good job with the soundscape and you know, the fridge makes like horrible, distant death noises all the time when it's in scene.

610
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,240
Scott: - Yep, all right, so what else do you guys say about this besides watching?

611
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,539
Rym: - You don't have much to say about it, do you?

612
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,992
Scott: - I mean, it was 90 minutes.

613
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,079
Scott: It was a pretty good movie, I don't know.

614
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,000
Rym: - I mean, it had such great attention to detail.

615
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,900
Rym: The music was good, not great.

616
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,979
Rym: The music kind of just worked.

617
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:48,940
Rym: The song was interesting because the theme of the movie was actually in English.

618
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,418
Scott: - Oh yeah, that's right, it was.

619
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,298
Rym: - There's a whole story behind why they chose that artist and everything that I read, but I don't remember the details enough to impart it to you.

620
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:09,660
Rym: But I believe it was something to do with like the artist who is not Japanese had mailed a copy of her latest CD to the studio as a gift for something and then they liked it, they used it in the movie.

621
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,178
Scott: - Not really.

622
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,980
Rym: - I read something about that, but I don't remember it in detail.

623
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,900
Scott: - That's interesting 'cause usually that's the sort of thing that a scary fanboy would do and we'd get ignored.

624
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:25,380
Scott: One thing about the movie that was only slightly confusing was there was the housekeeping lady.

625
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,780
Rym: - I don't think it was confusing 'cause one, it is set up early on that she just doesn't know much about the outside world.

626
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,553
Scott: - No, clearly, but the thing is, it's like her motive, she's obviously the bad guy.

627
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,859
Scott: She's not evil, but she's the bad guy.

628
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,160
Rym: - No, I would argue that she is in fact evil.

629
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,799
Rym: She's a creeper.

630
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,537
Scott: - She is a creeper, but she's not--.

631
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,080
Scott: - She's not evil like friggin' Darth Vader evil, right?

632
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,320
Rym: - No, but she's a creeper, which is a side of evil.

633
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:57,255
Scott: - But anyway, but it's like she wants to get the borrowers, she sees them.

634
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,760
Rym: - No, think about it, her motivation's pretty simple.

635
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:04,000
Rym: She obviously, remember when they're talking about the little people earlier in the movie?

636
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:13,360
Rym: And the mother, the family is like, yay, the little people, the stories from our great uncles and the people in the past in the family and the dollhouse and everything.

637
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:29,220
Rym: And she, she probably has noticed things missing or has seen things and she thinks they exist and it bothers her and she wants to prove that they're real and she doesn't like the fact that everyone else kind of treats this as kind of like fairytale and they're very happy about it.

638
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,379
Rym: Like she wants to prove that they're there, to prove that she's not just going crazy.

639
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,419
Rym: - Yeah, it seems-- - Also, she's a creeper.

640
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,000
Scott: - Yeah, but it's like-- - She makes this great face.

641
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:44,564
Scott: - If she just wants to prove that they're there, it's like, but she could have done that immediately, but then she called like the exterminators to come and trap more of the-- - She wanted

642
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:47,780
Rym: to catch the rest of them probably and then like show it to the newspapers.

643
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,707
Scott: - Yeah, but she never, that motive of like, let's make money off these little people and do.

644
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:57,200
Scott: the King Kong was never explicitly stated, so it was sort of like-- - I don't think it needed to be.

645
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,980
Rym: It was pretty obvious.

646
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,279
Scott: - So like, what is she doing?

647
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,980
Rym: - 'Cause she didn't like, you know, vermin.

648
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,657
Rym: She was already like wanting exterminators early on.

649
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,300
Scott: - But it's like, if she wanted to just make, you know, do the King Kong thing, she had one already, you know, I don't know, whatever.

650
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,639
Rym: - Yeah, but she knew there were more.

651
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,260
Scott: - Yeah, whatever.

652
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,360
Rym: - And she wanted to get the rest of them right away.

653
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:21,839
Scott: - Anyway, so after we watched the movie, we went on YouTube and we searched for the borrowers and we found-- - Oh, there is a treasure trove of terrible old things.

654
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:30,600
Scott: - Apparently, there was a really old TV show and there was also a more recent live action movie in the US and we watched like trailers and previews and clips from all of these.

655
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,739
Rym: - There's a lot of stuff.

656
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,080
Scott: - They were all horrible and horrifying simultaneously.

657
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,920
Scott: So actually, this is kind of good because it gives you hope in a way, right?

658
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,739
Scott: There's a lot of things out there that-- - Scott, My Little Pony.

659
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,639
Scott: - That's another one, right?

660
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:58,436
Scott: There's a lot of things out there that either started in one medium of art and they were, you know, transferred to other mediums very poorly for, you know, such as My Little Pony, which I guess My Little Pony started as a TV show,

661
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:02,139
Rym: but-- - It started terrible, it maintained terribleness and then was rebooted.

662
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,940
Scott: - Right, but I mean, there's plenty of like books that were awesome and then had like a bunch of terrible movies made after them, right?

663
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:11,740
Scott: There are plenty of video games that are a bunch of horrible movies made out of them.

664
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,217
Rym: - All of them?

665
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,079
Scott: - All of them, right.

666
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:29,840
Scott: So there's still hope, though, that even though every attempt to translate something into another medium has done been a horrible failure, if the right person does it with the right attitude, you have another chance and people might not even remember the other bad ones if they're old enough, you know?

667
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,480
Rym: - If only we could get people to forget about previous G4 My Little Pony to make it disappear.

668
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:38,397
Scott: - You mean My Little Pony prior to G4?

669
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,780
Rym: - The pre-G4 is not, anyway, it's not the My Little Pony cast.

670
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,760
Scott: - G1, G1, two and three.

671
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:51,580
Rym: - But like all the little details, like Arietty, the main character, I really like her 'cause she has the good balance of, she's definitely a Ghibli heroine.

672
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,678
Scott: - No, no kidding.

673
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Rym: - But she's the right amount of adventurous and defiant and cool and badass, all mixed in one.

674
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,899
Scott: - Yeah, but the other thing I liked about her more than some of the other Ghibli heroines is that she's actually somewhat more careful than the other ones.

675
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,899
Scott: A lot of the other ones are just so badass, like Nausicaa's just like, "I'm gonna fucking go out there and do it.

676
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:16,079
Scott: "We're going right in the fucking nasty, "horrible forest of death, fuck you," right?

677
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:21,589
Scott: Whereas Arietty's more like, "All right, yeah, I don't really wanna get seen "by the humans and get caught or eaten "by the cat or

678
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,976
Scott: anything.".

679
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:24,780
Rym: So she has a little more common sense and carefulness.

680
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,695
Rym: - Like she doesn't just take that sugar cube with a little note.

681
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:28,020
Scott: - Yeah, exactly.

682
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,319
Scott: She seems like a real person who's more intelligent and not just running into danger to make conflict for a movie, you know?

683
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:35,740
Scott: It's like she's more reasonable.

684
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,820
Rym: - Her with her cute sword and that little clip she puts in her hair, that's pretty great.

685
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,480
Rym: I like how the clip kinda looks like mouse ears from the right angle.

686
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,220
Rym: I think that was intentional.

687
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:46,920
Scott: - Maybe.

688
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,160
Rym: - Being a little person.

689
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,380
Rym: And the family's just great.

690
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,900
Rym: The moms, you know, the worried mom and the dad's just like--.

691
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,459
Scott: - Yeah, the mom was kind of annoying, but the dad was awesome.

692
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,280
Rym: - The dad's just like the badass, quiet Ghibli dad.

693
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,620
Scott: - Yeah, dad's cool.

694
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,036
Rym: - Yeah.

695
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,959
Scott: - I also like how, you know, you didn't have that sort, you know, there's those certain things like, oh, is this gonna go like, you know, dad dies kind of story?

696
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,340
Scott: And it doesn't really, it doesn't go that way.

697
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,480
Rym: - No, I didn't expect any of that.

698
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:20,359
Scott: - It just goes like, oh, you know, it's nice to see though, 'cause usually whenever there's a family thing, you know, 'cause when you have any kind of anime usually, they don't focus on characters' families unless they're gonna do something with them.

699
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:29,560
Scott: Like there'll be a show about a school, they'll only show you the parents of a kid if those parents are gonna do something like die or make trouble or become bad guys or something.

700
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,179
Scott: Otherwise, you never see the rest of the kid's family at all, you just, they don't exist at all and no one talks about them.

701
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,898
Scott: So, the fact that the parents are there, it's like, oh, something's gonna happen with them.

702
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,200
Rym: - Well, stuff did, but let's zoom out a little bit.

703
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,561
Scott: - Obviously, stuff did happen, but it wasn't-- -.

704
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:51,220
Rym: In the early part of the movie, there were tons of Chekov's rats and Chekov's swords and none of them Chekov, they were just atmosphere.

705
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,820
Rym: - They were.

706
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,640
Rym: - And it was actually kind of refreshing.

707
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,818
Scott: - Yeah, I was like-- - I thought the movie-- - When I saw those rats in the beginning, I was like, rats are gonna eat somebody, they never did.

708
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:04,359
Rym: in this one particular direction just based on all the Chekov's and then it really didn't at all.

709
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,138
Scott: - No, not at all.

710
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,639
Rym: - I was pleasantly surprised by that.

711
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,320
Rym: - Yeah, I like that.

712
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:15,040
Rym: - Like, right away, I expected there to be some sort of continuing camaraderie drama between that dumbass crow and the fat cat.

713
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:17,979
Scott: But then, really-- - The crow had his scene and never came back.

714
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,299
Rym: - Yeah, the crow had two scenes.

715
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,740
Rym: He attacks the cat for no good reason.

716
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,359
Scott: - And he gets stuck in the window.

717
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
Rym: - Which is actually a pretty great scene.

718
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,480
Scott: - Which is pretty, and then you never see him again.

719
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,738
Rym: - I love how the kid is just sitting there like, what the fuck do I do?

720
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:38,059
Rym: And he like, the crow's like trying to struggle and every time he tries to help the crow, the crow starts pecking him, so he backs off and then the crow starts struggling again and there's just.

721
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,760
Rym: - And I do enjoy the housekeeper because she, you know, we keep saying she's a creeper.

722
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,559
Rym: Just wait, watch this movie, you'll see.

723
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,160
Rym: There are like 10 scenes where someone's doing something and in the background, she's like, hey.

724
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,080
Rym: She makes this face.

725
00:38:55,702 --> 00:39:04,819
Scott: - Well, a lot of Ghibli characters, you know, especially bad ones, sort of have that mouth open kind of heavy breathing kind of thing that happens once or twice in a movie.

726
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,420
Scott: You know, like.

727
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,720
Rym: - Yeah, but she does this every time nobody's looking.

728
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:18,080
Scott: - There's a lot of, you know, a lot of those typical Ghibli things, there's like some ball-like creatures in the very early scene that are, you know, they're always kind of hanging around.

729
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,879
Rym: - But like when she locks the kid in the room and the way she was creeping for so long, I have expected the maid to like try to murder the whole family.

730
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,680
Scott: - Yeah, get some sort of inherited, like what, you know, I didn't know what her motive was and so I was like, is she gonna like, hoping the kid dies?

731
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,639
Scott: Like what is she up to here?

732
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,579
Rym: - I feel like she is gonna murder the family, but that's after the credits.

733
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,016
Scott: - Maybe.

734
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,720
Rym: - Unless Anna My Heart gets the kid first.

735
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,337
Scott: - Yeah.

736
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,120
Rym: - But I mean, I don't wanna say anything else about this movie because-- - I assume Disney's gonna put it on DVD eventually, right?

737
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,771
Rym: - It's fantastic.

738
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:47,239
Rym: - Like they do.

739
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:58,570
Rym: - Or at least really good and there's no reason not to see it and there's no reason for us to spoil it or talk about the cool stuff that happens in it because you'll see it and it's awesome and we're just gonna say, oh

740
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:01,120
Scott: man, remember when-- - It's a Ghibli movie, how could you not watch it?

741
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,620
Scott: What's wrong with you?

742
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,359
Scott: If you're any kind of anime fan, it's not, you know, it's not Earthsea, so why wouldn't you see it?

743
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:08,100
Scott: It takes 90 minutes of your life.

744
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,680
Rym: - You can see Earthsea, just don't turn on the subtitles.

745
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,900
Rym: And don't watch the scenes with the blob at the end.

746
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,660
Rym: - Just look at screenshots.

747
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,098
Rym: - Just skip from when the blob appears to when the dragon comes.

748
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,700
Scott: - Sure.

749
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,980

750
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,140
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

751
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,500

752
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,460

00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,060
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

756
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:56,160
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

757
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:22,097
Rym: - It's Wednesday, August 17th, 2011.

758
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:22,427
Rym: I'm Rym.

759
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,689

00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:29,527
Rym: - It's Wednesday, August 17th, oh fuck.
