00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,379
Rym: It's Thursday September 22nd 2011.

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,886
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,129
Rym: We talk about weddings.

4
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:29,032
Rym: Let's do this Much like Pinkie Pie.

5
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:30,240
Rym: I like to party.

6
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:36,380
Rym: I like to go to parties a lot, and it's funny that I like to go to parties a lot more.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,365
Scott: They like to go to work.

8
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,371
Rym: It's funny.

9
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:43,091
Rym: How when we were in college We did not party like we very rarely had like.

10
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,034
Rym: this is a party.

11
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:48,229
Rym: we basically just hung out And did stuff or usually didn't do stuff.

12
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,895
Rym: That's a party or just played games.

13
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,160
Scott: How is that not a party now?

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,545
Rym: Well see what I think of party.

15
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:54,173
Rym: I differentiate it from hanging out.

16
00:00:54,213 --> 00:01:02,948
Rym: when I say let's hang out I invite specific people to do something or I have a general invite, but no no agenda No, nothing, and I don't provide any food.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,917
Rym: to me party means wherever I am They're providing food and drink and a larger number of people possibly people.

18
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:11,840
Rym: I don't know are invited.

19
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,817
Scott: How many people makes a party?

20
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,862
Rym: I think it depends more on whether or not the host is providing food and drink and Entertainment.

21
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:22,093
Rym: like is it provided entertainment or a provided thing?

22
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:23,920
Rym: or are you just at their house?

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,519
Rym: And you're stealing their orange juice when they're not looking.

24
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,499
Scott: What if you come over to my house, and I pour you the orange juice?

25
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:39,615
Scott: If you if it was planned ahead of time - is kind of important like if you said hey Rym on Thursday come over you come Over to my house is just you and me and you've been but the orange juice is already poured when you show up.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,123
Rym: ah there's one more step.

27
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:57,034
Rym: to make it a party it has to be not an open invite to the public, but a Generally either a generally open invite or some sort of RSVP system like and it has to be broken down like the family unit Or the friend unit group like if you say I

28
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:02,879
Scott: send you a written Invitation to come over to my house for orange juice and tomorrow and the orange juice is already poured and show up

29
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,528
Rym: And that is party.

30
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,438
Scott: okay even though it's two people.

31
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,638
Rym: yes Okay, you can have a party with one person as we learned in my little pony, okay?

32
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:22,829
Rym: There you go, so the trouble I had is that I for a long time was the one who was always hosting all the fucking parties Which means one.

33
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,099
Rym: it costs a lot of money?

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,222
Rym: and to Visigoths

35
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:30,601
Scott: well, I mean the price of a party varies greatly But

36
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:37,929
Rym: even a crap Oh party like when we like we had everyone for New Year's right and we want to have dinner for one That was a couple hundred bucks worth of catering

37
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:38,170
Scott: yep,

38
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,180
Rym: which was a lot more money to us back then than it is now.

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,883
Rym: Well, that's your.

40
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,932
Scott: I mean, that's no different than going to a restaurant.

41
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,277
Scott: It's just you're paying for everybody.

42
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:50,220
Scott: now If everyone you made everyone pay then it wouldn't be so expensive.

43
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,254
Rym: But at the same time that's much more of a pain in the ass to manage it is.

44
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:57,706
Rym: and also what if someone says no Then you can't get in.

45
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,252
Scott: and I found cover charge.

46
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,220
Rym: I found something to pay me for the door bitches.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,510
Rym: That's right, but I found something more interesting.

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,800
Rym: if you expect people to pay for the food Then they will have an opinion on what foods you get and you know what?

49
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,780
Rym: I no longer have the patience in my life to deal with anyone's preferences on anything.

50
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:32,178
Scott: Yeah even when I'm at a restaurant and there's people there I'm with or even people at an adjacent table that are strangers if They like have trouble ordering or have to like be like say oh don't do this You know, give me this without this ingredient, you know, and it's not for an allergy.

51
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,585
Scott: it's like Dude, just pregnant order something.

52
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:35,709
Rym: No, no to be fair.

53
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,740
Rym: That's okay at crappy restaurants sometimes but it's a fine line.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,803
Rym: It's a really crappy restaurant.

55
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:40,786
Scott: I mean, there's a limit Scott.

56
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:45,120
Rym: if you're at McDonald's you're like, can I get extra sauce on this burger?

57
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,256
Rym: It's like dude, come on.

58
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:52,736
Rym: But at the same time if you're an ultra fancy restaurant You're paying that chef to do what he does best if you know better than him.

59
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,560
Rym: Why you at his restaurant?

60
00:03:54,462 --> 00:04:01,877
Rym: Yeah, you know I feel like it's okay to say yeah, can I not have bacon on the salad, please?

61
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,006
Scott: Mostly it's you know, the.

62
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:16,336
Rym: the annoyance depends on how much time you spend deciding true But when it comes to me providing food for people if I say like hey, we'll get catering.

63
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,440
Rym: What do you all want?

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:27,920
Rym: I believe that if I take my entire circle of friends and everyone gets to veto one and only one thing Every possible food will be vetoed except gruel and then no one will want to eat gruel.

65
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,924
Rym: Yep, but you only get one veto people use their first.

66
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,670
Scott: the first person to veto will veto gruel.

67
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:40,573
Scott: that actually is a little before we get into the main topic and Then the other thing that person doesn't like is the one that's gonna get picked.

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:47,651
Rym: before we get into the main topic I have a word of advice for all of you punk kids who are going through the steps We went through forming your own crews out there.

69
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:48,757
Rym: eat all food.

70
00:04:49,038 --> 00:05:00,579
Rym: Well Everyone will eat Mediocre lukewarm delivery Chinese, that's true because if you're ordering mediocre lukewarm delivery Chinese You're hungry enough to where it doesn't matter.

71
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:09,800
Rym: But more importantly if you do have to order food as a group and it's pizza For example use the one veto system works very well.

72
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,184
Rym: Just go around the room first.

73
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:20,663
Scott: eliminate anything with allergies like celiac or whatever because you can't blame someone for at least You know, if you have enough people you're gonna be ordering multiple pizzas Chinese food.

74
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:31,188
Rym: you're gonna order multiple dishes true, but if you're ordering like come you like even pizza though all right bigger people - maybe three pizzas if Through three people have specific requirements.

75
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,640
Rym: You're kind of fucked already and one of those pizzas are gonna be plain cheese.

76
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,451
Rym: Yeah, you don't want one of your pizzas to be plain cheese.

77
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,380
Rym: That means you failed as a group of friends.

78
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:43,580
Scott: Just get one plain cheese and then get an extra meat pizza that you can have something.

79
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,040
Rym: No, because if you have a friend who will only eat plain cheese pizza, what the hell that's true.

80
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,883
Scott: Don't be that guy.

81
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,789
Scott: unless you're allergic and you can't.

82
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:56,539
Rym: you're allergic to everything in the world, but bread and cheese And sauce.

83
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:06,889
Rym: But anyway go around the room pick an order and say everyone gets to veto one topping Mmm, you will be surprised how well that works.

84
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:19,066
Scott: as long as the group is more than like four people and less than like 12 And as long as enough of your friends are reasonable because half the more than half of our people are like I veto nothing Yep, which makes it even easier.

85
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:23,519
Scott: like, you know, and the thing is also, you know, everyone has tastes right?

86
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,181
Scott: Like.

87
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,795
Scott: I really like sausage or ham or pineapple on pizza.

88
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:34,340
Rym: I love pineapple in general Yep, but I want fruit on the which is trouble because I my favorite kind of pizza is Hawaiian pizza.

89
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,188
Scott: How is that your favorite?

90
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:35,693
Scott: disgusting?

91
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,226
Scott: It's awesome But it's like I'm not gonna.

92
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,100
Scott: you know, sometimes they get a pizza with sausage and I just eat it anyway.

93
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,019
Scott: Cuz I'm not a little baby.

94
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,786
Scott: Don't be a baby.

95
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,574
Rym: I feel like I can eat it.

96
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,060
Rym: you would not eat a Hawaiian pizza?

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,603
Rym: I don't think.

98
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,211
Scott: probably not but it's like.

99
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:53,900
Rym: no, you know what you would do with my answers.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,663
Rym: God, I know you.

101
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:58,802
Rym: you just pick the pineapple and the ham off and then it's just a mediocre slightly wet pizza Maybe.

102
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:03,900
Scott: but the point is I wouldn't cry and moan about it or do anything like that.

103
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:14,600
Rym: This is a good exercise for you as the man up Of your group of friends to one assert your dominance by taking charge of the situation to by doing the game.

104
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:22,600
Rym: You can now use mechanism design to influence the way your friends choose in order to get your desired outcome Which is no hassle one.

105
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,655
Rym: You have to say because and quotes because I am sorting out the bullshit with the toppings.

106
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,939
Rym: you picky-ass motherfuckers.

107
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:35,460
Rym: Someone else has to call the pizza place And To use peer pressure.

108
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,515
Rym: Someone's gonna be like I want to veto more than one thing and just peer pressure will end that.

109
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,785
Rym: you can't say no go home Yep, get the fuck out.

110
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,212
Rym: That's right, or maybe trade some futures.

111
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:50,681
Rym: Like I will sell you my veto for $10.

112
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,260
Rym: Anyway, the point of all this is that I really like parties but it sucks to run parties.

113
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:54,903
Scott: No kidding.

114
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:58,059
Rym: The answer is to go to other people's weddings.

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,549
Rym: Shit because forget let's forget about the.

116
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,340
Rym: you know, there's a whole discussion about whether or not or any sort.

117
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,159
Scott: You know bar mitzvah is also good.

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,258
Scott: Yep, pretty much anyone else throwing a party at their expense if I'm going fuck.

119
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:12,900
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,645
Rym: so Weddings in particular.

121
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,693
Rym: now, I don't really want to get into just yet the whole thing about.

122
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,820
Rym: you know, diamonds aren't worth anything.

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,666
Scott: or You can talk about how diamonds aren't worth anything.

124
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:24,509
Rym: They're worth nothing.

125
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,685
Rym: Yeah, or you know, you spent $80,000 on a wedding that you could have had for $20,000.

126
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:33,418
Rym: if you just been a little more judicious in your plan.

127
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,549
Scott: you spent $20,000 on a wedding.

128
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,198
Scott: you could have spent two.

129
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:38,880
Scott: What did you waste?

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,340
Scott: $18,000.

131
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,888
Scott: now granted I can imagine a $20,000 party.

132
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:53,440
Scott: it would have to be a fucking week long Or it should I have to be one day a few days long, but you're paying for everyone's hotel rooms and transportation.

133
00:08:54,026 --> 00:09:00,139
Scott: It could just be one day But one epic day and you're paying for their plane tickets or you're paying for a fucking cruise ship.

134
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,860
Rym: to me $20,000 means you had a live band that is actually known by people who aren't you?

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,879
Scott: Yes, as in you paid the appearance fee of a famous person for an hour.

136
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,356
Scott: I know some famous people have appearance fees greater than that, but you can get a semi-famous purse.

137
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,460
Rym: you can get c-list.

138
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,010
Scott: Yes, definitely.

139
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,871
Rym: You can get fucking B list you If they're local yeah, and they're a little desperate.

140
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,380
Scott: you can also get tons of crazy shit.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,143
Scott: That's this you.

142
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:28,216
Scott: you would not believe some of the party shit that is available out there.

143
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:35,519
Scott: if you want to blow your money And there's a lot better ways to spend that party money then on Useless decorations you're gonna throw away.

144
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:38,040
Scott: You know a DJ that's you know.

145
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,084
Scott: You could just got.

146
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:43,763
Scott: you could have bought a whole Serato system for the amount of money you spent on the DJ to do it For one day.

147
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:50,032
Rym: Well, the key is to just get a friend to do it Mediocrally competent and it's not that hard in these.

148
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,760
Rym: don't ask ab just go for it.

165
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,060
Scott: Wow like that's their job.

166
00:10:54,422 --> 00:11:00,695
Rym: I've never encountered professional party dancers I was picturing like backup dancers like just at the front of the room behind the DJ.

167
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:01,859
Scott: no they like they.

168
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,364
Scott: you know They're like the DJ's like right and left hand people but we don't.

169
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:21,160
Rym: there have been a number of weddings in the crew and actually it's kind of fun that Weddings in the crew have more often than not been officiated by people in the crew and everyone in our crew Happens to know and be with both sides of the aisle bride and groom.

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:29,580
Rym: So it's kind of like every wedding I've been to in most of my life has been all of my friends having a party on someone else's dime.

171
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:36,945
Rym: Well, there's all these other people there at least recently Yeah, also family ones Family wedding.

172
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,260
Scott: there haven't been a whole lot of weddings in my family.

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,770
Rym: I've not in my lifetime been to two family weddings.

174
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:58,860
Rym: one of them was my mom getting remarried Which was awesome because like all my friends from town just kind of showed up and ate the pig and Some friend of the family got married once and I just went and got really drunk because my parents kept giving me alcohol And all the middle-aged ladies kept giving me alcohol.

175
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,664
Rym: And it was awesome.

176
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:07,335
Scott: all the people in my family who are married were married before I was born My close family and none of the people of my generation.

177
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:21,819
Rym: for me all the weddings I've been to have been the same like this the people I hang out with at the wedding of the same people I'd hang out With anyway, but yet there's a party and catered food and unlimited alcohol that I didn't pay for.

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,091
Scott: Alright, but at the same time right.

179
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:46,469
Scott: while it's awesome to go to someone else's wedding Most weddings are Unreasonably expensive and even reasonable ones are still somewhat unreasonably expensive now It is a lot of money to throw a party and I could understand you would want to throw a party and it costs a lot of money, but some people Overpaid notably on the aforementioned useless

180
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,010
Rym: rocks.

181
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:53,819
Scott: Yep, and useless one-time dresses and Tuxedo rentals and crap like that.

182
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,289
Scott: And so sometimes what you know.

183
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,940
Scott: wedding venues when you could have just had it in someone's backyard.

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,640
Rym: Some venues could be worth it something nice enough.

185
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,644
Rym: I mean venue.

186
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,858
Rym: what one of our friends got married in a pretty rocking castle.

187
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,851
Scott: actually Yeah, but I mean how much did the castle cost?

188
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,840
Rym: actually my favorite party?

189
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,852
Scott: It's like a castle is awesome party.

190
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,020
Scott: I would totally party in a castle.

191
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,124
Rym: The thing is my favorite part.

192
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,532
Scott: how much would I pay to party in a castle?

193
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:26,960
Rym: at the venue at night that we'd they let us Like use the venue all night long and we just had a bonfire and just sat around drinking.

194
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,651
Scott: That was an excellent a venue that I'm sure was much less money than the castle.

195
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,519
Scott: That was a very great venue excellent day.

196
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,920
Scott: But you know, it's like, you know, I think our friends are the most part.

197
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,878
Scott: I've had more weddings on the reasonable side of cost.

198
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:47,180
Scott: Yeah most people Seem to spend a lot more money and also a lot of you will get ripped off because when they go to have a wedding.

199
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:54,360
Scott: Right, it's like you go if you try going to get catering and then try to go get catering But let the caterer know you're having a wedding.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,820
Rym: Yes, like have like have two people called the same set of caterers for the exact same party But one of them says it's a wedding and one of them doesn't say it's a wedding.

201
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,551
Scott: They charge you more because it's a wedding because of the same reason.

202
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:13,299
Scott: funeral parlors charge you a ton of money because there's this Emotional grasp they have on you like it's your special day.

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,896
Scott: Actually the same way you want your special day to be so great, isn't it worth it?

204
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,266
Scott: your one special day You'll remember for the rest of your life.

205
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,296
Scott: It's worth that extra five thousand watch.

206
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,060
Rym: This is when I was a kid.

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:35,868
Rym: I remember seeing this, you know back when local news did a lot more investigative journalism And I saw a local news thing where they went to flower providers, you know botanists, I guess not botanists florists Yeah, I don't know.

208
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,350
Rym: I feel like you.

209
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,340
Rym: into a botanist you get much more interesting flowers, maybe.

210
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:57,398
Rym: Yeah so you go to a florist and what they did is they went to pretty much every florist in our area like in the suburb of you know Detroit and They would have one where a guy would go and say like he's doing it for some event and he wouldn't say what he'd say like some political function and a girl would go and say it was for a wedding.

211
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:05,925
Rym: a Guy would go and say it was for a wedding and they videoed with a hidden camera how the people treated these three different People trying to get flowers.

212
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,335
Rym: if her girl went to a wedding it was literally.

213
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,640
Rym: but it's your special day.

214
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:15,680
Rym: These black roses are only a hundred thousand dollars more, but you'll only have one wedding.

215
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,708
Rym: It's your special day.

216
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,720
Rym: Yeah ripped off to the guy and this actually kind of pissed me off.

217
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,550
Rym: They'd be like do you want her to be happy?

218
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,380
Rym: How will your honeymoon be if she isn't happy?

219
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,788
Rym: What if she regrets that you didn't get the better flowers?

220
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,992
Rym: She'll know.

221
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:31,955
Scott: you know, what?

222
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,840
Scott: don't buy any fucking flowers.

223
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:38,620
Scott: How are the power is gonna make the party any better or worse for the for the go to party fucking city?

224
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,610
Scott: It's cheap and you can get some streamers and you know what.

225
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,320
Scott: if you know how to work a streamer it can look fucking awesome.

226
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,822
Rym: Actually, nobody's gonna complain at the wedding We just went to.

227
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:54,352
Rym: I was very pleased that it was real flowers because having been in the wedding real flower if you're if you are Gonna get flowers real flowers are very important.

228
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,720
Rym: Yes fake flowers.

229
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,465
Rym: I've had fake boutonnieres before and let me tell you fuck those things also when you do get you know That sort of stuff.

230
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:07,208
Scott: most of the problem with expensive shit at weddings Is that it's a useless or be one-time use.

231
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:17,036
Scott: right dress is not useless, but it is mostly one-time use which is like Uh, but if you're gonna reuse that dress a whole bunch and it wasn't ludicrously expensive like this.

232
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,520
Scott: wedding dresses for multiple thousands.

233
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:24,986
Scott: Yeah, if you get a few hundred dollar wedding dress and you reuse it many times Dresses cost few hundred dollars.

234
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,049
Rym: You say a few hundred dollars.

235
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,480
Rym: I mean I've spent over four hundred dollars on an okay suit.

236
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:34,040
Scott: I've been three hundred dollars in a coat and three hundred dollars in a kilt, but I get you sad of them.

237
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:39,352
Scott: Yep, if I spent three hundred dollars on the coat and wore it once my whole life That would be fucking crazy.

238
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,443
Rym: the most recent wedding We went to the bride.

239
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,000
Scott: that would be like buying an Xbox and playing one game for four hours and never using the Xbox ever.

240
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:50,664
Rym: I Scott bought a PlayStation 1 Sure, not that long.

241
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,590
Scott: Did you use it for only four hours?

242
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,597
Rym: I used it for only one day.

243
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:55,540
Rym: use it for one game.

244
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,364
Scott: That's not the same.

245
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:59,800
Scott: this dance dance revolution is wearing a dress for one day for four hours.

246
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,020
Rym: It is telling that I put a mod ship in it before I'd ever plugged it in or turned it on.

247
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:08,262
Scott: You know a ring with a diamond in it is a useless rock and also a work but first off.

248
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:16,037
Rym: so The wedding we most recently went to the bride had actually an amazing dress like.

249
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:22,734
Scott: it was pretty awesome Like it is hard for me to not be amazed But it also gets mad props for being it like, you know workable.

250
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,859
Scott: a lot of people get you know.

251
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,295
Scott: Especially women's fashion is often like high heels.

252
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:32,714
Rym: You cannot walk in them Yep, or a train so long that you need attendance to carry it right like they'll get stuff.

253
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,480
Scott: That is not feasible clothing.

254
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,970
Scott: It just doesn't work as clothing.

255
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,376
Scott: but this dress worked.

256
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:39,180
Scott: like you just walk around.

257
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:47,533
Rym: yep, and I'm in general all of our friends who have gotten married have gotten pretty nice dresses that were either very cheap and Good-looking or will be reusable and we're just awesome.

258
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,883
Scott: I haven't seen anyone reuse it yet though They'll see.

259
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,700
Scott: watch for at least you know, if you can hand it down thing is we need.

260
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,229
Scott: But the question is like if you were gonna hand it down.

261
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,219
Scott: Why weren't you wearing the handed down one from your mom?

262
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,088
Rym: Because styles change.

263
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,660
Scott: yeah, okay big deal.

264
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,884
Rym: Yeah, part of that is.

265
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:11,500
Rym: I like how non-traditional like non-traditional ceremonies are way more fun to me than traditional old You know standard way.

266
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,685
Scott: Well, I mean, I hate tradition.

267
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,327
Scott: in general.

268
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,460
Scott: tradition is never a good reason to do something if it's the only reason.

269
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:27,193
Scott: So if something is not a traditional way of doing something it automatically gets props for me no matter what Almost always and you know, I mean, all right, I'm beating flash now.

270
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:27,554
Rym: You know what?

271
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,740
Rym: I'm gonna be quick man first.

272
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:30,678
Scott: That's not a tradition.

273
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:44,300
Scott: I'm saying that you know, if you're doing something and your only reason that you're doing something, you know Or the only reason you're doing something in a particular way is because of tradition that is usually a bad reason to do it.

274
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:52,960
Scott: And instead you should figure out you know What is the best way to do something or the best thing to do regardless of any traditions that may exist?

275
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:54,429
Rym: But yeah under the rock.

276
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,692
Rym: we've talked about this on GeekNights a lot But not recently probably in like the 2006-2007.

277
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,178
Rym: It's been a long time since we talked about this because in 2006-2007 for whatever reason that was just a hot issue for us.

278
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,164
Rym: diamonds Mm-hmm fuck diamonds.

279
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,168
Rym: They're worth nothing.

280
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:12,220
Scott: Yeah people if you don't know right diamonds are worthless rocks.

281
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:17,997
Scott: They dig them out of the ground for you know often with very harsh labor, but sometimes not.

282
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,751
Scott: you can get it certified You know mined by not slaves if you want.

283
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:26,989
Scott: it cost more though, of course And there's bajillions of them.

284
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:27,190
Scott: It's.

285
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,540
Scott: they're not rare in any way or shape or form.

286
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,600
Scott: They're as rare as the rocks in your backyard.

287
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:37,705
Scott: Not only that we can just fucking make them and I don't mean make them like oh, it's a kirby zirconia It's not really a diamond.

288
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:43,136
Scott: No, we can make really a diamond never mind the fact that Genesis or other people you can make real diamonds.

289
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:47,277
Rym: I defy Anyone who is not a jeweler to be.

290
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,972
Rym: you know Walking down the street see a ring someone's got on and be like.

291
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:51,875
Rym: that's not a diamond.

292
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,200
Rym: That's a cubic zirconia.

293
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,063
Rym: I can tell by.

294
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,573
Scott: you have to get real close to tell and you know what.

295
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:12,800
Scott: in fact the fake ones or the ones that We make are usually better than ones that were randomly dug up out of the ground not to mention the fact that basically the reason diamonds are expensive is because the only people digging diamonds out of the ground is One giant company de beers and they put all the diamonds in a big safe in London.

296
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:25,379
Scott: This safe has just a bajillion diamonds in it a bajillion bajillion and what they do is every once in a while They take a handful of diamonds out in like a briefcase and given to some jewelers and that's they have a very so.

297
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,420
Scott: it seems As if the world is a very slow trickle of increased diamond supply.

298
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,427
Rym: You don't need to take any of this on faith.

299
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:35,020
Rym: a much better way to illustrate the truth as many documentaries and books.

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,890
Rym: There's a very simple way take any piece of jewelry.

301
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,555
Rym: That's legitimate as in.

302
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:48,160
Rym: you know, it's a real diamond or whatever and get it appraised and See what they say like oh, this is worth X tens of thousands of dollars, right?

303
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,559
Rym: So go to then go to any pawn shop or any jewelry store and ask them how much they will give you for it.

304
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:04,979
Rym: there will usually be a couple orders of magnitude difference between the quote appraised value and The value anyone in the world is actually willing to give you for it.

305
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,536
Scott: Yeah, GameStop right is is not even close to how jewelry goes right.

306
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:10,720
Scott: you think GameStop is ripping you off.

307
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:20,110
Rym: If you want a really nice ring and you actually for whatever reason wanted to be real Get a used ring from an estate sale.

308
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,273
Scott: That's a good idea.

309
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:26,849
Scott: other good ideas number one Don't get any rare metals or gems whatsoever.

310
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:30,960
Scott: get something else such as maybe someone on Etsy will make you something, right?

311
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,706
Scott: Why do you even need rings?

312
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,011
Scott: It's because it's a tradition.

313
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,296
Scott: Maybe you can do something else.

314
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,360
Scott: Maybe not do anything.

315
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:42,242
Scott: maybe get necklaces or earrings or Nothing or tattoos or You got to give.

316
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:49,225
Rym: you got exchange sets of D&D dice, it's a good deal.

317
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,910
Scott: hewn from something.

318
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,060
Scott: you'll use excellent computer mice keyboards find something to exchange.

319
00:21:56,824 --> 00:22:04,650
Rym: If I saw a wedding ceremony where they exchanged an IBM AT keyboard and like a DOS keyboard That's my wedding.

320
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:12,240
Scott: That's A kind of lame anyway.

321
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,527
Scott: and but the thing is you can still if you really want to if you have some emotional attachment to do with rings or Jewelry or something like that.

322
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,757
Rym: Seriously, you can at least get something.

323
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,170
Scott: Valuable diamonds are worthless, but you know what?

324
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:32,850
Scott: gold platinum especially Emeralds rubies all are actually rare and valuable.

325
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:37,587
Scott: as long as they don't have blood on the rubies can be Manufactured - they can be.

326
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,755
Scott: but they're still actually somewhat rare and valuable.

327
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:49,851
Rym: and as long as they don't blood on them the thing is I feel like a resin jewel of any kind is a Fully functional equivalent for just about any jewel in almost any situation.

328
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:58,140
Scott: Yeah, you can also get you know, various polished stones I mean my class that are not the shiny gems But you know stone from high school, by the way punk kids many of you are in high school.

329
00:22:58,622 --> 00:22:59,947
Rym: Don't buy your class ring.

330
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:00,670
Rym: You'll regret it.

331
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,280
Rym: You'll never look at it again after your freshman year of college.

332
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:07,275
Rym: Yep, if your parents try to make you buy it ask them to give you cash instead.

333
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:14,491
Rym: Yep Seriously worthless rocks, but my class ring looks really nice.

334
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,457
Rym: It has all gigantic fake.

335
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:20,128
Rym: general general You know what mine - looks fine.

336
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:29,166
Scott: Well, I got the India cut - gigantic fake I guess clear jam, which I it's not really diamond clear That was I guess I don't know.

337
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:32,960
Rym: I got I got a green one because I liked emeralds and I also like green.

338
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,292
Rym: Anyway, yeah, and what was on the side of your class ring.

339
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,593
Scott: one side had like a rocket ship That was like 2000 and the other side had a computer.

340
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:44,490
Rym: Ah mine We had a dragon, but one side was a trumpet.

341
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:45,253
Scott: All right.

342
00:23:45,353 --> 00:23:51,335
Rym: Yeah trumpet and a French horn and it said brass Brass and the other side was the dragon dragon.

343
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,499
Rym: No, it doesn't No, never never doing.

344
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:06,957
Scott: But yeah, what else you know, mainly just in general most people Spend way too much wet money on weddings bar mitzvahs and other sorts of parties than they should.

345
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:11,052
Scott: they could have a lot more Fun for a lot less money just like I think it would.

346
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,117
Scott: then it was it a thing of the day.

347
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:18,439
Scott: once these people on Reddit we're gonna have their wedding in a mansion and the guy who owned the mansion Canceled on them at the last minute.

348
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:21,352
Scott: So they that they went on reddit and they said help us.

349
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,140
Scott: reddit said have it in a field.

350
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,739
Scott: They called up their uncle who had a farm.

351
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:30,960
Scott: They had the wedding with some bouncy castles on the field of the farm for nothing because it's the uncle's field.

352
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:41,600
Scott: They had horses that were just there so people pet the horses and It was the amazing wedding that cost almost nothing compared to the mansion that they were gonna pay a fortune for.

353
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:46,179
Scott: So, you know, it's just you know, it's like nothing wrong with having a party.

354
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,970
Scott: Getting married is a good occasion to have a party.

355
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,320
Scott: any occasion is a good occasion to have a party.

356
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:53,840
Scott: How about we have a party about getting up or going to sleep?

357
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,092
Scott: Those are good reasons, but if you're gonna have any party, it doesn't matter what the reason.

358
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:00,840
Scott: don't spend moronic amounts of money on it.

359
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:02,113
Scott: Make it reasonable.

360
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:12,240
Rym: Hmm Though in terms of maximize fun going to weddings money spent I have noticed many things and that now I have having a wedding most recently on the mind that I actually find kind of interesting.

361
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:15,373
Rym: You can tell the Masters from the professionals.

362
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:16,579
Scott: That's for sure.

363
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:22,240
Rym: the a Master will drink a lot of alcohol in the course of the wedding.

364
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:24,828
Rym: The professionals are lined up.

365
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:29,060
Scott: everyone who's not a teetotaler like me will drink a lot of alcohol during any wedding.

366
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,046
Scott: If the bar is open.

367
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,613
Rym: they do not line up before the bar is open.

368
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,740
Rym: the alcoholics line up before the bar is open.

369
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,368
Rym: Let's see professionals appear out of nowhere.

370
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:40,153
Rym: The second the first drink is poured.

371
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,480
Rym: Yep ceremonies over there in line somehow.

372
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,906
Rym: Yeah, you don't know how they got there.

373
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:44,528
Rym: It's uncle Jim.

374
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,834
Rym: He's 400 pounds.

375
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:47,159
Rym: How did he beat you there?

376
00:25:50,081 --> 00:26:02,213
Rym: The middle-aged people the fathers and the mothers and the younger grandfathers and the uncles will be Surprisingly all touchy-feely with the spouses of all their friends male and female.

377
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:14,518
Rym: I've noticed that every wedding I've been to hmm, which is Only horrifying until you get old and then it's kind of awesome The ceremony will have some amount of derpitude in it.

378
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:22,266
Rym: Yeah, there is no way to not have some amount of derpitude because it's really hard to treat anything seriously Anything especially.

379
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:29,656
Scott: it doesn't matter what culture you are or anything You know, I guess maybe the incredibly seriously religious can keep it serious.

380
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:30,800
Scott: the whole time though

381
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:52,460
Rym: I was very proud of our friend Nury because there were readings during the wedding we just went to and she read a speech from Babylon 5 and rather than changing the names of all the Languages and races to be real ones just to make the speech kind of normal It was a reading about the Minbari and such and the fact that she did it super cereal was kind of amazing.

382
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:55,280
Rym: I almost cracked up and I was standing up there just trying not to laugh.

383
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,390
Scott: Yeah, I was just looking at a Rym the whole time.

384
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,220
Scott: He was making his don't laugh face.

385
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:07,160
Scott: I was like don't laugh where he makes his mouth completely fat But you get flat but you can see the corners going up and sometimes you can see the corners going down really firmly.

386
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:14,370
Scott: Yeah as he wins as he starts to win against his fight You'll see my cheekbone stick out as my.

387
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:30,992
Rym: I clench my whole jaw followed by Our friend Pete - Every wedding he's officiated has been way nerdy.

388
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,039
Scott: He's making use of his church universe.

389
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:44,497
Scott: Oh, by the way, when you need someone to officiate your wedding, right if you're not religious and you don't you know Want the wedding to be about God instead of being you might know a captain a captain's.

390
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:44,858
Scott: a good idea.

391
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:54,913
Scott: But basically, you know, even if you are religious, right if you go and get your wedding officiated by a religious person what ends up happening most of the time is How well do you know that person?

392
00:27:54,953 --> 00:28:01,268
Scott: maybe you know You're really churchy and you're really good friends of the minister and they know you and you see him every week And you actually talk to him.

393
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,559
Rym: then yeah, go for it.

394
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,288
Scott: But a lot of times people go and they get married by like, you know The priest or whatever and you barely know this guy.

395
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:16,580
Scott: you just go to that church once or twice a year for the important times You're supposed to go or the rabbi, you know, you go to the Jewish temple on the High Holidays.

396
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:27,162
Scott: You don't really know the guy so the wedding ends up being you know, the official yating tends to be generic More about God than about you, even if you believe in God You.

397
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:36,654
Scott: so I would suggest even if you do believe in God to try to get people You know to do it and not some person doesn't know you people about you.

398
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,820
Rym: He did a really good job at this one.

399
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,620
Rym: He's done all their weddings too in our crew.

400
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,360
Scott: All right, the point I was really trying to make is Pete does it because he got the thing from the universal life Church.

401
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:48,059
Scott: I also got it which you can get if you just you know.

402
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:54,732
Scott: If you need someone to officiate pick the person and if they can't do it Send them to the universal life Church where they can get this thing.

403
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:55,716
Scott: that lets them do it.

404
00:28:55,917 --> 00:29:05,789
Rym: nice aside I I joined the universalized life Church a long time ago and whenever I get hotel rooms or reservations for anything I put Reverend as my title.

405
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,740
Rym: Yeah one time this saved my bacon.

406
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:14,240
Rym: Yeah, we were at between PAX East the first PAX East and anime Boston.

407
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:19,760
Rym: They were like opposite weekends, so we just stayed in Boston the whole week and did a whole bunch of awesome shit.

408
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,462
Scott: That was good times.

409
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:25,097
Rym: I accidentally had one of the hotel reservations a day too long in.

410
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,095
Rym: for all of our travels I would have been out like 200 bucks.

411
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:32,815
Rym: So I called him up and I'm like, hey, can I just cut this short?

412
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:46,180
Rym: I know I'm past the deadline And at first I like no no, no, no, no, but then she the lady on the other end pauses and say oh Reverend give me a moment and then the manager comes on lines like Reverend to cost her.

413
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,292
Rym: We've made all the arrangements or anything else I can do for you.

414
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:52,490
Rym: Yeah, so Yeah, being a reverend is kind of awesome.

415
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,752
Rym: Yep, and it's oh, by the way I hereby forgive all the sins of every everyone who hears this right now.

416
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:02,190
Rym: if you're in the universal life Church I don't know even if you're not the power to do that.

417
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:02,591
Rym: There you go.

418
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,740
Scott: But what if they denied the Holy Spirit?

419
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,603
Scott: They can't be forgiven.

420
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:06,126
Scott: You know what?

421
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:06,950
Rym: That's fine.

422
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,216
Rym: There's no at least if they're Christians.

423
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:12,152
Rym: There's no Holy Spirit And if you believe and if you suddenly believe there is one for you.

424
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:13,699
Rym: Yeah, there is just for you.

425
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:17,424
Rym: I hereby make them all sure Cannon.

426
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,688
Rym: Yeah, I'm a priest.

427
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,837
Scott: Okay, and you're married.

428
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:23,849
Rym: No Yeah, you're all married to each other.

429
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:24,372
Rym: That's right.

430
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,357
Rym: Good luck sorting that one out.

431
00:30:25,438 --> 00:30:27,618
Scott: everybody one big blob.

432
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,864
Scott: It's it's marriage instrumentality.

433
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:32,388
Rym: Yep wedding cakes.

434
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,311
Rym: I don't know.

435
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:39,678
Rym: I'm a fan of the traditional wedding cake actually flavor wise Like that white wedding cake I really like.

436
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,280
Rym: But every wedding I've ever been to had shit-ass ice cream.

437
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:47,964
Scott: That's true.

438
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:49,813
Scott: They don't use expensive ice cream.

439
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,380
Rym: They use the cheapest possible.

440
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,989
Scott: I mean ice cream is real expensive to get good stuff in bulk.

441
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,544
Rym: Also forget that this reminded me of the things that piss me off one.

442
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:02,315
Rym: I Know there's that stupid tradition where like the bride or groom shove the cake in each other's faces.

443
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:02,817
Rym: It's stupid.

444
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:03,239
Rym: Don't do it.

445
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,427
Scott: Okay, do.

446
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:14,293
Rym: if you ever Take a fork and bang it against the glass because you think that's cool I hope you take the fork in your eye.

447
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:15,580
Rym: I just I hope you die.

448
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:18,516
Scott: Yeah, that needs you not clink the glasses.

449
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:31,405
Scott: you can however If you are drunk run your finger around the top of the glass that saying that is awesome That's okay but no clicking with your silverware to get them to kiss if I'm ever getting married somehow and There's clinking going on.

450
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:32,268
Rym: I'm ignoring it.

451
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,151
Rym: I'm just sitting there.

452
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:34,797
Scott: No, you should kick whoever clinks out.

453
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:35,720
Rym: No, I'll just wait.

454
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:39,499
Rym: I'll stare them all down Fluttershy style give him the finger.

455
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:54,940
Rym: however One person and only one person in all of history gets forgiven for clinking for Scott Johnson who was getting married was dancing with his mom Which is both an inside joke and literally what was going on and someone starts clinking.

456
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,451
Scott: That was an appropriate joke.

457
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:56,813
Rym: that was.

458
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:57,700
Rym: that was fantastic.

459
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:04,423
Rym: That was kind of like how when the cake came out they play the portal song and you know It's lame.

460
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,687
Rym: to make a cake is a lie joke.

461
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:11,368
Rym: unless there is literally a cake and some sort of like truth about it That can be revealed.

462
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,524
Scott: Yep What are the things?

463
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,752
Scott: there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of small things out there.

464
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,539
Scott: actually I'm a big fan of the.

465
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:28,980
Scott: You know, I said I don't like traditions, but I actually like the throwing and catching parts Because it is like a sport and I think weddings need more sport like activities.

466
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:35,240
Scott: I know that like a kids bar mitzvahs usually and you know, I guess also what are the the confirmation parties and things?

467
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,880
Scott: They'll do things like play games such as Coke and Pepsi and whatever which are kind of dumb games But at least they're like structured sport like activities.

468
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:55,073
Scott: I think more weddings need like, you know, like I said the bouncy castle maybe some kickball dodgeball Gladiator jousting X. Yep, those things they do the sumo suits.

469
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:59,630
Scott: I'm a big fan of all those things Especially because remember it's a wedding party activities.

470
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,413
Rym: It's a wedding.

471
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:05,294
Rym: It's gonna be you and all your friends and All of your middle-aged drunk uncles.

472
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,564
Scott: Well, that's another thing I'm not in favor.

473
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:12,240
Scott: usually these parties even if they're not weddings you are charged based on the number of people.

474
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:23,880
Scott: I am NOT in favor of inviting people you do not know Right, it's like people they'll invite like a distant cousin like your mom's second cousin someone you maybe saw once or twice in your life.

475
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,506
Scott: Right, you know, they exist.

476
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,031
Scott: Maybe I use.

477
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,360
Rym: those people are not invited by the people who are getting married.

478
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,989
Rym: They're invited by the family members.

479
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,840
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people, right?

480
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,223
Scott: I know like your parents will pay for the wedding and stuff like that because they're so traditional Right.

481
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,214
Scott: It's like don't don't let them do that shit.

482
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,820
Scott: take control of your own shit.

483
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,939
Scott: Do it the way you want to do it invite who you want to invite.

484
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:51,379
Scott: now Some people will be like, oh they're play this game where it's like, well, the person's gonna give a gift.

485
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:56,024
Scott: So if it costs less to invite them than the gift they give It's a good deal.

486
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:59,037
Scott: Listen, it's not about getting, you know profiting.

487
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:04,300
Scott: if you want a profit You could have taken all the money you spent on this party and invested it in a business or something, right?

488
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:05,765
Scott: You're not looking to profit.

489
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,011
Scott: you're looking to have an awesome party.

490
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,337
Scott: don't invite schmucks.

491
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:11,159
Scott: You don't know They're not gonna help your party be any better.

492
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:15,273
Scott: I only invite people you know and actually care about to your thing.

493
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:19,187
Scott: and even if that's not a lot of people who cares That'd be more fun without those other people there.

494
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:23,364
Scott: They're just gonna you know, and plus those people you don't know We're always a risk.

495
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:24,206
Scott: It's all.

496
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:42,020
Scott: there's always someone who's maybe you know is taboo or Makes trouble or something and it's that distant guy that you know, it's like the drunken second third uncle grandpa's Third brother, I have a feeling that the majority of drama at weddings comes from the closer relations.

497
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:45,996
Scott: Yeah, but you can't not invite the closer relation to the party.

498
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:55,840
Rym: That's like Yeah, well one of our friends weddings They did the traditional Chinese like challenges for the groom like he had to beat all the bridesmaids at something or we couldn't get married.

499
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:56,744
Scott: Yeah, that's fun.

500
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,934
Scott: Yeah, anything that is fun regardless, you know.

501
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:03,631
Scott: when I said, you know, I don't like tradition It's not you know You're only doing something because it's tradition.

502
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:14,847
Scott: that's the problem like the chair if something also Good, if something is good and in tradition will do it because it's good not because it's you know tradition though I have a very important admission to make.

503
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:15,771
Rym: poop came out of my mouth.

504
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:16,755
Rym: I should talked.

505
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:20,893
Rym: I broke a vow All right, you might remember some time ago on GeekNights.

506
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:21,857
Rym: I went to a wedding.

507
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:22,560
Rym: It was a fine wedding.

508
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:34,520
Rym: I was in the I was one of the groomsmen But I had to rent a tuxedo and just due to the logistics of renting that tuxedo It was an unholy nightmare that consumed like eight total hours of my life.

509
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,356
Rym: Yep, so I vowed I would never wear a tuxedo again unless I owned it.

510
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,391
Rym: Mm-hmm I ended up renting a tuxedo for this wedding.

511
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,740
Scott: Yeah, that's another bullshit, right?

512
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:55,440
Scott: It's like people have these weddings and they want all the like the people in the wedding party to wear like the same Clothes and they'll force you to go and rent a tuxedo or something, but they'll make you fucking pay for it.

513
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,440
Rym: I got around that I deducted the cost of the tuxedo from my gift nice.

514
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:00,887
Rym: I had a gift I'd planned.

515
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:03,037
Rym: I saw the cost of the tuxedo and I deducted it.

516
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:18,357
Scott: Good job I even told him as much I was like minus cost of tuxedo nice, but it's like, you know, I If you can't make someone else pay for your party, right a party is either Everyone pays collectively or one person pays.

517
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,080
Rym: if I bring you know What.

518
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,460
Rym: if you had a game where people the losers had to pay for the at least it's a fair some fair structure, right?

519
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:35,440
Scott: It's if I'm having a New Year's party I can't be like, alright, listen you ten people who are close to me You're all gonna pay for part of this but all these other people are gonna get in the party for free.

520
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,020
Scott: Well, do I get any benefits for paying for extra in this party?

521
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,266
Scott: No, in fact you get a penalty.

522
00:36:40,286 --> 00:36:42,636
Scott: you have to wear these horribly fitting ugly clothes.

523
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:49,677
Rym: Ah The closest thing to a benefit was like we got drink service while we were doing all the pictures independent of the professionals in line.

524
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:54,131
Scott: a Few minutes of extra drink service when there's unlimited drinks now.

525
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,900
Rym: great now there's unlimited drinks to a time.

526
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,292
Scott: Would you have paid the cost of the tuxedo for that drink service now?

527
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,099
Scott: No, yeah, so you got ripped off.

528
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,949
Scott: You can't make someone else pay for your shit.

529
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,840
Rym: if you want people to do something for your party I point out that they'll all do it anyway.

530
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,088
Scott: That's only because they feel obligated.

531
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:16,853
Scott: I would be like, you know, if you ask me I'd be like fuck you Which is why I was gonna which is why nobody asked me.

532
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,440
Rym: I was gonna to get around that.

533
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,948
Scott: It's the same as in the the.

534
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,060
Scott: you know, it's I attack only one.

535
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,906
Scott: Nobody will fuck gang up on me.

536
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:31,849
Rym: because they know I was going to consider getting the fancy utila kilt the dress one and wearing that Under the red the top of the tux.

537
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:32,572
Rym: that would have been cool.

538
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,340
Rym: then I would have kind of gotten around my shit talk.

539
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,484
Scott: I had to match the tux.

540
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:36,649
Rym: It would have matched pretty well.

541
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:37,030
Rym: I like.

542
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:41,788
Rym: I kind of specked it out, but I The utila kilt nice like.

543
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:43,736
Rym: they're already a little overpriced, but I like they're.

544
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:44,720
Rym: they're good for what they ours.

545
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,603
Rym: That's why I own a couple.

546
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:50,920
Rym: but the fancy utila kilt is not worth the 800 whatever dollars.

547
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:51,743
Scott: I didn't know.

548
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:52,787
Scott: I thought the fancy utility.

549
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:53,591
Scott: It was actually cheaper.

550
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,037
Rym: No, it's pretty expensive.

551
00:37:55,057 --> 00:38:06,920
Rym: That sucks $750 fuck that for basically a Skirt and it's even less utila kilty than the real utila kill.

552
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,840
Scott: Yeah, we talked about you know money spent on clothing versus the number of times and how often you're gonna use it.

553
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:19,323
Rym: I spent three by two more of the fanciest kilt they've got rather than the tuxedo Money left.

554
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,992
Scott: I spent 300 plus on a kilt that I use often.

555
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:27,831
Scott: the tuxedo one cost twice that and I would use it Far far far less often.

556
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,477
Scott: so it is a bad idea.

557
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:34,039
Scott: Yep Anyway, but yeah parties are awesome.

558
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:39,334
Scott: Just make them reasonable and don't blow your whole money because of a tradition.

559
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:43,740
Scott: use it on something reasonable instead Like, you know a vacation something worthwhile.

560
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,530
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
