6
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:30,730
Rym: So we did a show about nothing last week, and I remember the the impetus where that was not seinfeld.

7
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:36,829
Rym: It was that I thought oh, I know I'll read a dirty limerick And then I'll just go from there with random stuff.

8
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:44,061
Rym: And then I forgot about the limerick and we just talked about actually nothing for what an hour Because we couldn't come up with the show and we were lazy whatever.

9
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,950
Rym: so a little backstory.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,570
Rym: We were at RIT and there was a book of limericks.

11
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:55,030
Rym: It's just called limericks, and it was like two dollars at the bookstore.

12
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,680
Rym: So we were like oh, yeah, we'll buy this turns out.

13
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:00,906
Rym: It wasn't just limericks.

14
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:07,086
Rym: It was primarily Dirty limericks or at least suppose if it's not dirty.

15
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:07,990
Scott: It's not a limerick.

16
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:17,452
Rym: So I have opened just now to a random page and every episode of GeekNights henceforth either in the beginning or during the meta moment I'm going to read a Random.

17
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:18,877
Rym: oh my god.

39
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,626
Rym: Yeah, and if you ever find yourself on the floor of the Senate, and you need to filibuster there you go.

00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,236
Scott: Oh shit, son You know what.

41
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:33,979
Scott: maybe that's?

42
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:34,622
Scott: what we should do.

43
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,310
Scott: is we should send it to a congressman?

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,974
Scott: I should always.

45
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:44,519
Scott: only Anthony Wiener had not fucked up He could be in a limerick himself.

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,810
Rym: there once was a congressman Wiener.

47
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,959
Rym: So this weekend though we will not be there.

48
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,686
Rym: it is the San Diego Comic Con.

49
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,930
Rym: I kind of want to go some year.

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,590
Rym: It's just I'm always busy.

51
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,818
Rym: It's not really the kind of thing we like.

52
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:07,615
Rym: I always kind of forget to like say hope panels or lectures or whatever It's like in the one hand.

53
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,568
Scott: It's like the exact opposite of a convention that we want to go to.

54
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:11,853
Rym: yeah I mean, what do we go to?

55
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:15,004
Rym: we go to like really participatory conventions like PAX.

56
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,550
Rym: we go to super party.

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,308
Scott: San Diego comic-con is a big room of booths and waiting in line to see famous people.

58
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:25,928
Rym: now granted We go to that with the New York comic-con, but it's right there.

59
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:26,290
Rym: That's right.

60
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,314
Rym: It's like next door.

61
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,800
Scott: We don't have to fly to San Diego.

62
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,070
Scott: meanwhile the thing starts fucking Wednesday night.

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,439
Scott: Yeah If you want to go to it you have to buy tickets a year in advance and get your hotels here in advance and pay A zillion dollars and fly to San Diego.

64
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:38,022
Rym: or what.

65
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,550
Rym: we could get a professional badge or something.

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,149
Rym: I'm sure we could get a badge without having to do all that BS.

67
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,015
Scott: You'd be surprised.

68
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:53,010
Scott: This is like one level up from our usual convention because it's got real famous people Yeah, but at the same time a level famous while getting like guests and all that stuff at those conventions is difficult.

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,469
Rym: There's one thing that through this to this day is not that difficult and that is the press pass.

70
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:03,505
Scott: San Diego comic-con press pass is harder than you think but at the same time easier than you'd expect.

71
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:10,263
Rym: I'm sorry comic-con international So we will not be there but someday I'll go.

72
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,750
Rym: maybe we'll just go as attendees or something.

73
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,690
Scott: Yeah, but that one thing that I found weird right is like, you know, there's gonna be a bunch of stuff there But I don't actually need to be there for any of it, right?

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,529
Scott: The only thing you would actually need to be there for is like a panel that no one videos But they're always gonna video the funny part.

75
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:28,085
Scott: Yeah, right and they're always gonna sneak a camera into the you know premieres or whatever.

76
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:32,117
Scott: the sneak peek of course But it's the there is always.

77
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:37,030
Scott: the one thing you do have to be there for is the exclusive limited-edition swag.

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,063
Scott: But of course, we don't give a shit about exclusive limited-edition swag.

79
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:49,282
Scott: And if you do, you know what eBay Except when it's a limited to five thousand Special my little pony poster god damn it.

80
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:50,727
Rym: How did they know by Hasbro?

81
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:56,172
Scott: And if you look at this thing, it's definitely a fan Appeal.

82
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,094
Scott: it's got derpy.

83
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,702
Scott: It's got every fucking fan thing.

84
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:03,072
Scott: This is like for bronies specifically Yep.

85
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:03,634
Rym: Well, I got.

86
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,547
Rym: I got a lot to say about Hasbro and bronies and all that.

87
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:13,815
Rym: but give me Give me another two weeks until I no longer work for a company where I'm not able to talk about Stocks and companies and things.

88
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:17,810
Rym: and I got stuff to say anyway, so it's warm today.

89
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,109
Rym: It is the warmest so warm.

90
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,844
Rym: In the studio I have suffered through some goddamn heat.

91
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,890
Rym: we used to turn that AC off religiously.

92
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,372
Rym: You know what?

93
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:33,304
Scott: It is too hot to do that, you know, isn't there a way that you could?

94
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,830
Scott: I mean, I'm so much smog.

95
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:36,690
Rym: Look, I live we have a luxury apartment.

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,685
Rym: The studio has a window overlooking the East River and Manhattan at like 59th Street.

97
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:46,510
Rym: Like we can see Manhattan right now Manhattan is almost entirely obscured by smog.

98
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,794
Rym: I've never seen anything.

99
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:52,671
Scott: all the buildings are just silhouettes with no color and I can only see the first row of Buildings.

100
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:57,004
Scott: the second row of buildings is sort of like have gray and that is legit smog something.

101
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,750
Rym: I've never seen in person before.

102
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,218
Rym: It could be a really low cloud.

103
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,140
Scott: That's smog.

104
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:05,387
Rym: There is no way that is not smog.

105
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:06,510
Scott: It could be just haze.

106
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:07,859
Rym: I don't think it's haze.

107
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,371
Scott: Haze is not that thick It's.

108
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,959
Scott: it's super haze but it's not that humid double.

109
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,447
Rym: hey if that were haze it would be more humid.

110
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,330
Scott: It's pretty humid.

111
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,136
Scott: It's just hot.

112
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,690
Rym: It's not that humid good anyway.

113
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,035
Rym: So fucking hot.

114
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,224
Scott: it's real hot, but that's fine by me.

115
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:24,188
Scott: I'm fine with this hot.

116
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:24,610
Scott: I love it.

117
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:25,314
Scott: I'm all good.

118
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:26,663
Scott: You know, I love it one.

119
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:27,850
Scott: Let it be a hundred something.

120
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,169
Scott: I don't give a shit because you know what reasons got one.

121
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,436
Scott: I did not want it to be.

122
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:34,050
Scott: I just think back to when it was motherfucking cold.

123
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,263
Scott: You know fucking space nuts frozen off and I'm like this is.

124
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,689
Scott: I'm happy with this.

125
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,980
Rym: I can deal with many things.

126
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,070
Rym: I can deal with horrible fanboys.

127
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:51,650
Rym: everyone knows Scott would always be amazed at RIT way back in the day and how Polite and nice I could be to horrible fanboys.

128
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:52,988
Scott: I'm just gonna get out of my face man.

129
00:06:53,852 --> 00:07:02,360
Rym: I can abide a lot of BS from people but I cannot abide someone who complains that it's too cold in the winter and Complains that it's too hot in the summer.

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,909
Rym: you get to complain about one season.

131
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:04,530
Scott: That's right.

132
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,907
Rym: That is all you get to complain about if you complain about both.

133
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,394
Scott: good No, cuz what these people?

134
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,160
Scott: let me let me be these stupid people.

135
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,790
Rym: They want it to be 74 degrees and boring.

136
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:19,270
Scott: They're like, oh, you know, I like the weather when it's kind of warm, but not too warm, but not too cold.

137
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,890
Scott: I like it to be 65 70.

138
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,203
Rym: I think they're the same people when they order food at a restaurant Want something very particular like can you replace my rice with this?

139
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,350
Rym: and I'd rather have this and I want it cooked exactly like this.

140
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,276
Scott: Yeah, shut the fuck up.

141
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,566
Rym: No, you don't Indian place or something.

142
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:34,396
Rym: I'm just like yeah That exactly.

143
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:35,685
Rym: if you bring me the wrong thing.

144
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:36,430
Rym: I won't even notice.

145
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:41,604
Scott: I mean if you're crazy rich and you know the people there you can do cool things like ordering off menu.

146
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:45,375
Rym: Yeah, that's that's Right by feelings about that.

147
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:46,982
Rym: cuz I just watched get shorty again.

148
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,171
Rym: cuz Emily never seen it and had been a while since I saw It.

149
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,901
Scott: remember when Martin where I never saw it.

150
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,868
Rym: really I would have sworn we watch art.

151
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:54,410
Rym: You should watch it.

152
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,273
Rym: It's in Netflix streaming.

153
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,839
Scott: All right, it's hilarious.

154
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,630
Rym: And it's John Travolta playing John Travolta.

155
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,267
Rym: It's kind of like a fanfic about John Travolta.

156
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:02,750
Scott: All right.

157
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,670
Scott: But anyway, the point is don't be complaining about hot and cold weather.

158
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,517
Scott: Otherwise you suck and be.

159
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:11,545
Scott: don't be being weird at restaurants.

160
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,850
Scott: Just fucking pick something on the menu.

161
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,893
Scott: Don't be all asking what's in this what's in that it wouldn't be Here?

162
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:18,717
Rym: are legitimate.

163
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,660
Scott: have an allergy.

164
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,584
Scott: you have an allergy.

165
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,990
Rym: you have celiac disease.

166
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,335
Rym: It is okay to be like is there?

167
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:24,680
Scott: celiac disease is an allergy.

168
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,266
Rym: No, it's an autoimmune thing.

169
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,657
Rym: It's distinct from allergies It's.

170
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,348
Scott: it's the same.

171
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:36,626
Rym: You have a food problem because celiac if you have a food allergy and you eat a food that you're allergic to throat swells up and shit hives.

172
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,379
Rym: Celiac doesn't have any of that thing instead.

173
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,369
Rym: It's just an autoimmune like attack in the gut.

174
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:49,150
Scott: Well, I mean, you know hives is an autoimmune attack in the skin, but they're distinct and EpiPens not gonna help you with celiac.

175
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:55,530
Rym: Anyway I'm sure Nuri is gonna be like you guys are both wrong, whatever.

176
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,853
Scott: So my news is that it's warm and here at the NOAA the National Oceanographic You don't know.

177
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,078
Rym: do you something?

178
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,747
Scott: American now atmospheric administration?

179
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:08,369
Scott: That's it.

180
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,462
Rym: That sounds like an organization that administers the atmosphere.

181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:23,050
Scott: if you don't know about the NOAA It is paid for with federal tax money and there are people who are against it on the grounds that it's unfair competition with like the Weather Channel Except the Weather Channel gets their weather from the NOAA.

182
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:26,630
Rym: In fact, almost everyone who reports on weather just gets it from the NOAA.

183
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,150
Scott: So every weather you watch is just taking the weather from the NOAA and then reporting it except for weather underground Which has citizen weather stations.

184
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:40,461
Scott: Anyway, you should get your weather from there because it's you're you're paying for it And they have the best weathers and it's free.

185
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:52,600
Scott: and they made this little video Of a heat of the heat wave and it shows you day by day where the heat wave at and basically looks like full 1080p like Texas caught on fire and that fire spread.

186
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:02,273
Scott: Yeah, it's like a 1080p video of the heat wave from July 13th through tomorrow, but 105

187
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:05,130
Rym: degrees in the seven tunnel under Grand Central today

188
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:12,999
Scott: I heard there was somewhere that it was a hundred and seventeen like in Minneapolis or something in that at the Moat a Particular time it was the hottest and humidest place on earth

189
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,704
Rym: the hottest weather.

190
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:16,430
Scott: I guess short of short of a volcano.

191
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,381
Rym: I've been in a hundred and six degree heat.

192
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,990
Rym: That is the hottest outdoor temperature I've ever experienced.

193
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,416
Scott: I don't know what the hottest I've been in is.

194
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,054
Rym: I'm maybe it was hotter one day and I didn't know but Yeah, it's hot.

195
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,726
Rym: We can't stop talking about it cuz it's just so hot but it's good.

196
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,408
Scott: It's great.

197
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:33,890
Scott: I'll take it.

198
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,162
Rym: So anyway, so uh SDCC this weekend, we won't be there.

199
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,004
Rym: Otakon.

200
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,990
Scott: I'm sure there'll be a zillion news for next Wednesday.

201
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,558
Rym: We will also not be at Otakon.

202
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:48,105
Rym: so I'll just say this we're known we have no blood blood for Otakon But they do not like us so much.

203
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:53,850
Rym: Oh, well So if you want us to go to Otakon just tell Otakon that you want us to do our stuff at Otakon.

204
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,019
Rym: We'll do it if they ask us.

205
00:10:55,482 --> 00:11:03,016
Rym: Yeah, but that aside You probably should be going to Otakon even if we're not there because as we've said Makoto Shinkai Is gonna be there.

206
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:06,290
Scott: if you don't know who Makoto Shinkai is you need to watch all his movies.

207
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,690
Rym: Such basically just watch him in order.

208
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,890
Scott: He is the guy who made an anime called Hoshino Koei voices of a distant star in his basement with his wife with his wife.

209
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:19,546
Scott: They voiced it then they got it re-voiced but later and it is like what five ten minutes.

210
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,790
Scott: It's short, but it's amazing.

211
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,503
Rym: It's I defy other than people who really fight it or who aren't human.

212
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,870
Rym: You're gonna cry, you know fucking cry.

213
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:36,365
Scott: but he pretty much draws clouds and Movies and well short animations about sad people in relationships separated by space and time.

214
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,901
Rym: space and time drama sad Longing distant love, right?

215
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,370
Scott: That's all he makes but he's going by.

216
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,341
Scott: There's nothing wrong with being a one-trick pony if you're awesome at that trick And it's not a trick anyone else has done and such and such.

217
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:55,062
Rym: so he also made The full-length movie Place Promised in our early days, which I really like.

218
00:11:55,082 --> 00:12:00,355
Rym: Hoshino Koei, but I like Place Promised more But that seemed that way.

219
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:05,330
Rym: the place promised in our early days has some some of the most beautiful skyscapes I've ever seen.

220
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,770
Scott: Well, yeah, cuz he draws clouds.

221
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,697
Rym: Awesome plane with the two like propellers.

222
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:17,217
Rym: Yeah, and it has either the saddest happy ending or the happiest sad ending I've ever seen does have a terrible secret of space.

223
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,388
Scott: it does typical from animes the mysterious tower in the distance.

224
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:28,519
Rym: Yeah he did five centimeters per second, which is just a TV series of lovers separated by space and time.

225
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,421
Scott: and his.

226
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:30,484
Scott: what's the new thing called?

227
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:32,289
Rym: It is called Hoshi.

228
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,051
Rym: Oh Kodomo.

229
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:34,753
Scott: Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:36,858
Scott: But anyway, it's a new thing.

231
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:37,380
Scott: He made.

232
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,410
Scott: it's gonna be screened at Otakon premiered with no subtitles.

233
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,121
Rym: Children who chase lost voices from deep below.

234
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,547
Scott: I'm sure it will be stunning.

235
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,236
Rym: Yep I'm pretty sure that there's a picture.

236
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,681
Scott: if you don't understand what's going on.

237
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,265
Rym: There is a picture probably a movie poster in the article I'm going to link to.

238
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,699
Rym: and Yeah, I want to see that.

239
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,110
Scott: please videotape his panel.

240
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:01,318
Rym: Oh my god, if we were at Otakon with Emily She would just translate the whole thing for us while we were sitting there.

241
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:01,940
Scott: That's true.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,690
Scott: But please videotape the panel so I can see it.

243
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,070
Scott: Yes, and don't videotape the movie because Otakon will kick your ass out.

244
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,597
Scott: I can wait for that to be on DVD.

245
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,612
Rym: if you are at Otakon go to the Q&A People.

246
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,138
Rym: don't go to the guest panels.

247
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:14,821
Scott: They do.

248
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,090
Scott: they just go to like voice actors and other stupid shit.

249
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,701
Scott: They don't go to the Japanese people who came all the way from halfway around the world To see you and you and I'll like ten people show up and simultaneously.

250
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,229
Rym: the anime cons don't do anything about this.

251
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:27,293
Scott: They don't try.

252
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,163
Rym: I mean the New York Anime Festival did try when they got mr.

253
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:30,564
Rym: Gundam.

254
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:32,812
Rym: They were like, holy shit We got mr.

255
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:33,956
Scott: Gundam and then they fucked up.

256
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:37,690
Rym: Well, yeah, they fucked up the translator, but that room was packed.

257
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:47,020
Rym: It was indeed and I think more people went to see him at Otak at that New York Comic Con Anime Festival just because they pumped him up then.

258
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:51,595
Rym: anyone has ever seen anyone who was Japanese At any other anime con ever?

259
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:55,908
Scott: quite possibly except maybe yoko kano, maybe I don't know which was.

260
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,654
Scott: I had no to count But that was a concert.

261
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:58,517
Scott: a concert doesn't care.

262
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,943
Scott: We're talking about a panel not a concert.

263
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,650
Scott: concerts are different because here's someone talk Versus to hear someone sees them and perform.

264
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:08,246
Rym: Yeah just one of my saddest memories is going to the anime central and they're not anime central.

265
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,320
Rym: anime next and Just randomly walking into a big gigantic panel room.

266
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,035
Rym: There's only a few people sitting around and up front We're like, is that Rintaro?

267
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:19,147
Scott: It was oh my god, the director the director of the movie.

268
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:31,565
Rym: We'll discuss today Yes But before that we have of course things of the day.

269
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,414
Rym: so if you I'm living under a rock.

270
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:39,168
Rym: You might not realize that my little pony friendship is magic is legit more ponies.

271
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,615
Rym: I got it Before we did the show.

272
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,690
Rym: Scott is basically just going item by item down radio.

273
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,009
Scott: That doesn't mean I want to put it in GeekNights.

274
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:51,210
Rym: I needed a thing of the day and one thing that is very popular in Japan.

275
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:52,000
Rym: That does not happen.

276
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,486
Rym: as much in the?

277
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:52,769
Rym: u.s.

278
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:59,604
Rym: Is taking the opening to an anime or an animation or something and Reanimating it with characters from something else.

279
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:04,405
Scott: Yeah Americans Remixers tend to be lazier and they take paths of least resistance.

280
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:08,930
Scott: They like to edit videos They don't like to make new animation and or you know, because it's a lot of work.

281
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:11,090
Rym: So it's a very like Japanese fandom thing.

282
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,607
Rym: So that's why I'm using it today because this is someone did that sort of thing in flash to the.

283
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,309
Rym: my little pony.

284
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:22,596
Rym: friendship is magic opener, but they portrayed all the ponies as Girls like human girls.

285
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:23,238
Scott: Uh-huh.

286
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:24,564
Rym: It's pretty cute.

287
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,401
Scott: Okay, so You know when it comes to webcomics, right?

288
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,610
Scott: There's a bunch of different categories of web comics.

289
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,435
Scott: I sort of realized.

290
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:32,596
Scott: right.

291
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,904
Scott: there's the pure webcomic.

292
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:34,950
Scott: It was a webcomic.

293
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,082
Scott: It always will be a webcomic like say a penny arcade or a dr.

294
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:43,755
Scott: McNinja, right or something like that Or boases, right.

295
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:44,738
Scott: then there's the.

296
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,388
Scott: it's a newspaper comic, but you can read it on the web, which is all the newspaper.

297
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:48,870
Rym: Thanks.

298
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,017
Scott: But then there's sort of the.

299
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:56,250
Scott: it's a comic book, but it's a webcomic at the same time, right?

300
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,721
Scott: So one of those was freak angels, which I was reading right?

301
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,085
Scott: So I just started reading that.

302
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,350
Scott: Oh, well, it's almost done.

303
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,864
Scott: Oh good gonna be done in like a chapter and they're gonna print the final trade.

304
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:09,221
Scott: I think it's gonna be seven By the trade.

305
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:09,785
Scott: then seven of them.

306
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,699
Scott: But yeah, so freak angels cuz I mean it was purely.

307
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:18,430
Scott: I mean, you know mechanically it was a webcomic, right?

308
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,670
Scott: It was you know, put on the web first collected into trades.

309
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,770
Scott: There were never any issues, but it was written by Warren Ellis a professional comic book writer, right?

310
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,490
Scott: He was coming who comes from comic book land.

311
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:39,769
Scott: so that's like saying if Alan Moore just you know started writing a webcomic and it happened to be that every page of the Webcomic was the same shape as a real normal comic book store comic.

312
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,724
Rym: Because with a webcomic, I mean if you post just one page you have to scroll.

313
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,949
Rym: imagine reading spider-man One page every few days.

314
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,349
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's it's made by someone who comes from the real quote real comic world, right?

315
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,096
Scott: So anyway, freak angels is ending.

316
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,566
Scott: So I needed some new comic to replace it.

317
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,610
Scott: It's not done yet.

318
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,569
Scott: I think freak angels might have another few chapters or whatever.

319
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:13,869
Scott: But so I needed in a comic to replace it and I found one in the same category not ogloff Not ogloff, but I probably will add ogloff.

320
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:23,944
Scott: So there is a new Comic and it comes out every Monday and Thursday and it's steampunk pirates, which is really cliche.

321
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:31,578
Scott: It's lady saber and Pirates of the ineffable ether spelled a e th er, right?

322
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,249
Scott: So that's sort of like All right.

323
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:47,390
Scott: But the person who has created this comic Oh What the hell is his name is a comic creator that I much enjoy and his name is not on the front page.

324
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:53,352
Scott: Why did he not put Oh unprepared Unprepared.

325
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:54,558
Rym: I'm not gonna turn this off.

326
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:55,301
Rym: It's dead air.

327
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,787
Rym: There's gonna be dead air Scott.

328
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:57,370
Rym: Who's the author?

329
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,330
Scott: He I fucking know his name, but like he didn't put it on his own thing.

330
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:08,693
Scott: He's a. he's the guy who did whiteout and he did Gotham Central and he did Oh Greg Rucka Christ.

331
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:14,276
Scott: he didn't put his fucking name on his own fucking comic moron What the hell.

332
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:19,225
Scott: but anyway anyway, yeah So he wrote all those great comics that I like and bought all of.

333
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,430
Scott: so now he's writing a webcomic.

334
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:28,070
Scott: So I'm like, well even though this is cliche steampunk pirate ladies, and there's only three pages so far.

335
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,283
Scott: So I don't even know if it's good or bad.

336
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:34,883
Scott: yet Greg Rucka is been nothing but win in all the real comics.

337
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,050
Scott: He's written that I have read a queen and country.

338
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,121
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

339
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:38,808
Scott: queen and country.

340
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:43,324
Scott: Gotham Central and whiteout are like his big winners.

341
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:44,688
Scott: So I like all those.

342
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:45,250
Scott: they're all great.

343
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,776
Scott: So I'm gonna trust him on this one, too.

344
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:47,459
Rym: Yep.

345
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:52,730
Rym: So in the meta moment the next convention We will be at is of course the penny arcade expo.

00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:56,105
Rym: Oh shit, we'll be doing stuff at it.

347
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,050
Rym: Stay tuned for that.

348
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,500
Rym: We will probably like we did at PAX East video it and put it online Shortly after that in New York Comic Con.

354
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,435
Rym: Now one thing very important.

355
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:29,154
Rym: when it comes to a contest like this much like our someone it's gonna be a completely subjective Content.

356
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:35,118
Rym: our slightly infamous worst podcast pond contest which uh Anime pulse won pretty handily.

357
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,083
Scott: Well, did they?

358
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,550
Scott: I forget who won anime pulse one.

359
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,837
Rym: Okay, but here's the thing.

360
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,068

Rym: we have a prize.

363
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:58,876
Rym: submit whatever you want, but you Must agree and understand that if you do not yourself make your creative work If you are not yourself a webcomic artist a podcaster or something Look at what shit you just submitted.

364
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:05,842
Rym: that you're saying is terrible and realize that you are worse as a person than whoever Made the thing that you just because you didn't make anything.

365
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,308
Scott: So at least they made something.

366
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,323
Rym: Yep Something's better than nothing even making shit.

367
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:14,657
Scott: At least they're making something Unless they give up after like two strips.

368
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,487
Rym: that also also you can stop submitting control.

369
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:18,510

Rym: We got that.

372
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:29,910
Scott: we got that one the first person submitted in the case of a duplicate submission because there's quite a few others Winning the one that was submitted earliest or has like the best.

373
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,482
Scott: I guess we'll subjectively decide who amongst denominators.

374
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:36,251
Rym: the only thing that's been submitted more than once is control alt Delete.

375

Scott: there are other things submitted more than one really.

376
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,270
Rym: Yes, cuz I haven't looked at it recently.

377
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,005

389
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,309

392
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:30,323
Scott: After that is New York comic-con at some point October, I think.

393
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:33,881
Rym: uh October is when the New York comic-con is.

394
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:34,606
Rym: we already mentioned that.

395
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:35,089
Scott: oh he did.

396
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,250
Scott: Okay I just want to add one more thing, you know, I know that we are shit talkers of the highest order.

397
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:40,477
Scott: Well the second highest order.

398
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:41,844
Scott: I mean we do make GeekNights.

399
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:45,897
Scott: Yeah But I have a new strategy.

400
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,502
Scott: it is the most obvious strategy.

401
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,750
Scott: it's not a new strategy it's a strategy.

402
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,392
Scott: Well, it's it's.

403
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,159
Scott: um, the fact that I'm following.

404
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,303
Scott: the strategy is new.

405
00:21:53,403 --> 00:22:01,990
Scott: This is strategy to achieve V. Yes, the strategy itself is very old and I'm like, why was I so stupid not to ever actually use this strategy?

406
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,810
Rym: We've used it before we just forget.

407
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,523
Scott: So now I'm gonna follow this strategy for hopefully until the end of time when I die.

408
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,289
Scott: and that strategy is attack only one.

409
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:14,890
Rym: Dude why do you keep attacking me cuz I attack only one.

410
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,170
Scott: So The attack only one at this point in time is front crew calm.

411
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,450
Scott: So I've put all other projects aside and I am attacking only major improvements to front recruit calm.

412
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,153
Scott: So they will.

413
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:36,346
Scott: I've already made some of them and if I could just fucking get home instead of coming over here to play Games and make podcasts every day then I could get a lot more done.

414
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:44,610
Rym: But luckily Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday not doing Anything meanwhile, so you guys know well, I'll keep you know, this is the meta part of the show.

415
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:46,069
Rym: So I'll keep it on my attack.

416
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:53,338
Rym: Only one is now all the video content for GeekNights front row crew radio free Equestria all our lectures the uncle yo stuff I recorded.

417
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:58,932
Rym: I'm going to attack all the video projects that have been piling up on me Mm-hmm.

418
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:01,339
Scott: That doesn't sound like attacking only one.

419
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:07,919
Rym: Well one at a time in that I'm attacking that and inside of that I'm going to finish game mechanics and mechanism design.

420
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,701
Rym: get that online.

421
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:16,840
Rym: then how to win a games then uncle Yo, then radio free Equestria then all the other videos I've got Mm-hmm.

422
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,384
Rym: Yeah I'm sure that's just riveting to all you listeners.

423
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:30,036
Scott: It is There's one more thing I want to say August August 6th 13th and 20th, huh?

424
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,560
Rym: Three days that mean nothing to me.

425
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:40,935
Scott: on those three days the New York City Department of Transportation Will be having a program known as summer streets From 7 a.m.

426
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,024
Scott: To 1 p.m So that's a full 8 9 10 11 12 6 hours.

427
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:53,626
Scott: Right on those three days Park Avenue will be closed from 70 something Street to the Brooklyn Bridge.

428
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:57,770
Rym: I Want to go over there and do something.

429
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:01,687
Scott: I'm probably gonna bike all the way but that will probably take like 15 minutes.

430
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:02,350
Scott: I should walk it.

431
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:05,171
Scott: I'll probably do it 15 or like not 50.

432
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:08,870
Scott: I'll probably do it like back and forth four times because you can go so fast cuz no one there.

433
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:17,227
Scott: but they have like actually programming like you can go and like just do yoga and Exercises or you know shit and there's police everywhere, huh?

434
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,490
Rym: I wonder See we could say oh, we'll do a meet-up.

435
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,120
Rym: We'll say when we're gonna be there, but usually when you do meetups It's because we have a table and we're gonna play some board games.

436
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:26,970
Scott: Yeah, this is gonna be moving.

437
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:27,312
Scott: I'd see.

438
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,809
Scott: what I'm really wondering is you know in Park Avenue is a little tunnel.

439
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,241
Scott: Yep, right in front of grants.

440
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,250
Rym: Can we go into the tunnel?

441
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,130
Scott: Can we go in the tunnel cuz there won't be cars in there?

442
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,360
Scott: I really want that to be so will it?

443
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:41,324
Scott: but it thing is it's so dangerous, you know It's so dangerous to go in there under normal circumstances.

444
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:45,213
Rym: I know I'm always afraid It's one of my weird like one of the few things I'm actually like.

445
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:46,919
Scott: I like if you go near that tunnel.

446
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,115
Scott: it has all these signs like don't go the fuck in here unless you're A car.

447
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,540
Scott: stay the fuck out If you're a biking.

448
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:54,729
Scott: don't even go near this thing.

449
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:59,943
Rym: I'm always nervous when I'm biking that I'll just like Be stupid and not pay attention and go right into one of those tunnels.

450
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,469
Scott: the UN tunnels good of is the worst.

451
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,580
Scott: Yeah, really don't want to go in that one one time.

452
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,937
Rym: I went through that tunnel through Central Park Like that half tunnel that some like the cross.

453
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:10,121
Scott: those are just overpasses.

454
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:10,623
Scott: Where's there?

455
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,486
Scott: a tunnel there is.

456
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:16,924
Rym: there's one that's under Like it's down and it has some tunnels in it and there's really no room for.

457
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,370
Scott: you don't want to go in the transverse road?

458
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:18,994
Rym: No, you don't.

459
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:19,901
Rym: I was in I was on it.

460
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,170
Scott: take you want to take the park drive.

461
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:26,070
Scott: I think Emily was on a park drive - if you're on a bike you want to do park drive only no transverse road.

462
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:32,470
Rym: So anyway, we talked about rent aro earlier and a long time ago on the sci-fi channel.

463
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,164
Rym: You know, this is one of the things that got us into anime.

464
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:39,630
Scott: I was watching, you know I'd only seen you know a few animes and I didn't really you know.

465
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,390
Scott: I kind of knew like a cure was this cool anime that I hadn't seen it quite yet.

466
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,665
Scott: Yeah, I you know, I watched Voltron when I was a kid and I sort of knew Japanese.

467
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:48,910
Scott: ish, right?

468
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,290
Scott: But it was sort of like yeah, but I watched the whole week on sci-fi channel of Godzilla movies.

469
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,930
Scott: So I had gotten used to watching TV at that time slot the next week.

470
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,468
Scott: I sit down at the same time slot on Monday and it was anime week in the same time slot and they showed.

471
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:11,210
Scott: the first Night was Fatal Fury and Galaxy Express 3 9 and the second night was a do Galaxy Express 3 9 and I think something else.

472
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:16,363
Rym: I don't know if it may be fatal for you, too But I know Galaxy Express 3 9 was shown and so was earth.

473
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:26,750
Rym: say yet sir a to beautiful dreamer That I saw the end the very end of Galaxy Express and all I remember thinking was so what it's a train in space?

474
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,718
Scott: Yeah, but but of all those right.

475
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:31,390
Scott: so I said you like do I remember Fatal Fury fuck?

476
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,115
Scott: No, right, but Galaxy Express.

477
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,900
Scott: I fucking remember that shit, right?

478
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,448
Scott: That was like the first anime that I saw.

479
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:47,229
Rym: that was like About that like that kind of thing like when I first saw vampire hundred space adventure Like what's this hardcore vampire guy?

480
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,429
Rym: Like no none of the tropes of anime were known to me or the history of anime, you know.

481
00:26:52,650 --> 00:27:00,253
Rym: So imagine seeing you know a Galaxy Express like it's so different from anything you'd see in America because it's so epic and melodramatic That you know.

482
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:04,168
Scott: just that was the thing, you know, I saw animes before it kind of sorta.

483
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,798
Scott: But that was the first anime that was like whoa.

484
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:09,908
Scott: I need to see everything that is like this that exists in the world.

485
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:14,970
Rym: So you Relatively recently in the last like year or two watched all of the TV show.

486
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,861
Scott: Well, yeah, I pretty much you know, I you know, I saw more.

487
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,410
Scott: Liji Matsumoto works over the years, right?

488
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:27,010
Scott: You know his properties the Yamato's and the Captain Harlock, but more recently I set him on fire.

489
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:30,409
Scott: I saw every episode of the Galaxy Express 3 9 TV show.

490
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:33,810
Scott: I was every episode of the Captain Harlock TV show.

491
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,069
Scott: I want to see all of the Queen millennia TV show, but it's really hard to get episode.

492
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:41,875
Scott: At least it's hard to get all of them.

493
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:43,540
Scott: You can get quite a few of them.

494
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,348
Scott: I saw Space Symphony meta.

495
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:50,360
Scott: I saw Almost everything Arcadia of my youth.

496
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,841
Scott: I saw that.

497
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:53,230
Rym: I think we reviewed that on GeekNights, right?

498
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,010
Scott: But just recently as in within the past month, right?

499
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,395
Scott: Discotech media has.

500
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,021
Scott: finally these people are awesome.

501
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:09,190
Scott: By the way, discotech is pretty much the best anime Company in the US right now, right prices good translation prices good translation subtitles high quality DVDs.

502
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,253
Scott: Everything's good.

503
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,028
Scott: You can buy it like a full season of Fist of the North Star for them for 30 bucks.

504
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:17,250
Scott: They also put out awesome, you know movies like attack the gas station and shit.

505
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:30,807
Scott: I'm pretty sure they do that one, but they you know those kinds of movies if not that one in particular All your awesome Asian cinema discotheque, so they put out Galaxy Express 3 9 and the sequel movie I do Galaxy Express 3 9 on DVD.

506
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,730
Scott: They just both came out.

507
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,469
Scott: They're like $17, but it's totally worth it.

508
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:42,130
Scott: I've never seen them before in this higher resolution with this high quality and audio with the subtitles and the whole thing.

509
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,521
Scott: It was way beautiful.

510
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:52,569
Scott: Yeah for something from like 1979. so basically the deal is for those of you who are not familiar with the Galaxy Express, right?

511
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,861
Scott: There is a kid who lives on earth.

512
00:28:56,022 --> 00:29:01,785
Scott: earth has normal people Biological humans and they suck because they die and they're basically all poor.

513
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:05,470
Scott: but meanwhile There are also robot humans, right?

514
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,270
Scott: Anyone who has enough money goes and gets a machine body like Ghost in the Shell, right?

515
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,518
Scott: So why wouldn't you get a machine body?

516
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,290
Scott: machine bodies can live forever and you don't get sick or anything?

517
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,950
Rym: Ah, but what is the price of immortality?

518
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:18,614
Scott: I don't know.

519
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,165
Scott: that may be the message and moral.

520
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:24,305
Scott: that might be What the show's about the overarching points that there is.

521
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,188
Scott: but regardless of that.

522
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:32,884
Scott: so there's a poor kid named Tetsuro, right and Hoshi no Tetsuro and he is in the TV show.

523
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,893
Scott: He's a potato head and The movie.

524
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:40,130
Scott: he has a much better character design and steady as the butt nose, but it is less funny.

525
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,417
Rym: There's a butt nose instead of a potato face.

526
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:46,390
Rym: Yeah, sometimes I love how the flashback in the movie is back to the potato head.

527
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,401
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

528
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:50,221
Scott: It's like as a kid He was Phil potato head But not later.

529
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,982
Rym: that is you know That is such a nod to the people watching the show.

530
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,770
Rym: right that was just lost on me as a kid.

531
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,190
Scott: So he was poor and walking around in the snow with his mom.

532
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,458
Rym: We're trying to get to the city with his mom.

533
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,562
Scott: right an evil count.

534
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:04,810
Scott: Mecca is basically a robot guy.

535
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:11,050
Scott: I met a you know mechanical person and he hunts human biological humans for sport because he can do that sort of thing.

536
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:15,809
Scott: so he freaking just blows Tetsuro's mom away with a laser right to have her mounted on his wall.

537
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:20,760
Scott: and Then you know Tetsuro goes on a journey to get his revenge.

538
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,998
Scott: and also he wants to get his own machine body because there's a Planet far away where you can get a machine body for free Even if you're poor.

539
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,289
Rym: all you have to do is get there.

540
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:37,482
Scott: He wants to have a long life to make up for the short life of his parents so that he wants to get to that Planet and the only way to get there is in the galaxy ray.

541
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,390
Scott: I've also watched galaxy railways all of it.

542
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:40,780
Rym: Oh, yeah, I watch that.

543
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,525
Rym: It looks really fun.

544
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:41,949
Rym: It's okay.

545
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,530
Scott: So galaxy railways is basically this intergalactic train service.

546
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:53,470
Scott: It's like if the MTA went everywhere in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies and possibly other galaxies as well.

547
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:58,210
Rym: Now the interesting thing is the the design of the galaxy Express is nostalgic.

548
00:30:58,491 --> 00:30:59,614
Rym: It looks like an old.

549
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:04,910
Scott: yeah, most of the galaxy railways trains look like fancy, you know, I guess at least bullet trains, right?

550
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,745
Scott: They would be futuristic for the 70s and let's the late 70s early 80s.

551
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,250
Scott: But you know, they look like bullet trains and all other fancy space trains.

552
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,910
Scott: But the galaxy Express is a high-tech train that looks like an old-fashioned steam train.

553
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:26,873
Scott: Right and the reason it's a special train because not only is it incredibly expensive to ride this train But it goes Express to Andromeda Which is a big deal.

554
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:43,730
Scott: because you know, most of the trains just go from solar system to solar system or planets a planet You know, there's like commuter trains that go from like, you know Saturn to earth or whatever, you know, like Titan to Mars But this is a train that goes all the way to fucking Andromeda, which is another galaxy.

555
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,458
Scott: You know what space there is between galaxies.

556
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:48,250
Rym: about over 200 episodes worth of plan.

557
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,893
Scott: Well, yeah, it's like.

558
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:53,902
Scott: so people question whether or not it's an Express and in the movie It doesn't stop at that many planets.

559
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,170
Scott: in the TV show It stops at every planet and I haven't read the manga.

560
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,103
Rym: Well, how many planets are in between the stops that it just doesn't bother with?

561
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:05,637
Scott: right the Express part of the galaxy Express is in between the Milky Way and Andromeda.

562
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,423
Scott: It doesn't stop cuz there's nowhere to stop.

563
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:10,010
Scott: That's the Express part, right?

564
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,442
Scott: There's no other train that's gonna get you all the way to.

565
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:17,221
Rym: and now we're not talking about the show But the show is primarily just this kind of show.

566
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:28,070
Rym: where they do episodic the train lands on a planet It's there for X hours or X days Tetsuro fucks up and gets into trouble and the planet has its existential crisis right at that moment.

567
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,406
Scott: Yep, so imagine if for you know, take for example cowboy bebop.

568
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:35,270
Scott: right in cowboy bebop There's some episodic episodes and there's also plot episodes.

569
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,730
Scott: But some of the non plot episodes have a little bit of plot in them like a tiny bit, right?

570
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,810
Rym: Or they have like some really important character development or something or something like that, right?

571
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,266
Scott: But there are episodes that are purely episodic.

572
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:50,390
Scott: now Imagine if cowboy bebop was hundreds of episodes long like a hundred and thirty something.

573
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:57,490
Scott: Well, you know Maybe ten twenty of the episodes would have some bit of plot in them and the rest would just be talking dinosaurs.

574
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:58,774
Scott: Right, exactly.

575
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:03,410
Scott: So Galaxy Express the TV show a lot of the episodes are just you know, they're self-contained.

576
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,173
Scott: You don't need them.

577
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:12,120
Scott: The movie is a compilation that only focuses on the main plot Tetsuro getting his revenge getting to the robot planet.

578
00:33:12,883 --> 00:33:13,705
Scott: What's the deal with?

579
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,186
Scott: may tell?

580
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,530
Scott: why does she want to help Tetsuro?

581
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:22,650
Scott: You know what's going on in the time Castle, you know all that sort of stuff right count Mecca is a bad guy.

582
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:29,366
Scott: It concentrates solely on that plot and also brings captain Harlock and emeraldus and friends into it more.

583
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:38,590
Scott: So yeah, right And it skips over a lot of the stop at a random planet and you know learn a lesson about something unrelated.

584
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:46,402
Rym: There's a more, you know, it's always some sort of like existential moral dilemma What is the meaning of fighting your own way or being a beggar?

585
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,533
Rym: or yeah, this is not listening to what mental who told you This is the.

586
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:52,010
Scott: this is the planet made of bolts, right?

587
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,330
Scott: All people do on this planet is make bolts, but there's an artist living on this planet.

588
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:02,530
Scott: Oh, so woe is this artist who is forced to make bolts but wants to make art, you know on this horrible planet?

589
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,277
Scott: Yeah, I can't afford to leave.

590
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:10,889
Rym: This is the planet where everyone's immortal, but they miss funerals So they fucking murder people so they have an excuse for funerals, right?

591
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:17,909
Scott: So, yeah, there's planets like that in the TV show But the movie just concentrates on the planets that have something to do with the plot.

592
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:22,409
Rym: So our review if it wasn't obvious, we're just gonna talk about the movie and we'll avoid spoilers though.

593
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:33,196
Rym: Sorry, I already talked about the movie a lot Yeah But bear in mind that the movie which spoils the end of the show was aired in Japan like shown Before the series ended.

594
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:42,630
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure when the the timing of the manga release which I haven't read any of But yes, the movie was released before the TV show was done.

595
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,438
Scott: So you saw the ending of the TV show in the movie.

596
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,969
Scott: if you were Japanese before you saw the ending of the TV show.

597
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,101
Scott: But they are slightly different.

598
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,770
Scott: They're not exactly the same, right?

599
00:34:52,870 --> 00:35:00,590
Scott: I mean, it's the same general idea with this spoiling ending that we won't actually spoil but They are quite different.

600
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:07,818
Scott: So just because you've seen the whole movie and you think you know Oh, I know what's gonna happen at the end of the TV show now It's not exactly the same.

601
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:10,250
Scott: It's still worth watching the TV show if you like.

602
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:10,551
Scott: Yes

603
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:21,989
Rym: now in terms of the movie, this is one of those things where even if you don't like it I know people who are anime fans who have seen it and who don't like it Even though they do understand a lot of what's going on and why it's the way it is.

604
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:23,448
Rym: That's fine.

605
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:33,027
Rym: But much like citizen Kane if you want to have an opinion on anime and say that you care about anime You had better have seen this movie and at least know what the deal is.

606
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:43,809
Scott: Yeah It's like you don't have to watch the whole TV show Right, but if you haven't seen at least this first movie not even the second one Just if you haven't seen this first movie your opinion on anime really doesn't count.

607
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:49,230
Scott: It's also interesting not because it's that you know, I'm not gonna say, you know that it's the greatest movie ever.

608
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:53,426
Scott: There are plenty of anime movies that are significantly better than this movie.

609
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,776
Scott: many Miyazaki movies It's oshi khan movies.

610
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:58,830
Scott: Akira ghost in the shell does plenty of it.

611
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,310
Scott: I'd even say summer wars is better than this movie.

612
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:07,584
Scott: But this movie is important and it's still just because there are many anime movies better than it.

613
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:13,063
Scott: It is still great though It's interesting depending on when you watch it and in what atmosphere.

614
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:14,890
Scott: it could have a profound impact on you.

615
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,748
Scott: Oh my god, when I watched it in high school, it had a profound impact much less impact now But I still very much enjoy it.

616
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:26,668
Rym: Well, I think the difference is that when I first saw it, I didn't know any of those characters were.

617
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:27,290
Scott: that's true.

618
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:37,648
Rym: The whole all those like side plots and the bird and harlock and emeraldus and everything I I got the impression that I should know like kind of like when I saw the first tenchi movie.

619
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:42,690
Rym: as a kid I didn't know who these people were but the movie indicated to me that I should have known like they're a big deal.

620
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:46,370
Rym: So I went into that movie just thinking like oh that must be an important person.

621
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:51,990
Rym: Oh, I wonder what the deal is with that and it got me really interested in the Matsumoto verse.

622
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:53,196
Rym: Just cuz.

623
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:54,369
Rym: I wanted to know what the deal was.

624
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:55,756
Rym: Why'd that guy turn into a ship?

625
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,303
Rym: and what's the deal with the bird and the gun?

626
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,047
Rym: and why is?

627
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:58,790
Rym: why is that gone?

628
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,449
Rym: Like how did you get that fucking gun?

629
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,025
Scott: Yeah, why is the gun special right?

630
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:06,658
Rym: It's like Why is everyone so sad when so-and-so died?

631
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:08,506
Scott: There's even more of that in the second movie.

632
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:23,408
Scott: Yeah It's weird because the first time I saw it even though I didn't know who any of those people were and I didn't even realize it Was a universe of combined things or anything like that It sort of had this, you know, really melodramatic and sort of awe-inspiring mystic quality to it.

633
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:30,472
Scott: and now It's like I sort of have this, you know actual knowledge like oh, that's you know, you know Tochiro.

634
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:35,490
Scott: oh, yeah, man, that's so-and-so and oh my god, but you know, he's going into the Arcadia.

635
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,270
Scott: But it wasn't that same story told differently in you know, actually the actual captain Harlock show.

636
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,258
Scott: So which one is the right one answer?

637
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:46,430
Scott: There is no right one and there's a person doesn't go together.

638
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,942
Scott: It's a bunch of jigsaw puzzle pieces that look like they fit but they don't fucking.

639
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:56,750
Rym: we didn't even get the experience of imagine if We'd seen the whole show first and then the movie and we had and we had been people who had watched.

640
00:37:57,232 --> 00:38:02,530
Scott: You know, we had been Japanese people who watched Yamato and Harlock already and not just all at once like we do.

641
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:13,128
Rym: But you know every week every week every week for your childhood one episode of the space train Yeah, and then there are a hundred something weeks and then way later a movie.

642
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:18,882
Rym: Yep, but watching it like you said movie from my modern perspective.

643
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:22,832
Rym: I Fan-service.

644
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,116
Rym: there isn't that movie a lot.

645
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,703
Rym: a lot of that movie is check it out.

646
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:27,485
Scott: It's hard.

647
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,350
Scott: Yeah, it still works.

648
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,890
Scott: Definitely if you do not know about the Leiji Matsumoto stuff may work better if you don't know.

649
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,835
Scott: I think so too.

650
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,610
Scott: cuz like once you know it you it's or it's weird, right?

651
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,310
Scott: It's like the what Marvel Comics and that often get wrong.

652
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:44,450
Scott: They sometimes do it right this way, right?

653
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,268
Scott: But they often get it wrong where they'll put stuff in like that.

654
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:51,003
Scott: So therefore their comic makes no sense to people who don't know it.

655
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:52,810
Scott: DC gets it wrong a lot more often, right?

656
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,139
Scott: Yep, but in this case, it's like if you're a fan There's a whole bunch of stuff there for you.

657
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,790
Scott: And if you're not a fan, then it's just okay.

658
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,438
Scott: There's a space pirate, you know, who's?

659
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:03,739
Scott: who's?

660
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,482
Scott: a great space pirate.

661
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,580
Scott: Okay, you know, he's just some guy You don't know you don't know.

662
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:11,038
Rym: real part of it too is that I was not used but it's like it's like it's.

663
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:17,881
Scott: he actually sort of even worse having the inside knowledge because now I Look at it as fan service as opposed to just looking at it as it.

664
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,145
Rym: there's the secondary thing of.

665
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,920
Rym: I was not used to Leiji Matsumoto level melodrama.

666
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,050
Rym: I had never seen anything like that before.

667
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:34,886
Rym: So the melodrama when I was a kid watching this movie late at night all alone Just made it feel probably more profound than it actually.

668
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:43,353
Scott: that's why I always watch Galaxy Express late at night in the dark in the quiet because it that's when it works best because it's outer space quiet Melodrama, right.

669
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,150
Scott: if you watch it during the daytime like when you get home from school, that's not gonna work.

670
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,270
Scott: You know when you get home from school or whatever or work watch Macross instead.

671
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:52,214
Scott: Yeah, right.

672
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,633
Scott: then when the lights go out before bed, that's when you watch the galaxy Matsumoto and stuff.

673
00:39:56,654 --> 00:40:01,650
Rym: you just got to sit down quietly and watch it and just really let the melodrama just take you away.

674
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,774
Scott: That's how I like to watch it.

675
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:13,770
Rym: Anyway, I think that's probably kind of like how I wonder what the original time A particular red wine should be drunk at a particular temperature a Matsumoto should be watched in a particular time in a particular mindset.

676
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:21,825
Scott: Yeah, right because it's like if you don't give it your full attention, you know And you're really you're focusing on it and it's quiet then you're not gonna really get.

677
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:29,267
Scott: you know, this, you know Extreme melodrama and you know sort of quiet space action is gonna come off.

678
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,289
Scott: sort of cheesy, I guess.

679
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:41,545
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time the the actual message like the core moral structure of The Galaxy Express TV show and movie is I think extremely profound on its own.

680
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:50,930
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I don't know It is a strong and quality message But I think what got me about it was that it's a message that is in so many sci-fis.

681
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,123
Scott: You know, it's a combination of me.

682
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:57,696
Scott: I'm play guy and You know token elves.

683
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,340
Scott: Yeah at the same time.

684
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,163
Scott: What was us?

685
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,406
Rym: Oh the non men.

686
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:06,030
Scott: Yeah, right It's like, you know, it was even when I originally saw it.

687
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,850
Scott: It was a message that I had seen already in multiple sci-fi works over and over.

688
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,500
Rym: But there's something about the way it's presented.

689
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:13,821
Scott: Of course.

690
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:14,805
Scott: So seeing it again.

691
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:20,470
Scott: It was like, oh man There's that sci-fi message that I've seen in so many works that I really liked.

692
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,496
Scott: I really like this one too.

693
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:24,161
Scott: In fact, it gives me this message.

694
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:27,511
Scott: I've seen and heard before better than those other ones Did.

695
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:35,730
Rym: well because for all the melodrama it's weird like but when I first saw the movies a kid Certain scenes felt much more profound to me than they are now.

696
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,660
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time the message was actually like.

697
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,028
Rym: the core message was not presented directly in melodramatically.

698
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:43,830
Rym: throughout most of it.

699
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,157
Rym: it was very subtle.

700
00:41:45,217 --> 00:42:02,767
Rym: you see people who die and people who live and You realize toward the end how much more moved you are by the people who died After a long and fulfilling life achieving their goals or failing at their goals Yeah, and how the people who live forever achieved more but yet it felt more hollow.

701
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:14,282
Scott: Yeah There's also the the fact, you know, you watch a lot of sci-fi things right even yeah even Matsumoto ones right and they always have lots of space battles.

702
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,530
Scott: It's always about the space battles, especially Yamato.

703
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:24,150
Scott: It's like, you know fire the wave motion cannon, but dude Right, but Galaxy Express doesn't have a lot of that.

704
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,160
Scott: I mean the TV show.

705
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:28,158
Scott: there's space battles But they don't go the same way.

706
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:30,145
Scott: Star Trek Star Wars or Yamato.

707
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,270
Scott: space battles do right?

708
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:42,867
Scott: It's either like the train is sitting there with shields on hoping it won't get no they won't die Or someone comes on the train and has like one gun, you know, or you know, it's always.

709
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:49,890
Scott: you know, sir It's it's much more Western in its its battle styling than in it than space styling, right?

710
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,083
Scott: It's like all the action is Western action, even though it's because it's all character driven.

711
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:54,665
Scott: There's no.

712
00:42:54,705 --> 00:43:01,336
Scott: it's like instead of you know If they're gonna fight on the train, it'll be like a train robbery where you know Some bandits get on the train.

713
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:01,758
Rym: Well, that's it.

714
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:06,779
Rym: It's all character driven that the Matsumoto verse If anything could be said to be consistent throughout.

715
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:17,130
Rym: it's that a person fighting for what they believe Directly with just guts and will and determination is more powerful than any force in the universe.

716
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:24,070
Scott: Yeah, and it's like a lot of the planets they go to are Western in styling and space pirates are basically also Cowboys.

717
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:28,807
Rym: Well, they fight under their own flags in the sea of shining stars.

718
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:32,968
Scott: Yeah, of course Yeah, it's just and I mean come on gun frontier, right?

719
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,836
Scott: It's it's basically.

720
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:38,978
Scott: it's like Western in space And it's like people are like cowboy.

721
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:41,330
Scott: bebop was like Western Kung Fu movie in space like yeah.

722
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,742
Scott: Well, this is from the late 70s dude and the early 80s.

723
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:46,902
Scott: So it got beat Got beat big time.

724
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:49,134
Rym: I Still like the movie though.

725
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:50,179
Rym: I'm glad I watched it again.

726
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:53,030
Scott: I'm glad that I want to watch the second one again.

727
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,777
Rym: I haven't seen the second one.

728
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:55,902
Scott: Oh, yeah.

729
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:59,100
Scott: The second one is something special Something special.

730
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:03,118
Scott: Yeah, it's good But you know, but it's got stuff.

731
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,962
Rym: Yeah stuff.

732
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,429
Scott: I don't know how much I want to say about it.

733
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:06,395
Rym: Yeah, we'll hold on.

734
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:07,866
Scott: I want to hold off and do another episode.

735
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,079
Scott: Yeah Squeeze another episode out of it.

736
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,990
Rym: I mean we could go on and on about it.

737
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,818
Rym: I mean, I guess we could spoiler line, but there's not.

738
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:19,210
Rym: there's kind of one really important reveal and that's pretty much it.

739
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:20,979
Rym: And then that's it.

740
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:23,170
Rym: The end is just kind of all the denim all today.

741
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:23,997
Scott: It's pretty much all.

742
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,410
Scott: the whole end is the spoilers.

743
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,395
Scott: It's pretty much like this.

744
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,450
Scott: You can talk about the whole show right up until the end without spoiling anything.

745
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,461
Scott: Yeah, there are some slight differences in the plot.

746
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:36,534
Scott: I mean, you know, usually when there's a there's a Compilation in the TV show.

747
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:43,316
Rym: Tetsuro takes a fucking gun kicks in Count Mecca's door murders him and everybody in his household like right Away in episode one.

748
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:48,890
Rym: Yep, and I remember ConnectiCon way back We had that room late at night and we just had you know, we had to do something.

749
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,593
Scott: So we watched it.

750
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:53,047
Rym: We just watched that one episode and a crowd of people late at night.

751
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:53,710
Rym: We filled the room.

752
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,177
Rym: they're like 50 people sitting there and They were kind of like rowdy in the beginning.

753
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:04,650
Rym: and once the show started they were visibly moved by that scene because Tetsuro Fucking kills that guy.

754
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,675
Scott: It's like in the TV show.

755
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:14,842
Scott: in the very first episode in in the course of 20 minutes Count Mecca kills Tetsuro's mom and then Tetsuro goes and blows him away and all his friends right.

756
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,988
Rym: it gets his bloody revenge burns the mansion down Yeah, and then he comes back to Mattel and he's like, alright, let's go.

757
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:22,782
Scott: Yeah, I did it so in the movie.

758
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:33,047
Scott: in the TV show also There's a multi-part episode about the time palace Which is a castle where there's a fake captain Harlock who's making mischief distinct from the brain palace.

759
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:36,916
Scott: exactly in The movie right?

760
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:39,966
Scott: There's still a time palace because I mean that was such.

761
00:45:40,006 --> 00:45:41,090
Scott: it was like a multi-part episode.

762
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,236
Scott: Of course, you got to bring that in

763
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:42,638
Rym: but

764
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:54,453
Scott: Count Mecca is in the time palace So Tetsuro actually has to go on the train Get to count Mecca and get his bloody revenge like halfway through the movie as opposed to at the end of the movie or at The very beginning.

765
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:57,650
Rym: count Mecca is is whiny and pathetic to the end in both.

766
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,898
Rym: Yeah.

767
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:04,228
Scott: But the other thing is most times when there's a compilation a movie a lot of times what you'll see the jerk.

768
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:17,496
Scott: the general pattern I've seen is you know, they'll take the original TV show They'll cut up they'll slice up the important parts and just squish them together and make a movie without actually and maybe the Animate a few new scenes, right?

769
00:46:17,877 --> 00:46:28,510
Scott: This is actually all original animation new carat different character design for Tetsuro Much much higher quality animation than the TV show completely different music from the TV show, right?

770
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,589
Scott: It's a completely original animated movie.

771
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:40,910
Scott: They just happen to take the major plot points you know of a few planets from the TV show slash manga and Make those the story of the movies.

772
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:54,467
Rym: So it's like they wrote the movie using pieces of the writing from the TV show and It has because it has all these like the the whole Tochiro like side plot with getting the gun and everything is a good chunk of the movie.

773
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:55,310
Scott: Yeah, they do.

774
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,870
Scott: That's it's surprising like how much you know, cuz that is not in the TV show at all.

775
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:06,503
Scott: That is in the Harlock TV show and other Matsumoto works, but they squeezed it into that Galaxy Express Movie I guess to break.

776
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:08,493
Scott: maybe that was a Intentional thing.

777
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:14,150
Rym: Well, it did bring in more Harlock fan that whole thing with his mom and you know his fate.

778
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,556
Rym: And yeah tochiro's mom.

779
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:16,460
Scott: There's no way tojos.

780
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,886
Scott: Mom would have been alive at that.

781
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:18,850
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

782
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:19,874
Rym: Well, it was.

783
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:20,838
Scott: I got to just accept that.

784
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:21,461
Scott: you know the thing.

785
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:21,722
Scott: what does?

786
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:23,007
Scott: stuff doesn't fit Matsumoto.

787
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:25,869
Rym: stuff does fit But it only fits so much.

788
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:32,010
Rym: No It fits in this like the allegory and the moral and the feel is like deadlocked.

789
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:38,835
Scott: The Canon doesn't fit at all right cuz like if you watch one set of TV shows and movies It's like there's no way.

790
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:42,090
Scott: it's like tochiro came way the fuck after Harlock.

791
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:44,949
Scott: But then you watch this and it's like no they were at the same time.

792
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,608
Scott: Well, plus with I mean, I mean Tetsuro tochiro and Harlock were definitely the same.

793
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:54,350
Rym: Yeah But look at how the message of that whole tochiro thing.

794
00:47:54,591 --> 00:48:04,123
Rym: It's exactly the same message as it was in every other portrayal of ah, but it's somewhat conflicted because you know his death Serving the purpose that it serves.

795
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:10,104
Rym: but at the same time Could he not had he been longer lived with a robot body?

796
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:13,937
Rym: He could have gone hot back home to his mother And at least said something.

797
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,349
Scott: also his daughter was completely absent from the movie.

798
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:20,630
Rym: But this is I think why the message feels so profound.

799
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,783
Rym: You know this over this kind of generic fantasy message of if you are immortal life loses all meaning.

800
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:36,570
Rym: that in the Matsumoto verse Oftentimes you see characters who really should have lived longer and how everything would have been better had they been immortal.

801
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:38,821
Scott: Well, then he didn't die.

802
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:40,570
Scott: He uploaded himself into his spaceship.

803
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:47,668
Scott: So it's like he didn't go for the robot body until he was already gonna die Anyway, but at the same time as opposed to just a lot of people just went for the robot body.

804
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,899
Rym: immediately You get the impression that it was not a clean like.

805
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,027
Rym: he is not still quite the same person.

806
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:53,990
Rym: He can't go back home.

807
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,638
Scott: He's basically part of a computer.

808
00:48:55,658 --> 00:49:01,339
Rym: He can't go back and say just you know Anything to his mother can't resolve that whole situation.

809
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:02,342
Scott: He doesn't want to either.

810
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:03,807
Rym: Yeah, but she wanted him to know.

811
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:04,589
Scott: that's you know.

812
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,608
Rym: But in there's definitely this idea that the message is immortality bad.

813
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:19,115
Rym: yet The show is very conflicted on even that point and the movie is also somewhat conflicted on even that point Which is the main point.

814
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,990
Rym: the point is that it's conflicted that you could you could go both ways.

815
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:30,689
Rym: Yep, if I were a metal well, I don't want to spoil the end end, but I would do things differently And I wouldn't mind being immortal.

816
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:37,650
Scott: I might wait though wait for what you know for it to get the best possible robot body first.

817
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,300
Rym: Yeah, well, I think there are some good robot bodies one can get.

818
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,400
Rym: yeah.

819
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,448
Scott: They're also some not so good one.

820
00:49:42,508 --> 00:49:46,174
Rym: Yeah So I don't know.

821
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:49,209
Rym: so we can say I mean it's a fantastic movie even if you don't like it.

822
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,069
Rym: It's one of the more important animated movies ever.

823
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:55,901
Scott: It's now easily available in high quality with subtitles for the first time.

824
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:56,102
Scott: do

825
00:49:56,122 --> 00:50:03,676
Rym: it yourself a favor and just late at night some night Just put in the DVD with a couple of friends quietly watch it Maybe while sipping some wine

826
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:06,989
Scott: and if you like it watch all the Matsumoto show if you

827
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,130
Rym: like

828
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,630
Scott: Matos and I hope there's a hundred and something episodes on crunchyroll.

829
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,155
Scott: You can watch if you like it.

830
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,170
Rym: There is so much of it that you won't know what to do with yourself.

831
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:21,309
Scott: But yeah, if you do like it, I highly recommend the TV show.

832
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,770
Scott: Some episodes are better than others, but which is what's gonna happen with 100 plus episodes?

833
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:28,090
Scott: But if you like you'll notice how it's worried.

834
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:36,057
Rym: Oh head like morphs over time and it gets more and more potato with the eyes get more and more Derped until the very end.

835
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:41,484
Rym: when they under all at once because they put all their effort into the final They're like oh shit the I migrated too far.

836
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:42,269
Rym: We got to put it back.

837
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:54,200
