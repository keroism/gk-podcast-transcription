00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,071
Scott: It's Wednesday February the 2nd 2011.

Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:25,060
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is the night tonight the century ancient incredibly old battle of the dub and the sub.

4
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:27,790
Scott: Let's do this.

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:27,830
Scott: I.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,064
Rym: Yeah, I know Scott that you said the year.

7
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,032
Rym: have you given up on that battle.

8
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:34,594
Scott: Do you notice?

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,397
Scott: I said 2011 and not?

10
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:37,863
Scott: 2011. yeah, the Daily Show says 2011.

11
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:38,163
Rym: They're wrong.

12
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:38,585
Rym: They're right.

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,069
Rym: you said if it was the year 1911 would you say?

14
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:45,443
Scott: 1911 or would you say 1911 depends?

15
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,085
Scott: What do you mean depends?

16
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:46,446
Scott: sometimes I say?

17
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,840
Scott: 1948.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,983
Rym: you said 1991 1992 19 all through your whole life.

19
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:52,866
Scott: It was 19 and that number.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:58,604
Scott: so now it is 20.

21
00:00:58,604 --> 00:00:59,455
Scott: And then the number.

22
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:02,231
Rym: yeah 22,000. they're pretty much the same.

23
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:08,354
Scott: only in the first decade 2001 2002 as soon as you get that was one D.

24
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:09,158
Rym: That was the arts.

25
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,687
Rym: no 2010 that was 20 on one.

26
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:17,467
Scott: you could do that to 20 on to jerk, but it as soon as you get to 2010 It's funny said that I can't use.

27
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:21,020
Rym: I will probably never live to see the day where I can use on a guarantee.

28
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,733
Scott: You will never live to use odd again.

29
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:27,880
Scott: if you use odd again I will give you all my money except possibly referring to the past.

30
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:37,408
Scott: I will give if you use it hit it to refer to the present year correctly ever again in your entire life And I am alive and you are alive.

31
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,493
Scott: I'll give you every money.

32
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:41,340
Rym: I own so anyway There's not a lot of you know weird.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,418
Rym: It's Wednesday anime manga comics all that stuff and yet there usually isn't that much news lately.

34
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,408
Rym: that well We at least care about.

35
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,419
Scott: well actually there is a comic news.

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,511
Scott: You want to hear this comic news?

37
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,440
Rym: I'll hear this comic news.

38
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,150
Scott: I also have a geek bite, but I want to do both.

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,673
Scott: is that okay?

40
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:57,458
Scott: You can do both.

41
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:58,764
Scott: alright It's a comic news.

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,145
Scott: you ready.

43
00:01:59,265 --> 00:01:59,687
Scott: I'm ready.

44
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:00,510
Scott: You probably no one.

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,557
Scott: This is weird because it's sort of like this thing.

46
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,355
Scott: well That that was true for a long time, but wasn't completely true.

47
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,463
Scott: and basically now It's completely true.

48
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:10,485
Scott: so Superman's dead.

49
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,860
Scott: no wizard magazine is no more wizard magazine.

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,104
Scott: It is existed.

51
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,268
Scott: it is ceased to be.

52
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,175
Rym: no really wizard still exists.

53
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:20,540
Scott: also toy fair magazine.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,707
Scott: How about scribe?

55
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:22,854
Rym: is scribe still going?

56
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,545
Scott: that's dead a long time Yeah, but basically right.

57
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:37,164
Scott: the wizard whole thing was going downhill for a long time and people you know used to love it in The 90s but now more recently they were hating it and they were like oh wizard and wizards been doing a lot of bad shit With their conventions to real bad.

58
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:37,866
Scott: right.

59
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,751
Rym: but remember Philly wizard world.

60
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,880
Scott: yeah, that was that was right before they got real bad.

61
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:48,883
Rym: Yeah, that was honestly one of the most boring and depressing conventions I have ever seen.

62
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,820
Scott: but anyway, you know so the whole wizard thing they're pretty much gone.

63
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:58,660
Scott: They've hit rock bottom now, and it's it's game over, but you know it's like back in the day like wizard.

64
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,322
Scott: You know it's.

65
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:00,466
Scott: it's one of those things where it's like.

66
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,135
Scott: it was such a gradual decline.

67
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:04,720
Scott: You know it's not like newspapers.

68
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,551
Scott: It's gonna be the same situation right.

69
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:15,680
Scott: such a gradual decline That the day they die is gonna be so unmomentous because they basically been shindeiru for many many years.

70
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:16,467
Scott: It's like you know.

71
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,213
Scott: you know.

72
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:17,616
Scott: it's like.

73
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:22,740
Scott: It's like when five years ago Kentro went what that that that hit wizard in the in the neck.

74
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,749
Scott: But today they just exploded.

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,000
Scott: so it's like we knew that finally go out of business.

76
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,147
Rym: We won't like who would.

77
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,300
Rym: how would I even know if AOL went out of business?

78
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,532
Scott: Yeah, it's like it by the time that they go out of business.

79
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:35,240
Scott: They're gonna be so tiny already.

80
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:37,341
Scott: It's like you know they shrink so much I don't know.

81
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:46,351
Rym: well that actually dovetails quite nicely into my news because while you know wizard that whole aspect of comic-dom was Basically on the decline forever.

82
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:52,900
Rym: not forever, but for all of modern history Reed and the New York Comic Con and all those things have actually been on the upswing.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,513
Rym: Reed is kind of taking the New York Comic Con and the shell of what remains of the New York Anime Festival and turn them into An SDCC competitor.

84
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,865
Scott: well they're pretty much That's always what they wanted and now they're.

85
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:08,340
Scott: they're going even farther to pretty much copy the San Diego Comic Con in every conceivable way.

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,907
Rym: And that is the news.

87
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:14,407
Rym: the New York Comic Con is officially now not one not two not three But four days.

88
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,740
Scott: well the fourth day is really a preview night.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,744
Scott: It's not a full day.

90
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:23,489
Scott: where else have we seen a fourth day preview night, San Diego, Comicon And they even call it preview night.

91
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,936
Scott: They're calling it the exact same thing.

92
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,347
Rym: yeah I'm not very conflicted about this.

93
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,480
Rym: I do not fault Reed for making this decision.

94
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:35,280
Scott: Yeah, if you're a pro for-profit con you did it's gonna make you money.

95
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,363
Scott: How could you not do it?

96
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,129
Scott: it, but I but it does.

97
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:44,609
Rym: it service the fans now well well well well It does in a way, but does it service the industry?

98
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,400
Rym: it doesn't service the same fans because there's different kind.

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
Rym: There's like three kinds of conventions that at least Scott and I care about these days.

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,903
Rym: They're the only ones we go to.

101
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:58,200
Rym: there's either the real deal professional convention run by people who know what they're doing.

102
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,453
Rym: Yeah, like the New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival.

103
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,540
Rym: You know all the Reed cons.

104
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,659
Rym: There's the fan run con that has a lot of spirit, but is run by incompetent morons.

105
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:14,620
Rym: Maybe I shouldn't name names those cons You know like the Otakons and as much as I love ConnectiCon we're staff.

106
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,478
Rym: We were directors of programming and stuff and even we have trouble there, and and then there's Pax Which just does everything perfectly?

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,719
Rym: yeah, I says like all the benefits of the fan con and all the benefits of the pro con with pretty much no drawbacks.

108
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:33,140
Rym: and Nope, what bothers me is that the New York Comic Con and Reed?

109
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,711
Rym: They're doing everything right.

110
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:39,600
Rym: if they came to me and said Rym How can we make more money with this con and make it more popular?

111
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,486
Rym: I would say do everything that you just did.

112
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,620
Rym: yeah, but it makes the con way less fun for people like us.

113
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:55,169
Rym: It's fun for the Hollywood types the people who go to see a famous person or to see the guy who's playing the superhero in The superhero movie based on the comic they didn't read.

114
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:02,920
Scott: it's also fun for people who are like you know They want to dig around in bins of comics for a long time and see like absolutely amazing.

115
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,832
Scott: You know that kind of stuff, but you know there are other places to do that.

116
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,620
Scott: It doesn't it's not exclusive in that regard.

117
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:13,120
Rym: It's also fun for the I don't want to say casual fan because that is such a misnomer And it has too much connotation.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,872
Scott: Yeah, if you were like a slight fan of nerdy stuff, and you went to this it would just blow your mind like oh Like.

119
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:20,740
Rym: I have a lot of co-workers.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:28,294
Rym: They're not into comics or into anime or into gaming But they do and consume all of those things and they don't think anything of it.

121
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:34,680
Rym: so they hear oh, there's a comic-con I'll go for a day, and it's big and flashy and there's crazy stuff everywhere, and they have an awesome time.

122
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:42,760
Rym: It's basically only not fun for what I would almost call the advanced fan who is not single minded and single focused.

123
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:49,019
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you're an advanced the thing is there are advanced fans who have you know some sort of?

124
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:49,280
Scott: you know?

125
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,325
Scott: They like to spend money.

126
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:54,206
Scott: right because it's your comic con Yeah, the whole convention.

127
00:06:54,347 --> 00:07:02,260
Scott: if you gear the convention towards making money Then what you're gonna Do is you're gonna make it most appealing to the fan who likes to spend money?

128
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:09,705
Scott: So the kind of fan who's not a big spender someone who's not interested in shopping or paying for art from artists You know.

129
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:16,671
Scott: or and pretty much you know Buying DVDs and paying to see get autographs and all that you know.

130
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:22,566
Scott: someone who's not going to pay money someone who's there to Participate in sort of community things right.

131
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,193
Scott: look at the conventions like PAX and even Otakon.

132
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,717
Scott: how many community meetups.

133
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:27,880
Scott: and go in the forums.

134
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,566
Scott: Let's get together and play Pokemon.

135
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:33,216
Rym: There's the surface level flash kind of show me stuff.

136
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:46,388
Rym: There's the Programming like actual discrete programming not just like the big floor, but like go to this panel go to this event Yeah, and then there's the hang out with like-minded people and we know we've said this a lot And we have a lot of like-minded people.

137
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,500
Scott: doesn't make the convention more money so that is minimized.

138
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:55,385
Rym: Well, we have a lot of evidence at least anecdotal evidence from the last decade of going to conventions that by and large Comic-con attendees.

139
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,815
Rym: any comic-con are not there nearly as much for the community.

140
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:03,570
Rym: well actually heard to anime fans who are only there for the community.

141
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:11,880
Scott: well one thing I have noticed right is that the Many of the people who are there for the community right are the people behind the tables right?

142
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:25,280
Scott: It's like if you're some guy who's like a podcaster will be there behind the table And he's friends all these artists who are behind tables and they're friends with vendors who are behind tables And they're friends with other people who are behind in the expo hall right and there's a community there.

143
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:31,177
Scott: And there's also a community between people who are you know sort of into the same thing right.

144
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:40,659
Scott: so a whole bunch of people might be in line for an artist and they're all fans of the same thing and this community in that respect or Maybe a whole bunch of people are fans of the same.

145
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:45,197
Scott: You know Publisher or something so they'll be all around that.

146
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:52,968
Scott: publishers You know dealer area yep, or they'll be the guys who are in a community of Trading comics that are sealed in plastic.

147
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:56,280
Scott: so at the table where they seal stuff in plastic those guys are all together right?

148
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:08,940
Rym: But there isn't community like you know Triwizard drinking tournament community yep Or it was most stark last year the New York comic-con New York anime festival win if you walked around any part of the con.

149
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:20,920
Rym: But the anime ghetto it was basically a giant crowd of people shuffling and looking walking around looking around walking around looking around Standing in a lot of money, and if you went to the anime ghetto it was just as crowded.

150
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:31,329
Rym: But it was people like in big Clobs just talking to each other and hanging out and dicking around and running around and hitting each other and just like sitting in Circles good and bad good and bad.

151
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,585
Rym: I'm not gonna say that it's all good, but then again I'm an old man who's too old for that shit.

152
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,110
Rym: That's right, but it's very.

153
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:50,880
Rym: They're so diametrically opposed and while our Programming like the stuff didn't eyes what we do like our real lectures Really fit more on the professional comic-con side like you do the professional panel.

154
00:09:52,062 --> 00:10:03,176
Scott: it's more fun to hang out in the anime side and Consequently and even though the even though the presentation of our panel is professional the content is more geared towards Than you know not the comic people.

155
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:16,980
Rym: yeah well it was very telling that the because the comic and the anime panels last year were kind of separated and Every time I walked over to the comic area unless it was Famous guy talking about his thing there was literally like two people in every room.

156
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:21,160
Scott: Yeah, they were like panels over there were either crazy full or crazy empty.

157
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:25,926
Rym: I mean most of the anime panels at least the ones I saw were actually really Crowded like all of them.

158
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,480
Rym: just there was a solid group of people that were just going to every panel.

159
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:38,591
Rym: Yeah, and the end result of this is that I don't know where the New York comic-con is going other than that It's becoming SDCC in NYC.

160
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,535
Scott: That's what it is.

161
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,734
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much it and We'll see what happens.

162
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:52,205
Rym: last year We were gonna really up our content, and then we we ended up only doing one panel in the anime side Which was fun, but it made me realize this weird aside It's kind of a GeekNights meta thing.

163
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,759
Rym: we haven't been to many anime cons in the last year.

164
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:04,600
Rym: No, I mean we ditched on Otakon because they didn't like they didn't have anything for us and We didn't go to a lot of smaller anime cons that invited us out.

165
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,133
Rym: I think Zenkai Con is the next anime con we're going to since anime Boston.

166
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:09,499
Scott: Anime Boston Zenkai Con.

167
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,589
Scott: we're down And ConnectiCon is has anime content.

168
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:16,220
Scott: Yeah, ConnectiCon has anime, but it's an everything con anyway.

169
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:17,779
Scott: So I'm gonna do a geek bite here.

170
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:23,280
Scott: Alright, so this normally it's a video game, but this is not a video game for video game people.

171
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,666
Scott: It's basically for anime manga.

172
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,792
Rym: It's not for you alright.

173
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:30,720
Scott: The game is it's a DS game, and I'm sure you might have heard of it.

174
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,332
Scott: It's called.

175
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,386
Scott: Well it's nine person.

176
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,171
Scott: I'm not sure which nine persons.

177
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:36,994
Scott: nine don't know.

178
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:39,120
Scott: nine hours nine persons nine doors.

179
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:43,737
Scott: I forget which order it's like hours persons doors or persons doors hours, but anyway.

180
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:44,620
Scott: It's nine nine nine.

181
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,089
Rym: What's the equation is like door hours per person?

182
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,260
Scott: It's nine nine nine nine hours nine persons nine doors.

183
00:11:50,401 --> 00:12:07,086
Scott: That's the game and this is It's an adventure game right on the DS when it's very very focused on story And it's pretty much got you know anime characters, which are pretty well designed and a very good Naoki Urasawa.

184
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:10,219
Scott: ish kind of story right or it's one of those.

185
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:10,560
Scott: you know.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,993
Scott: It's in the genre of sort of Death Note where there's a crazy scenario.

187
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:18,472
Scott: it basically the crazy scenario is You're some guy Junpei.

188
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:20,864
Scott: you got you know Ether.

189
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:29,420
Scott: oh no you wake up in a room on a boat And there's a number five on the door And you've got a wristband with the number five on it also sort of a battle royale kind of situation.

190
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:38,032
Scott: you know same kind of thing also, and then you realize there's a whole bunch of people on this boat with wristbands with numbers and You can only give you there's a number.

191
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,228
Scott: you have to get out and In order to get out you to go through.

192
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:51,636
Scott: you know these numbered doors and solve puzzles and then there's a lot of plot and you got it's a choose your own adventure book where Occasionally you have to stop and solve a bunch of puzzles, and then you know more.

193
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,800
Scott: choose your own adventure occurs.

194
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,400
Scott: Now I don't want to talk about the game too much except to say this one thing The number one problem in the game is slow text speed.

195
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:05,780
Scott: But there are multiple endings and if you play through again any text you've already seen you can fast forward.

196
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:15,749
Scott: Ah, however when you play through again If you do the same puzzle again if you choose say the same path And there's a puzzle you've already solved you do the puzzle again You can do it again really fast because it's the same puzzle.

197
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,216
Scott: I would hope but you had to do it again.

198
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,359
Scott: anyway Here's the thing about this game.

199
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:25,540
Scott: I said alright for my first playthrough cuz Conrad sort of you know told me what was up with it before.

200
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:26,605
Scott: You know he was like.

201
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,520
Scott: I do not know what is up, but he didn't tell me all that was up.

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,525
Scott: He just told me that it was.

203
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,098
Scott: sort of you know it was annoying with all these different endings like he's like.

204
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:43,197
Scott: all the first Time I played I got that shit ending and then the second time I played I got the to be continued ending and I was like Oh great So I played it and I said I'm just gonna do whatever I feel is right and see what ending I get.

205
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,686
Rym: that's the best Way to play a game like.

206
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:45,693
Scott: so I got at the.

207
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,580
Scott: I beat it yesterday.

208
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,222
Rym: That's how I played.

209
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:54,551
Scott: one chance I beat it yesterday, and I got quote-unquote the coffin ending right, so I said all right I got the coffin ending.

210
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:55,560
Scott: it said to be continued.

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,591
Scott: I was like aha I didn't die on the first ending.

212
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,059
Scott: that's better than the coffee.

213
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,030
Scott: here I got the hit.

214
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,880
Scott: I did better than Conrad.

215
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,810
Scott: So then I'm like all right time to go to game facts.

216
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,682
Scott: so into game facts and look at a list of endings you ready For some bullshit.

217
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:09,751
Scott: Uh-huh here's the bullshit the coffin ending.

218
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:11,677
Scott: I guess this is a minor spoiler.

219
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:15,645
Scott: the coffin ending is The true ending.

220
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:19,478
Scott: in order to get the quote true ending you have to do the exact same thing.

221
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,823
Scott: you have to do to get The coffin ending.

222
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:24,940
Scott: however, it's simply that you can't get the true ending on your first playthrough.

223
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,683
Scott: There is no way.

224
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:32,028
Scott: so in order for me to get the true ending at a place of play the exact same game again Making the exact same decision no no no no you don't.

225
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,199
Rym: what you have to do is type true ending into YouTube.

226
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,792
Scott: hello That's what I did last night.

227
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,807
Scott: all right But get this.

228
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,611
Scott: so you're ready for this.

229
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,003
Scott: so I typed true ending into YouTube And there was a guy.

230
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:49,589
Scott: he made like a at least 40 or 50 part video of the whole game Including the true ending right every single second of the game.

231
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,759
Scott: wow so I was just watching from the part where the coffin is forward at through that you know past the to be continued to through the true ending.

232
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,514
Scott: and If you're doing the true ending basically there's a whole fuck ton of game beyond that point.

233
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,000
Scott: like there are multiple puzzles.

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
Rym: Wait so it's a Castlevania situation.

235
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:11,880
Scott: Yeah, but pretty much the only way to get to the upside-down castle is to beat the game twice the exact same way.

236
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,749
Rym: I guess I'll have to deal with that.

237
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,120
Scott: and no I just kept watching on YouTube.

238
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,547
Scott: I wrote down.

239
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,577
Scott: I couldn't even finish it cuz it was so long.

240
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:21,100
Scott: I wrote down.

241
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:31,482
Scott: I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna pick up at part 42 And keep going until I see the end because there is no way I'm gonna play the exact same game again even with fast-forwarding The text.

242
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,500
Rym: what's funny is based on a vague reading of what the plot is.

243
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:40,172
Scott: Pretty good death note battle royale and Arasawa kind of suspense.

244
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:47,419
Rym: there's a movie I watched recently just randomly because it was on Netflix while I was like cleaning up the apartment called exam.

245
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:54,518
Rym: It's from 2009. eight dudes locked in a room to take an exam, and that's the whole movie.

246
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,905
Scott: Yeah It's a similar.

247
00:15:56,005 --> 00:16:03,699
Scott: It's one of those weird scenario Sci-fi thriller mystery situations that you know it always seems to work out really well.

248
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,661
Scott: I mean They were 11.

249
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:10,420
Rym: Yeah, actually they were 11 and exam kind of similar.

250
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:11,585
Scott: It's a. it's a whole.

251
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:14,156
Scott: it's a genre that I'm getting sort of keen on.

252
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,080
Scott: you know I mean death note.

253
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,084
Scott: I think sort of really.

254
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:17,369
Rym: I hear by dub it.

255
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,416
Rym: I hereby dub it the 12 angry men.

256
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:27,140
Scott: genre 12 angry men is not really the same genre because it doesn't have these sci-fi mystery thriller even though it does have a scenario.

257
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,440
Rym: Right yeah, but I think it's the closed scenario limited number of people.

258
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,989
Rym: They don't know what the answer is and you don't know what the answer is.

259
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,115
Rym: whatever no whatever there is to answer.

260
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:40,309
Rym: hmm anyway Or the I mean some of these are the.

261
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,240
Rym: you're in one room for the entire movie.

262
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,463
Scott: No, because what death note is not that right death note is there's you know a weird sci-fi or supernatural Scenario.

263
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:49,865
Scott: ah.

264
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,836
Scott: but and then the suspense and mystery.

265
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:58,320
Rym: there's the difference I think between these the scenario that set in the world versus the scenario that's completely cut off from the world.

266
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,717
Rym: I feel like they're two very different kinds of movies.

267
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,412
Scott: now This is pretty much gives this game gives you the same feeling as death note.

268
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,660
Scott: the same feeling is like a 20th century boys.

269
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,948
Scott: They're definitely in the same wheelhouse.

270
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:09,209
Scott: I don't know.

271
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,473
Rym: maybe you should watch the exam.

272
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:13,323
Rym: well just exam wasn't great But it wasn't bad.

273
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:15,694
Scott: I got there great things to watch on the list.

274
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:16,779
Scott: so fuck the exam until.

275
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,809
Rym: So things of the day, what do you got for me Scott in?

276
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:29,490
Rym: 2011?

277
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,946
Scott: oh snap.

278
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,320
Scott: so Everybody knows Kate Beaton is the most awesome.

279
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,444
Scott: that is not a secret.

280
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:40,607
Scott: if it's a secret to you Then you are nobody because it's a secret to everybody.

281
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:46,327
Rym: they'd beaten Consistently makes me laugh more than most people I've ever everybody.

282
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,050
Scott: so anyway.

283
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,159
Scott: So her webcomic is hearts artist.

284
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,170
Scott: hark a vagrant is the best webcomic anyway.

285
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:57,410
Scott: So you may remember in the olden days penny arcade once did a thing where?

286
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:03,206
Scott: Some guy took penny arcade strips and erased all the words and then had his students fill in the words.

287
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:10,118
Scott: as you know a learning lesson right to these blank speech bubble comics And it was hilarity Lowell.

288
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,635
Scott: well it was a guy he teaches English in Korea who's a friend of Kate Beaton.

289
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:23,132
Scott: he took Kate Beaton's comics erased the words out of the speech bubbles and had the students fill him in and Hilarity.

290
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,819
Scott: I mean this has been done a lot of time.

291
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,943
Scott: any arcade did it.

292
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:30,960
Scott: yeah a lot of people have done this But this is the most hilarious of all times.

293
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,909
Scott: I have seen it done, so it is a thing of the day worthy.

294
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,197
Rym: So Stanley fish.

295
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,804
Rym: you may not know who Stanley.

296
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,394
Scott: Stanley Spider-man.

297
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,969
Scott: Stanley fish fish spider-man.

298
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:48,830
Rym: He was a literary critic a legal scholar works for the New York Times all these sorts of things.

299
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:55,110
Rym: And he shares something at least with me and with I think some of our listeners the number four or not for a mites?

300
00:18:55,151 --> 00:19:05,427
Rym: Yes, just one That he's very much enamored with language and diction and prose and sentences and grammar and all that sort of stuff that I find fascinating.

301
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:09,320
Rym: all right and He has a book entitled how to write a sentence.

302
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,223
Rym: so what I have for you.

303
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:11,789
Rym: This is a website talking about it.

304
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:19,943
Rym: He has a list of what he describes as five of the greatest Sentences ever written in what makes a sentence great.

305
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,127
Scott: Well that you could.

306
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:21,990
Rym: I'm gonna read the book.

307
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,690
Rym: I already ordered it.

308
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,834
Rym: I'm curious to see what he says.

309
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:27,448
Scott: is it the content of what the sentence is saying or is it simply the structure?

310
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:35,576
Rym: it is the structure of the sentence the the manner in which it reveals to you its nature and its truth the beauty of it the symmetry of It all those things combined.

311
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:43,890
Scott: and I gotta tell you these are some pretty good sentences All right, well let me hear these sentences all right Or do I have to see them to see the punctuation to really get them?

312
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,984
Rym: I think I can read the punctuation pretty pretty solidly.

313
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,429
Scott: all right, so sentence number one.

314
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:56,229
Rym: Last week I saw a woman flayed and you will hardly believe how much it altered her appearance for the worse.

315
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,980
Scott: Uh-huh all right this one's okay.

316
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:04,012
Rym: This is from 1678.

317
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:10,150
Rym: Now he had not run far from his own door But his wife and children perceiving it began crying after him to return.

318
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,201
Rym: But the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying.

319
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:17,038
Rym: life life eternal life That's smart man.

320
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,346
Rym: all one sentence.

321
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,273
Rym: yep I read one more.

322
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:22,659
Scott: I like how a lot of people.

323
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,144
Scott: this you know reminds me of something.

324
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:30,750
Scott: a lot of people right there Either don't know run-on sentences, so they write them all the time, or they never write a long sentence.

325
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:31,815
Scott: They never they.

326
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:34,530
Scott: they're worried about run-on sentences, so they never write a long sentence.

327
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,474
Scott: I tell you friend.

328
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,870
Scott: I tell you go look at the Constitution or Declaration of Independence.

329
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:47,890
Scott: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all You can write a fucking long ass sentence and still it would be legitimately one sentence.

330
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,038
Scott: I do it all time.

331
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,997
Rym: also if you want to be tricky There's always the semi colonic sentence.

332
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,442
Rym: semi colons are your friend.

333
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:56,890
Rym: it just lets you cram sentences into a sentence.

334
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:04,490
Scott: Not really you can only do it if the set if those separate sentences with it the semicolon are actually part of the same idea.

335
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,957
Rym: Yes, same idea, but not directly related.

336
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,464
Rym: the colon is the directly related right colon.

337
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,490
Rym: is the this therefore this or something to that effect?

338
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:14,761
Rym: The semi colon is the basically two related sentences.

339
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:19,499
Scott: right, but you can't be like you know say yet two completely unrelated sentences.

340
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,168
Scott: like you know see spot run and Scott likes.

341
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:34,010
Rym: Well, I can say this I cannot imagine a very nice sentence that involves a semicolon that is simultaneously imperative.

342
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,423
Rym: I I don't think that can work.

343
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,290
Rym: Yeah, I'll read one more.

344
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:46,088
Rym: I think this is my favorite one and I shall go on talking in a low voice while the sea sounds in the distance and overhead the great black flood of wind polishes the bright stars.

345
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,476
Rym: Uh-huh, I here's the excerpt from the book.

346
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:57,625
Rym: in this sentence the personal voice of the narrator is absorbed by the sea sounds a delivered Pun that begin as background and end by taking over the sentence the scene of writing.

347
00:21:58,086 --> 00:21:59,872
Scott: that is a very good Sentence.

348
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:03,086
Scott: that itself is a good sentence if I see what he did there.

349
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:19,454
Scott: Yeah, that's very good Lava girl, so It's not a college humor But I mean the fact that you had to make a big deal of the fact that it wasn't is telling Illustrative of the problem.

350
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:29,530
Rym: so we will be met a moment at the penny arcade expo doing not one two three four But five panels three of which collapsed into one panel right for a total of three panels.

351
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,630
Scott: There's a whole bunch of conventions the Zenkai con the week after PAX East anime Boston's like a month after that.

352
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,738
Rym: Next weekend February 11th Friday.

353
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,510
Rym: We'll be at nerd NYC board game night at think coffee in Manhattan.

354
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:47,070
Rym: I only say this and keep saying it because we are there at almost every one of these and a lot of listeners show up.

355
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,158
Rym: If you want to meet us hang out with us.

356
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,201
Rym: if you want to play modern art with me and Scott next Friday We'll be there.

357
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,937
Scott: All right You should go to our website.

358
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,163
Scott: It's broker calm.

359
00:22:57,183 --> 00:23:01,579
Scott: You should Go to the forum forum the broker calm.

360
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,931
Rym: you should read the GeekNights book club book, which is currently Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.

361
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:09,700
Scott: Yeah, you should follow us on the Twitter's and all those sorts of things like that.

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,926
Scott: You know Internet's people Internet's and That's enough metamome for now.

363
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,430
Rym: So many of you are probably thinking Rym and Scott.

364
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:28,911
Scott: Why are you talking about an issue that's been dead for a decade because we couldn't come up with any other idea for a show Today and I came up with it and we never did a show on It.

365
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:30,336
Scott: so it deserves a show.

366
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:31,280
Rym: I think it's also.

367
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,970
Rym: I mean, it's a debate like nowadays.

368
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,150
Rym: I don't think anime fans remember the bullshit that used to go on.

369
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:43,384
Scott: Well, I mean some of them some of them don't remember some of them don't care but it's definitely.

370
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,570
Scott: it's always there at the bottom.

371
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:50,433
Scott: It's just you know, there are some issues right that They're.

372
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,097
Scott: they're pervasive issues, right.

373
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:56,450
Scott: and the number one pervasive issue for the last decade and a half is copyright.

374
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:06,482
Scott: but the thing is the copyright issue keeps rearing its head and coming back and coming back and coming back because New things keep happening to it and it keeps rearing and rearing and rearing.

375
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:17,280
Scott: but sub and dub was a big issue especially in the VHS days because you when you bought VHS had to pick you had to pick and The sub usually cost five to ten bucks more.

376
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:26,306
Scott: Yep, not less and also many times you wouldn't have a choice Right, so it was a big issue then and more recently it was become less of an issue because DVD.

377
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:36,750
Rym: you buy the DVD and Everyone gets their own personal preference and it was a huge like people would get weird about it Like it was like the old school of fans like how dare you watch the dog?

378
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,879
Rym: We could watch this job be perfect.

379
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,687
Rym: And then the new fans like whatever.

380
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:41,450
Rym: I just wanna watch my show.

381
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,843
Rym: Leave me alone you old fat nerd.

382
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:50,090
Scott: Yeah But yeah, basically, you know The fundamental thing here is you want you got a show some sort of piece of entertainment, right?

383
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:54,210
Scott: I mean we did do the show with the with the Oda King, right?

384
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,554
Scott: You talked about subtitling.

385
00:24:55,654 --> 00:25:05,910
Scott: a lot did you know and he but he was mostly complaining about the low quality of the fan subs And their method of subtitling and not whether subtitling or dubbing was better or worse.

386
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:09,727
Rym: I mean to do that that we could talk about fan dubbing if we really wanted.

387
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:13,557
Scott: no No, I mean the fundamental issue here right?

388
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:24,716
Scott: is you have some sort of artwork primarily, you know a video game or you know An anime right and you need to translate it so that people who do not speak the language It was originally creating can understand it.

389
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,679
Rym: It's also a problem.

390
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:29,390
Rym: That's very particular to visual moving media.

391
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,222
Rym: I mean, you're not gonna put subtitles on a book.

392
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,210
Rym: You're just gonna translate it in most cases.

393
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:37,690
Scott: Yeah, you know, no one's gonna complain about what was your method of translating the book?

394
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,516
Scott: You know, it was translated.

395
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:40,821
Rym: what I would like that.

396
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:41,685
Rym: I'm actually surprised.

397
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:42,247
Rym: No one does.

398
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,801
Rym: this is Subtitles for audio dramas just timed subtitles.

399
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:49,850
Rym: that are just subtitles that I can watch while I'm listening to an audio drama.

400
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:50,813
Scott: Why?

401
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:55,386
Rym: because there are a lot of audio dramas that are not translated that are actually supposedly good.

402
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,395
Scott: Oh I see what.

403
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:08,036
Scott: yeah, like basically the good listen You could listen to a Japanese audio drama while reading a translation of it because I could print out a translation But without the timing.

404
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,422
Rym: that's actually really hard to do.

405
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:11,170
Scott: Yeah, you have to figure out which line you're on.

406
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,245
Rym: I mean, I've watched anime where I had just a script printed out and I'm watching it.

407
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,673
Rym: Yeah, and that was not Pleasant.

408
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,064
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know the fundamental problem is the other thing.

409
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:21,330
Scott: you might translate it, right?

410
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,678
Scott: But you also in the translation, right?

411
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:27,230
Scott: Do you want how much do you want to be lost in the translation?

412
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:29,613
Scott: right and the Subtitle people?

413
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:31,478
Scott: their main arguments are like look.

414
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,030
Scott: Okay, the subtitle at worst covers up a small part of the artwork, right?

415
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:46,147
Scott: but maybe you can even do a letterbox and get it underneath or something right and Once you know how to read subtitles, it doesn't really distract your eyes from the from the picture at all.

416
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,050
Rym: That's a weird argument.

417
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,806
Rym: I always was amazed by the people who would say that this they couldn't catch up with the subtitle.

418
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,630
Scott: You just can't read.

419
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:53,529
Scott: Yeah, you got to hear not smart.

420
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:58,028
Rym: But then again part of that I was reading an article kind of relatedly a few days ago talking about maybe if

421
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,255
Scott: I problems or Something I don't know

422
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:06,480
Rym: talking about how a lot in most foreign countries subtitles are very very very common just for everyone even little kids even little kids.

423
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,564
Rym: cartoons will often have subtitles in a lot of places because America makes a lot of the media.

424
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:12,389
Rym: that's in the world.

425
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:17,090
Scott: Yeah, but I mean there's plenty of dubs like how many Simpsons Seinfeld dubs have you seen?

426
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,455
Rym: But I'm saying for every dub.

427
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:26,896
Rym: There's a ton of subs and I don't see people complaining about Subtitles in other countries.

428
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,361
Scott: No, it's only in the US.

429
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,330
Scott: I've ever seen people complain that there are subtitles.

430
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,970
Scott: They're never subtitles on the US TV pretty much ever ever.

431
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:41,470
Scott: For like a crazy showing of a foreign film that's on like a weird foreign film, you know channel.

432
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:44,162
Scott: That's for you know, people who like that sort of thing.

433
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:55,710
Rym: Meanwhile, I mean look at us anime fans There was a time when we would watch live-action American like English things like the ratio hornblower and we would turn on the subtitles just because we were used to it.

434
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,889
Scott: Well, it was also because we'd be so loud while watching it So you wouldn't get you would have to pause it and rewind because you didn't hear that ratio.

435
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:09,785
Rym: But I'd always be startled when I didn't see subtitles, but I don't know it's.

436
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,715
Rym: it's weird how Vitreolic it got.

437
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:15,150
Rym: like being in the RIT anime club a very large anime club.

438
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:19,010
Rym: There would be bitter arguments and like lost friendships over this sort of thing.

439
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:33,550
Rym: like the club would always show things subtitled because we had kind of this side reason of the fact that RIT is the NTID the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and the RIT anime club was actually very popular among deaf students because they could just watch the anime.

440
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:39,553
Scott: Yeah, and the thing was is we would always have the subtitles on no matter what because of the deaf Attendance.

441
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:43,788
Rym: however as an aside, you should all know that subtitles and closed captioning are completely different.

442
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,310
Scott: That's correct.

443
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,213
Rym: They're very different things.

444
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:49,650
Rym: closed captioning will also note things like sound effects or noises.

445
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,738
Rym: Yeah, the subtitles do not by default.

446
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,686
Rym: if they do they're not really subtitles anymore.

447
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:54,269
Scott: That's true.

448
00:28:55,151 --> 00:29:02,532
Scott: However, we would always have the subtitles on you know for those people because I don't know how many anime DVDs had full closed captioning On them.

449
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,419
Scott: right, but and that was fine.

450
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,789
Scott: No one complained, you know, the deaf people were satisfied with that.

451
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:16,790
Scott: However You know that sometimes I remember at least two or three incidents We would have the dub with subtitles on because you know the audience for every reason wanted to watch the dub.

452
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,068
Scott: But you know the policy of the club was generally Japanese language with subtitles.

453
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,159
Rym: now I mean my argument.

454
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:27,598
Rym: I mean I was on the eboard I was the president of the club I voted and we debated that sort of thing a lot.

455
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:38,790
Rym: my argument for pretty much always showing subtitles was the one English dubs of Japanese Animation are some of the most god-awful pieces of shit I have ever heard in my life.

456
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,944
Scott: Yeah, I mean not all of them are bad.

457
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:41,910
Scott: There are many good ones.

458
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,710
Scott: However, you can have a discussion about how about which ones they are because there's so few of them, right?

459
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,337
Scott: There's you know, the cowboy bebop.

460
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:49,538
Scott: Yep.

461
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:54,038
Scott: Some of the Disney Miyazakis are pretty good I'll sing had a surprisingly good dub.

462
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,890
Scott: some people like the ghost in the shell stand a little complex ones.

463
00:29:56,972 --> 00:30:02,570
Scott: Okay, you know There are a lot of people who have a lot of nostalgia for like you get all the way down to hi I'm Fasha Stampede.

464
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,830
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's some people have a lot of nostalgia.

465
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,345
Rym: The worst dub ever to this day is Armitage the third poly matrix with Kiefer Sutherland.

466
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:12,052
Scott: No, you forgot about He.

467
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:22,094
Rym: literally a girl is like being shot and falling off of a cliff and on the screen the characters like Desperately jumping and reaching for and Kiefer Sutherland says no No, you got it.

468
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,663
Scott: What about the the gassaraki?

469
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,030
Rym: Oh my god that one extra.

470
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:32,229
Rym: The thing is the rest of the dub was actually pretty good It was alright, and there's that one guy who is like what's the matter you shiro?

471
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,990
Rym: Yeah, remember, of course What's funny too is a lot of the older dubs and it's not just nostalgia.

472
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,790
Rym: A lot of people say oh you just think the older dubs are better because that's what you grew up watching.

473
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:49,950
Rym: The older dubs were a lot freer and looser with the translation and as a result the acting I think was a lot better.

474
00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:57,270
Scott: Yeah, the acting you know in many of them was was more and it was better in ways Actually worked pretty well.

475
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:02,330
Scott: Yeah, there was a lot less stiffness and other sorts of acting related problems.

476
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:14,110
Scott: But I dub is hilarious, but in terms of you know purity to the original work, you know They had some serious issues, you know, pretty much most of well I mean there are some dubs that don't have such issues.

477
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:26,245
Scott: But is that the older dubs definitely had those issues and part of the one thing that made your contributor is the insistence on not Only translating but sticking to you know making everything match the moving lips of the characters really

478
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,129
Rym: funny when you because

479
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,000
Scott: the Japanese people don't even try to do that in the original.

480
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:34,236
Rym: Yeah, you watch the original and nothing matches up at all I mean, there's no relation.

481
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:37,005
Scott: Yeah, the Japanese the original audio track didn't match.

482
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,470
Scott: So why should the dub match?

483
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:49,050
Scott: Why should even matter, you know, I mean obviously if saying it in English Completely translated is gonna take ten times as long or a fraction of the time You still the time is still an issue, right?

484
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,933
Scott: Like if you translate.

485
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:58,737
Scott: if someone says like, you know a word in Japanese and that somehow I don't know You know that translates to a sentence in English It's gonna be problematic or vice versa.

486
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:09,610
Scott: right if something's a big sentence in Japanese and you can just translate it to you know Fuck you or something like that That's a problem, but you don't have to match the actual syllables, you know.

487
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,270
Scott: You just have to make sure it's the right length of time in there.

488
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,770
Rym: Well, I remember this one time at RIT anime when we switched the dub on cowboy bebop.

489
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:22,432
Rym: She watched the sub most of the way through and the club was like, hey the dub here is actually really good You want to.

490
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:27,152
Scott: well, there's a particular episode that you have to watch the mushroom Mushroom.

491
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:36,390
Rym: Yeah, so we watched that episode dub and then we just left the dub on yep And actually some people walked out like people walked out of that showing once the dub was turned on.

492
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,113
Scott: I don't remember that.

493
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,237
Rym: remember a hoagie.

494
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:38,980
Rym: Steve walked out.

495
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:39,582
Rym: I don't remember.

496
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,048
Rym: He got super pissed when we changed it.

497
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:45,506
Rym: We voted yeah, and him the whole room voted and a few other people I could name.

498
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:48,962
Rym: they all walked out and They were mad about it.

499
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:50,030
Rym: They were mad that we switched.

500
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,894
Scott: I don't remember them.

501
00:32:51,095 --> 00:33:03,188
Rym: anyone walking out perfectly Bible dub and One of them his sighted reason and he grumbled about it for a while Loudly before he just left was that during the the beta mags VCR episode of the VHS in the beta.

502
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:13,322
Rym: Mm-hmm There's this one scene where the guy who has the VCR is going on this long rant about technology that no one cares about like Well back in the day beta was this bla bla bla bla.

503
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,830
Rym: She's like this long rant and it's funny.

504
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:25,969
Rym: the subtitles did not match what the guy was saying in the dub and This fanboy was like see see the dub is way off from the subtitles.

505
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:26,290
Rym: the dub.

506
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,336
Rym: Oh, you're accurate.

507
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:29,930
Scott: You're assuming that the subtitle is correct also.

508
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:36,470
Rym: Yeah, the subtitles were also way off because it was a translation of something that it didn't even matter what the guy was saying.

509
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,720
Rym: Yeah, I guess what bothered me.

510
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:46,910
Scott: that is the thing is if you don't know the original language There's sort of this assumption that the subtitle be you know is a is a the best translation, right?

511
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,682
Scott: You just assume that because it's it has this authoritarian.

512
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:51,430
Scott: It's just it's in a position of authority.

513
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:58,070
Scott: So if a dub doesn't match it that the assumption is that the dub is wrong more wrong than the subtitle always.

514
00:33:58,312 --> 00:33:59,742
Scott: Yep, but you know, it could just be.

515
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:10,030
Scott: they're two different translations of the same thing and They're both equally off in different directions and you have to look at each case Individually and you have to know the original language to make a judgment call.

516
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,994
Rym: But that's what bothers me.

517
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:16,679
Rym: almost every bitch like intelligent people can argue the merits of both Intelligently and come to a conclusion.

518
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:28,803
Rym: I have my preferences I can articulate them I can understand other people's preferences, but the fanboys on both sides would Basically be wrong about the technical aspects of translation.

519
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:38,784
Scott: They didn't know Japanese usually and They would basically just argue from this position if you know Japanese you don't care if it's dub or so as you can just do either way.

520
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:53,489
Rym: my stance though, is that When in doubt unless you have a reason to watch the dub like for example If you're doing something else and you're watching the anime casually the dubs fine But if you actually want to see the real show you should watch the subs.

521
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:59,048
Rym: But I think the dub is better for someone who does not watch a lot of like.

522
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:02,290
Rym: if it's anime Who doesn't watch a lot of anime in Japanese?

523
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,154
Rym: They don't like.

524
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,278
Rym: get the language like.

525
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,708
Rym: I don't understand Japanese that well at all me.

526
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,476
Scott: Hey there but why?

527
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:22,842
Rym: having watched anime for the last 20 years I Can understand the inflection like if I hear Japanese being spoken and I see a translation that is accurate next to it I understand all the emotion you can kind of feel it.

528
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:32,550
Rym: you understand all these kind of subtle aspects of the language even without understanding the individual words and Dubs translate that better for someone who is not familiar with the Japanese language.

529
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:43,421
Scott: well if they're if they're done well right and I think that pretty much means that you shouldn't start someone who's never watched anime before who might be a fan of it is Coming into it shouldn't watch a bad show right.

530
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:48,362
Scott: and if if they if you know if they're gonna start with a dub I mean we started with dubs right on TV.

531
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:49,790
Scott: They didn't start with no subs.

532
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,978
Rym: Yeah, vampire hunter D.

533
00:35:51,038 --> 00:36:02,070
Scott: Kashawn robot hunter project echo You got to watch something where you know that if the dub is not good Then if they're going to watch a dub show no matter what then that's not a good show.

534
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:03,389
Scott: They have to watch something different.

535
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:10,570
Rym: Well, the trouble is what I run into is there were a lot of people who weren't anime fans So I would try to get into the anime and I didn't want to show them dubs.

536
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,650
Rym: This was like high school and middle school because the dubs were god-awful and I could even tell they were god-awful.

537
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:27,671
Rym: Yep, because and think of this if you say you hear a show on in the other room You can always tell if it's an American anime dub versus any other kind of show just by listening to it For

538
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,024
Scott: like a second just based on the way the people talk.

539
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:33,498
Scott: because they don't you know They're not talking the same way regular people talk.

540
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:36,990
Rym: They're not talking the way voice actors and anything but anime talk.

541
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:37,752
Scott: Yeah, right.

542
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:39,238
Scott: Well video games also.

543
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,281
Rym: video games are just as bad.

544
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:47,850
Rym: That's a bad, you know, you're right, but Basically everyone I tried to show anime to I couldn't show him the dubs because the dubs were terrible.

545
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:52,390
Rym: And if I tried to show him a sub they'd say the fuck are these subtitles and they refused to watch.

546
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:53,780
Scott: Yeah, that's that's the thing.

547
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,170
Scott: It's like you got both sides, right?

548
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,074
Scott: There's the fanboy.

549
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,018
Scott: who's such a fanboy?

550
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,010
Scott: he refused to watch a dub and he's stupid for his own reasons.

551
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,964
Scott: But then the person who says I refuse to watch this, you know subtitles.

552
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:06,938
Scott: They're stupid for their own reasons You know, it's like you got these.

553
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,590
Scott: it's stupid versus stupid.

554
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:14,855
Scott: And the truth is is that you should probably watch subtitles most of the time But it does not.

555
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:15,758
Scott: all dubs are bad.

556
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:16,762
Scott: There are good dubs.

557
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:17,605
Scott: They exist.

558
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:19,110
Scott: They're not gonna kill anybody.

559
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,290
Scott: Right, there's reasons for them to exist.

560
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:34,289
Rym: For example a show that is very like certain kinds of shows probably would be better served by a well-done dub Because the well-done dub is more natural to anyone who isn't fluent in the language.

561
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,300
Rym: However, there are almost no well-done dubs.

562
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:46,681
Rym: So it's kind of like arguing about whether or not unicorns are blue or red Or the size of Gandalf's dick, I just can't seven inches.

563
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:51,202
Rym: I cannot express to you how Crazy this argument used to be.

564
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,211
Rym: you young anime fans have no idea Like I wish.

565
00:37:53,472 --> 00:38:04,994
Rym: I wish I could just take like go back in time and film like RIT anime in the year 2000 1999 oh my god, like it was fierce But to this day.

566
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:13,010
Rym: like look at conventions and all the people still fight about it But only the fanboys fight about it because not that many people watch anime at conventions anymore.

567
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:13,612
Rym: I think that's.

568
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:18,792
Rym: part of the reason why it's not an issue is that the culture is not a culture of watching collectively.

569
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:26,449
Rym: it's a culture of watching your fans subs on your own watch your country roll on your own and Then if you get together you get together at a con and just hang out.

570
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:32,241
Scott: Yeah I do think that it's sort of like, you know There's a good part and a bad part to the fact that you know the.

571
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:37,158
Scott: because of the collapse of the anime industry There's not that much dubbing going on as it used to be.

572
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:45,710
Scott: only the few animes that get on DVD are dubbed and even now You know, there's been more recently some subtitle only DVD releases towards the at least towards the end days.

573
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:50,450
Rym: Guarantee of a dub is if it's gonna be on TV right or they're trying to get it on TV.

574
00:38:50,992 --> 00:39:01,375
Scott: but in most of the all the animes that are on crunchyroll and Streaming on the funimation in the anime news network and fan subbed and all these shows right are pretty much Subtitle only.

575
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:18,069
Scott: and I think this is good in a way Because the car the modern anime fans are watching shows now or going back to watch old shows Right are getting you know, the better truer subtitled Experience and there's no weird bad dubs to turn them off or anything like that.

576
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:25,790
Scott: You know, so the people who are watching anime now I think you're getting a better appreciation for anime and the Japanese language and these sorts of things.

577
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,065
Scott: however, I think it's actually it's sort of like.

578
00:39:29,145 --> 00:39:32,001
Scott: it's sort of like a Closing the door, right?

579
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,450
Scott: It's like anime went downhill.

580
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:38,830
Scott: So now it's subtitled only and now anime can't go back uphill because there's no dubs to get new people.

581
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,605
Rym: At the same time so many people won't watch some.

582
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:45,047
Rym: among youth culture I found just looking around more and more.

583
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:50,707
Rym: Is that references to anime are just a general understanding of knowing what Naruto is like?

584
00:39:50,747 --> 00:40:02,298
Rym: this kind of It's very widely known among young kids you know if they don't watch a lot of anime almost every punk kid you ever run into has seen some anime knows what it Is and treats it just like they'd create any other TV.

585
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:08,529
Rym: in a way the anime fans that were trying so hard to make anime regular basically mainstream.

586
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:22,050
Rym: One in that as anime became more and more accepted and more and more mainstream the culture around it disappeared because There's very little real culture except for the hardcore people around the Simpsons in America.

587
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:25,579
Rym: I mean, you know, that's that hardcore Simpsons fanboy.

588
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,121
Rym: They exist.

589
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,745
Rym: Most people just watch the Simpsons.

590
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,450
Rym: They're not gonna go to a Simpsons convention.

591
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,498
Scott: Yeah only the super hardcore people are gonna go to a Simpsons convention.

592
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:36,734
Rym: but people who know about TV might go to a TV convention cuz.

593
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,200
Rym: oh, yeah, they go to the Simpsons there.

594
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,510
Scott: I'll go see that and there might be some Simpsons action there.

595
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:41,950
Scott: Yeah at a TV convention.

596
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:52,869
Rym: But I think anime cons have gone down the same road and I think this is part of the reason why the dub sub debate Has disappeared because the collective watching of anime is no more popular now than the collective watching of TV.

597
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:55,357
Rym: Yeah, you watched anime the same way.

598
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:59,129
Rym: you watch TV mostly alone maybe with one person on your computer.

599
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:11,759
Scott: Yeah But yeah, I mean, you know there there are issues in terms of the quality of subtitling but we discussed that in Don't watch crappy fans with the Oda King right back in the day.

600
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:18,861
Scott: Yeah, you know, and there's also the issues of What's it called with two different kinds of translations?

601
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:21,229
Scott: Well, no, we talked about that also with the Oda King.

602
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:22,737
Scott: Oh, what do you got?

603
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:23,320
Rym: What do you get?

604
00:41:23,622 --> 00:41:23,903
Rym: Nothing?

605
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:24,447
Rym: Nothing?

606
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:25,010
Rym: You got nothing?

607
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:30,530
Scott: Right like sometimes right like on the the the Gundam the Z Gundam.

608
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:38,790
Scott: Right, the subtitles are just like all busted and you know, they fixed them on the other disc, right?

609
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,793
Scott: So it's like a mother, you know You some.

610
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:45,226
Scott: just cuz it's subtitles right doesn't mean that it's good either.

611
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:54,050
Scott: There are plenty of bad Subtitles out there, you know a lot of people to sort of take for granted The subtitles are right and good or whatever, but that is not always the case.

612
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:59,090
Scott: So, you know and especially in the olden days if there were bad subtitles, right?

613
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,285
Scott: You paid more for that VHS with subtitles than the dub one than the dub VHS.

614
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:04,750
Scott: You would be hella pissed off.

615
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:10,448
Rym: Yeah It is interesting that the subtitled ones were more expensive because there was less demand for them.

616
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,135
Scott: yet They were cheaper to make.

617
00:42:12,235 --> 00:42:24,460
Rym: yet at the same time anime fanboys by and large preferred subtitles Yeah Which meant that a lot of non anime hardcore fanboys were buying anime back when it was 30 bucks a tape Four episodes.

618
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:30,790
Scott: Well, maybe two episodes But some of the thing is a lot of the VHS tapes most of the sales were to like blockbusters.

619
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,075
Scott: Yeah, so and a lot of those things were so it were you know That were released early on.

620
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:38,510
Scott: VHS were mega popular things like Akira that everyone and their mother would buy.

621
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,690
Rym: Yeah, the anime section of blockbuster when I was a kid was bigger than the anime section of blockbuster when I was in college.

622
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:52,970
Scott: the Akira dub VHS definitely sold way way more than this the rare subtitle VHS even though I've seen that subtitle VHS plenty.

623
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,760
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
