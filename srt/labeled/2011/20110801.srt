Scott: So I'm like whatever recruiters you happen to call me while I'm not I'm waiting for him to show up and I have nothing better To do.

48
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:24,124
Scott: I'll talk to you because you had the balls to call me on the phone instead of just emailing the last recruiter I talked to.

Scott: They really want to get you in because it's basically it's impossible to hire tech people But they're paying you nothing like rare rare skills like you.

61
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,320

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,402
Scott: You're ready.

72
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:49,187
Scott: question number one.

73
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,979
Scott: What phones do the big ups have?

74
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:52,884
Rym: I actually don't know.

75
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:58,972
Rym: but but they asked me what phone I had because they were gonna give me a company phone and it felt Like the Nexus and everyone's like, oh you don't need our phone.

76
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,947
Scott: Okay, dude What computers do they have on their desk?

77
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,292
Rym: Everyone has a different computer.

78
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:09,305
Rym: One guy has a super fast Mac bunch of the tower, uh Or a MacBook Pro.

79
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,933
Rym: one has a MacBook Pro one is a tower.

80
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,240
Scott: Well, someone is the Mac Pro tower.

Rym: Okay, also people like.

82
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:17,055
Rym: the first computer they gave me before I got the Windows box was just Ubuntu.

83
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,964
Scott: Okay, they took There's already an Ubuntu in the house.

84
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,108
Scott: Yeah, that's a good sign.

85
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,860
Scott: Okay question number three is the most important.

86
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,525
Scott: Uh-oh, what kind of bikes are they riding?

87
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,953
Rym: Ah, actually he's got one of those commuter bikes.

88
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:30,340
Scott: Oh the the foldy day on thing.

89
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,863
Scott: Okay, okay That's a very CEO.

90
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:37,720
Rym: the thing is they know real bikes and they're all super athletic which counts for a lot actually.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,931
Scott: Yeah, but the question, you know if it was?

92
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,884
Rym: I'm tired of working with Eunuch Santas much.

93
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:42,887
Rym: I love Eunuch Santas.

94
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,433
Rym: I like people I can play paintball with.

95
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:47,890
Scott: the thing is in the ideal company All right has to have both.

96
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,300
Scott: you have to have the Eunuch Santa.

97
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:55,839
Scott: Ah, you don't think you can learn if there's nothing if there's no Eunuch in your job If there's no Eunuch, then you got another problem.

98
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:58,628
Rym: Here's the weirdest thing.

99
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:05,580
Rym: this is the first time in my life I have had a job where my job does not in any way involve straight-up support.

100
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,868
Scott: But I mean your company uses Eunuch's machines.

101
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,093
Scott: They're all your servers.

102
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,080
Rym: Well, yeah, there's stuff but I don't have to manage that.

103
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,130
Rym: I'm actually kind of divorced from that.

104
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,060
Rym: let like operational tech, right?

105
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:27,409
Scott: but the point is You got to have Eunuch Santas and Steve Jobs is combined right because while lately I'm been a lot of you know a lot of my rants and Technical opinions have been very anti jobs.

106
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,620
Scott: You got to remember that the jobs is also necessary.

107
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,390
Rym: Well, let's put it this way the jobs made for whatever you feel about Apple some of the best goddamn user interfaces The world has ever seen.

108
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,520
Scott: Yes, um, not.

109
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:40,988
Scott: But look, you know.

110
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:47,680
Scott: take for example my favorite example I always bring up in this discussion is the Apple to GS the most beautiful computer ever created.

111
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,063
Rym: That's Eunuch Santa.

112
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:51,249
Scott: Why was the Apple to GS created?

113
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,540
Scott: is because it was a combination of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs.

114
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,155
Scott: God, we just had the Wozniak.

115
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:03,114
Scott: without the jobs The Apple to GS would have been like all sorts of wicked ugly.

116
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,020
Scott: if you just had the jobs You wouldn't have been able to open it.

117
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,484
Scott: It would have been welded shut right.

118
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:15,309
Scott: but because you had both you had this perfect computer that opened up just once and it was Completely flat and all the slots were in a row.

119
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,954
Scott: It was the ultimate combination.

120
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,480
Rym: I feel like there's a third way.

121
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:19,470
Rym: There's a third way.

122
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,740
Rym: There's actually a triangle Eunuch Santa Steve Jobs and the other direction is Tim Berners-Lee.

123
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:34,842
Rym: idealized software solutions Functional Requirements with no interface or thought for practicality Right.

124
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:38,193
Scott: So speaking of Steve Jobs, right you you got a new HDVC.

125
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:39,016
Rym: I did.

126
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,120
Rym: I have not that exciting.

127
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,370
Rym: I've not plugged it into my TV yet just cuz I've been busy.

128
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,736
Rym: But yeah, it's.

129
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,680
Scott: it works though, right?

130
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,309
Rym: Yeah, you know what my whole life.

131
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,536
Rym: ever since I switched away from AMD I got to say I've never had a failure to post on the first boot.

132
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:57,560
Rym: In fact, I Closed the case and put all the screws in before I turned it on for the first time.

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,931
Rym: That is how fucking confident I was and it were.

134
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,760
Scott: you were right, dude, my old AMD boxes.

135
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,760
Rym: I would like plug power into the motherboard with CPU and RAM sitting on the floor and turn it on to make sure it worked.

136
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,285
Scott: Can't go wrong with Nvidia Intel.

137
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:13,260
Scott: Anyway, the so you didn't need the Mac Mini anymore now.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,830
Scott: So I said hey Mac Mini you have been you.

139
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,195
Scott: you have served your many years.

140
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,380
Scott: It's actually many years old.

141
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,427
Rym: It was like it was a core solo.

142
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:20,968
Rym: is the you?

143
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:24,299
Scott: do you remember that you originally bought it to replace my normal PC?

144
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,780
Scott: He uses your normal PC and it was in the earliest days of gig night.

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,966
Rym: You may remember an episode that was me bitching for an hour because I unplugged my old computer Which was my old RIT computer.

146
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,371
Rym: It was like a Thunderbird giga.

147
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,535
Scott: So this was probably in 2005 six.

148
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:40,823
Scott: I remember.

149
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:45,280
Rym: there's a picture of me sitting there like holding it up like amazed at how tiny it is and I install it.

150
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,603
Rym: I think was actually six seven, but I set it up and I'm like It still had that old 19 inch CRT.

151
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:54,788
Rym: Yeah, and it was so shiny and so nice.

152
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,411
Rym: and then I opened up Garage band and I was like, let's podcast.

153
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:06,780
Rym: and then four hours later I had plugged my old PC back in it wouldn't boot because it was broken.

154
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,720
Rym: That's the reason I replaced it and I redid an entire episode from scratch.

155
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,940
Rym: There was me bitching about how much I hate the Mac, right?

156
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,184
Scott: So this Mac mini?

157
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,632
Scott: I said well you have lived out your years.

158
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,959
Scott: if we threw you out or just gate sold you or gave You away, that would not be bad.

159
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,280
Scott: But you still work and you're a Mac.

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,286
Scott: You're the only Mac I have.

161
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,780
Scott: that's not a work computer that I can't use for personal things.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,324
Rym: I have some trouble with the optical drive.

163
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:31,776
Scott: Yeah, so I brought it home - I said why not?

164
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,551
Scott: I'll try some Development of iPhone app.

165
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,780
Scott: I'll make the simplest iPhone app.

166
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,270
Scott: That's like just a fucking button or something.

167
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,780
Scott: do the thing just to make an iPhone.

168
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,778
Rym: You notice how that the Apple logo at the top like that's plastic is slightly yellowed.

169
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:51,351
Scott: Yeah Yeah so anyway I brought a home and I really wanted to reinstall the snow leopard to get it back for it to nothing and I couldn't because the optical drive was busted which I remembered.

170
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,040
Rym: It's okay the watch out.

171
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,720
Scott: We switched it to region - you'll have to it doesn't matter because I'm not even gonna use the optical drive.

172
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:03,760
Scott: I went and I used my work Mac to create a snow leopard bootable USB stick which race which worked.

173
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,300
Scott: Amazingly if you search on Google for directions, it'll tell you how it worked perfectly.

174
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,326
Scott: So I reinstall the snow leopard from the USB stick.

175
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,069
Scott: beautiful.

176
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,640
Scott: Then I said, well, let me get the X code.

177
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,567
Scott: So there's a free X code in the App Store.

178
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,475
Scott: X code 4.1 is the newest one.

179
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:19,840
Scott: you need lion.

180
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,128
Scott: Alrighty, what's only 30 bucks?

181
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,513
Scott: Who gives a shit?

182
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,080
Scott: I'll buy your stupid lion.

183
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,170
Scott: You cannot install lion.

184
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,613
Scott: You have a core solo, ha That's so sad which is not 64 bits.

185
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:34,719
Rym: that's so sad.

186
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,928
Scott: Well, then let me go get X code.

187
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:41,940
Scott: cuz you remember there was X code 3 point something which is on the snow leopard disc.

188
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,526
Scott: So I could have just installed that easily.

189
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:51,520
Scott: but before they came up with X code 4.1 There was X code 4.0 Which is the one that they were charging like $10 for in the App Store.

190
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,580
Scott: Remember that when everyone was like, oh they're charging for X code 10 bucks now, it's free again.

191
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,712
Scott: Well, I said well, let me go get that one that they were charging 10 bucks for.

192
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:00,680
Scott: right, but it wasn't in the App Store.

193
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,320
Scott: So I went to the Apple developer site and it wasn't there.

194
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,459
Scott: The only ones they had were 4.1 which which is the one you need lion for and three point something Which is the one I already had on the USB stick.

195
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,586
Scott: So I'm like what happened to 4.0 point whatever.

196
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:18,840
Scott: you need to pay $100 to be in the iOS developer program to get that.

197
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:24,130
Scott: oh my god, and The Iowa you can't even if you you can make.

198
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,440
Scott: if you had lion you could make all the iPhone apps you wanted.

199
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:31,419
Scott: You can't load them onto your iPhone unless you pay the hundred dollars.

200
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,661
Scott: Submit them to the App Store unless you pay $100.

201
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,548
Rym: That sounds about right.

202
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,060
Scott: you can only run them in a little emulator.

203
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:40,898
Scott: And by the way that hundred dollars is a hundred dollars a year not a hundred dollars.

204
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,996
Scott: once It's a hundred dollars a year to be an iOS develop still gonna be an iOS developer.

205
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:45,618
Scott: Fuck.

206
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:55,062
Scott: No Given that Mac mini to the parents to use as an HTTP C and to sync their iPods because right now I watch out It won't full-screen 1080p.

207
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:59,240
Scott: it doesn't matter that my parents they can't even watch Netflix on their TV right now.

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,975
Rym: Do you think they're gonna be okay with control zooming in to YouTube videos like we were?

209
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,560
Scott: they're not gonna watch YouTube videos.

210
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,408
Scott: They're just gonna use like boxy and watch.

211
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:08,493
Scott: we're lucky if they watch.

212
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,180
Scott: use boxy to watch a Netflix.

213
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,991
Scott: All right, that'll be a huge improvement over what they're doing now.

214
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,000
Rym: boxy didn't even work so well on that thing.

215
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,760
Scott: It's better than what they have now at the very least, right?

216
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:29,740
Scott: They don't even have like a. they only have like a Ubuntu on a Dell laptop that they use for everything and all they really do Is use Firefox which is just fine for them, but they have iPods that they can't sync.

217
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,457
Scott: So the very least they can just use it for iTunes and nothing else, which it can definitely do.

218
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:36,452
Scott: Yeah On snow leopard.

219
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,607
Rym: I think in the long run It should probably replace the like.

220
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:42,003
Rym: I don't put it somewhere in their house is like a little PC somewhere I don't know.

221
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,598
Scott: But yeah, I'll just give it to them because now it's useless for me.

222
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,779
Scott: But the thing is I have to go and buy them the little Mac keyboard that goes with it?

223
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,185
Rym: No, yeah, cuz I kept that one.

224
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:56,505
Rym: Yeah, cuz I like the boxy remote, but since I need a mouse anyway When I'm not in boxy.

225
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,872
Scott: Yeah, I've been using boxy more though.

226
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,260
Scott: I've got hooked up to pretty much all the video files.

227
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,847
Scott: So yeah, I don't want to watch any.

228
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:08,199
Scott: the only time I don't use boxy is pretty much to go to College Humor.

229
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,680
Scott: Yep, I got a massacre.

230
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:14,200
Rym: I got to see what it would take to set up like a boxy app thing that would just do College Humor you want to.

231
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,771
Scott: There is a College Humor boxy app, but it only watches College Humor originals.

232
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,820
Scott: It doesn't do all the videos in college humor.

233
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,563
Rym: What the fuck?

234
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:25,015
Scott: Yeah, you can write a boxy app in Python if you want.

235
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,520
Rym: really that's what I was about to ask.

236
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:27,444
Rym: What does it take?

237
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:28,449
Rym: is it easy to do that?

238
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,980
Scott: Because yeah, there's just there's instructions on the boxy website.

239
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,227
Scott: You can just write boxy apps.

240
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:37,748
Scott: It's actually not that hard duly noted You know, you could definitely do it.

241
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:47,700
Rym: your code might be ugly, but you could definitely write a boxy app Because I need a Python project and while I like a web stuff and like I was playing with Django and I really like flask.

242
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,525
Rym: I was playing with that.

243
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:49,310
Rym: That's really fun.

244
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,020
Scott: Actually flask is a lot simpler.

245
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:56,280
Scott: It's well, it's really fun because if I want but the thing is what's gonna happen is you I've used flask a bunch also.

246
00:12:56,488 --> 00:13:07,080
Scott: Yeah You start using it like we and then you want to do something like logging in and it's like you can write a login authentication thing or Django has authentication.

247
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,900
Rym: So What I would use flask for in my professional life in the like operations is something like making a little status page of stuff.

248
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,787
Scott: Absolutely Perfect use of flask.

249
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,939
Rym: Yep, like see what's running on the PC.

250
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,300
Rym: You see anything like that, but it's just fun too.

251
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,040
Scott: Cuz you know you just got to make sure you put the Apache in the WSGI in front of it properly.

252
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:28,965
Scott: Yeah, I'll do that.

253
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,635
Scott: Yeah, I can show you how to do that.

254
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:31,460
Rym: I learned how to do that.

255
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,340
Scott: Okay, cuz I had a lot of free time Because that way you can get things like the Apache offs and but as much no, you know.

256
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,630
Scott: Oh, that's something I gotta tell you.

257
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,899
Scott: I'm not gonna go into this very long.

258
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:45,334
Scott: You know the Apache configs is always like allow deny allow from all all that business.

259
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:45,475
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,285
Scott: Yeah, I mastered that really Yep, it's not that hard.

261
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,952
Scott: I've completely mastered all that.

262
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,920
Scott: I finally know what it all means and can do it perfectly.

263
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,227
Rym: Can you here's here's the love this is.

264
00:13:54,247 --> 00:14:05,760
Rym: this is if you're like a four out of ten in terms of guru mastery of Apache Do you know how to pretty much drop in make Apache authenticate against an active directory like a Windows one?

265
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:06,990
Scott: I already saw the instructions.

266
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:07,756
Rym: Yeah, have you ever done it?

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,284
Scott: I'm just curious.

268
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,150
Scott: No, but I could.

269
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,480
Scott: if I had to do it I could do it in a day.

270
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,454
Rym: Yeah, cuz I did it but it didn't work with Twiki.

271
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:24,760
Scott: and then I gave up what I did Actually at work as I made it so that if you visit a page a site On a virtual host actually it gives you basic off which is you know username password against an HD pass.

272
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,288
Scott: Yeah, but if you're coming from a certain IP No basic off you just get right in.

273
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,514
Scott: so if you're in the office you can just visit the page But if you're outside the office, you got to log in to get.

274
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,320
Rym: I did the same thing.

275
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,420
Rym: I had a thing that would control some fixed sessions on this like fixed gateway.

276
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:41,157
Rym: I wrote right and it had a little like web page in it that would like.

277
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:46,620
Rym: you could like turn Sessions on and off and whatever and I didn't want to put off into it because I didn't care, right?

278
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,900
Scott: So anyway, the long day end of this opening bit is fuck you Steve Jobs.

279
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,366
Scott: You want people to make iOS apps?

280
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:54,460
Scott: You should let people develop them on Windows or whatever.

281
00:14:54,902 --> 00:15:06,013
Scott: I might try this phone gap thing which came out with 1.0 today, which lets you make an app in HTML CSS and JavaScript that will then work on Android iPhone Windows phone and fucking everything.

282
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,219
Scott: Yeah, so I'm gonna try that out.

283
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,259
Rym: I thought oh we should make a nice app and I was like what the fuck would it do?

284
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:11,445
Scott: Nothing.

285
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:19,926
Scott: Yeah, if you want a GeekNights app What you can do is you can use your Twitter and soon your Facebook app on whatever device you have and just go to Us in Twitter or Facebook.

286
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,671
Scott: That's basically the equivalent of the app.

287
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:26,037
Scott: is you'll get all the notifications about all our new shit Yep, and our I'll save for the meta.

288
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,947
Scott: I got some Com in your mobile browsing.

289
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:34,120
Rym: Let's talk about some tech because there was a. I had some other news I wanted to talk about but I noticed this article today.

290
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:39,680
Rym: It's funny having a job where it's really knowledge based and not operational at all.

291
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,328
Rym: And also, you know learning a lot.

292
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,404
Rym: I didn't look at the internet like once the whole time I was at work.

293
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,360
Scott: Well, you never look at the internet on your first day.

294
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,987
Rym: You know what warning sign that hospital.

295
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,360
Rym: two hours looking at FARC because no one would like meet with me to tell me what to do.

296
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:57,795
Scott: So even you didn't even have a full day of HR papers to fill out.

297
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:01,347
Rym: now actually today Five minutes of HR because it's an LLC.

298
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:05,538
Rym: No, so it's like BAM nice plus, you know, I'm older now.

299
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,845
Rym: I'm smarter I know what to expect.

300
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,611
Rym: so I came in with my passport.

301
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,377
Rym: I canceled check, you know all the stuff.

302
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,104
Rym: Mm-hmm I didn't do that.

303
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,691
Rym: You know the last time I took a job.

304
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:15,997
Scott: I always forget the cancel check.

305
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:16,680
Scott: That's the one I forget.

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,526
Rym: Yeah, I remember it cuz I changed jobs.

307
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,893
Rym: This is you know, you change jobs a while ago.

308
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,060
Rym: I hadn't changed jobs like four years.

309
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,118
Rym: I was waiting for this day.

310
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:28,473
Scott: You remembered it better because it was longer ago.

311
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:28,573
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,920
Rym: Well, I thought back.

313
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,457
Rym: I was like what went wrong the last time I got a job.

314
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:36,032
Rym: the problems I had were I didn't know anyone's phone numbers for like the beneficiary stuff.

315
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,940
Rym: I didn't even know my mom's address.

316
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,743
Rym: I'd go like look it up.

317
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,532
Scott: I always need my mom the beneficiary Social Security numbers.

318
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:52,006
Rym: Yeah, I didn't need that yet because well Anyway, anyway, yeah, but so there's this article from today about some CMU researchers Carnegie Mellon, by the way Which is yeah, we know what that is.

319
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,156
Scott: I'm some people might not almost went there.

320
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:54,960
Rym: I run into people.

321
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,665
Rym: I'm like RIT.

322
00:16:55,705 --> 00:17:06,792
Rym: They're like, yeah RPI like no RIT RPI sucks but CMU is a good school and they uh, they came up with a pretty.

323
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,452
Rym: this is one of those things like hey let's see if we can do it.

324
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:18,185
Rym: and The fact that what they did as quickly and kind of half acidly hackishly as they did worked as well as it did is Kinda it's not

325
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:18,828
Scott: scary to me

326
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:28,240
Rym: cuz I knew but it might be scary to your mom with crappy off-the-shelf webcams and Fairly simple data mining of like Facebook.

327
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:36,079
Rym: Okay, they were able to make a system where if you point a webcam at a crowd and it sees people's faces It'll find their Social Security numbers.

328
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:50,800
Scott: Yeah, that could work because you get the face you match the face up with Facebook You get profile information get the name address whatever and then you look you basically get as much information as you can Start a really good or starting with flicker or Picasa.

329
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:55,058
Scott: They just did Facebook apparently to start and then you just you start with just Facebook here.

330
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:55,620
Rym: No, here's the thing.

331
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,975
Scott: Here's the kicker and you just cross reference and if enough things match you can.

332
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:07,780
Scott: just on different sites You go to you can just keep filling out the profile until eventually You hit a site that has social security number and you've now you've got the whole profile granted.

333
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,265
Rym: That site is breaking the law.

334
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:13,640
Rym: Well, duh, but here's the kicker that the thing that made this probably a lot easier.

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:22,320
Rym: I didn't go into the depth of how they did it like on the low level but to this day Four digits of my social security number are in all my old RIT shit.

336
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,355
Scott: Yeah you lot of times you could you could eat if you.

337
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:31,232
Scott: I Imagine that like if they could get 80% of the real full numbers They could definitely get 99% of the last four digits.

338
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:37,739
Rym: and here's the funniest part 60% of the students that they caught Didn't have Social Security numbers.

339
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:43,700
Rym: So the it was crazy successful despite the fact that the majority of the people they were testing did not even have them.

340
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,869
Rym: So it got some crazy percentage of the people who did.

341
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:47,631
Rym: Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,313
Rym: So what this illustrates is Something we talked about earlier.

343
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,260
Rym: We have talked about a lot.

344
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,780
Rym: I think we've talked about it recently that there's a lot of publicly available but difficult to get information.

345
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:03,137
Rym: Like if you really want to stalk one person, this is what P eyes used to do.

346
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:06,240
Rym: a private investigator Just gets publicly available information.

347
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:09,180
Rym: It's not a crime to stand on the sidewalk and look at someone's house.

348
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,924
Rym: Not a crime.

349
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,630
Rym: just follow someone unobtrusively.

350
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,300
Rym: not a crime to take a picture of stuff in public places.

351
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,719
Rym: Go to public records freedom information act stuff.

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,709
Rym: Technology allows you to do that to everyone all the time at zero cost.

353
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,311
Scott: Yep.

354
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:25,520
Scott: Oh really almost zero cost effective negligible cost.

355
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,295
Rym: Yes couple this with the fact that there's well negligible cost per person.

356
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:33,691
Scott: to actually do it to everyone at once You do need to buy a bunch of computers.

357
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:38,340
Scott: your house per person will be zero But the cost of a rack will be like a thousand couple thousand a month.

358
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,214
Scott: Well, I think it is Google.

359
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:44,960
Rym: this is you know A lot of people are afraid of Google Maps and Google Street View and that's the least of your worries.

360
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:48,053
Rym: I don't think Google should even be blurring out faces or anything.

361
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,860
Scott: I don't understand the license plate thing.

362
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,471
Scott: That's always really confuses me.

363
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:55,487
Rym: Yeah, but that aside All Google did was economy of scale.

364
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:59,300
Rym: it had people basically do the equivalent of walk around and take a picture of everything.

365
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,353
Scott: Yeah, and they're actually.

366
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,460
Scott: I wish they would do that.

367
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:09,630
Scott: I heard that a while ago like months and months ago that they were gonna go into stores and take pictures in the stores If the stores let them.

368
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,860
Rym: that would be so awesome, right?

369
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,985
Scott: But I haven't actually seen that on any street views yet So I'm still been waiting for.

370
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:19,302
Scott: the like announced that they've added that like if I could go and look in the bodega to see If they have.

371
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,270
Rym: you know, dude, I'd go one step further.

372
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,500
Rym: Here's a way for Google to actually make some money.

373
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:36,217
Rym: Yeah, like a product what they could sell is a service where if you have an event like a convention You can pay them to send someone Probably just someone they hire like a contractor who uses their technology who goes into the event.

374
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:47,634
Rym: for you know Repeatedly walking around gathering like these gigantic panoramas of your entire event like Otakon Imagine a navigable street view map of the interior of Otakon at like noon.

375
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,239
Rym: Okay, that would be awesome.

376
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:51,383
Rym: But anyway,

377
00:20:51,463 --> 00:21:16,010
Scott: or like if they could temporarily update something on Google Maps like embed a map of your convention that weekend and then when the conventions over remove it or like Temporarily if you're having a concert at a football stadium, which means the seating chart is gonna change temporarily Embed the seating chart into Google Maps on the stadium for that weekend during the concert and then when the concerts over Switch the seat map back to the original football playing seat.

378
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,494
Rym: couple that even further.

379
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:32,660
Rym: you couldn't use GPS for this obviously but you could use either a creatively named access points that were set up ahead of time by Google or Some other like similar technology to make a local only Location system doesn't even have to be that precise.

380
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:38,679
Rym: That gives you a map of the convention and a you are hair in the convention Even though it's in some ungodly bunker like the Javits.

381
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:42,090
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so so I got a news.

382
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,796
Rym: I got to finish my point here.

383
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:57,339
Rym: I often Explain to people who don't understand technology that they cannot have privacy because even if we make laws to protect them Hackers can trivially aggregate extent information that cannot by law be easily hidden.

384
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,974
Scott: and If you did hide all the information you'd basically wouldn't be.

385
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,140
Scott: you might as well not use computers.

386
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,420
Rym: Yep, you'd have too much like there'd be no more freedom of speech.

387
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Rym: Imagine if you couldn't tell another person that you saw a certain person on the street wearing a red cap.

388
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,425
Rym: That's all Google does.

389
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,539
Rym: Joe was wearing a red cap and he was standing in front of scandals.

390
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,772
Rym: I Always try to tell people you can't get it.

391
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:21,557
Rym: You can't get it.

392
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:21,999
Rym: give up.

393
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:28,080
Rym: You know, we've got to manage privacy before it's too late, but we can't keep privacy as we currently know it.

394
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:29,304
Rym: No one believes me.

395
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:35,979
Rym: if you ever run into an old person who doesn't believe that you can just aggregate information like this show them This article and scare the crap out of them.

396
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,599
Scott: They'll just get more scared and do more reactionary stupidity Maybe.

397
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,547
Scott: Anyway, so Adobe did something today.

398
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:51,131
Scott: that so be slightly impressed me if that that's possible, you know, I Render don't you get a complaint about your premiere codec?

399
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,260
Rym: I'm gonna one more me from like one complaint.

400
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:57,538
Rym: You know, I recently put up an hour-long panel game mechanics and mechanism today.

401
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:59,530
Scott: It wasn't that bad, but I have.

402
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,999
Scott: I keep saying right all the yeah.

403
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:09,032
Rym: Whenever I'm talking I'm like scooting back and forth like scoot to the light But we're good forward to back a worse problem than scooting.

404
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:10,939
Scott: is me going right, right, right, right.

405
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,947
Scott: Yeah, I gotta I gotta work on the right.

406
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:16,180
Rym: Well, what I do is when you're talking I keep touching my nose.

407
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,918
Scott: That's why I keep zooming in on your nose that you're touching.

408
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:20,340
Rym: I don't know.

409
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,692
Rym: I just keep like poking at it pushing my glasses around.

410
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:23,818
Scott: Oh, you got glasses.

411
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:26,048
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's a situation and I think it's cuz.

412
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,500
Rym: I used to always fiddle with my mustache, but there's no mustache there.

413
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,833
Scott: So I got a fiddle with someone's got to invent something about something for glasses.

414
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:32,476
Scott: That's different.

415
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:33,540
Scott: in the nose area.

416
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:34,483
Scott: I don't know what.

417
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:35,627
Scott: lazy.

418
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,537
Scott: I guess they already have pads of gelatin, right lazy.

419
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,280
Scott: I mean, how could you do?

420
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,156
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so Adobe they came out with a beta of this product called edge.

421
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:48,827
Scott: It's totally free and Actually, it's pretty fascinating.

422
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,758
Scott: I opened it up didn't know how to use it and just started using it.

423
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,062
Scott: alright, and What?

424
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:58,151
Scott: it is an animation tool and you know It does sort of like that in-betweening that flash does.

425
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,040
Scott: so you go to time you go to the timeline.

426
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,248
Scott: You said it's zero seconds.

427
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:12,000
Scott: You put something in the top left corner You go to five seconds You move it to the bottom right corner and then you press play and it'll show you it's Sliding from the top left corner to the bottom right corner over the course of the five seconds, right?

428
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,228
Scott: Beautiful easy to use animation tool totally awesome.

429
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,717
Rym: That'll actually really useful for making content for panels.

430
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:22,465
Scott: Well, actually It can only at the present time.

431
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,153
Scott: It can only do rectangles rounded rectangles and text.

432
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,760
Rym: Ah, okay, which is like wait a minute.

433
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,906
Rym: You know what this reminds me of.

434
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,172
Rym: I'm gonna take you way back.

435
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,780
Scott: It's a free beta that only works for hundred.

436
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,340
Rym: No what I'm saying, you know, there's flash and shockwave and all this stuff.

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:48,009
Rym: Way back when I bought a ball time meat while my parents bought a multi media PC It came with a product called Macro media remember macro media and action.

438
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,154
Rym: Okay, you know that was this.

439
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:50,996
Scott: No, it wasn't.

440
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,540
Rym: it could do things like this.

441
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Scott: No, you're not you're not finishing cuz flash can do all this animation stuff.

442
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:02,220
Scott: But what this does specifically is not so much about the animation stuff that it does which flash already does.

443
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:04,086
Scott: It is about its export.

444
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,955
Scott: It only exports to HTML 5.

445
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,969
Scott: Oh That's all it does.

446
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,040
Scott: So you go you can save it as HTML 5.

447
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,806
Scott: It gives you CSS JS and a div and you put that div in a web page with those CSS and JS Included and there's your animation.

448
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,054
Scott: Oh, they added support for audio.

449
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:21,676
Scott: you could.

450
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:22,880
Scott: and vector arts.

451
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:26,938
Scott: You could make a homestar runner and you'd be all set, but I don't think it does.

452
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:28,676
Scott: vector arts I don't think they plan to do that.

453
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:32,834
Scott: So I think what it's gonna end up being is just text and boxes and images.

454
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:35,362
Scott: So you basically would make Webpages.

455
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:37,706
Rym: I have a feeling it'll go a little bit beyond that they're gonna.

456
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:44,912
Scott: it's gonna be web pages with animations in them That are all smooth and fancy as of right now, but pretty chill.

457
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,056
Scott: It's it's actually.

458
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:47,460
Scott: the user interface was really good.

459
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,445
Scott: It didn't crash.

460
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,060
Scott: It was actually pretty fast for Mac and PC.

461
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:51,888
Scott: It's free for 150 days.

462
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,491
Scott: Some of the stuff is one of these.

463
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:58,802
Scott: I looked at all the CSS and JS files It makes.

464
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:02,676
Scott: so the files that it makes that are part of your project have no license.

465
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,659
Scott: So I assume you own them.

466
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:14,095
Scott: It does have two jQuery files those are open source and two JS files of one of which is BSD licensed and one of which you were free to distribute but not to modify.

467
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:18,976
Scott: so so one of the JS files is BSD and one of them was there.

468
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,207
Scott: but it's like It's produced.

469
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:28,258
Scott: It's a Adobe product that outputs something Almost entirely open source as opposed to some locked up SW.

470
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:28,720
Scott: What the hell?

471
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,066
Rym: They must have gotten like a really good intern or something the fuck.

472
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:34,763
Scott: They're smoking and it works and it does animate.

473
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:35,825
Scott: so this is it's free for 150 days.

474
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:43,111
Scott: get it now and Maybe make something awesome with it before it becomes $500.

475
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,518
Rym: so Adobe when you get a support video formats in premiere.

476
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,841
Scott: Yeah, when these Let's move on.

477
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,948
Rym: so things of the day.

478
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,909
Rym: What do you got for me Scott?

479
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,030
Scott: It's a really good video.

480
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,010
Scott: You know the those old videos like let's go out to the whatever.

481
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,848
Scott: And it was you know, they're like dancing popcorn and the dancing.

482
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:14,683
Rym: I saw one of those that was not ironic at the drive-in when I was a kid.

483
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:15,566
Scott: Oh, yeah.

484
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,905
Scott: Yeah, we had drive-ins You know, it's just that little.

485
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:27,203
Scott: you know Those little cartoon videos that are sort of you know famous the watch in the movie theater and they're telling you to go out to the concessions to get Popcorn right and to make you thirsty for Pepsi or some shit.

486
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:28,930
Rym: This is just one of those you should watch.

487
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,422
Scott: Well, this isn't really one of those sort of a take on one of those right.

488
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:39,739
Scott: that is pretty interesting and very Professionally well made by MK 12.

489
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:40,882
Scott: It's called follow the Sun.

490
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:42,928
Scott: Make sure you watch the whole thing.

491
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,619
Scott: Don't stop You might get bored.

492
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,930
Scott: It's like three or four minutes long.

493
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,586
Scott: I know you have short internet attention spans, but this is one of those ones where it builds.

494
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:50,370
Scott: trust me.

495
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:59,010
Scott: It builds and it's got sort of a catchy tune like Right, so just keep watching it all the way to the end.

496
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:01,869
Scott: I don't know if it's entirely safe for her work.

497
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:05,021
Scott: It is not safe for work, but just watch the whole thing.

498
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:05,783
Scott: Trust me.

499
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:06,486
Scott: This is great.

500
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:07,750
Scott: And it's not really made.

501
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,280
Rym: It's no Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it has a similar.

502
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,182
Rym: you'll see.

503
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:14,248
Rym: it's subtle and then unsubtle.

504
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,994
Scott: Yeah, watch it It's great.

505
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:19,209
Rym: I saw this a while ago and I forgot about it.

506
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,395
Scott: Oh and mix it with ponies.

507
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,263
Scott: cuz ponies go well with everything.

508
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,660
Rym: That'd be a pretty good mix actually Kind of like that to our ring you mix.

509
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:27,450
Rym: so I got something really simple.

510
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,477
Rym: This is just the Batman equation.

511
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:48,710
Rym: for any math nerd who's ever seen the Batman equation, which is holy holy plus something equals Goddamn, but no, that would be a Robin equation kid minus two ex parents plus Joker.

512
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,710
Rym: Anyway, so this is just a fairly large equation that you can grab.

513
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:54,855
Rym: It's a fairly like.

514
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:02,890
Rym: it's relatively simple to understand though I defy anyone who is not insane to look at it and figure out what it graphs.

515
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,190
Rym: Just from looking at it without a lot of well now that they know it's the Batman equation.

516
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,437
Rym: Yeah, it's the Batman equation.

517
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:10,550
Rym: It turns into Batman and it's kind of new.

518
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,450
Scott: So basically you type it into your graphing calculator and the bat logo appears.

519
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,927
Rym: Yeah, this is the kind of thing that you should have on hand to impress the girls at high school calculus class.

520
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,385
Scott: Ah Yeah.

521
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,755
Scott: So metamoment.

522
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:28,879
Scott: well, I mean it's not gonna impress any girls but on the On the off chance that it impresses a girl.

523
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:29,861
Scott: That's the one.

524
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,423
Scott: don't let her go.

525
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:31,766
Rym: I want kids.

526
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:35,327
Rym: the Rainbow Dash equation It's not gonna happen might happen.

527
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:43,050
Rym: So the metamoment metamoment metamucil book club book is is all right the the ear the eye and the arm.

528
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:48,341
Scott: Yeah, yes Rym still hasn't uploaded the book club book episode, but it's already recorded.

529
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:48,642
Scott: Yes.

530
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,510
Rym: It'll be up as soon as I have time been busy.

531
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:54,706
Scott: Yeah, so you might actually hear this before hearing the foundation episode, but we recorded it.

532
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:55,729
Scott: Yes, it was done.

533
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,325
Rym: Other metas we have a fax is coming soon.

534
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,170
Scott: You can't get tickets.

535
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:02,118
Scott: Yep, New York Comic Con is coming after that.

536
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,768
Scott: mag fest is sometime next year after that.

537
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,929
Scott: Yep We'll be at mag fest will be all three of those guaranteed.

538
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:13,007
Rym: We are doing on Saturday at noon in I forget which theater I think is the big one.

539
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:17,362
Rym: We're doing Discover the Forgotten Masters brand new panel.

540
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:21,817
Scott: don't even know what it's gonna be cuz I've written it But it involves an Atari 2600.

541
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:22,499
Rym: Yeah.

542
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,281
Scott: All right.

543
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:25,910
Rym: We have a fancy new Facebook page.

544
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:27,930
Scott: Yeah, you should like us on Facebook.

545
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:41,790
Scott: Right now I'm manually cross posting things to Facebook But I've already coded the site to automatically cross post things to Facebook and as soon as I launch the new updated site of front Recruit comm it will automatically post everything into Facebook.

546
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,277
Scott: So you won't have to come to forever.

547
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:46,010
Scott: I've given up on trying to get people to come to the site at this point.

548
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,557
Rym: It's pretty much the site is basically for at this point one.

549
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:52,890
Rym: I will occasionally post like a link to all the slides from panel.

550
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:53,830
Scott: It's like at this point.

551
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,841

558
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,645
Rym: I'm like just Google GeekNights.

559
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,729
Rym: It's the first thing.

560
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,016
Scott: Let me make sure it is.

00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,102
Scott: let me see if it is.

565
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:30,754
Scott: if you use GeekNights as two words and make a mistake Yep, still number one all right of course But we have.

566
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:36,836
Rym: you know we put up our for one of our PAX lectures from PAX East last year on YouTube in the GeekNights Rym YouTube channel.

567
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:43,283
Rym: I have now uploaded the second of our three panels a Second running of game mechanics and mechanism design.

568
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:43,705
Rym: I thought

569
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:49,073
Scott: it wasn't as good as the first time We did it, but I watched the video today, and it was alright except for me saying right Yeah, we

570
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:53,830
Rym: ran it way better the first time we ran it, but I was kind of tired when we ran it at PAX.

571
00:31:54,331 --> 00:32:00,350
Rym: Yeah, East 2011, but the third panel how to win at games will be up as soon as I have time to edit it together.

572
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:01,970
Scott: Oh, I forgot we even had a third panel.

573
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,886
Rym: Yeah, and keep your eye out because I am rapidly going to add a lot of video content for GeekNights also.

574
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:12,254
Rym: You pig fuckers You know what what.

575
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:18,337
Rym: the first question we got on game mechanics and mechanism design to YouTube was guys Where's radio free equestria?

576
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:19,764
Rym: I mean we made these pilots.

577
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:20,970
Scott: It's not a regular show.

578
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,075
Scott: We made three pilots.

579
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:25,270
Scott: coming Jesus you kids your regular show is for later.

580
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:28,562
Rym: I love my little pony, but Jesus really Jesus.

00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:33,769
Scott: videos hard.

583
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,739
Scott: Any other meta merch anything?

584
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:40,089
Scott: Oh hold off on merch if there's other meta that we forgot.

585
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,534
Scott: worst Worst webcomic.

586
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:43,804
Rym: yes, we have the worst webcomic contest.

587
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:51,641
Scott: when you if you're gonna go to our site Go to the news section find the post about the worst webcomic contest And there's gonna be a link to a form to fill out.

588
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,488
Scott: don't just post in the forum thread.

589
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:56,470
Scott: forum Right your suggestion you actually have to go.

590
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,550
Scott: There's a Google Docs form to fill out your submission for the worst webcomic contest.

591
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:07,430
Scott: That is the only place to officially submit where you can win a prize and be considered along those lines.

592
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,642
Rym: Stop submitting control alt elite.

593
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:14,036
Rym: we already said that yeah, but I Okay, and I got it.

594
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,601
Rym: preface this one last little thing.

595
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:20,268
Rym: you if you submit an entry to this you might think This is a little bit of a mean-spirited contest.

596
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:27,950
Rym: Yep, yep, so you if you don't actually create something are worse than whatever it is that you are submitting whoever created.

597
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,354
Rym: That is better than you as a human.

598
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,239
Scott: so feel bad and shitties.

599
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,721
Scott: better than making a really poorly drawn furry porn Fanfic where you're the otter with in Star Trek.

600
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:44,084
Scott: that guy's better than it's better than someone who makes Nothing unless I mean if Mike and Jerry you know penny arcade.

601
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:46,814
Rym: if they submit a comic yeah Yeah, they get.

602
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:47,897
Rym: they can call something shitty.

603
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:49,222
Scott: They get away with it.

604
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,707
Scott: They can diss whatever they want.

605
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:55,261
Scott: alright, so We already did a show on version control systems.

606
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:55,682
Rym: Yep.

607
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:59,116
Rym: We have not done one on change management But that's more of.

608
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:02,070
Rym: it's almost a more like release management.

609
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:09,978
Scott: Those the same thing yeah anyway, but you know get is one of the few hot new Technologies that I am extremely familiar with.

610
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,460
Rym: Scott.

611
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,850
Rym: I would argue knows more about it than most people at this point.

612
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:21,230
Scott: Well, I think the thing was is just because at my last job You know I was working with a guy who was pretty Linux II and he started using git like slightly before it was cool.

613
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,407
Scott: So I started using it slightly before it was cool.

614
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:26,864
Rym: Yeah Like hey, and I was like what do you mean?

615
00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:27,529
Rym: I use RCS.

616
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:34,183
Scott: I was in the nub stage of git when other people didn't know it existed Except for really hardcore Linux people.

617
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:41,789
Scott: and then when it became popular I had already sort of mastered the user parts and by now I've mastered the underneath parts which most people don't even know about.

618
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,454
Rym: yeah I mean, I'm.

619
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:44,330
Rym: I'm currently a nub at git.

620
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:44,958
Rym: I mean I may.

621
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,969
Rym: I have a GitHub account that I haven't logged into in a while and yeah.

622
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,141
Scott: So the thing with git is that it is a version control system.

623
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:58,124
Scott: Just like subversion or whatever Except it is architecturally different and that it is distributed right.

624
00:34:58,144 --> 00:34:59,630
Scott: there is no canonical.

625
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,810
Scott: This repository is the repository.

626
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:06,602
Scott: Instead every repository is the full repository.

627
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:08,468
Scott: So you have a. you have it on your computer.

628
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,030
Scott: you clone You don't check out you clone.

629
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:14,090
Scott: You have the whole thing the whole history of the project on your computer.

630
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:22,930
Scott: You edit that history and then you share commits with other people in a distributed mesh Fashion and that you know, that way anyone can do as they please.

631
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:27,870
Scott: Alright, and this has many benefits and you know drawbacks, but mostly benefits.

632
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:35,790
Scott: Once you understand it and use it properly You'll see that subversion and other centralized version control systems are just awful.

633
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,099
Scott: There is a come some competitors.

634
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,130
Scott: the chief among them is mercurial which is written entirely in Python.

635
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:44,075
Scott: You know There's all sorts of arguments to be made.

636
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:44,838
Scott: is one better?

637
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:45,680
Scott: is one worse?

638
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:48,570
Scott: the general consensus mercurial is a little easier to use.

639
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:50,722
Scott: Git has slightly better performance.

640
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,190
Scott: They have a lot of feature parity.

641
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:58,863
Scott: It doesn't really matter that much but it seems to get his one, you know GitHub is destroyed bitbucket.

642
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:03,109
Scott: So I Mean bitbucket still exists, but github is definitely winning.

643
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,481
Scott: GitHub is sort of the way of the future.

644
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:14,030
Scott: if you're not using git now You should learn it because if you're doing anything with software, that's where it's at And such alright, so I mean, what's that?

645
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,759
Rym: Like what are the primary benefits for getting the architecture?

646
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,609
Rym: that I doubt many of our listeners will know much about?

647
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,779
Scott: well The primary benefits are distributed.

648
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:24,070
Rym: if you can tell I don't know a lot about git.

649
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:29,996
Scott: Well, do I mean I could start from like the bottom up if you want but I might be a little boring now Maybe maybe later.

650
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,810
Rym: Let's know what you know what the listeners always want.

651
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:40,039
Rym: They're always like well the listener always wants us to go in depth at our own level and to not like Pull back from our level of technological prowess.

652
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,182
Scott: Okay, so here's here's I'll get.

653
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,550
Rym: let's talk about this the way we talk about this stuff.

654
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,693
Scott: Okay, so here's how git works.

655
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,075
Scott: ready.

656
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:45,737
Scott: You have a file.

657
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,037
Rym: Yep.

658
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,127
Scott: You hash the file with sha very strong hash.

659
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:56,770
Scott: You're very unique Right, yeah, so what you do is you take a file you hash it you create a what's called a blob in git terminology.

660
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:04,113
Scott: Right, so that blob contains the contents of the file compressed and whatever right and the name of that blob will be the hash The sha1 hash.

661
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:04,435
Scott: Uh-huh.

662
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,706
Scott: You update the hat you update the file you update the blob.

663
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:08,870
Scott: It's that simple, right?

664
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,262
Scott: So you create a new repository in that file.

665
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:13,929
Scott: in that repository you have some files.

666
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:18,650
Scott: You add them all to what's known as the staging area the index, right?

667
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,026
Scott: So basically this is advantage number one of git is the index.

668
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,935
Scott: most You know things like subversion.

669
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:29,609
Scott: you edit files and you commit and it commits all your changes no matter what files.

670
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:30,371
Scott: they are Right.

671
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:35,690
Scott: So if you what say want to have two files that are edited and you want to commit one file and not the other.

672
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:40,430
Scott: You have to actually roll one of the files back commit and then roll the file forward, right?

673
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,253
Scott: It's sort of annoying.

674
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:50,190
Scott: in git you actually add your changes to the staging area The index and then when you commit the index is what is committed.

675
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:56,510
Scott: Right, so you can actually if you do an interactive add you can actually add part of a file.

676
00:37:56,913 --> 00:38:05,193
Scott: So if I edit a file and I change two functions I can actually add one of those changes to the one of the functions to be committed and let the other one just stay as A dirty chain.

677
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:06,618
Scott: Oh, it's pretty crazy.

678
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,550
Scott: So you stage and then you commit, right?

679
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,090
Scott: So that's that's the first advantage of git just from the user perspective, right?

680
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,324
Scott: So anyway under the hood, right?

681
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:17,330
Scott: It's making blobs.

682
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,526
Scott: so everything is uniquely hashed which means that whatever you put into git is what you're gonna get out.

683
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:27,872
Scott: a lot of other version control Systems don't actually guarantee that what you put in is what you get out With git.

684
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:31,650
Scott: whatever you put in guaranteed to get out because if the hash don't match ain't gonna fly.

685
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:37,010
Scott: So a commit in git is what's known as a tree.

686
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:44,070
Scott: It's a tree and that tree is a list and the list is a list of trees and blobs.

687
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:45,399
Scott: That's all it is.

688
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:46,470
Scott: It's trees and blobs.

689
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:51,104
Scott: So a tree would might you know would be the top level of your repository which would be your commit Yeah.

690
00:38:51,531 --> 00:39:02,010
Scott: and then underneath that would be trees which would be the sub directories and in those sub directories would be blobs and When you commit it just creates a new tree with the new blobs and the new trees in it.

691
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:08,722
Rym: So when I've pulled out like I've brought down the repository or whatever I basically got the entire like everything in the project just local.

692
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:12,656
Scott: you have the entire history of Every commit that has ever been.

693
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:16,670
Rym: so I could step back through to like the hello world of the project.

694
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,119
Scott: You absolutely could all right, you wouldn't even have to step.

695
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,183
Scott: you just reset to it.

696
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,750
Rym: Does this I mean?

697
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:25,641
Rym: Does this cause disk space issues ever for people?

698
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:29,171
Scott: I mean it is highly compressed and incredibly efficient I guess.

699
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:34,790
Rym: does anyone use git for the management of things that aren't code like large images or video or anything?

700
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,330
Scott: Oh, it's actually incredibly efficient at doing those things.

701
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:42,948
Scott: You are you are going to obviously have to use a lot of disk space Yeah, but if I'm doing like video I have to use like anyway.

702
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,402
Scott: It is better at that than the other version control systems.

703
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:49,236
Scott: Well, I found it will not crash under the weight It was originally.

704
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:50,870
Scott: git was originally gonna be a file system.

705
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,577
Scott: So, you know if you have?

706
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:57,356
Scott: I did not know that if you have 10 1 gig video files sure It's gonna be a 10 gig download.

707
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,602
Scott: But yeah, but that's expected.

708
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,390
Rym: It's gonna be 10 gigs if I use the version.

709
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,808
Scott: Yeah, but switching between versions is like basically instantaneous once you've downloaded it.

710
00:40:04,828 --> 00:40:05,270
Scott: You're all set.

711
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:13,624
Rym: The performance of git is is off the chart considering that local disk space is Effectively infinite in the modern world.

712
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,590
Scott: I mean, yeah Git is actually really useful for things other than code just because it's so good.

713
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:28,706
Scott: like if you go to github all the wiki's on github are actually powered by git and I've actually I've actually figured out a way to do wiki show notes on our site powered by git.

714
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:29,830
Rym: Ooh, we kind of need that.

715
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,923
Scott: It's pretty crazy when you once you see how it works.

716
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,167
Scott: It's it's intense All right, so where was I?

717
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,528
Scott: You're oh, yeah can get be used for.

718
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,118
Scott: yeah You can use git for anything you want.

719
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:40,561
Scott: a version.

720
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,170
Scott: writing a book gets a great idea.

721
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:48,169
Scott: Anything that you need to basically have another level of undoing and versions on git is a great way to go.

722
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:54,390
Scott: So you make these commits and every commit is a tree and every commit has a hash of its own, right?

723
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,136
Scott: So that's an easy way to identify.

724
00:40:56,156 --> 00:41:02,770
Scott: a commit is by its hash and a commit also has one other thing Which is a pointer to the previous commit in the history.

725
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:10,649
Scott: So commit number one points at nothing but commit number two points at commit number one and every commit is a full tree full of trees and blobs.

726
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:18,290
Scott: So the main thing here that this allows you to do that other version control systems don't allow you to do is easy branching.

727
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,920
Scott: Right in subversion making a branch is a big deal.

728
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,410
Scott: You've got one shared repository if you make a branch.

729
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:29,250
Scott: That's a branch for everyone not just you right and it's a big deal to make a branch and then to merge your branch.

730
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:30,777
Scott: Forget it kill yourself.

731
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,043
Rym: I've never done it.

732
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:37,310
Scott: I've given up People who have mastered it and can get it done with a minimum of pain.

733
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:41,870
Scott: But if you do get properly you can always avoid the pain, right?

734
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:45,444
Scott: So you can just branch like a nut job, right?

735
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:50,830
Scott: You just be like, oh, yeah I'll make a branch over here to branch over there and what I tend to do which is a good best practice.

736
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,759
Scott: That's that's another thing people can get confused about.

737
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:54,000
Scott: git.

738
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,530
Scott: is that other version control systems because they're so limited?

739
00:41:56,952 --> 00:42:03,229
Scott: There's only one workflow you can follow if you want to use them but git lets you do anything Which means it's like what workflow do I have?

740
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,630
Scott: You have to make up a workflow and you have to enforce that workflow with just people and talking to each other.

741
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:10,839
Rym: I imagine that's very difficult for many people.

742
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:17,090
Scott: There's no technological enforcement of the workflow But there are certain practices that will sort of grease the wheels.

743
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:30,010
Scott: So it's like you have to simultaneously know the path to follow to grease the wheels to make to have less conflicts and merge problems While simultaneously getting people to behave in a certain way so that you know, everything runs smoothly.

744
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:30,251
Scott: it

745
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:51,510
Rym: is however, I think in the long run a more fruitful path than say like ticketing systems are an example of this where you need to enforce certain workflows and The only way people ever do it is to make rules like a ticket cannot be set to a resolved state unless X Y and Z Have already happened to the ticket Unless it actually hasn't assignee because you can and the thing is once you go down that path.

746
00:42:51,952 --> 00:43:00,349
Rym: You can't trust people for shit because if there is any way to do the thing You don't want them to do they will do it and in their mind, it's okay because they'll let them do it.

747
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:09,504
Rym: Mm-hmm It's like the difference between a ride with a car where you're on a rails no matter how what way you turn the car goes That the straight way anyway versus an f1 car.

748
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,770
Rym: if you turn off the track you just die.

749
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:11,834
Scott: Well, that's the.

750
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:14,804
Scott: that's the thing because git is distributed right subversion.

751
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:26,530
Scott: a commit in subversion Actually pushes your code to the central repository if there's a bunch of people working on the project together Which means one person can just commit and fuck the whole thing up in git.

752
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:33,690
Scott: Everyone's working locally with their own copy of the repository and they're only sharing when they explicitly share.

753
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:36,887
Scott: So committing making checkpoints It's free, you know.

754
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:43,190
Scott: to Reset and roll forward and back for your code is completely independent of sharing code.

755
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:48,170
Scott: So you can make checkpoints to make your life easier locally without sharing those checkpoints with anyone.

756
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:52,610
Scott: So that would greatly reduces any chance of fucking things up right right up the get-go.

757
00:43:52,714 --> 00:44:02,670
Rym: Yeah I mean I can't imagine but like the subversion I used to use at another company like pulling the repository down to my laptop Working on stuff for a week like on a trip or something coming back to work and kind of put that back in.

758
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,560
Scott: Well, that's another thing.

759
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:04,390
Scott: right subversion.

760
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:10,263
Scott: You only get the most current version of the code when you check out Which you can't work if you're not online if you're not connected.

761
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:11,550
Scott: get you have the whole thing.

762
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,547
Scott: You can work completely offline, you know, it doesn't matter where you are open.

763
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:17,783
Rym: as a version I could pull down what I'm working on and lock it for everyone else.

764
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:19,210
Scott: You could do that.

765
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,796
Scott: There's no locking and get right.

766
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:24,150
Scott: So so when you do want to share something, right?

767
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,750
Scott: There's a whole bunch of different ways to do it.

768
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,637
Scott: You could share by email if you freaking want to.

769
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:30,790
Scott: you could give someone a gz file on a stick if you want to.

770
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:31,668
Scott: Right, you can do whatever.

771
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,840
Scott: But generally people tend to do things in two ways.

772
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:41,593
Scott: You could set up a Just a communally agreed upon central repository and push to it Right.

773
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:45,570
Scott: So push should be a separate command and you would just send your commits to that.

774
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:53,267
Scott: you know repository on whatever branch you wanted to send them on to and then other people would pull them and You would all be disciplined and no one would mess it up.

775
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:57,690
Scott: That's what we do at work, but it breaks down when you have too many people, right?

776
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:09,407
Scott: So when you have too many people like you do say on Linux What you do is you do a pull request Which is you email someone or call them on the phone or say hi and you talk to them and you say that's

777
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:11,936
Rym: quite a difficult Protocol for many developers.

778
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:19,350
Scott: I know and you say look my repository is over in this place And I have some commits on it that I would like to submit for your consideration.

779
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,600
Scott: Please pull from my repository.

780
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,366
Scott: All right, and this is how github works.

781
00:45:24,426 --> 00:45:25,530
Scott: is github has pull requests.

782
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:33,550
Scott: So if you go on github you clone someone's project you do some work on it you finish it You push your code back to github from your local, right?

783
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,030
Scott: So you push it from your local to your github.

784
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:41,690
Scott: Then you do a pull request telling the other guy to pull your github into his github.

785
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,292
Scott: You see how it's like.

786
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:44,038
Scott: everyone has all these different copies of it.

787
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,250
Scott: Yeah, so he gets a pull request notification on github.

788
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,930
Scott: He takes your code from your github to his local machine.

789
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:55,229
Scott: Hopefully check, you know puts it on a separate branch where it won't mess anything up.

790
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,760
Scott: Checks your code out sees how good it is.

791
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,250
Scott: sees if it's working merges it in with his code.

792
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:01,129
Scott: See is how that works.

793
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:06,481
Scott: If he likes your code, then he'll merge it in and push it to his repository There by accepting your pull request.

794
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:10,850
Scott: if he doesn't like your code He'll just throw that branch away and give you the finger and ignore you.

795
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:13,163
Scott: All right And but the thing is your code isn't lost.

796
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,294
Scott: you still have it Right, if you don't like?

797
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:19,390
Scott: if you like your thing a different way than he likes it then you maintain your own branch.

798
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:20,357
Scott: Good for you.

799
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:21,445
Scott: You forked it.

800
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:22,050
Scott: Congratulations.

801
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:22,953
Rym: so how well like.

802
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:32,810
Rym: how does it handle merging like if two people have edit like you're trying to merge two branches where the Fundamental difference is like one section of code is just like two people implemented it way different.

803
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:37,987
Scott: Okay, so get merges are pretty complex here, but they're also the most powerful and the best right?

804
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:38,710
Scott: So here's how it works.

805
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:43,047
Scott: Remember I told you a commit is just a tree that has trees and blobs under it.

806
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:43,710
Scott: Yeah, right.

807
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:47,750
Scott: So I want to merge two branches together, right?

808
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:55,110
Scott: So I take these two branches and all it looks at really is The top commits because a branch is just a pointer to a commit.

809
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:55,893
Scott: That's all it is.

810
00:46:56,455 --> 00:47:02,767
Scott: and it just so happens that if you are on a branch and you commit it Automatically moves the branch pointer ahead to the new commit.

811
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:03,229
Scott: That's all it does.

812
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:07,064
Scott: So a branch is just a pointer an easy way to specify a commit.

813
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,730
Scott: So I might say master.

814
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,717
Scott: Well master is currently pointing at this commit.

815
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:14,069
Scott: So master is just an easy way of saying that commit.

816
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:18,849
Scott: All right Head is just an easy way of saying the commit I'm currently looking at.

817
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:22,001
Scott: So head is just a pointer that looks at the commit you're currently looking at.

818
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:27,150
Scott: and if you make a new commit head and the Rancher on get both get moved forward to point at the nuke, right?

819
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:27,592
Scott: They're all.

820
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:29,910
Scott: just point me all these names are just pointers to commits.

821
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:42,230
Scott: So if I merge let's say I have a production branch and I go to the production branch and I say get merge master Right, which would take the commit of the master branch and merge it with the production branch, right in right?

822
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:48,410
Scott: What happens is it takes the top it takes production which remember is just a commit.

823
00:47:48,590 --> 00:48:00,952
Scott: yeah, it takes a master which again is just a commit and Then it looks at their histories and it rolls back to find the common ancestor and it doesn't care about any of the commits in between.

824
00:48:01,032 --> 00:48:04,900
Scott: all it cares about is the two commits you're merging and the common ancestor.

825
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,980
Scott: So then it looks at each blob in both commits.

826
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:15,246
Scott: So let's say that all that's in there is a readme text and some other Five readme text.

827
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:20,664
Scott: Yeah, so it looks at the first readme text and it says alright this readme text I'm production branch.

828
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:26,100
Scott: Was there any difference between this this readme text between production and the common ancestor?

829
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,683
Scott: No, okay.

830
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:33,198
Scott: Well, is there any difference between this readme text on between master and the common ancestor?

831
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,164
Scott: Well, yes Yes, there was a change.

832
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:37,572
Scott: So in the master branch this file changed.

833
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,880
Scott: Yep, but in the production branch did not change.

834
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:44,454
Scott: Nope, we're we're just gonna take that master change aren't we that easy merge?

835
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:45,738
Scott: just do take the master done.

836
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:46,480
Scott: Um easy.

837
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:48,876
Rym: So what if the two readmes diverged?

838
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,020
Scott: ah So both in the case where both readme files have changed there were edits on production and there were edits on master.

839
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,348
Scott: Well, were they the same edits?

840
00:48:58,629 --> 00:48:59,532
Scott: exactly the same?

841
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:01,840
Scott: because then that case we're just right.

842
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,592
Rym: Yeah, I'm assuming no bro, because that's the more interesting case.

843
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,340
Scott: So no, they're not the same.

844
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,840
Scott: There were some edits on the production branch and there's some edits on the master branch that were different.

845
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,610
Scott: Well, are these edits like on the same line?

846
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:15,580
Scott: You know, it has actually a bunch of different merge algorithms.

847
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,996
Scott: It uses that.

848
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:17,616
Scott: it tried All right.

849
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:25,797
Scott: So let's say one one of the things added a commit at the top of the file and one of the things added a comment At the bottom of the file, it'll just merge them together.

850
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:27,037
Scott: No problem Uh-huh, right.

851
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:31,051
Scott: But let's say two people edited the same function.

852
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:34,260
Scott: the same line of code is two different lines.

853
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:40,969
Scott: Right since the common ancestor, it'll say Dude conflict yo and you.

854
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:53,477
Scott: what you'll have to do is you have to open up the file and you look through the file And you see a bunch of chevrons and it'll basically say hey, dude Look this line on the production branch looks like this and on the master branch looks like this Manually edit me.

855
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,670
Scott: So you manually edit that one area of the file.

856
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,400
Scott: remove all the chevrons and all the extra crap it threw in there.

857
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:13,040
Scott: Right get the file just the way you want it to look post merge Add it to the staging to the index the staging index and commit and then it'll be merged nice And of course it keeps the versions of everything along the way because it's good.

858
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:19,675
Scott: Yeah, of course Alright, so, you know There's no way you could possibly lose anything unless you intentionally try to lose something.

859
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:30,826
Scott: and even if you do lose something Like you accidentally like remove something You could actually check the git ref log and bring it back because unless the garbage cleaner has come along It won't actually be gone.

860
00:50:31,548 --> 00:50:34,578
Scott: Which is really the git ref log has saved my ass quite a few times.

861
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:39,098
Scott: Let me tell you So yeah merge is pretty fancy like that.

862
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,894
Scott: But the other thing about git that's incredibly powerful is the rebase.

863
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,346
Scott: a lot of people if you look online They'll be like don't use rebase.

864
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:48,531
Scott: That's a naughty thing to do.

865
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:49,575
Scott: They're totally wrong.

866
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:50,800
Scott: They don't know what they're talking about.

867
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,067
Scott: There's a reason the tools in there They wouldn't have made it if you weren't supposed to use it.

868
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:57,340
Scott: Linus Torvalds wouldn't have made rebase if you weren't supposed to use rebase.

869
00:50:57,962 --> 00:50:58,203
Scott: All right.

870
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:02,240
Scott: So what rebase does is it basically rewrites history it rebases.

871
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,080
Scott: So say for example, I start working on a new feature.

872
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:09,000
Scott: I'm gonna add to the website the ability to post on Facebook.

873
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:12,318
Scott: So I make a branch called the Facebook branch and I start working on it.

874
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:19,520
Scott: Meanwhile you add the ability to post to Twitter right and you finish and now you put it on the master branch.

875
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:27,399
Scott: So I forked the master branch and to add my Facebook feature, but your Twitter feature is now on the master branch But it's not in my Facebook branch.

876
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:34,280
Scott: But it needs to be alright because I need to build my stuff taking your stuff into consideration because you finish your work first.

877
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:40,734
Scott: Therefore I have to get my work to work on top of your work Right, and I don't want to just try to merge the two together when I'm all done.

878
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:42,220
Scott: that could be painful.

879
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:44,339
Scott: It might work, but it could be painful.

880
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:49,234
Scott: So what I do is I rebase my branch onto the master branch.

881
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:56,139
Scott: What that does is it takes all my commits on My Facebook branch and sort of puts them in a bin on the side.

882
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:02,540
Scott: Okay, so now my right and then it takes your commits and it puts them right there, right?

883
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:04,207
Scott: Where my Facebook commits just were.

884
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,020
Scott: so now my branch and master look the same.

885
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:13,480
Scott: Then it takes my Facebook commits and it puts them right on top of your Twitter commits on my Facebook branch.

886
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:15,466
Scott: So now I've rebased.

887
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:17,010
Scott: you see how I picked my stuff up.

888
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:20,220
Scott: I made a new base for my stuff, right?

889
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,846
Scott: Do you understand you get what I'm saying?

890
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:28,031
Scott: Yeah, all right now this also has other Fancy powers and this is where the magic comes in.

891
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:29,840
Scott: the magics the magics.

892
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:33,114
Scott: I'm working on an open-source project say I'm making a Linux kernel driver.

893
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:34,459
Scott: It's hard work.

894
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:38,340
Scott: So I make a lot of commits locally a lot of checkpoint commits, you know.

895
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,840
Scott: And a lot of these commits are just like fix the typo out of the line testing this out.

896
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,608
Scott: Oh that didn't work.

897
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:44,679
Scott: revert it, you know.

898
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:55,840
Scott: And I just keep making tons and tons of commits all locally and eventually after ten days and a hundred commits I finished the driver, right now the Linux kernel doesn't want to see a hundred commits.

899
00:52:56,562 --> 00:53:03,640
Scott: Right, I can't be like hey Linus pull request hundred little commits with typos and all this nonsense for this one driver.

900
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,488
Scott: He'll be like screw you.

901
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:08,540
Scott: I don't want your hundred commits cluttering up the history of Linux kernel.

902
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,102
Scott: It's you're.

903
00:53:09,382 --> 00:53:13,594
Scott: you're basically, you know, as far as you're personally concerned those hundred commits have meaning.

904
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:20,863
Scott: but as far as it's basically one version like 1.0 as far as line, you know Linux the kernel is concerned It's one commit.

905
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:26,807
Scott: that commit should have a message like added new driver for lousy webcam That only Scott has right?

906
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,479
Scott: That's all he wants one commit with that whole change in it.

907
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:31,500
Scott: So what you do is you rebase?

908
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:40,488
Scott: Against yourself you rebase the branch against itself and you do an interactive rebase Which is allows you to manually control the rebase.

909
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:56,511
Scott: and what you would do is you would actually squash the commits with this rebase Into just one commit that you would then share So that you it allows you to rewrite the whole history of what you just did on that branch Uh-huh, and then merge just that one really pretty commit back in.

910
00:53:57,052 --> 00:54:01,874
Scott: so you can make a whole bunch of messy commits all on your Own that make it really easy to do your work.

911
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:07,308
Scott: because you have all these checkpoints You can roll them back and forward take them in and out You can try to a function other people.

912
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:11,808
Scott: you can decide you don't like it take it out or place it with something else You know and you can have this whole.

913
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:28,204
Scott: your whole workflow history is there You know to make it really easy to get the job done and try all sorts of stuff out Branches and all sorts of merging and nonsense, but when you're finally said and done You can rebase everything into one cozy commit that can then be shared With other people.

914
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:32,360
Scott: that is clean and beautiful and no one will see all that mess you made when you were working locally.

915
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,274
Scott: But you do and you still have that history.

916
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:35,000
Scott: It doesn't go anywhere.

917
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:39,252
Scott: It's hidden inside so you can always go back to it if you need to.

918
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:41,680
Scott: you know, oh adding that one line was a mistake.

919
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,886
Scott: I'll just go and find that.

920
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:47,287
Scott: you know commit that got rebased in revert it and Read, you know make a new man.

921
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:48,954
Rym: that makes a lot of sense in light of like.

922
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:50,039
Rym: go back to my video example.

923
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,166
Rym: say I Wanted to use that for like video collaboration.

924
00:54:52,547 --> 00:55:00,554
Rym: Well, I have a thousand one gigabyte commits of this video and The project manager doesn't want a thousand gigabytes of crap.

925
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,020
Rym: They want the final one.

926
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,808
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure how exact.

927
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:06,640
Scott: I haven't done a lot with binary files so much and get at least not big.

928
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,300
Scott: I don't know either.

929
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,777
Scott: So I'm not sure if it only stores the diffs of the binary files or if it actually stores the whole files.

930
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:14,723
Rym: that diffs of Binary files are often.

931
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:24,575
Scott: but the thing is even though even though it will be expect exceptionally good At performance of saving space and being very fast at executing commands.

932
00:55:25,136 --> 00:55:26,100
Scott: Don't fool yourself.

933
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:30,620
Scott: You know with subversion when you check something out you are only checking out the newest version.

934
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,366
Scott: So it's a pretty quick download.

935
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:41,016
Scott: if you try to clone the Linux kernel and get the complete history from git It takes a long time to download because even though it's mostly just code.

936
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:45,128
Scott: In fact, it's almost all code There's a lot of it and the history is long.

937
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,740
Scott: It takes a long time to download that it's a big package.

938
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:51,251
Scott: Don't fool yourself.

939
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:51,615
Scott: Mm-hmm.

940
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:59,198
Scott: So if you if you consider download time to be incredibly important, you know that that is a negative.

941
00:55:59,599 --> 00:55:59,940
Scott: it's there.

942
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:01,542
Scott: There.

943
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:02,987
Scott: there are tons and tons of fancy things.

944
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:07,188
Scott: I can go on for like hours talking like git bisect and which like you would Git bisect.

945
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:12,180
Scott: I won't tell you how it works But what it does is you tell it lets you have a bug and you don't know when the bug appeared.

946
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:19,580
Scott: You tell it the last known good commit and it will roll forward one commit at a time asking you is this commit good?

947
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:20,179
Scott: Yes, no.

948
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:22,327
Rym: So I could run that through a regression tester.

949
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:26,240
Rym: that regression tests every commit until it hits the one that fails the test.

950
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:30,140
Scott: And I know you know that that's you know, which commit introduced the problem.

951
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:35,160
Scott: And yeah, you can run it through an automatic testing system that will automatically mark the commits as good or bad.

952
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,449
Scott: So it'll automatically just play good.

953
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,294
Scott: This is the bad commit.

954
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:39,359
Scott: This is where the problem came from.

955
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,479
Scott: It can do all sorts of crazy shit.

956
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,342
Scott: There's like hooks.

957
00:56:44,704 --> 00:56:46,971
Scott: so you'd be like here's a here's a shell script.

958
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,920
Scott: whenever anyone commits automatically execute the shell script.

959
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:52,547
Scott: Whenever anyone pushes execute the shell script.

960
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:57,440
Scott: so you can have like your git repository email everyone when there's a new commit or stuff like that.

961
00:56:58,065 --> 00:56:59,700
Scott: You can do tagging of releases.

962
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:03,632
Scott: You can do bringing tons and tons of ridiculous shit.

963
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,181
Scott: that most you can do get blame is really good It.

964
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,539
Scott: no it knows who edited every single line and every single file.

965
00:57:10,202 --> 00:57:11,246
Scott: So you do a git blame.

966
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:16,553
Scott: when you see a bug and see who exactly introduced that bug cuz their name is right there on The line, you know who did it?

967
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,452
Scott: Mm-hmm I know it's just.

968
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:20,240
Scott: it's crazy shit.

969
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:31,136
Scott: but if you are You know if you've never used version control or even if you have been using it or if you're coding anything Even the simplest little project personal thing just for yourself.

970
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,240
Scott: That might be one file.

971
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:38,720
Scott: It's worth the distort and git even if you're not coding if you're doing anything where versioning might be a good idea, right?

972
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:41,537
Scott: I mean, I know that like doesn't Microsoft Word do versioning in itself?

973
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:46,499
Rym: now Yeah, and a lot of people use like web dev and stuff to do that sort of good God.

974
00:57:47,035 --> 00:58:01,459
Scott: Yeah you want to use if you're doing any work that needs to be versioned where you want to be able to roll back to old Versions rolled in new versions if you're working collaboratively on something with anyone that is in that is files especially text files.

975
00:58:02,302 --> 00:58:04,499
Scott: You want to use git and you want to learn it?

976
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,096
Scott: Even if you start out using it just really simply don't bother with the fancy stuff like rebase and whatever.

977
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:17,000
Scott: just do commits on one Branch push and pull between two people what you know, just use github in the simplest way possible.

978
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:18,545
Scott: That's okay.

979
00:58:18,605 --> 00:58:29,353
Scott: You're doing something and even though you don't know the advanced features You might need them and when you do come to need them You can look them up how to use them to save your ass Or you can get someone to help you save your ass.

980
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:37,129
Scott: if you're using something else Saving your ass might not be a possibility and you know, that's the thing with git is like, you know It's the whole hog of Neil Stevenson, right?

981
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:39,800
Scott: It's this incredibly powerful drill that you could just fucking kill yourself.

982
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,520
Scott: It's so powerful, but it can always get the job done.

983
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,443
Scott: So you could.

984
00:58:44,306 --> 00:58:48,060
Scott: it can shoot yourself in the foot, but it can also unshoot yourself in the foot.

985
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:50,935
Rym: And of course with the whole hog, you can't undrill a hole.

986
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:56,200
Scott: That's true But get you it's very hard to get to ruin it completely.

987
00:58:56,421 --> 00:59:05,487
Scott: It might be also really hard to get it back to goodness, but it's possible almost always possible to fix Anything and it's all.

988
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:09,358
Scott: it's definitely possible that no matter what problem you're in you can escape.

989
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,572
Rym: so kids Just remember it's trees and blobs all the way down.

990
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,957
Scott: It is trees and blobs all the way down.

991
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:24,870
Rym: pretty much This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

992
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,710
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

993
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:35,010
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

994
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:42,689
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

995
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,226
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

996
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:50,581
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

997
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,226
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

998
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:53,650
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
